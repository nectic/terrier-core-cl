'GOOD EVENING MR. AND MRS. AMERICA AND ALL THE SHIPS AT SEA'; WALTER WINCHELL'S 
NIGHTLY GREETING WAS THE SIGNATURE OF GOSSIP'S GOLDEN AGE, BUT THE WORLD MOVED 
ON AND WINCHELL DIDN'T.; WINCHELL: GOSSIP, POWER AND THE CULTURE OF CELEBRITY,

By Murray Kempton, Murray Kempton is a longtime New York columnist. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every sorcerer must have his apprenticeship; and Henry Allen, the Washington 
Post's weaver of spells, served his as a trainee at the New York Daily News at 
the end of the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 The post-war suburban drift of the Irish and Italians had changed New York and 
consigned the News to stay where it was and refuse to adjust to the change. The 
congregants who had once crowded its pews had begun to fall away as from a 
dying church; and, since the acolyte's nostrils are fresher than the 
initiate's, Allen could feelingly suffer the air to whose stagnations its 
journeymen had been awhile since benumbed. 
</P>
<P>
 As Allen recalls in his recent book, "Going Too Far Enough" (Smithsonian): "I 
felt as if I were walking through the Museum of Natural History, looking at 
dioramas, the Plains Indians in their tepees, that sort of thing, a gone 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 And yet the Plains Indian is still with us, however most conspicuously visible 
at work with the croupier's rake. So too is the Daily News; and, if we are to 
think of both as historical relics, where can we place the Walter Winchell that 
Neil Gabler has so admirably toiled to resurrect? 
</P>
<P>
 Not with the dioramas at the Museum of Natural History, I'm afraid, but 
upstairs with the stego- and bronto-sauri who press us to ask, "Can these bones 
have lived?" Winchell seems to have slipped under the primeval ooze almost as 
long ago as they did and to have become a livelier subject for the 
paleontologist's curiosity than the historian's. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet he was a very great man in his time, which was in the 1920s, when he 
was obscure and earning the appreciative attention of refined appetites. In the 
'30s, when he was famous, he catered to the taste of coarser appetites and was 
well on his way toward the demoralizing self-importance that would transform 
him into a common scold in the '40s and reduce him to more shade than presence 
by the end of the '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 When in 19299 he had scarcely shifted his column of Broadway gossip from the 
exiguously disreputable New York Graphic to the better-filled and somewhat 
better-reputed theater of the New York Mirror, Heywood Broun was already 
persuaded of a future "when (Winchell's) life and works are studied in freshman 
English classes a hundred years hence." 
</P>
<P>
 H. L. Mencken registered high respect for his "multitudinous bright 
inventions" in The American Language and complimented him as "no mean student 
of new phrases" while finding his etymologies occasionally suspect. Mencken 
assigns Winchell credit for coinages such as pfft (formarital rifts), welded 
(for marital conjunctions), blessed event (for the newly born), making whoopee 
(for courtships), curdled (for post-courtship disillusionment) and phewed (for 
feud). 
</P>
<P>
 Most of these flowers have faded in obedience to a habit general among 
neologisms, but they echo with unexpected force even now and were once resonant 
enough to inspire movie titles like "Pfft" and "Blessed Event." 
</P>
<P>
 Poor Winchell's simultaneous dotings over by arbiters of good taste and 
slaverings over by exemplars of bad taste may fairly pardon his having gotten 
so swollen with himself as to think Broadway too small for his enlarged bulk 
and, as Mencken regretted, "put off the jester's motley and put on the 
evangelist's shroud" to reach out to embrace the cosmos. 
</P>
<P>
 By then he had a wider syndication than any other newspaper columnist and a 
larger radio audience than any other commentator, or for that matter, any other 
entertainer. His effectiveness as a preacher of the New Deal's gospel was 
second only to Franklin D. Roosevelt's; and he was occasionally invited to the 
White House for conversations that lasted longer than either party had 
anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 The Second World War was his apotheosis as the President's bugle boy, flogger 
of the laggard, spur to the languid, and flailer of imaginary fascists. His 
frenzies were as warming to liberals in the '40s as they would be to Joe 
McCarthy when Winchell began flailing at imaginary Communists in the '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 Winchell's comet had sputtered downward from the apex of its afternoons with 
Presidents to my own modest level by 1954, when the two of us found ourselves 
sitting across from one another at the Army-McCarthy hearings on "Un-American 
Activities." He turned out to be a surprisingly agreeable comrade, ever anxious 
to please and generous about bringing back secrets garnered from his intimate 
access to the McCarthy camp and doling them out in snippets that tended to be 
stale when authentic and spurious when fresh. 
</P>
<P>
 His grandest trophy from these inside tradings was a report on Communist 
infiltration of the Fort Monmouth signal corps laboratories prepared by an Army 
Colonel and bearing the "Top Secret" admonition that rank entitles its 
possessor to stamp on his coffee-and-danish orders to the commissary. Then as 
ever afterward, Winchell sought to make a mystery of this document's 
provenance, which lay indubitably with McCarthy Counsel Roy Cohn; and he passed 
it across to me with a portentous whisper that I should read it surreptitiously 
and use a washroom stall if I were minded to take notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Duly cautioned, I lowered this prize to my lap, read it just far enough along 
to remember reading it earlier and whispered back, "Mr. Winchell, I think this 
has been printed before." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's all right," he replied, "I'll make it public." 
</P>
<P>
 There in his twilight, he could still speak with all the assumptions of the 
high noon of those days when the many were dazzled to learn from Walter 
Winchell whatever it was, true or false, that only the few already knew. The 
shadows of the night had crept ever farther upon him when we next met at the 
1956 Republican convention in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 He was even matier for being even more desperate than ever and invited me to 
join him in an evening's pilgrimage to the Hearst estate at San Simeon. Visions 
of communion with the ghosts where Bernard Shaw had been introduced to Marion 
Davis were enormously tempting; but duty had conscripted me to the Republicans 
instead and I had to decline. Later that day, another Hearstling conveyed a 
corporate invitation to San Simeon; and I regretted once more with an 
explanation that I had already told Winchell that I was bound to the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Winchell asked you?" the Hearstling replied. "I hadn't thought we'd asked him 
." 
</P>
<P>
 We were together for the last time on an Eisenhower plane trip that fall; and 
when we got back to Washington and the White House closed us down, Winchell 
suggested we all go to Duke Zeibert's. There were no takers until the heartache 
of his loneliness grew unbearable enough to bring me forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Our entrance upon Zeibert's was so all else but triumphant that its proprietor 
did not even come to greet us. We sat awhile among the lowly; and the service, 
although prompt, arrived with such scant ceremony that Winchell soon grew 
oppressively aware of himself as object of inattention and suggested that he 
and I go our separate ways to sleep. The check came and I paid it, an act 
identified in our trade as the signal that one party still has an expense 
account and the other doesn't any longer. The owners of property and the 
proprietors of saloons are infrequently the last to recognize when the orange 
is squeezed and the rind to be thrown away. 
</P>
<P>
 And why had it come to this and would come to worse? Gabler's chronicle of 
Winchell's decline is lively and balanced enough to persuade us that punishment 
was deserved and that so too was pity. But he lacks -- as who among us doesn't 
these days? -- the Winchell gift for pith. The best of paleontologists cannot 
hope to explain the dinosaur's extinction as succinctly as the dinosaur could 
have. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, when he was railing against his daughter's propensity for the beds of 
the bad and dangerous, Winchell paused, Gabler tells us, and reflectively and 
forgivingly observed: 
</P>
<P>
 "What can you expect? Her father is a whore too." 
</P>
<P>
 It was never easy to separate the arrogance from the self-distaste in 
Winchell's nature; and we would go too far if we defined the gossip column as 
whore's work even in the crude early stages of its development in his hands. 
</P>
<P>
 His column nonetheless had some of the atmosphere of a house of ill repute. 
Press agents bought their favors there with the coin of scandals about the 
clients of other press agents; and the whore-master bullied the customers with 
the overweening assurance that he owned the best if not the only house in town. 
Customers in good standing took care to bend the knee and those in bad were 
exiled and might be worked over for offending the decency affirmed in the 
pieties and sentimentalities that were as standard appurtenances to his 
column's decor as the lavender pillows in a cathouse salon. 
</P>
<P>
 Gabler shrewdly traces the withering of Winchell's authority to the loss of 
shame that inclined too many sinners to sell their own scandals instead of 
letting them seep to him for free. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1957, he took due note of this great loss when he wrote about the demise of 
the smut-and-scandal-mongering Confidential, which had been a cherished 
shooting partner in the infinity of his personal feuds: 
</P>
<P>
 "Nearly every high class magazine now offers lowdown articles by well-known 
people, who supply their own skeleton-rattling. In short, they now sell the 
stuff they once threatened to sue about." 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether Walter knew it or not," Gabler comments, "(that) was the epitaph of 
his own gossip column." 
</P>
<P>
 The gossip column endures now and even proliferates by no means less 
engagingly but altogether more respectably. The peeping Tom has lost his 
function in a society whose gaudier personages, far from pulling down the 
shades, have taken to selling tickets to view the trespasses inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowadays the gossip columnist triumphs with his scoop not by nosing out Marlon 
Brando's dirty secrets but by getting first look at the memoir where Marlon 
Brando has dirtied them up to an unseemliness perhaps as fanciful as Winchell's 
originally fructifying illusions about the bad and the beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
 Winchell lingered on as one of the great hosts of those forgotten but not gone 
until he died in 1971. Gabler reports gossip that a fortune vaster than any 
other journalist's two decades before had been considerably shrunken by "failed 
investments late in life." It would have been like him to go on believing his 
dubious stock tips disablingly too well after everyone else had ceased to stop 
an ear to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, well. There had, as Yeats once said in another connection, been some 
excuse for him and none at all for those who had pretended to like him. Where 
does the degradation reside in a life like this: in being fawned over by Roy 
Cohn in the 1950s or being snubbed by him in the '60s ? 
</P>
<P>
 Gabler is not to be envied the labors of his exhumations; but he has worked at 
them wonderfully and surprised us with the revelation that these bones do 
indeed live and are almost as vividly deplorable as when they were flesh 
pulsing with the same half-educated desperation from their world-conquering 
start all the way to their world-conquered-by finish. 
</P>
<P>
 This had been flesh born in vaudeville, blooming over vaudeville's ashes and 
at last mixing up with vaudeville in the dust of what cannot be again. The 
lesson is only too familiar: Art is short and life thereafter much too long.

TOUTING AND DOUBTING THOMAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After reading David G. Savage's "Lone Justice" (Oct. 16), I wonder whether 
questions about Judge Clarence Thomas' veracity and qualifications would be at 
issue if he was a liberal. Although Savage tried to write in a balanced manner, 
both his dredging up of Spike Lee (such a purveyor of scholarly thought) and 
his commenting that Malcolm X would have called Thomas a "handkerchief head . . 
. Uncle Tom" were patently offensive to me. It seems as though Savage holds a 
filmmaker and a pimp-turned-racist militant in higher esteem than a Supreme 
Court justice who happens to be a black conservative. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas and Thurgood Marshall were poles apart. Yet Marshall was never 
castigated for being "a knee-jerk left-winger." Clearly, when it came to the 
death penalty and civil-rights causes, Marshall had an agenda. So what? 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas is reviled by Savage, by activist groups and, unfortunately, by other 
African Americans because he isn't "politically correct." Many people, 
especially black citizens, buy into the belief that all African Americans 
should think alike, forming a united front to uplift the whole race. Kudos to 
Thomas for dispelling this inaccurate premise. His shining day in court will 
come.

 Three years later, the liberal media still cannot stand the fact that Thomas 
is sitting on the Supreme Court. According to Savage, Thomas is guilty by 
association -- being friends with Rush Limbaugh. He is guilty because of his 
quiet demeanor. And he is guilty of not voting according to race, as every good 
black man should. Indeed, how dare Thomas not cower to the distinguished 
members of the Senate Judiciary Committee? And how dare he not give interviews 
to a left-wing press that still reviles him?

 During the lengthy confirmation hearings, my main concern, aside from the 
Anita Hill controversy, was with Thomas' statements denying that he had 
preconceived opinions in several areas. I had hoped that my suspicions would 
prove unfounded, and that Thomas would follow in his predecessors' footsteps, 
bringing much-needed diversity to the court. 
</P>
<P>
 How disgraceful that now, several years into his lifelong term, we know the 
truth. In Thomas' effort to attain one of the highest positions in the nation, 
he was untruthful -- a poor quality in any person but an intolerable one in a 
Supreme Court justice.

 It was the comment about Thomas sounding more like a Jeffersonian liberal than 
a Reagan conservative that moved me to write. Jefferson's statement has so 
often been misquoted and been used out of context that the accurate text may 
come as a surprise to many liberals, who have used it to justify laws that ban 
prayer in schools, ordinances that restrict Nativity scenes on public property 
and proposals that the phrase In God We Trust be removed from our coins and 
currency. 
</P>
<P>
 It reads: "The First Amendment has erected a wall of separation between church 
and state. That wall is a one-dimensional wall. It keeps government from 
running the church but it makes sure that Christian principles will always stay 
in government." 
</P>
<P>
 Personally, I'm glad that Thomas is a conservative who sounds like a 
Jeffersonian.

 Savage chooses two examples he labels as voting-rights discrimination: the 
cases involving Lawrence Presley's loss of decision-making power on 
road-construction matters, and Bleckley County's change from one county 
commissioner to five. These are simply examples of power politics, which can be 
found in any small jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 While the situations cited by Savage were correct, they represent the type of 
problems that need to be solved by the electorate at the local level and not by 
the U.S. Supreme Court.

 The impression that remained with me after reading your hate piece on Thomas 
was that he is a man of incredible dignity and courage. It's about time that we 
leave behind the narrow-mindedness of the Thurgood Marshall years and give 
encouragement to African Americans who have the courage to stand up for 
conservative principles and individual self-worth. The liberal establishment 
only values those African Americans who conform to a monolithic socialist 
agenda, and the Democratic Party, which is always trumpeting its own tolerance 
for diversity of ideas, really has no tolerance at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Rush Limbaugh and Clarence Thomas, both men of character, will be around long 
after liberalism and socialism are dead.

 A banner across the second spread of Savage's story shouts that Thomas has 
rarely affected the outcome of a key case. What that refers to, I assume, is 
his being among the majority in a 5-4 decision. The same could have been said 
about Justices John Marshall and Oliver Wendell Holmes. The Marshall court was 
usually unanimous, and Holmes is best remembered for his dissents.

 In ordinary life, if a job applicant is found to have lied or to have hidden

 Good heavens! Thomas listens to and likes Rush Limbaugh, he smokes cigars, 
drives a Corvette and prays with his wife. I can see how such activities would 
hinder his movement toward liberalism -- excuse me, growth. I feel so

Thomas' own words will see a quite different sort of man than the one Savage 
portrayed.

RICHARD EDER: THE VIEW FROM MIDDLE AGE; A MIDWESTERN BOY ENCOUNTERS THE GREAT 
WORLD OF LITERATURE, THE LITTLE WORLD OF ACADEMIAAND THE MYSTIFYING PAIN OF 
GROWING OLDER; NOVEMBERFEST BY THEODORE WEESNER (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $24; 386 PP.) 
 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Astride the parabola of middle age, where the curve tilts forward and almost 
instantly plunges, Glen Cady walks on a cold Atlantic beach with Alice, his 
4-year-old daughter. In his mid-50s, he is only an assistant professor of 
German, will not get tenure, will have to leave and has virtually no prospects 
of another position. His marriage to a much younger woman is coming apart. He 
is afflicted by the memory of an old love, and by a ghostly revenant in the fey 
person of a student who is on the point of seducing him. 
</P>
<P>
 All these things are told us virtually in the first page of "Novemberfest," 
but Theodore Weesner doesn't simply tell them. Adding one more element, one 
more distress -- as a chemist introduces a droplet of material to precipitate a 
solution -- he releases the first active storm-sign in Cady's lowering anguish. 
Alice is the droplet. Normally sparky and responsive, she is oddly languid. 
Instead of running ahead she hangs back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alice's fingers are like stubby, moist pencils and keep trying to return to 
his own," Weesner writes. She trudges beside Cady, reluctantly. Finally he puts 
her on his shoulders. "She has the weight of an empty gym bag" and then, as he 
carries her to the car, "the empty gym bag seems to be filling with sand." 
</P>
<P>
 Only a parent can pick up those first signals from the onset of a child's 
sickness: not quite consciously, but as an ache in the parental bones and a 
lead weight on the spirit. If I mark this minor passage -- Alice is indeed ill, 
will go to the hospital for a night and will quickly recover -- it is to mark 
something of the light and intensity that Weesner can focus on a small event, 
and his use of it to show the simultaneity of our emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 We are strong at a funeral, and a few spilled drops of coffee afterward make 
us break down. Cady, the stoic and vulnerably romantic protagonist of this 
finely drawn novel, does not break down, but Alice's beach-droop breaks us into 
the darks and lights of his story. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a story that Weesner tells with what might be called haunted realism. He 
approaches the task of presenting a familiar enough event, emotion or setting 
with buoyant discovery, as if it had never been attempted before. There are 
some rather old-fashioned fictional qualities to "Novemberfest," such as the 
very complete and explicit account of just where the protagonist stands at each 
moment. How refreshing it is, though, to be on an author's beach, instead of 
inside his head; especially when he is able to make it and so many other scenes 
suggest the music of a life as well as its text. 
</P>
<P>
 In alternating sections, "Novemberfest" sets the story of Cady's middle-age 
crisis against the time, nearly 35 years earlier, when he was an Army recruit 
in Germany and had a brief, consuming and transforming affair with Hedy, a 
married German woman. Its dazzlement opened the 20-year-old up; through the 
opening entered a passion for a European culture and civilization he had never 
dreamed of. 
</P>
<P>
 From his pre-Army Midwestern blue-collar youth, with a factory job in 
prospect, he painfully worked his way after the Army through a community 
college and then, with scholarships, up through a doctorate in modern German 
literature and a teaching position. He was late getting there and now, in the 
late 1980s, with the job market tight, with a brilliant teaching record but 
skimpy publication and with middle-aged white males at no premium whatsoever, 
he is at the end of the line. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cady's effort to fight for his job makes a splendid account of present-day 
academic politics. Weesner treats his hero's ordeal with compassion but with a 
certain balancing irony as well. There is a villain or two, but mostly the 
university authorities get a touch of sympathy. They are under constraints and 
have to follow the tenure rules; and Cady is decidedly an odd fish. 
</P>
<P>
 He puts his case to a dean: His publication record is no worse than that of 
several tenured professors, he has done brilliant translations, he is 
acknowledged as a superb teacher, he had been assured that he was on tenure 
track, he cannot get another job and finally . . . "I saw Thomas Mann once. On 
a street in Stuttgart." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a splendid, revealing moment (all the more because the dean, a political 
scientist, politely inquires: "You do mean the author?"). Only apparently is it 
an irrelevancy, though Cady is embarrassed to have said it. In fact it defines 
him. He is passionately, hopelessly in love with German literature -- as he was 
once with Hedy, his German love -- and, anachronistically, he believes in an 
academic world where such a passion was the reason you became a professor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Novemberfest," in fact, is the story of an aging romantic in a chilly modern 
world. His grief, frustration and anger are real, but Weesner makes him joyful, 
as well, occasionally triumphant -- particularly at the end, where the fall of 
the Berlin Wall and Cady's final, improbable success are juxtaposed, as if to 
proclaim the possibilities of the impossible -- and once in a while, comical. 
</P>
<P>
 There are, for example, the efforts of Ecki, the German graduate student, to 
seduce him. She enters his office, refuses to sit down and tells him she is in 
love with him. She offers her body in a wonderfully theoretical way; pointing 
out, for instance, the advantages of her breast, partly exposed. She goes on to 
argue that sooner or later he is bound to fall, and that it will probably be at 
some drunken academic conference, so why not with her, who is beautiful and has 
a large spirit? We can virtually hear her translating from the German. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Here and elsewhere Weesner has expressed the alternate sense of recognition 
and bewilderment on the no-man's-land between American and European notions of 
how people engage with each other. Henry James did it; Weesner can show an 
equivalent penetration and -- particularly with Ecki, whose comedy is both 
serious and winning -- a good deal more fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the best writing in a book whose only real defect is a certain 
bumpiness in the rhythms and timing of the plot, is the rise and fall of Cady's 
affair with Hedy. He is on a day's leave in Baden, trying to get away from his 
fellow GIs. She is pushing an expensive baby carriage. He bumps into it, 
apologizes, she accepts the apology; there is a spark of humor on both sides.

 "Your carriage, it is nice-looking," he says awkwardly. She lifts him from the 
awkwardness with a joke. "Forgive me? My baby is not so nice-looking?" He 
mounts up onto the joke. "What baby?" And bit by graceful bit -- the grace is 
hers, the eagerness to learn it, his -- they are off. He is all passion and 
discovery, she is all passion, but with the knowledge that the world allows 
passion its place but is more important. At their first rendezvous (her husband 
is away) she comes to the door wearing a blue smock over her seduction clothes; 
she has been doing a little last-minute Hausfrauing. 
</P>
<P>
 Weesner does the passion splendidly; even more splendidly he does the gradual 
sating and thinning-out. Cady is always relieved to get back to Army routine 
and camaraderie -- Hedy is taken up with other plans. Passion and its limits; a 
lesson, perhaps a European lesson, that will take the Midwestern boy into the 
great world of literature, the little world of academia and through the 
mystifying pain, losses and illumination of his middle age.

COVER STORY: THE NEW SCARLETT: WHERE SHALL SHE GO? HOW SHALL SHE ACT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The last we saw of Mrs. Scarlett O'Hara Butler, no one gave a damn about her. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, that may not be completely accurate. Probably every person who has 
watched the ambiguous ending of the movie based on the Margaret Mitchell novel 
wondered what would happen next to the willful Southern belle who once vowed, 
as God was her witness, to never go hungry again. 
</P>
<P>
 How would such a woman cope after her husband left her -- so suddenly and in 
all that fog -- in an Atlanta manse. It would be something sweeping in grand 
Scarlett style, no doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 Author Alexandra Ripley's bold sequel to "Gone With the Wind" filled in the 
blanks, and it wasn't long before a CBS miniseries was in the making. Here, the 
two actors picked to play Scarlett and Rhett Butler talk about the expectations 
and the reality of picking up where movie legends last left off in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of actresses would be intimidated about following Vivien Leigh's 
legendary Oscar-winning turn as Scarlett O'Hara in the all-time favorite movie 
"Gone With the Wind." 
</P>
<P>
 Fiddle-dee-dee. Not Joanne Whalley-Kilmer. 
</P>
<P>
 The petite, unassuming actress doesn't seem a bit unnerved about playing 
Margaret Mitchell's infamous, fiery character. "Scarlett," the lavish 
eight-hour miniseries, based on Alexandra Ripley's best-selling sequel to 
Mitchell's novel "Gone With the Wind," premieres Sunday on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 Actors, Whalley-Kilmer says, always have played roles that other actors have 
essayed before. So she really doesn't understand the fuss. 
</P>
<P>
 "On one level, it's, 'What are they talking about?' " she says, relaxing in 
the lounge of the Bel-Air Hotel. "On another level, it's different because you 
are dealing with 'Gone With the Wind.' On the other hand, we are not remaking 
'Gone With the Wind.' But even if we were, why shouldn't we? Why shouldn't we 
have another go at the role?" 
</P>
<P>
 Whalley-Kilmer, 30, has a lot in common with Leigh, who died in 1967. Like 
Leigh, Whalley-Kilmer is British with a strong stage and movie ("Scandal") 
background. Leigh was married to actor Laurence Olivier for more than 20 years; 
Whalley-Kilmer has been married for six years to actor Val Kilmer, the newest 
Batman, whom she met while they were making "Willow." The couple have a young 
daughter, Mercedes. 
</P>
<P>
 She also happens to adore old movies, especially Leigh's. "I've always been a 
Vivien Leigh fan," she says softly. "She was extraordinary. Vivien Leigh is so 
exquisite and wonderful and completely Scarlett O'Hara in the first film. It's 
a wonderful movie and it has gone beyond a movie. It is people's lives." 
</P>
<P>
 And CBS is probably hoping that "Scarlett" will become part of modern culture, 
too. Adapted by William Hanley and directed by John Erman ("Queen"), the 
melodrama begins at Melanie Wilkes' funeral and chronicles Scarlett's futile 
early attempts to win back her husband, the dashing Rhett Butler (Timothy 
Dalton). 
</P>
<P>
 The sprawling story spans six years and follows Scarlett to Ireland, where she 
becomes involved with her relatives and the wealthy but evil Earl of Fenton 
(Sean Bean), who becomes her lover. Though Scarlett doesn't have to endure the 
Civil War and those nasty Yankees, she does survive a boating accident, 
experiences an horrific birth, receives a concussion after falling off her 
horse during a fox hunt and is put on trial for murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Audiences won't know until the final episode if Rhett, who remarries in the 
second installment, does give a damn and comes to Scarlett's rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 Whalley-Kilmer is in practically every scene of the maxiseries. She says she 
kept up her energy during the arduous six-month shoot in England, Ireland and 
Charleston, S.C., because Scarlett had energy to spare. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started shooting very early Monday morning and by the time we got through 
Friday, we would finish very late," she explains. "So Saturday, you were like a 
moron because you were exhausted. Sundays, I'd go over stuff for the week 
coming up. Thank God, we had some time in the weekend, so we could take a 
breath." 
</P>
<P>
 The first couple of weeks were chaotic. "I felt like I was spinning," she 
says, lighting up a cigarette. "I was surrounded and people were pulling at my 
costumes. It was endless -- seven scenes a day and dialogue and period and time 
changes and event changes. It was a whirlwind. But what happens is that you 
kind of hit your stride and see what the task is." 
</P>
<P>
 Whalley-Kilmer pauses and laughs. "The problem is, now I'm not changing my 
clothes six times a day. I'm getting confused. I get twitchy. I should be 
changing." 
</P>
<P>
 Having her family with her also helped. Mercedes, she says, "was great. She 
was kind of a great savior. When I was single and I was doing this stuff by 
myself, you would go crazy at night. You worry so much about what happened 
during the day. You just torture yourself. With a 2 1/2-year-old, you get home 
at night and you are a mom. I just know they both really helped me." 
</P>
<P>
 Whalley-Kilmer had just two weeks to prepare before rehearsals began last 
December. She immediately began working with a dialect coach to perfect her 
Southern accent. "I said, 'I have to start on the accent right now or I know I 
will never be comfortable.' You just go over and over it until you don't think 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
 She then read "Scarlett" and 'Gone With the Wind" each twice. " 'Gone With the 
Wind' was really helpful for all that background and history. I'd never read 
the book, but obviously had seen the movie. It's a really good book." 
</P>
<P>
 And Scarlett, she says, was a challenging character to bring to life. "What's 
interesting is her complexity," offers Whalley-Kilmer. "She's not cut and dry 
by any means. What I like about her is the opposites within her. She can be 
manipulative, shameless, hard and cruel, but you find out she's doing that to 
save someone's honor or she's doing that to save her family. She's admirable 
but she's human. That's what I love about her." 
</P>
<P>
 Whalley-Kilmer also found Scarlett to be a somewhat tragic figure. "She can't 
allow herself to be vulnerable, to fail or be wrong. She doesn't let herself 
cry, which is all admirable, but sad. If she could just allow herself to reach 
an understanding about Rhett, then she could find some peace. But she doesn't 
find peace. She's looking for that." 
</P>
<P>
 "Scarlett" airs Sunday at 9 p. m. and Tuesday-Thursday at 9 p.m. on CBS.

RETURN TO THE WILLOWS; SEQUEL TO GRAHAME'S CHILDREN'S CLASSIC FAILS TO CARRY ON 
HIS VISION; THE WILLOWS IN WINTER, BY WILLIAM HORWOOD . ILLUSTRATED BY PATRICK 
BENSON (ST. MARTIN'S PRESS / A THOMAS DUNNE BOOK: $18.95; 295 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Michael Cart, Formerly Director of the Beverly Hills Public Library, Michael 
Cart is now a full-time writer and observer of the children's book world. His 
first two books will be published in 1995. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Considering the recent commercial success of posthumous sequels to celebrated 
novels ("Scarlett," Alexandra Ripley's 1991 postscript to "Gone With the Wind," 
sold an astonishing 2.3 million copies), it was only a matter of time before 
publishers began searching the world of children's literature for likely 
candidates. Since nothing is sacred in the corporate land of bottom-line, could 
there be a better place to start than Kenneth Grahame's "Wind in the Willows," 
arguably the greatest children's book of them all and a perennial bestseller to 
boot? 
</P>
<P>
 So, step aside, Scarlett, and make way for Mr. Toad, Water Rat, Mole and 
Badger who have returned in the pages of William Horwood's "The Willows in 
Winter." When it was first published in Great Britain last year, the book 
enjoyed brisk sales, spending 12 weeks on the London Times bestseller list. 
With an impressive first printing of 100,000 copies by its American publisher, 
the book is obviously expected to do equally well here in the States. 
</P>
<P>
 If a sequel to this enduring classic had to be written (though Grahame himself 
refused to do so, explaining that "sequels are often traps which the wise 
author does well to avoid"), William Horwood is not a bad choice to do it. 
After all, this former journalist is the author of the popular Duncton Wood 
series, six massive fantasies chronicling the imagined lives and civilization 
of a race of sentient moles living in a wood near Oxford. His established 
sympathy with the small animals of the natural world and his obvious love for 
the Willows characters stand him in good stead here. As a sequel to Grahame's 
enduring childhood classic, however, his book is ultimately a failure -- but an 
interesting failure, because its shortcomings point up Grahame's successes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Wind in the Willows," you will remember, is essentially two stories: The 
first finds an exasperated Mole fleeing from the rigors of spring housecleaning 
and discovering the world of the river bank and a new friendship with one of 
its residents, the Water Rat. The second follows the outrageous misadventures 
of the wealthy Toad, master of Toad Hall but hapless slave to his exuberant 
enthusiasms, particularly for shiny motor cars that go "poop-poop." 
</P>
<P>
 When Mole, Rat, and the stern Badger restrain Toad for his own good, he 
escapes, steals a motor car, is apprehended and locked up in "the remotest 
dungeon of the stoutest castle in Merry England." He escapes and at length 
returns to Toad Hall, a chastened, repentant and "indeed, an altered Toad." 
</P>
<P>
 Sure he was! Not even Grahame believed that one. "Of course Toad was never 
really reformed," he admitted later, "he was by nature incapable of it. But the 
subject is a painful one to pursue." 
</P>
<P>
 Not for Horwood, however, who relishes the premise that, some years later, the 
recidivist Toad has finally backslid, his mania for motor cars now replaced by 
an all-consuming passion for flying machines. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Toad is aloft, the story takes off, just as his earlier misadventures had 
propelled Grahame's plot. 
</P>
<P>
 If Toad has captured Horwood's imagination, it is Mole who has won his heart. 
Indeed, Horwood claims that it was his acquisition of one of E. H. Shepard's 
brilliant illustrations of Mole in the Wild Wood that was the inspiration for 
this sequel. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Grahame before him, Horwood begins his book with Mole, though not in the 
midst of spring housecleaning, this time, but at his ease in front of a fire in 
the dead of winter, instead. While Horwood's principal characters are Grahame's 
own, he has taken the liberty of introducing a new character, Mole's young 
nephew, whose only purpose -- aside from suggesting the possibility of a sequel 
to the sequel -- seems to be to venerate Mole and by his attitude to invest 
that small animal with almost mythical largeness. This, it seems to me, is one 
of Horwood's first mistakes. For if you consider the quartet of Grahame's chief 
characters to be a family, Badger would be the stern but benevolent father; 
Rat, the oldest, resourceful brother; Toad, the egocentrically solipsistic 
infant, and Mole, the middle brother -- always loyal but sometimes naive and 
sometimes timid, too. By pushing him ahead in the pecking order, Horwood has 
violated the integrity of Grahame's neatly ordered family world. And so when 
Mole -- through misunderstanding -- believes Rat to be in danger, he boldly 
sets off, at night, in the middle of a blizzard to rescue him. Instead, he 
disappears, and the first part of the book tells of the other animals' 
fruitless search for him. Toad and his flying machine are impressed into 
service but Toad -- through an awkwardly plotted stratagem -- escapes to his 
own (mis)adventures and the plot then moves back and forth between him and the 
other animals, following essentially the same structure that Grahame used, 
though Grahame's narrative is punctuated -- some critics would say interrupted 
-- by a number of gorgeously written chapters that offer quiet reflection on 
the comforts and emotional importance of home ("Dulce Domum"), a salute to the 
siren song of the South ("Wayfarers All") and a panegyric to Pan, the Helper 
and Healer of small animals in distress ("The Piper at the Gates of Dawn"). 
There is little of this in Horwood's book, his narrative being more continuous 
and swiftly paced and more agreeable, thus, to impatient modern readers. And 
yet this absence of the reflective is the chief reason for the relative failure 
of Horwood's book. 
</P>
<P>
 Understand that Grahame was a deeply conflicted man. Superficially he was a 
professional success -- an Establishment figure, the youngest secretary in the 
history of the Bank of England, starchy, well-to-do and respected. Yet deep 
within him lived another Grahame -- the child who, at 7, suffered the death of 
his mother and abandonment by his alcoholic father. Along with his brothers and 
sister, he was remanded to the emotionally distant care of his grandmother who 
lived in Berkshire. It was that beautiful countryside which, when he retired 
there 40 years later, provided both the setting and emotional catalyst for the 
creation of his great classic childhood. Never entirely comfortable with the 
"real" (i.e., adult) world, burdened by an unhappy marriage that he escaped at 
every occasion to flee, alone, to the "South" (usually Italy), befriending 
Bohemian companions (not unlike Toad!) but denied the freedoms of their lives; 
dismayed by the inroads of the Industrial Age, which were so destructive to the 
comfortable, established, clubby order of his world, Grahame retreated to his 
fiction where all of this subterranean material emerged, in symbol and 
allegory. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two examples from "Wind": first, the terrifying stoats and weasels of the Wild 
Wood -- the personifications of the impersonal terrors of the Machine Age -- 
invade and take over Toad Hall, the ancient and ancestral home, when the 
Establishment animals are distracted by Bohemian Toad's peccadilloes. Horwood 
has made the mistake of domesticating these Wild animals, even of having them 
assist in the search for Mole, just for the sake of an invitation to Badger's 
tea party! Secondly, Grahame had a deeply pantheistic veneration for the 
natural world and an attendant interest in the neo-pagan movement (his first 
book was even titled The Pagan Papers). This devotion inspired the mystical 
chapter "The Piper at the Gates of Dawn." Horwood tries to emulate this by 
giving both Mole and Rat near-death experiences and a vision of "Beyond" 
(paradise) yet his "vision" is tepidly New Age and totally lacking in the 
primal power of Grahame's intensely personal vision. 
</P>
<P>
 Because "The Wind in the Willows" is such a personal book, no other author -- 
even a talented one like Horwood -- can hope to capture more than its 
superficial style; its essence is forever elusive. 
</P>
<P>
 If Horwood has set himself an impossible task, so has illustrator Patrick 
Benson. There have been more than 100 different editions of "The Wind in the 
Willows" but only one -- that of 1931 with illustrations by E. H. Shepard -- is 
considered definitive by devotees. A great genius, Shepard (who also 
illustrated A.A. Milne's "Winnie the Pooh") somehow contrived to capture in 
pictures the wonderfully realized reality of Grahame's prose. Shepard's 
black-and-white illustrations -- some full-page, some sketches, some vignettes 
-- are artfully placed among the text to offer not only an aesthetically 
delightful book but a richly imagined expansion of Grahame's own vision. 
Benson's pictures, on the other hand, are muddy and oddly vague, perhaps 
because he lacks both Shepard's art and understanding that the heavily 
anthropomorphized characters must be simultaneously animal and human. Thus, 
Benson's characters either lack personality or approach the grotesque (his Toad 
looks less like a toad than a mutant ninja turtle!), while his images seem 
carelessly dropped on the page rather than gracefully placed like Shepard's. 
Ultimately "The Willows in Winter" -- despite its obvious and abundant good 
intentions -- is a manufactured book rather than an inspired one. And that, 
finally, is the telling difference between it and Grahame's unique and enduring 
original.

 "Rain Forest Remedies" (by Michael Tennesen, Palm Latitudes, Oct. 9) made me 
think of my mother, who maintained in our cellar rows of jars filled with 
herbs, leaves, roots and other strange, unidentifiable flora from Mexico, where 
she was born and raised. She had a cure for everything.But growing up American, 
I considered these old wives' tales, believing that when one of her remedies 
resulted in a cure, it was a coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
 I really hated one of them: When anyone suffered emotional trauma or shock, 
she would simmer a pot of water, drop in some wood chips she called cuasia , 
let it cool overnight, strain it and force her patient to drink it. 
</P>
<P>
 When my mother died, her jars of herbs were discarded, and the names of the 
plants and what they were supposed to cure were forgotten. But years later, 
during a time of stress, my doctor prescribed the most recent and popular 
tranquilizer, Miltown, generically named meprobamate. While leafing through a 
medical book at the library, I came across Miltown and discovered its main 
ingredient: cassia. 
</P>
<P>
 My mother was years ahead of medical science, and we threw it all away.

THE HMO DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the basis of personal experience, I beg to differ with the claims of Dr. 
Roger S. Taylor for Secure Horizons, the Medicare HMO operating under Taylor's 
PacifiCare Health Services, (Letters, Oct. 9) in reference to "The Triumph of 
Harry and Louise" (by David Ewing Duncan, Sept. 11). 
</P>
<P>
 Last winter, my father switched from Medicare to Secure Horizons. That seemed 
like a good idea, until Dad's health took a dramatic and unexpected downturn in 
February. Following his hospitalization, we found that he was unable to get the 
home health care he needed. Secure Horizons provided minimal home visits, and I 
had to fight to get those. 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever I called their customer-service number, I was passed from one person 
to another or told that the person I really needed to talk to had just gone 
out, was away on vacation, whatever. Everyone had an excuse, but no one was 
responsible. My husband and I, both of whom were working, took turns looking 
after Dad until we were able to organize different living arrangements for him 
and get him back on Medicare, which provided, without a squabble, the 
additional health services he required. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have the youthfulness and good health of the older people pictured in 
HMO advertisements, an HMO may be a valid option -- for a time. But if you 
develop chronic health needs, or fear that you will develop them, think twice 
before giving up Medicare.

 What we are currently witnessing is an insurance industry that by the way, is 
present in no other country in the world, charging more for premiums and paying 
providers less while at the same time intimidating doctors to provide less care 
-- all in the quest for greater profits. Some people have suggested that the 
great American health-care system has been saved this year by Congress' failure 
to enact a health bill. To the contrary, it has not; it is currently in 
decline. Greedy insurance companies are taking their turn at killing the goose 
that laid the golden egg.

THE RHETT STUFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Timothy Dalton really doesn't know why he takes risks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I often say I like a challenge, but I begin to wonder where you draw the line 
between a healthy creative challenge and something that is potentially 
self-destructive," acknowledges the 48-year-old Welsh actor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether it becomes about ... can I survive it? Or can I, against all odds, be 
good? One wonders. I'm not quite sure where the line is between something 
that's perverse and masochistic and what's challenging. I sometimes feel I 
strangely have to test things all the time and see if I can survive and, 
hopefully, do well." 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-2 actor did win critics' approval when he took over the role of 
James Bond from Roger Moore in 1987's "The Living Daylights" and 1989's 
"Licence to Kill." (Earlier this year, Dalton passed the Bond torch to Irish 
actor Pierce Brosnan.) But he had less luck as the brooding Heathcliff -- the 
part that made Laurence Olivier a superstar in 1939 -- in the turgid 1970 
remake of "Wuthering Heights." 
</P>
<P>
 And now the actor has taken on what may be the biggest career challenge of his 
life: starring as the dashing rogue Rhett Butler opposite Joanne Whalley-Kilmer 
in "Scarlett." Dalton acknowledges that Clark Gable, who received an Oscar 
nomination for his indelible performance as Rhett in the classic 1939 movie, is 
a hard act to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clark Gable was pretty damn wonderful," Dalton says, puffing on a cigarette 
at the Bel-Air Hotel. "He didn't play it like Gable. I was hoping in an odd 
sort of way that Gable, who I thought was wonderful, was just being a wonderful 
Clark Gable, and that Margaret Mitchell would have written something that was 
very different that I could pick up. But when you read Margaret Mitchell, you 
realize Clark Gable was being a wonderful actor. He was playing the Rhett 
Butler she had written." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Dalton's Rhett still possesses the mustache, killer smile, hearty laugh 
and charm of Gable's Rhett, Dalton creates his own Rhett -- more laconic and 
subdued than Gable's larger-than-life portrayal. 
</P>
<P>
 As for following in Gable's footsteps, Dalton acknowledges, "Some people would 
say it is deeply foolish to do it." That wasn't the case with Bond. "At least 
three people played him before, so people, I think, got used to the idea that 
different actors were going to play the role. It's a bit more buffered with 
Bond. But with this, we don't have the luxury." 
</P>
<P>
 "Damn ridiculous" was Dalton's first reaction when he heard about the "Gone 
With the Wind" sequel. "It was stupid and wrong and how the hell could anybody 
make something that was the continuation of 'Gone With the Wind?' Why should 
they make a continuation of 'Gone With the Wind?' And if they are asking to 
step into Clark Gable's shoes, you're mad. I'm ashamed to say I did shout at my 
agent on the phone." 
</P>
<P>
 But then that certain something inside Dalton urged him to do it. "You get 
hooked," he says with a smile. "In the end, I would have turned it down if I 
didn't think the piece was going to be any good, with no qualms whatsoever. But 
knowing the director (John Erman) and knowing his approach and knowing the cast 
he was getting, there was every chance in the world it would be real good." 
</P>
<P>
 In "GWTW," Rhett was pursuing Scarlett, and in "Scarlett" she is trying to get 
him back. "She's after him," Dalton says. "I'm sure it's still with the awful 
juvenile immaturity she seemed to display in 'Gone With the Wind.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Though "Gone With the Wind" ends with Rhett throwing the infamous "Frankly, my 
dear, I don't give a damn" line at Scarlett, Dalton believes he still loves 
her. Still, he says, "she has treated him bad. It's his own fault. He took that 
chance, but she has pretty much treated everybody bad through the entire 'Gone 
With the Wind' story." 
</P>
<P>
 And Rhett, he says, "certainly has had enough. He loves her, no question. I 
think he loves her even when he says, 'I don't give a damn.' What he's really 
saying is, 'I don't trust you. I don't believe you. I don't care anymore. I've 
had enough.' This is a man and a woman who are obviously made for each other 
dealing with a situation where he doesn't want to have anything to do with her, 
but can't rid himself of that passion in his heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's not like any other woman in the society," Dalton continues. "And in 
many, many ways, she is a horrible, horrible woman. She treats people 
appallingly. She's full of fire and determination. She's mean, ruthless, 
ambitious, selfish." 
</P>
<P>
 And, he adds firmly, "I think she's worse than a bitch to a lot of people in 
('GWTW'), but she's a complete one of a kind and he recognizes that. She's the 
woman for him but he can't win her." 
</P>
<P>
 Dalton laughs. "Well, I mean, guys are often just stupid . You fall in love 
with somebody and that's it. You get obsessed. Rhett always thought he would 
make her love him. He thought he would make her grow up and love him. In 
'Scarlett,' I think, ultimately all the rigors that she faces in this 
eight-hour soap opera, she gets to the stage in her life that she's a lot more 
mature and recognizes Rhett for what he is and really feels for him."

'MATLOCK' OVER 'MCKENNA'?! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am a high school senior and between my college applications, cheerleading, 
drama and other school activities, I don't have the time ... to watch TV.Now, 
the one show I make time for in my week and I feel that is worth watching 
(unlike "Models Inc." or "Melrose Place") is "McKenna" and it's been replaced 
by "Matlock." (Of all things -- that show would definitely be one of my last 
picks. It's tired and has seen better days ... !)

 "Men, Movies and Carol" (CBS, Oct. 24) was an exceedingly pleasant saunter

 ON FLIRTATION: Psychoanalytic Essays on the Uncommitted Life by Adam Phillips 
(Harvard: $19.95; 226 pp.) This is not a joie de vivre book, not a bon vivant, 
c'est la guerre sort of book.Not a flirtatious treatment of flirtation. Do not 
be fooled by Robert Doisneau's photograph ("Les Amoureux aux Jonquilles") on 
the cover. Nor is it sheepish. Phillips does not sidle into the subject 
crab-wise and guilty. First things first: "To be committed to something . . . 
one has first to be committed, perhaps unconsciously, to commitment itself." 
"Flirtation," on the other hand, "is the game of taking chances, of plotting 
illicit possibilities." Much of the book refers to and challenges Freud. The 
Freudian self, writes Phillips, knows "what it wants and is always wanting; we 
can call this 'unconscious desire.' " But there is another self that interests 
Phillips as well: the self "that is not about knowing what it wants or is 
wanting. This version of the self -- for which wanting is not the game -- lives 
its contingency without contesting it." For the contingent self, "We cannot 
make our relationships work; we can only make our compromises work." The 
chapter on guilt, of course, is a little convoluted. Something about "turning 
pain into meaning -- which is the project both of psychoanalysis and of most 
religions." And "psychoanalysis," writes Phillips, "has always been a religion 
in which you are not allowed to believe in God." In other words: Deal with it.

 BETTER THAN LIFE by Daniel Pennac (Coach House: $16.95; 207 pp.) This is a 
lighthearted account of a couple of bookish parents who are horrified when 
their teen-age son turns into a book-hater, a non-reader.As a child, the author 
assures us, his son loved to be read to more than anything. "The absolute 
wonder of his new life endowed us with a kind of genius. For him, we became 
storytellers. . . . We didn't even know we had that skill. His pleasure 
inspired us. His happiness made us inventive." Suddenly the "reclusive 
adolescent" is "stuck on Page 48." Interminably. The culprits? Myriad: 
television, of course. The consumer society. Bad teachers, "threadbare 
libraries." All good culprits, says Pennac, asking himself at the same time, 
"What did we do to the ideal reader our child was in those days when we were 
both the tale and the teller?" We became, he concludes, our child's accountant, 
taking the pleasure out of reading by making it obligatory. By using television 
as a reward for good behavior. The solution? Pennac draws up a reader's bill of 
rights: The right to not read. The right to skip pages. The right to not finish 
a book. The right to reread. The right to read anything. The right to escapism. 
The right to read anywhere. The right to browse. The right to read out loud. 
And the right to not defend your tastes. "If we want our sons, our daughters, 
all young people to read," he writes, "we must grant them the same rights we 
grant ourselves."

 A BITTER TRUTH: Avant-Garde Art and the Great War by Richard Cork (Yale 
University Press: $49.95; 336 pp.) The arts just prior to World War I were 
charged with profound upheaval, feverish vitality and brilliant invention, as 
if the Zeitgeist knew that dramatically different visual languages and 
techniques would soon be required to register the monstrous carnage of "the 
last days of mankind."Expressionism, with its strident disruptions of classical 
composition and the human form, secured a central place in this brave new 
artistic world. Its tendency to reduce people to generic types provided a 
chilling counterpoint to the dehumanizing means and scale of modern warfare. 
Ludwig Meidner's apocalyptic landscapes (with which this book opens), painted 
in the two years before the war, show how mysteriously intertwined these 
upsurges of creative and destructive energy could be. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Bitter Truth: Avant-Garde Art and the Great War," is, amazingly, the first 
book to comprehensively treat its subject, and it does so masterfully, teeming 
with trenchant anecdote and telling detail. Cork moves chronologically, 
combining historical background, biographical incident and cogent visual 
analysis in a highly integrated and readable text. The illustrations, moreover, 
are profuse, superbly chosen and excellently reproduced: In some ways the book 
forms the perfect visual complement to Paul Fussell's "The Great War and Modern 
Memory." Among numerous unexpected discoveries is the striking work of British 
painter Paul Nash, a gentle, countrified aesthete whose battlefield experiences 
as a commissioned war artist utterly transformed his vision and his work. In 
this he serves well as an emblem of all that was done and undone by the Great 
War. Thomas Frick

 CLEOPATRA'S NOSE Essays on the Unexpected by Daniel J. Boorstin (Random House: 
$23; 211 pp.) One of the nice things about an essay is that it gives the author 
an opportunity to answer a question that burns in the breast of the reader; 
questions the author, because he or she possesses extraordinary sensitivity, 
living as authors do, on the pulse, the heartbeat of the era (or shut away in 
some isolated cubbyhole), knows the correct answer to, or can at least puzzle 
through with the reader. In these essays, which take on the "role of the 
accidental and the trivial" in history, the questions and the answers are both 
constructed, in a sort of wobbly way, out of Boorstin's vast erudition. 
(Boorstin is an historian, a Pulitzer Prize-winner, the author of "The 
Creators," "The Discoverers" and "The Americans," and was, for 12 years, the 
Librarian of Congress.) "For most of Western history interpretation has far 
outrun data," he writes. He contemplates the writer's divided self as 
"conscience of the world," the problems of being a "conscience-wracked" nation, 
the "historical paradox" that "in a nation where blacks are only a minority, 
the federal capital is governed by blacks. But they play a small role in the 
cultural life of the city." Some of the enemies here are just as shadowy as the 
questions being asked: "To respect female sensitivities, must the once 
respectable university group called a 'seminar' be re-christened an 'ovular'?" 
The essays on Washington, "The Role of the President's House," "The Making of a 
Capitol" and "An Un-American Capitol" are a little bland and uncompelling.Best 
are the autobiographical essays, "My Father, Lawyer Sam Boorstin," and "Land of 
the Unexpected," which answer at least one of our burning questions at the end 
of this book, namely, "Who are you, Mr. Boorstin?"

 A YEAR IN THE MAINE WOODS by Bernd Heinrich (Addison Wesley: $22; 258 pp.) "By 
the time I was 10 years old," Heinrich, author of "Ravens in Winter," and 
"Bumblebee Economics," tells us, "I had lived for six years as a refugee in a 
northern German forest."He takes to the Maine woods to "rediscover the 
vividness" with which he remembers seeing things as a child, "to see nature 
again as I did then." You have to appreciate and respect this desire in order 
to fully appreciate the pace and flavor of this delightful account. And to 
appreciate his loneliness, even as he accomplishes what he set out to. One of 
the most strange and wonderful things in this book is the author's 
relationship, over far too soon, with his pet raven, Jack. "Once we were off 
again," he writes of their drive to Maine, "Jack quickly resettled on his perch 
next to my ear. 'You OK, Jack? You glad to see me?' ' M m mm .' 'This is fun , 
huh?' 'Mm mm .' He was very glad to see me, and we journeyed on."

 CIVIL WARS From L.A. To Bosnia by Hans Magnus Enzensberger (The New Press: 
$18; 144 pp.) "Violence has freed itself from ideology" writes the poet 
Enzensberger, who was born in Nuremberg in 1929.According to him, civil wars 
have several common denominators, primarily "the autistic nature of the 
perpetrators, and their inability to distinguish between destruction and 
self-destruction." Participants must be "selfless," exhibiting what Freud 
called a "death drive," and youth is "the vanguard." Television and newspapers 
advertise civil wars, with television depicted as a "huge piece of graffiti, an 
artificial replacement for the autistically-shrunken ego." We ought to stay out 
of the affairs of other countries; "we ought to mop up the civil war in our own 
country." If you think that civil wars have anything to do with "hopeless 
economic situation(s)," you're wrong. Country by country, it's just a bunch of 
thugs with a death wish. Oddly, the book ends on this note: "If the state 
refuses to protect them, threatened individuals or groups will have to arm 
themselves." This voice, so clearly the furious voice of an ordinarily gentle 
man, implodes in the end, condoning the very activity he's deplored throughout 
the book. It's the saddest ending of all.

 HOW TO TRAVEL WITH A SALMON & Other Essays by Umberto Eco (Harcourt Brace: 
$18.95; 248 pp.) He's not the funniest man in the world, but with this 
collection of pieces, written between 1959 and 1961 for the Italian literary 
magazine Il Verri, Eco shows us his lighter side and the side that muses under 
deadline pressure.His sense of humor does not, in any way, resemble P. J. 
O'Rourke's or Dave Barry's or even Calvin Trillin's. It is more the bemused, 
frustrated, sarcastic but tolerant muttering of a world-weary intellectual 
living in a non-functioning universe. The Andy Rooney of academia. Eco vs. the 
Italian equivalent of the DMV, Eco vs. modern air travel ("A simple journey by 
air a few years ago . . . cost me in the end two Brooks Brothers neckties, two 
Burberry shirts, two pairs of Bardelli slacks, a tweed jacket bought in Bond 
Street, and a Krizia waistcoat"). Eco vs. the cellular phone ("very 
Rockefellerian"). Eco vs. the computer, Eco vs. American trains ("The train, in 
America, is not a choice. It is a punishment for, having neglected to read 
Weber on the Protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism, making the mistake 
of remaining poor"). "All through my early years," he writes, "I believed that, 
by some strange chance, all the people I met were stupid." Hey! Umberto! How's 
the weather up there?

ON THE TOWN: DIAL M FOR MADNESS; DO WE REALLY NEED ANOTHER AREA CODE TO 
REMEMBER? 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 I have had it up to here -- that's 5 feet, 8 inches -- with living by the 
numbers. A checking account number as long as an amino acid sequence, my Social 
Security number, payroll number, credit card numbers, ATM code, the distance to 
the moon at apogee and pi to four places are all embedded in the fissures of my 
reluctant memory. 
</P>
<P>
 But these I can accept as the price of a streamlined modern life, the 
trade-off for not having to write out the grocery list on lambskin vellum. It's 
telephone numbers that have pushed me over the edge and into an anonymous 
digitalized abyss as Orwellian as nine-number ZIP codes and even worse than 
Thomas Bros. coordinates, which on party invitations look like the host is 
expecting to call in an air strike if things get too rowdy. 
</P>
<P>
 What does L.A. County have now, three area codes? Four? Can you list them all? 
Does that include the 714-creep into the south end of the county? We have more 
area codes than some whole states have, more phones than cars, with another 
area code coming along in a year or so just for cellular phones. How can there 
be a sense of community in a city where you might have to dial 11 digits to 
order a good pizza? 
</P>
<P>
 As we wring our hands over our want of neighborhood and neighborliness, 
there's a practice we could revive to good purpose. It was phased out in the 
early 1960s, along with the Red Cars and, like the Red Cars, it shouldn't have 
been. 
</P>
<P>
 We used real words as telephone number prefixes. 
</P>
<P>
 Would anyone still hum a Glenn Miller song called 736-5000? Does it not linger 
in memory because it's PEnnsylvania 6-5000? Would Liz Taylor have won that 
Oscar for "228" and not "Butterfield 8"? When a movie character asked for a 
MUrray Hill number, you knew a swank Manhattanite would answer the phone. I 
never remembered our street number as a child, but today I can still recite our 
phone number out of a dead sleep: TWin Oaks 2-3262. Never mind that no oaks 
were in evidence, let alone a pair. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, prefixes were an early caller ID. Calling an ANgelus number 
would ring a phone in East L.A., TOpaz was in Downey, SYcamore in Alhambra and 
San Marino, and OXnard, mystifyingly, in Beverly Hills.

 Well into the 1970s, old phones at The Times bore the number MAdison 5-2345. 
To reach the rival Herald Examiner, you dialed a RIchmond number. The 
Anti-Digit Dialing League, headed by the grandson of the great reforming Gov. 
Hiram W. Johnsson, crusaded against the dehumanizing changeover from word 
prefixes to numbers, and not everyone has been converted to this day: A 
firewood store on Sepulveda near Pico still advertises its GRanite phone 
number. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the exception of prefixes such as HOllywood and VEnice, which did 
indeed ring in Hollywood and Venice, the prefixes had almost no connection to 
the neighborhoods they compassed. Here is where we can do better: 
</P>
<P>
 GOofy for Burbank. SEoul for Koreatown. TEmblor for Northridge. SImpson for 
Brentwood, TArpit for mid-Wilshire, ENtwistle for the Hollywood Hills (after 
Peg Entwistle, the starlet who became famous only after plunging off the 
Hollywood sign). BW for the phones around the old Bullocks Wilshire building. 
GRidiron for USC, NObel for Caltech. (I'd prefer NErd, but I'm afraid 
undergrads would dismantle my car and reassemble it in my china closet.) 
</P>
<P>
 There's something so cozy about shared prefixes. People in Topanga Canyon need 
only exchange the last four digits of their phone numbers because everyone's 
prefix is 455. 
</P>
<P>
 But let us not use this to paper over our flaws. Improvement projects can be 
stimulated by assigning frank prefixes to frankly problem neighborhoods. Give 
CRack to MacArthur Park for its drug trade . . . or to all MTA phone lines for 
the subway's structural flaws. WOnk for City Hall. DEcibel for the regions 
under the flight path at LAX. STrumpet for those red-light boulevards about 
which I won't invite indignant phone calls by naming. And SMog for the entire 
San Gabriel Valley.

 Those plushy superstars Kermit and Miss Piggy took some time out of their busy 
schedules to chat with The Times about their latest video, Muppet Classic 
Theater, which treats audiences to six Muppetized interpretations of favorite 
fairy tales: "Rumpelstiltskin," "The Elves & the Shoemaker," "King Midas," "The 
Emperor's New Clothes," "The Three Little Pigs" and "The Boy Who Cried Wolf." 
</P>
<P>
 Whose idea was Muppet Classic Theater?  
</P>
<P>
 Kermit: Well, the whole gang got together and . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Piggy: Let's not be modest, mon cher . It was Kermit's idea, and wasn't it a 
wonderful one? 
</P>
<P>
 It sure was. But is this really a forum for Miss Piggy's play at stardom?  
</P>
<P>
 P: PLAY AT STARDOM?! Were you raised on the moon? My dear ignorant 
journaliste, moi have been a superstar for quite some time. If you keep asking 
dumb questions, you'll never win that Wurlitzer Prize thingie. 
</P>
<P>
 Why is your take better than any other previous version?  
</P>
<P>
 P: Because moi am in it, of course! 
</P>
<P>
 K: Piggy! I wouldn't say that we're better than the other versions, but I can 
say that this is probably the first time the emperor in 'The Emperor's New 
Clothes' has actually been a bear emperor (Fozzie). 
</P>
<P>
 How did you decide who gets to play who?  
</P>
<P>
 K: It was very democratic. Whoever could fit into the costume played the part. 
</P>
<P>
 Why isn't "The Frog Prince" one of the stories?  
</P>
<P>
 K: We talked about that, but I didn't want to give a certain pig any 
additional reasons to try to kiss me. Besides, I like to finish a story the 
same species I was when I started it. 
</P>
<P>
 What are your favorite stories?  
</P>
<P>
 P: Moi adores the story where a humble young woman uses her talents, natural 
beauty and sparkling personality to become a legend in her own time. 
</P>
<P>
 K: I'm not familiar with that one. What story is that? 
</P>
<P>
 P: The story of moi 's life, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 Why will families want to watch the video?  
</P>
<P>
 P: What else would they do with it? 
</P>
<P>

PALM LATITUDES: THE BIZ; A MEMO'S JOURNEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Maria C. Iacobo 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Katzenberg memo, in which the former Walt Disney Studios chairman (who's 
now one-third of the Katzenberg-Spielberg-Geffen trinity) pilloried Hollywood's 
free-spenders, has joined the show-biz vernacular. But there's another, 
lesser-known Disney memo whose influence arguably exceeded Katzenberg's. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, Christopher Vogler, a Disney story analyst and student of Joseph 
Campbell, wrote a seven-page memo synopsizing the myth-master's description of 
the archetypal Hero's Journey, culled from thousands of years of stories, 
myths, legends and fairy tales. It was far from the first time Hollywood heard 
of Campbell -- he's been a conversational staple at least since George Lucas 
cited his influence on "Star Wars" -- but outside of a few screenwriters, 
critics and academics, precious few people had actually read "Hero with a 
Thousand Faces." 
</P>
<P>
 So Vogler's memo became a sort of a Cliff's Notes for Hollywood literati and 
it soon began a journey of its own. Dawn Steel in 1987 asked Vogler for a copy 
and made it required reading for Paramount executives, producers and writers. 
Other studio story departments followed suit. The memo grew to a 15- and then a 
40-page essay as Vogler continued to test and refine his ideas, talking with 
colleagues at Disney, friends at other studios and students at the UCLA 
Writer's Program, where he teaches a story analysis class. 
</P>
<P>
 Writers, producers and actors asked for copies. Among them was Jeff Arch, who, 
among other projects, wrote the story for "Sleepless in Seattle" and co-wrote 
the film's screenplay, says Vogler's work is "brilliant." "Every time I write 
something, I run each charcter throuh the system Chris has outlined," says 
Arch. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the memo made the ultimate metamorphosis; Vogler write "The Writer's 
Journey: Mythic Structure for Storytellers & Screenwriters." Published last 
year, the book presents the Hero's Journey in 12 stages. 
</P>
<P>
 Vogler, with a story credit on "The Lion King" and a hand in "The Little 
Mermaid" and "Beauty and the Beast," continues his journey as a literary 
consultant for several divisions at Disney, says the Hero's Journey "is much 
bigger than just a device for telling Hollywood stories. It's a way to live 
your life." Maria C. Iacobo

PRIESTLY DUTIES PLEASE 'ONE LIFE' ACTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY M. REICHARDT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Cal Winters, the psychopathic killer I played on 'Days of Our Lives,' is 
everything I would never want to be," says Wortham Krimmer. "While Reverend 
Andrew Carpenter, the character I've played for the past four years on 'One 
Life to Live,' is everything I aspire to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Krimmer finds it almost impossible to compare his former role and his current 
role. 
</P>
<P>
 "Andrew has so much strength that I wish I had," he adds. "Even when he makes 
huge mistakes -- like his current attraction to Marty Saybrooke (played by 
Susan Haskell) while still married to Cassie (played by Laura Bonarrigo) -- I 
admire the way he composes himself." 
</P>
<P>
 "On 'Days' I was a plot device used to run interference on 'super couples,' " 
he says, but on 'One Life' I have a home." 
</P>
<P>
 The actor feels that he was not typecast as a psychopath because Linda 
Gottlieb, who was the executive producer on "One Life" when he was hired, was 
new to daytime. "About a month after I started, Linda told me that she had just 
heard that I had previously played a psychopathic killer and asked me if it was 
true." 
</P>
<P>
 Krimmer had originally planned to be a lawyer with the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency. After being accepted to law school, he found himself drawn 
to acting. He got halfway through a law school in the University of California 
system before he took a leave of absence to accept a scholarship at the 
prestigious American Conservatory Theatre in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a three-year course of study, and I received my MFA there," says 
Krimmer. "But I kept renewing my leave of absence at the law school until the 
dean, who by then had seen me act, finally told me to face the fact that I 
wasn't coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 "I never looked back," Krimmer admits, even during times of unemployment. And 
the part of Andrew is an actor's dream. "I would be foolish to leave or to 
complain. I've continually been given great stuff to play, and the writers just 
keep digging deeper into the humanity of this man of the cloth." 
</P>
<P>
 The actor does not know what will happen with Andrew's attraction to Marty, 
but hopes they just keep it simmering. The mail has been in favor of the story, 
with more than half rooting for Cassie and the rest for Marty. 
</P>
<P>
 Krimmer, who describes himself as an "old married guy" has a 5-year-old son, 
Max, and a 1-year-old daughter, Tess. He rarely speaks of himself without 
mentioning Mary Ellen, his wife of 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has supported me as a person and in my career," says the actor. "Even 
before the kids, she put her own career on the back burner. She's a brilliant 
photographer, and it would please me to give her the same support she has given 
me. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the most romantic thing I've ever done is staying married for 18 years," 
he adds. "Romance is not the things you do here and there, but cumulative 
efforts over time. You can't top that with a box of flowers or chocolates." 
</P>
<P>
 "One Life to Live" airs weekdays at 1 p.m. on ABC.

CAUGHT MY EYE; MADE YOU LOOK! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID EHRENSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you've spent any amount of time in a bookstore lately, you've probably done 
a doubletake over the cover of David Sedaris' "Barrel Fever." You know the one: 
two '50s-era, fedora-topped businessmen with their tongues sticking out. 
Guaranteed to stop even the most hurried of shoppers dead in their tracks, it's 
a devilishly clever purchase-inducement ploy. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is that?" the shopper's inner voice can't help but ask as his/her hand 
finds itself moving irresistibly to pick "Barrel Fever" off the shelf. And as 
any sales expert will tell you, getting that hand to move is half the battle -- 
particularly with a book like this one. A collection of wackily irreverent, 
Donald Barthelme-style tales of the absurd, frequently featuring a gay sexual 
slant (the narrator of one story discusses his love affairs with actor 
Sylvester Stallone and boxer Mike Tyson), "Barrel Fever" isn't the sort of item 
likely to get much attention in today's competitive, nonfiction-powered 
marketplace. But how can you ignore a book that's sticking its' tongue out at 
you? 
</P>
<P>
 "The cover reflects the spirit of the stories themselves: completely wild," 
says Steve Snider, an art director at Little, Brown & Co. who designed the dust 
jacket and chose the photographs. Chose the photographs; because the 
tongue-wagging, white-collared duo weren't specially posed for this cover but 
culled from a book of stock photographs purchased by Little, Brown's art 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 Consisting of blandly generic images (landscapes, skylines, household items, 
office furnishings and models posed in scenes meant to typify activities in 
various settings) stock photographs are generally used for advertisements, 
calendars and reference books. More creative art directors have used stock 
images to create surrealistic collages of the sort found on some of the more 
elaborately appointed rock music album covers of the pre-CD era. Put a photo of 
smiling housewife holding a layer cake in front of a shot of an atomic 
explosion and voila -- instant social comment. The "Barrel Fever" tongue boys, 
however, don't need to be juxtaposed with anything to create an effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Art direction, like everything else, responds to the whim of fashion, so 
there's no telling just how long the stock boom will last. But according to 
Snider there are always new worlds to conquer when it comes to book cover 
design. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that spines are the next frontier. Often times the way books are 
displayed in stores the spines are all you can see. Take a look at the spines 
the next time you're in a store. We're just starting to think about how to use 
them. Spines are the future!"

15TH ANNUAL LOS ANGELES TIMES BOOK PRIZES; THE ROBERT KIRSCH AWARD / GIVEN FOR 
A BODY OF WORK BY A WRITER LIVING IN OR WRITING ON THE AMERICAN WEST ; WINNER: 
BRIAN MOORE; THE EPIPHANIES OF LOVE AND LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK MILES, Jack Miles is the director of the Los Angeles Times Book Prizes 
and a Times editorial writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The anonymous judge for the Robert Kirsch Award noted that among the many 
distinguished authors living in or writing about the American West, there is 
"only one inescapable candidate" for The Times' highest literary honor -- Brian 
Moore. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore, a resident of Malibu since shortly after World War II, is certainly the 
most distinguished novelist living on the West Coast of the United States, 
although his reputation is international. In fact, the judge noted, Moore is 
"like the prophet without honor in his own country," celebrated with many 
literary prizes in England, Canada and his native Ireland, but never here. 
</P>
<P>
 From his first novel, "The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne," which developed 
the cult status among British students that "Catcher in the Rye" did in the 
United States, the judge observed that he has had a loyal and discerning 
following that reaches beyond the reputation of being "a novelist's novelist" 
by which he is also known. 
</P>
<P>
 Though none of his 18 novels is quite like any of the others, he writes for 
the most part in a traditional novelistic manner; the judge offered a 
comparison to author Graham Greene, whose work Moore admires and who in turn 
designated Moore as the contemporary novelist he most admired. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like Greene," the Kirsch judge commented, "Moore has written novels of the 
kind Greene called his 'entertainments' -- serious thrillers which in Moore's 
case even more than in Greene's have a marked psychological and moral interest 
-- though the bulk of his fiction, like Greene's, is concerned with the most 
profound and reverberating moral questions, such as the dilemmas of Catholic 
faith, of the uniquely isolated individual in a hostile society, of passionate 
but unrequited love. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I think of the problem of the serious writer in our time, who works in 
the shadow of mass catastrophes that threaten to overwhelm the imagination, I 
think of Moore and his ability to find a context and a scale for the individual 
life through which he can engage the great questions of politics, faith, and 
conscience, and I am grateful that he lives among us." 
</P>
<P>
 Moore's Judith Hearne is a literary triumph of a very rare sort, for she is 
the sort of woman in whom virtually no man -- and no male writer -- would take 
an interest. (Her failure with men is, in fact, one of the themes of the book.) 
The challenge of drawing a believable character of the opposite sex is one of 
the largest any novelist faces. Male novelists usually overcome it by creating 
a larger-than-life spectacle of a woman or, if the woman must be ordinary, 
moving her through a set of extraordinary events. In this novel, Moore makes 
Judith compelling without resorting to either of those ploys. 
</P>
<P>
 In several of Moore's novels, including "I Am Mary Dunne," "The Doctor's Wife" 
and "The Temptation of Eileen Hughes," his fascination with the kind of woman 
who holds up half of heaven but rarely merits literary attention returns to the 
fore. Married or not, the Moore heroine is the little woman, small because she 
has never been allowed to grow; but he notices her with a kind of love, as an 
attentive teacher might notice a child sitting a bit too quietly in the corner. 
She interests him in the very plainness of her character. He draws her out and 
makes us interested in her without ever tricking her out in quirky 
characterological adornment. There is something, finally, quite dazzling about 
this feat. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Moore is a Northern Irish ex-Catholic who has spoken gratefully of the 
upper-class Protestant family who opened to him the larger world of English 
literature and secular British culture. He eventually left the British Isles 
for, initially, Canada (he remains a Canadian citizen) and then the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 But rather than a migration from one country to the next, this movement has 
been a concentric enlargement with Belfast ever at its center. Quite literally, 
Moore divides his time among the several countries to which he owes some 
emotional allegiance, among which France -- as for so many Irish intellectuals 
-- must also be numbered. If he is not in flight, he may be said to be in a 
particular kind of exile, taking his place in the history of distinguished 
European writers who for personal or political reasons chose to live at this 
far western edge of the western world. Among the recognizable varieties of 
California writer, the European in exile is unquestionably one. 
</P>
<P>
 The late Graham Greene, an Englishman who was in spiritual and often enough 
physical exile from England for much of his life, had something in common with 
Moore. Greene fled from England toward (if not quite to) the Church, Moore from 
the Church toward (if not quite to) England. Each stalled a bit short of his 
destination, and in the no-man's-land between belief and unbelief and between 
the British Isles and Everywhere Else they have been fellow travelers. 
"Greeneland," as critics eventually called it, was the generic Third World 
outpost where the inadequacies -- above all the spiritual inadequacies -- of 
the First World could be seen stripped of the bright costume that concealed 
them back home. "Mooritania," as we might call it, overlaps with Greeneland, 
notably in Moore's most recent novel, "No Other Life," which is set in a place 
very like Haiti. But Moore's Ireland, post-colonial and as seedy and corrupt as 
any tropical venue, offers in its way all that Haiti offers. 
</P>
<P>
 A priest in any of these settings is an interesting character, a failed or 
spoiled priest often the most interesting character of all. As something of a 
failed or spoiled priest myself, I am not above being a bit touchy about 
fictional versions of the type. But what troubles all us believers or 
near-believers or former believers or nostalgic unbelief-refusers about 
"blasphemous" fiction is never the blasphemy proper. There is, if anything, 
something off-putting about the writer who fancies he has shocked you when he 
hasn't come close. It is rather the pretension one trips over all too often 
that art or story-telling or, God help us, film-making is somehow ultimate and 
therefore sacred. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Greene nor Moore ever wraps himself in those flowing robes, but of the 
two it is Moore who has always seemed to me to have the greater self-conscious 
control of the issue. Moore's "The Mangan Inheritance" is, for me, the ultimate 
ruination of the sacred untruth that the writer is not as other men. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, a brief word on style. Partly because of his penchant for failed 
characters (success, he once told an interviewer, dilutes character, failure 
distills it) and for characters without rich resources of culture or education, 
Moore's style is sometimes quite plain. He writes, so to speak, close to his 
characters' impoverished bone. But once in a great while, he steps outside his 
always meticulously constructed narrative and allows himself a passage of rich, 
lyrical description. These passages are always few, they always leave the 
reader crying for more. Like Shakespeare's songs, they become an element in the 
suspense: never guaranteed but always possible and always a delight when 
provided. One looks back on them with pleasure and forward to them with hope. 
</P>
<P>
 Let that appreciative and expectant mood stand in lieu of any more searching 
characterization of the body of work for which, at 73, Brian Moore receives 
this award. The Kirsch Award judge called himself "grateful" that Moore lives 
among us. A good enough word, but the position that most of Moore's readers 
assume when they think about him is not, I suspect, the abashed and dutiful 
posture of the indebted but the cockier, slightly self-congratulatory pose of 
the lucky. For those fortunate enough to have found their way to him, Brian 
Moore is a wonderful piece of luck.

15TH ANNUAL LOS ANGELES TIMES BOOK PRIZES; WINNER: DAVID MALOUF 'REMEMBERING 
BABYLON'; THE TOWER OF BABBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNETTE SMITH, Annette Smith, a fiction prize judge, is a professor at 
Caltech. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One day, in the middle of the last century, when white settlement was 
crawling, tentatively, up the coast of Queensland, three children were stopped 
in their games by the sight of a strange "thing" in the nearby swamps: perhaps 
"a human that in the manner of the tales they told one another . . . had been 
changed into a bird, but only halfway, and now, neither one thing nor the 
other, was hopping and flapping towards them out of a world . . . that was the 
abode of everything savage and fearsome . . . and of all that belonged to the 
Absolute Dark." 
</P>
<P>
 What they had taken for a lone aborigine raider turns out to be Gemmy Fairly, 
a "black white" with hair as blond as theirs. As the creature stands, 
scarecrow-like at the top of the boundary fence, facing a toy gun, he shouts 
"Do not shoot. . . . I am a B-b-british object!" One mark of a great novel, it 
might be said, is that its totality be already contained in its first few 
paragraphs, and such is certainly the case for "Remembering Babylon," this 
year's winner of the Los Angeles Times Fiction Prize. In its first two pages 
alone, one understands that the book will be about boundaries, about 
encountering the Other, about metamorphosis and (through Gemmy Fairly's 
unwittingly accurate statement) about language. 
</P>
<P>
 David Malouf begins with this primal scene of the boundary fence -- a fragile 
line between the white settlers and a continent so vast that the silence, when 
the hissing of the lamp dies out, engulfs them in the unknown. His simple plot 
covers the two years spent by Gemmy with the white Scottish community 
(following 16 spent with the aborigines), the various responses to him (from 
total acceptance to total rejection and nuances in between), the subtle changes 
in relationships precipitated by his presence, and finally his mysterious 
disappearance and a postcript reuniting two of the main protagonists, many 
years older and wiser. This plot, which resembles the story of Francois 
Truffaut's "Wild Child" and of Alfred Kroeber's Ishi in "Two Worlds," is a 
recurrent one in Malouf's work, testifying to his fascination with otherness 
and transformation. An Australian poet and novelist, he has previously 
published a fictionalized biography of Ovid, "An Imaginary Life," in which Ovid 
befriends a wild child who, later during his exile in a decaying, rust-brown 
port town, will seem to him like a messenger, possibly a god. 
</P>
<P>
 With Gemmy as a catalyst, many boundaries are redefined in "Remembering 
Babylon," particularly those between races. The anti-colonial and racial themes 
are handled with a concern for historical and individual complexity. The 
ghostlike aborigines looming outside the limits of the settlement constantly 
remind us that the whites are encroaching onto native territory. Nevertheless, 
Malouf legitimizes the settlers' claim to a land disputed foot by foot to the 
wilderness and empathizes with their need to cling to the only identity they 
know. If Gemmy, "this mixture of monstrous strangeness and unwelcome likeness," 
has changed his identity, not to mention skin color and (due to eroded teeth) 
face structure, "could you lose it? Not just language, but it. It." The very 
vagueness of the pronoun connotes the essential nature of that "it." 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, Malouf's plea for tolerance goes beyond the racial context. While 
he finely satirizes empire builders in the person of Governor Lord Bowen and 
vividly evokes the hostility against Gemmy rampant in part of the community, he 
shows that Gemmy, as a rat-catcher's slave-boy in London, was indeed a "British 
object" long before his adoption by a native clan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Babylon in the title evokes therefore not only a parallel between the 
Israelites' captivity after the fall of Jerusalem and the colonists' nostalgia 
and isolation, but also the Tower of Babel, biblical site of the separation of 
languages and nations. Malouf's novel testifies all along to the confusion of 
languages. It demonstrates the demonic nature of words, both their inadequacy 
and destructive power and their creative ones, as Gemmy's past and his new 
identity take form, however spuriously, on records kept by a minister and 
schoolmaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Professors of literature and writers will, perhaps, read in this chapter not 
only an allegory of literature but also an allegory of the passage from oral to 
written culture, as Gemmy sniffs the sheets of paper on which his life has been 
inscribed. Finally, Malouf's prose itself provides a subtle allegory on the 
separation of languages, for its ceremonial, slightly rugged unfolding seems to 
echo faintly some ancient biblical language that would have been lost forever 
with the Babel episode. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the tale, as suddenly as he has appeared, Gemmy walks away from 
the uncomfortable niche his goodwill and that of others had won him in the 
group and takes to the bush. We are not told exactly why. Nor shall we know for 
sure when and how he died, probably the victim of a minor colonial raid on 
Bushmen; nor which bones are the white ones amid the remains his friend Lachlan 
finds, several years later, in the forks of trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the novel is elating, rather than depressing. Its final message is that 
men are capable of change and that even an imperfect change is better than 
none. Malouf wrote somewhere that "poems are acts of reconciliation." So, in a 
different way, is "Remembering Babylon." For we are linked to the Other in 
order to exist ourselves, and the gesture that gives is always the gesture that 
seeks. LOS ANGELES TIMES BOOK PRIZES / FICTION: Nominees

IT'S IN THE STARS; THE ONLY WAY TO FIND FRESHER SEAFOOD IS TO CATCH IT 
YOURSELF.

<P>
 Reporting back from Barcelona, my friend Amparo had me groaning on the phone 
as she described what she'd eaten the night before: fat, salt-cured anchovies, 
rice stained black with tiny cuttlefish, sweet-fleshed langoustines smeared 
with aioli, and giant Costa Brava shrimp, cooked in seawater and immediately 
plunged into ice to stop the cooking. Hungry for the taste of those shrimp, but 
unable to jump on the next flight for Spain, I headed for Ocean Star Restaurant 
in Monterey Park to feast on fresh (and I mean fresh) seafood. Actually, there 
are two Ocean Stars: the mega Hong Kong-style dim sum and banquet palace on 
Atlantic Boulevard and the much smaller original place a couple of blocks away, 
where the cooking is more home-style. And where, for just $20 a pound, you can 
eat your fill of superb steamed shrimp. And for every pound of shrimp you buy, 
you get one pound free. 
</P>
<P>
 At the more modest Ocean Star, incense smudges the air just outside the 
kitchen door. In the far corner, vague shapes swim in the aquariums. We already 
know what we want: live shrimp and a live whole fish, both simply steamed. Our 
waiter shakes his head regretfully. He has neither. But he has fish arriving in 
about an hour. "Some squid first? Duck tongues?" he asks. We'll try it. He's 
back in a few minutes with a platter that's half spicy squid, half deep-fried 
duck tongues, both presented with a dipping sauce of soy, chiles and slivered 
scallions. Tender, pale gold squid tantalizes with its heat. We soon have a 
small pile of delicate spade-shaped bones from the tongues piled on our plates, 
but we can't finish. This is a dish that's more about texture than taste. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as the waiter is ladling out bowls of the special baby chicken soup, a 
truck backs close to the entrance, and he rushes to help unload live fish and 
shrimp from big tanks.  
</P>
<P>
 As we finish the last spoonfuls of the rich chicken stock laced with bits of 
ruddy ham, he comes back to the table with two live black rock cod in a net. 
Yes, we'd like these fellows steamed with ginger and scallions. Then he's back 
again, this time waving two live lobsters. We order one as sashimi, the other 
stir-fried in the shell. And a steamed chicken. 
</P>
<P>
 When the huge platter of shrimp arrives, every one of the shellfish is loaded 
with roe. We tear off the heads and pull away the shells, biting into the 
sticky red roe. The shrimp is so sweet, so enticing in its variations of 
texture and flavor that the dipping sauce is almost superfluous. That's the 
genius of Cantonese cooking: to present a product so fresh, you can taste every 
nuance. Savoring each shrimp, I am a happy woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Next time, however, I'll pass on the lobster sashimi; the raw shellfish just 
isn't that interesting. But lobster cut into large pieces and stir-fried with 
ginger and green scallions is a lavish contrast to the shrimp. The steamed 
chicken is wonderful, too, the velvety plain chicken played against coins of 
salty Chinese ham, mushrooms and slightly bitter Chinese broccoli.  
</P>
<P>
 We eagerly take our chopsticks to the steamed black cod, presented whole, its 
flesh custardy near the bone, showered with scallions and ginger and served in 
light soy sauce. It is perfect in its understated simplicity. 
</P>
<P>
 This is an experience that can't be repeated too soon. A couple of weeks 
later, we round up a few eager eaters for another expedition. This time we try 
the bigger Ocean Star because it's running a special: for every pound of live 
shrimp ($18), one squab. The place is huge, a sea of tables where eight, 10, 12 
are seated, the Lazy Susans weighed down with every manner of seafood. It's 
loud and chaotic, but there's something very comforting about a space filled 
with so many people intent on eating. A Chinese American friend's children, 5 
and 10, pull out their homework as we wait for our first dishes: a platter of 
jellyfish and roasted pig. 
</P>
<P>
 I love the West Lake soup of hand-minced beef, scallions, cilantro and egg 
whites stirred into a heady cornstarch-thickened  
</P>
<P>
 stock. We snatch up the spicy squid bright with slivered red chile. We have 
the live shrimp again, of course, and scallops in the shell with black beans. 
</P>
<P>
 We order too much food: golden ping-pong balls of hand-chopped shrimp; pale 
green winter melon stuffed with dried shrimp, shredded dried scallops and black 
mushrooms in a rich sauce; a seasonal assorted seafood dish from Zhongshan with 
chopped asparagus, squid, shrimp and mushrooms, scattered with crunchy pickled 
radish and peanuts. All good -- but none of it is as soul satisfying as the 
plain, steamed seafood. I could eat at the little Ocean Star just about once a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean Star Restaurant: 112 N. Chandler Ave., (818) 300-8446 (dinner only), and 
145 N. Atlantic Blvd., (818) 308-2128, both in Monterey Park. Parking lot. 
Smoking permitted at both locations. Dinner for two, food only, $21-$150.

15TH ANNUAL LOS ANGELES TIMES BOOK PRIZES; WINNER: MIKAL GILMORE 'SHOT IN THE 
HEART'; A FIDELITY BORN IN BLOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM CLARK, Tom Clark, a biography prize judge, is the author of The Exile of 
Celine (Random House).

<TEXT>
<P>
 The problem of socio-pathology is a mask placed by an administered society 
over a much more ancient mystery, the problem of evil: its recurrent 
manifestations, its apparently deep sources in human nature, the trail of waste 
and ruin it leaves in its wake. Does evil run in families as a blood taint, a 
genetic fate that overwhelms the individual soul lost like a leaf on the 
current of its uncontrollable compulsion to manifest itself? Or is it something 
society does to a person, the legacy not of blood but of life in the world? 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that the answers to such ponderous questions are as impossibly 
elusive and bewildering as life itself does not make the earnest pursuit of 
them any the less pertinent, of course; and that's more than ever true in a 
time when the specter of evil stares back at us through the eyes of every 
spur-of-the-moment killer as news images -- or from the eyes of the imagined 
victims who peer warily at us from our mirrors, armed with such distrust and 
apprehension. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikal Gilmore's haunting, arresting family history is a serious, painstaking 
and painful meditation on the sources of evil, all the more unsettling because 
its investigation takes place not in the clean, well-lighted safety zone of 
social ideology but in the tawdry fields of America's waste places, where 
Gilmore finds seeds of destruction and mayhem that issue in the spilled blood 
of his own brothers -- one a murderer executed by firing squad, one the victim 
of a fatal stabbing, one a sad defeated drifter on mean streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The notoriety of the second-born Gilmore sibling, Gary, who in 1976 
senselessly killed two young Mormon men and then demanded to be executed, thus 
becoming the first man to be legally executed in America in over a decade, 
provides the obvious commercial hook for "Shot in the Heart." Gary's last days 
on Utah's Death Row in the fall of 1977 were as glaring a public sensation in 
their epoch as the ordeal of O. J. Simpson is in ours. (A subsequent Norman 
Mailer book and Tommy Lee Jones movie made the Gilmore case even more of a 
cause celebre, while the first shock wave of the punk rock explosion produced 
"Gary Gilmore's Eyes," turning the killer's steely gaze -- and his view of the 
"normal" world from the other side of a murderous pathology -- into a neo-noir 
icon of alienation and despair.) 
</P>
<P>
 But Mikal, youngest of the four Gilmore brothers and the sole survivor enabled 
to tell their grim tale, digs beneath the disposable headlines. His harrowing 
"inside" version of the Gary Gilmore story transforms the hyped-up, 
pseudo-mythic media image of the "natural born killer" back into something as 
disturbingly human as our worst nightmares -- or our problematic daytime 
present. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracing the roots of Gary Gilmore's violent fate in his family's dysfunction, 
Mikal speculates that Gary's demand for his own death may have been guided by a 
morbid craving for retribution inculcated in the Gilmore boys by their doomy 
mother -- a spooky eccentric who subscribed to the reality of ghosts, preached 
a warped version of the Mormon concept of blood atonement and deceived her sons 
into believing her own father had made her watch a hanging. 
</P>
<P>
 But as unbalanced as the mother appears here, and as psychically maimed as her 
sons turn out, at the true heart of this memoir of family disintegration stands 
the complex, largely mysterious figure of the father. Frank Gilmore Sr., an 
itinerant grifter and denizen of dead-end America who dragged his family around 
the dingy urban margins of the West, took out his rage at life on his wife and 
three eldest sons. Only Mikal, born nearly 10 years later than his siblings, 
when his father had dwindled to a worn-out old man, was spared Frank Sr.'s 
savage beatings. In describing his own angry rejection of the compulsory 
violent branding whose "indelible signs" had marked his brothers for life, 
Mikal honestly admits to feeling more than a trace of guilt at having been left 
out of that "fidelity born of blood," which bound the other male Gilmores in a 
destructive mutual stranglehold with the world and with each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikal's search here for the pivotal instance of his family's tragedy -- the 
"moment in this story when everything went wrong" -- leads him back to the 
family's stay in '50s Portland, a time in which, as a teen-age rebel, his 
brother Gary conceived the "ideal of badness," which to him "would always 
remain a guiding ethos." 
</P>
<P>
 The convicted killer, asked on Death Row to name an early event he regarded as 
fateful, had recounted a curious episode from his troubled adolescence: 
Attempting to take a shortcut from school, he had got caught in a dense thicket 
of brier bushes that loomed on a hillside behind the family house. Gary claimed 
that this seemingly trivial episode represented the point at which he had 
learned to conquer fear by overcoming himself. Mikal, looking deeper, discovers 
in this incident not the comic-book anti-heroism Gary had pretended but a truth 
of cultural as well as personal dimension. In those claustrophobic brambles, 
Mikal proposes, Gary received his first knowledge of how "to kill or silence 
the part of himself that needed to cry out in fear or pain." Returning to the 
family homestead years later, the writer finds the whole old neighborhood 
replaced by a sprawling industrial "strip of wasteland" -- the image of its 
sordid vacuity reinforcing the moral desolation this anecdote reflects. 
</P>
<P>
 It is in such bleak but eerily moving moments of interiorized location that 
Gilmore's book accumulates real power, as he dowses the West's lost places for 
America's lonely heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Epiphanic details reveal the subterranean ground of the Gilmore family 
history, and at the same time a dark-underside sector of the collective 
national psyche that's both burial ground and awful birthplace. Gilmore's 
memory-excavation, for example, of the "dead city," an obscure subterranean 
necropolis conjured by his youthful imagination under Seattle's Queen Anne 
Hill, is a piece of psychosocial archeology that's both telling and chilling: 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember one place in particular where we lived in Seattle. It was set back 
off the sidewalk about two hundred feet -- a dark old house poised on top of a 
large, trestle-style wooden framework. To get from the sidewalk to the front 
door, you had to cross a half-rotten wooden bridge that had a few planks 
missing. Beneath the bridge was nothing but a jungle of briers and weeds. . . . 
According to my father, in the early twentieth century there had been a massive 
fire that had half-leveled many of Seattle's homes. When the area was rebuilt, 
he said, a false ground was raised over several of the collapsed homes. In 
other words, there was a dead city buried under the part of town we lived in. 
Some people even thought that some of the old houses still survived there. Down 
in that web of thorns and bushes beneath our house, my father told me, were the 
remnants of another house. Sometimes I'd stand on the bridge and look down into 
that moat of undergrowth, and I'd imagine the skeleton of the other house down 
there. I would wonder if it was still full of the skeletons of the people who 
had once lived in it. Every time I saw a rustle in that underbrush, it gave me 
a chill. I didn't dream well in that house, but that was nothing new." 
</P>
<P>
 Toting up the sad balance of damage in his family, Mikal's own most compelling 
concern is understandably the exorcism of personal demons. Ours is something 
else again. The peculiar resonance of Gilmore's story lies not in the images of 
violence before which we are reduced to voyeuristic spectators, transfixed, 
ashamed and unable to turn away, but in the generalized attitudes they reflect, 
the existential anomie, emotional estrangement and utter moral emptiness that 
unfortunately typify this society at large as it uneasily turns the corner into 
a frightening millennium. Gary's "ideal of badness" might well stand as an 
ironic, prophetic emblem of the American dream in its inverted contemporary 
mutation, the favored stance of youth in a time when to be "bad" is seemingly 
the highest good. LOS ANGELES TIMES BOOK PRIZES / BIOGRAPHY: Nominees

THEATER NOTES; OVATION AWARDS BY THE NUMBERS

 Charlton Heston, Alfre Woo dard, Leonard Nimoy, Rue McClanahan, Mariette Hart 
ley, Ray Bradbury, Bruce Davison -- they're all slated to present Ovation 
Awards on Monday night at the Alex Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 But what might not be acknowledged Monday is that a few of the final decisions 
in this process -- the first peer-judged competitive theater awards to cover 
most of Los Angeles County -- will have been judged by a very small number of 
peers. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighty-two voters turned in score cards on shows during the preliminary round 
of voting, which resulted in the nominations announced a month ago. But during 
the final balloting, in an effort to ensure scrupulous fairness, only those 
voters who had seen all five nominees within a given category were allowed to 
vote in that category. (A computer knew who saw what, because voters turned in 
score cards on each registered show they saw.) 
</P>
<P>
 In one category, no one saw all five nominees -- so no one voted in the final 
round. In that case, the computer chose the winner based on the raw scores 
turned in during the first round. In "four or five" categories (out of 24), 
there were five or fewer voters in the final round, said Bill Freimuth, 
executive director of Theatre LA, which sponsors the Ovations. Freimuth 
wouldn't identify the categories or voters. 
</P>
<P>
 This means a few voters had a lot of power. "But they weren't told they had 
that power," Freimuth said. There will be no ties -- in the event of a tie, the 
computer breaks it by using the initial raw scores. 
</P>
<P>
 A pool of 70 voters, including some new participants, has already begun 
judging for the 1995 awards. Any voter who saw fewer than 25 shows last year 
was dropped from the voter list, so Freimuth is optimistic that voters will see 
more of the shows in the next go-round. However, there probably will be more to 
see -- so far, 48 shows have registered for the 1995 awards. Last year at this 
time, only 22 had. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony Monday is designed as a splashy Tony-like affair. Eventually, 
Theatre LA hopes the event will be televised, like the Tonys. But this year 
there is at least one advantage in not having to fill a Tony-like TV time slot 
-- acceptance speeches will not be cut off by the orchestra after a few 
seconds, as they have been at recent Tony ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
 Or is that a disadvantage? 
</P>
<P>
 Excerpts from seven or eight of the 10 shows nominated for best musical (in 
separate larger and smaller categories) will be presented at the Alex. The 
definite no-shows in that regard are "Sunset Boulevard" (which is otherwise 
occupied with a New York opening Thursday) and "Falsettos." The stakes are 
higher in the smaller musical category than any other, because the winner will 
receive $1,000 in honor of the late Franklin R. Levy, who often produced small 
musicals in L.A. The money was donated by Levy's friends and family. The other 
winners will receive nothing but statuettes. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony will be followed by a party in the lobbies and forecourt of the 
Alex. The whole event will cost Theatre LA approximately $30,000. The hall, 
most of the food, much of the labor and the accounting services of KPMG 
Peat-Marwick were donated.*

15TH ANNUAL LOS ANGELES TIMES BOOK PRIZES; WINNER: HENRY KISSINGER 'DIPLOMACY'; 
THE SORCERY OF STATECRAFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK BURBY, A current interest book prize judge, Burby is a former Times 
editorial writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Henry Kissinger's most recent book, "Diplomacy," is the perfect gift for a 
rich nation that seems to have everything. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything, Kissinger argues persuasively, except a foreign policy free of 
perpetually conflicting ideologies. On one side stand defenders of a nation's 
right to use its power wisely; on the other, those who view America's primary 
diplomatic mission to be sowing democracy as widely as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 A concept called "the balance of power" makes room for both perspectives. 
Kissinger sees it as an idea whose time has come again with the end of the Cold 
War rearranging national power on a historically unprecedented global scale. 
</P>
<P>
 From Kissinger's disciplined eyes, our foreign policy must resemble the 
negotiations of those weekend bicyclers who weave through suburban streets as 
though they have been vaccinated against cars. He does not accept the excuse 
that other countries are even less cautious. 
</P>
<P>
 So he has fashioned a stunning 900-page handbook on shaping and executing 
foreign policy based on his own half-century of analyzing and practicing 
statecraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Massive but not ponderous, "Diplomacy" swarms with leaders groping through 
three centuries of war for formulas that would give peace a better chance. 
</P>
<P>
 A Kissinger trademark is the sardonic aside he throws into a heavy discussion 
of foreign affairs. "There is in every great leader an element of guile," is 
one such and it could apply to any of the leaders that march through these 
pages -- Richelieu, William of Orange, Bismarck, and his favorite, Metternich. 
</P>
<P>
 But it appears here as a direct reference to Franklin D. Roosevelt's 
remarkable effort in the late 1930s to keep edging the United States toward 
readiness for what F.D.R. knew would be its inevitable plunge into World War 
II. He writes: 
</P>
<P>
 "It is difficult to imagine any contemporary of Roosevelt -- of either 
political party -- who, having had the courage and foresight to recognize the 
challenge, would have had the willpower to lead his isolationist people, step 
by step, toward the commitment to do whatever was necessary to defeat Nazi 
Germany. . . . The wisdom of his solitary passage is now, quite simply taken 
for granted." 
</P>
<P>
 No leader in Kissinger's pantheon gets higher marks. Why? That Roosevelt got 
it right would be reason enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Attention to detail ranks high on Kissinger's list of wise foreign policy 
principles. So does seeing things as they are rather than as they should be. So 
does smiling confidence and one's choice of allies. So does winning. 
</P>
<P>
 Kissinger is no more comfortable now than ever with the Wilsonian concept -- 
still very much alive -- that every skirmish is part of a crusade in the cause 
of democratic enlightenment. 
</P>
<P>
 Having right as well as might on one's side is better than Bismarck's or 
Richelieu's notion that might is enough. 
</P>
<P>
 But being right without might isn't enough, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Another dazzling moment in U.S. diplomatic history is the "long telegram" that 
George Kennan sent from Moscow in 1946 that was gradually written -- or, as 
Kennan believes, rewritten -- into the policy of containment and the nuclear 
standoff between the United States and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennan's waiting game worked. Moscow collapsed. But the strain on the United 
States took its own toll. Debate over the policy "turned into a struggle for 
the very soul of America," as Kissinger puts it. 
</P>
<P>
 Containment began to go sour in Korea where the United States found itself in 
"a limited war for which it had no doctrine and in defense of a country for 
which it had no strategic interest." 
</P>
<P>
 But it collapsed in Vietnam where the "almost causal relationship the nation 
had always enjoyed between its values and its achievements began to fray." 
</P>
<P>
 The basic problem, he says, was that "Nobody asked the important questions 
about" escalation in Vietnam: "Was it really true . . . that every communist 
gain hurt? . . . (W)as it conceivable that the addition of Indochina to the 
Communist camp could by itself overthrow the balance of power?" 
</P>
<P>
 Kissinger made three trips to Vietnam as a consultant in 1965 and 1966. As he 
has written before, the visits "convinced me that the war could not be won by 
the prevailing strategy, and that America would need to extricate itself by 
negotiating with Hanoi. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Hanoi knew that, too, and while he covers in detail the Nixon Administration's 
efforts to prevail, the important lesson for the future is that strategic 
miscalculations made Vietnam a hopeless cause. Kissinger wants a formula that 
will avoid future Vietnams, as do we all. 
</P>
<P>
 Carefully nurtured, he thinks, a balance of power similar to the one achieved 
in 1815 by the alliance of Great Britain, Austria, Russia, and eventually 
France, is America's best bet. 
</P>
<P>
 The alliance that emerged from the Congress of Vienna worked because its 
combined military power created a balance to any possible combination of 
competitors and because the member nations shared a value system. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite America's historic aversion to the balance of powers, Kissinger says, 
the 19th-Century concept can and should be adapted to the new world emerging 
from the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 "Though a military superpower," he writes, "America can no longer impose its 
will because neither its (largely nuclear) power nor its ideology lends itself 
to imperial ambitions. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Finding the right allies -- allies who share America's values -- would be a 
diplomatic task for the United States as formidable as either Kissinger or his 
new book. But it's a task that Kissinger inspires us to begin in this important 
book. LOS ANGELES TIMES BOOK PRIZES / CURRENT INTEREST: Nominees

15TH ANNUAL LOS ANGELES TIMES BOOK PRIZES; WINNER: MARTIN M. SIMECKA 'THE YEAR 
OF THE FROG'; A SLOVAK PRINCE IN CHECK 
</P>

 "The Year of the Frog" endears itself to one's soul, for that is what Martin 
Simecka's remarkable first novel is about. As an immediately engaging trio of 
novellas, Simecka's work was first circulated clandestinely during the 1980s in 
the Slovak literary underground or samizdat. We owe its arrival in the West to 
the championing efforts of Czech President Vaclav Havel, who first helped the 
book to win the Pegasus Prize for Literature, and who wrote a brief foreword to 
the excellent English translation by Peter Petro. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first section, "Notice," 21-year-old Milan quits his job in a factory 
and gets himself hired as an orderly in the neurology ward of a Bratislava 
hospital. Nothing ordinary seems to happen; patients die in his arms; he 
witnesses brain surgery without knowing what to expect; he achieves a strange 
and brief but deeply nourishing kind of intimacy with the strangers whose 
draped bodies he wheels through the dim corridors. An intellectual with little 
use for either his culture or for his deep habit of wonder, Milan is however 
passionately caught up in a highly carnal romance with Tania, his very dream of 
a woman. Seriously athletic, Milan is also liable to be overwhelmed by the joy 
of a new pair of running shoes; he runs for hours through the streets of his 
native Bratislava just to take his mind off his country's political hell. For 
as the affliction of Communism tightens its grip, the host organism called 
Czechoslovakia itself seems scheduled for some radical surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Simecka adds to these somewhat exotic, yet somehow familiar, ingredients a 
particular autobiographical savor. His father having been imprisoned by the 
Communist authorities for "political" activities, the young Milan can never 
hope to be admitted to the university. Like the author for part of his life, 
Milan is thus forced to choose between menial jobs and slabs of time "stolen" 
from the State in which he doesn't work at all. Neither mode can make him 
happy. Yet what enlivens this novel on every page are the brief flashes of wise 
humor, the ironic twists sculpted by the lively mind from the most unpromising 
of circumstances. Milan probes his own purposes even as he watches a surgeon's 
knife expose the human brain so as to heal it; while Simecka himself charms the 
reader by a similar pattern of daring leaps and plunges of doubt: 
</P>
<P>
 "How should I know what goes on inside a woman? Nature forms her in her image, 
and I just watch in astonishment. We look at women, build homes for them, play 
and sing for them, create household inventions for them, force them to work, 
divide them into states, and keep them in fear that one day we'll get tired of 
it and wreck it all. Because we mourn our own purposelessness. And what does it 
matter if I'm wrong?" 
</P>
<P>
 The middle section of the novel takes us back three years to the beginning of 
Milan and Tania's relationship, when her mere proximity would inflame him 
almost unbearably. Yet the sudden injustices of his father's arrest and the 
crib death of a friend's infant child drive Milan's thoughts deeper into the 
linkage of life's blessings and curses. 
</P>
<P>
 Milan finds himself, during one of his exuberant runs through Bratislava's 
Mountain Park, on a stretch of road covered with thousands of tiny frogs, 
jumping even as he can't stop running over them. "They were popping under my 
shoes like tiny balloons," he notes with fascinated horror, and the mixture of 
his own feelings at that moment captures his conjoined awe and cynicism before 
life, thus giving both this section and Simecka's novel its title. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gin," the third and final panel, takes us back still further in time to Milan 
and Tania's first meeting, and also forward, to a period of difficulty in their 
marriage. The recollection of the recent past under Communism, when Slovakia 
was less than half a country and the efforts of individual souls to remember 
who they were cost so much, gives this remarkable first novel its own 
historical significance. Indeed, this new author has already read by invitation 
from "The Year of the Frog" at the Library of Congress. With precisely that 
balance of humor, insight and suspicion most valued by the namesake of the Art 
Seidenbaum Award, Martin Simecka makes a welcome and auspicious entrance onto 
literature's world stage. LOS ANGELES TIMES BOOK PRIZES / ART SEIDENBAUM AWARD

ON THE RECORD: A MIXED BAG OF PRECOCIOUS FIDDLERS

<P>
 The sheer quantity of super-accomplished, audience-attracting young violinists 
from which an impresario can choose today defies the wildest imaginings of 
anyone in a similar position a quarter-century ago. Or is it that we weren't on 
the lookout for them then, dominated as that distant age was by pianists? 
</P>
<P>
 Among recent recorded releases by these young whizzes, none of whom has as yet 
reached age 30 (will you still need me? will you still feed me?) consider the 
following . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Is it surprising that everyone, particularly the youngsters, is discovering 
the 1940 (revised 1948) Violin Concerto of Samuel Barber, the most lusciously 
overripe creation with which a Romantically inclined virtuoso was ever blessed? 
And since it was written in what is loosely regarded as "our own time," claims 
to doing one's duty by modern repertory can be made by all concerned without 
subjecting an audience to any alienating modernism in the music itself. 
</P>
<P>
 But we are hardly here to bury Barber, rather to praise and admire him for 
having possessed the lyric gift that either eluded or was disdained by his 
contemporaries, and to admire 23-year-old Gil Shaham for his natural, engaging 
way with the piece and the eloquent partnering of conductor Andre Previn here 
and in its present companion piece, the 1945 Concerto of Erich Wolfgang 
Korngold, the constitution of which is stickily, rather than endearingly, sweet 
(Deutsche Grammophon 439 886). 
</P>
<P>
 In the Barber Concerto Previn wraps his orchestra, the London Symphony, around 
the solo with optimum sensitivity -- of the sort that a particularly sensitive 
Mozartean might accord his soloist in one of that composer's piano concertos, 
with chamber-music clarity of texture and the most refined ear for 
solo-woodwind balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Anne Akiko Meyers, a year older than Shaham, makes a relatively faint 
impression with her latest offering (RCA Victor 61700), at the heart of which, 
so to speak, is another desperately needed Mendelssohn E-minor Concerto, which 
she plays in workmanlike fashion within the context of Andrew Litton's 
phlegmatic conducting of the Philharmonia Orchestra. The fire that marked her 
recording, as a 16-year-old, of the Barber Concerto (RPO Records 5002) is 
hardly evidenced here. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is there much beyond the dutiful in the deliberately un-showy remainder of 
the present program: Vaughan Williams' "The Lark Ascending," Dvorak's "Romance" 
and a particularly bland (where some schmaltz was really in order) Meditation 
from Massenet's "Thais." 
</P>
<P>
 C hristian Tetzlaff, at 27 the senior member of this quintet and the only one 
not affiliated with the Dorothy DeLay finishing school for violinists at 
Juilliard, tackles the Dvorak Violin Concerto, a succession of glorious melodic 
inspirations that nevertheless pits solo against a rather thick orchestra 
rather than allowing them to work companionably. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's no sense of strain on this occasion. Tetzlaff delivers the goods 
with bracing rhythmic energy and a neat, 1990s take on Romantic style, i.e. 
with varied rather than uniformly throbbing vibrato and gentle applications of 
expressive portamento -- in all of which he is immaculately seconded by 
conductor Libor Pesek and the Czech Philharmonic (Virgin 45022). 
</P>
<P>
 Tetzlaff makes a strong case as well for the coupling, Lalo's salon-folksy 
"Symphonie Espagnole," by taking it just seriously enough to project its formal 
elegance. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest recording by Midori, a veteran at 24, would be a triumph for an 
artist twice her age: a thrilling display of musicianship combined with 
transcendent technical mastery in the service of the Sibelius Violin Concerto 
(Sony 58967). 
</P>
<P>
 From the outset, Midori creates marvels of dramatic tension by the most subtle 
variations of bow-pressure and vibrato. Overall, hers is a view of the concerto 
that ideally blends sentiment and dramatic punch. 
</P>
<P>
 Zubin Mehta, always a strong, positive presence when partnering Midori, draws 
playing of considerably greater polish from the Israel Philharmonic than is its 
wont, and the level of expertise and involvement from all concerned is equally 
high in that most gracious of virtuoso vehicles, Bruch's "Scottish" Fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
 What does one say about Sarah Chang, 13-years-old and one of the most 
sought-after artists on the planet? One thing we out here can state with 
reasonable certainty is that she hardly needs Paganini's D-major Concerto (EMI 
55026), which recording companies continue to promote as a rite of passage for 
every successive infant phenomenon. Wee Sarah is already too sophisticated a 
musician to have it serve any meaningful purpose for her. 
</P>
<P>
 And since it holds no terrors for her, it's no fun for us. In rounding out her 
wafer-thin program, Chang augments digital skill with a little display of 
sensitivity in sustaining the lyric lines of Saint-Saens' moonglow twins, the 
"Havanaise" and Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso. A cheesily obvious program. 
</P>
<P>
 In such repertory one notices the accompaniments only when they are 
particularly good or particularly bad. Those provided by conductor Wolfgang 
Sawallisch and the Philadelphia Orchestra are neither.*

15TH ANNUAL LOS ANGELES TIMES BOOK PRIZES; WINNER: GEORGE CHAUNCEY 'GAY NEW 
YORK'; OUT OF THE CLOSET, INTO THE CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAZAR BARKAN, Elazar Barkan, a judge for the history book prize, is 
director of the humanities center and professor of history at the Claremont 
Graduate School.

<TEXT>
<P>
 George Chauncey maps a topography that historians and others have long found 
inaccessible: that of the gay male world from the 1890s to the 1930s. Centered 
on New York, his map guides us through restaurants, clubs, bathhouses, parks 
and streets where gays lived a public life, at times interacting, and on 
occasion coexisting, with the mainstream "outside" culture. 
</P>
<P>
 The "public" life of gay New York is in this context public only in certain 
specific circumstances. Still, from a highly distinctive appearance and 
behavior in 1900, gay culture grew -- with expanding confidence and 
effervescence -- to animate numerous New York scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 The celebration reached its apex in the gay '20s. Gays during Prohibition 
"acquired unprecedented prominence," Chauncey observes, and as "the 'pansy 
craze' swept through New York, they became the subject of newspaper headlines, 
Broadway dramas, films, and novels . . . The drag balls . . . attracted 
thousands of spectators and the nightclubs where they performed became the most 
popular in the city." The speak-easies blurred legal and moral boundaries for 
the middle class, and the gay party bloomed in this expanding demimonde. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1931, curious tourists were "advised" by Vanity Fair and the tabloids to 
hang around Times Square and have their picture taken with pansies, while 
Harlem was attracting domestic tourism from the like of the Astors and the 
Vanderbilts together with numerous middle-class gawkers. In the next few years, 
the party moved to mid-town, and when the Pansy Club opened in Times Square, it 
featured Karyl Norman, heading "Pansies on Parade." The advertisement billed 
the show as "something different." 
</P>
<P>
 Chauncey not only splendidly re-creates this little-known chapter of New York 
history, but also produces an exquisite story, combining extensive original 
historical research with captivating narrative passages. His material is 
primarily drawn from court trials, the papers of the Manhattan district 
attorney, of the city magistrates' courts and other governmental regulators, as 
well as various committees of harassment such as the records of the 
anti-prostitution society and the Society for the Suppression of Vice. 
</P>
<P>
 Given such an ample record of repression, arrests, investigations, and trials 
for sodomy and prostitution, it no doubt must have been tempting for Chauncey 
to compose a persecution story. After all, the philosopher Michel Foucault 
achieved his immense contribution to the history of sexuality by highlighting 
the discursive network (penal codes, institutions, politics and cultural 
condemnation) which society constructed in order to control this and other 
"deviant" behavior. Before the '60s, few outside the medical Establishment and 
various disciplinary and penal institutions had written about sexuality at all. 
What gives "Gay New York" its excitement and appeal, then, is Chauncey's 
ability to transform these narratives of persecution into an often affirmative 
tale. 
</P>
<P>
 In Chauncey's interviews, the gay men who lived through the pre-repression 
period describe gay New York early in this century as the good old times. 
Through these interviews, the streets and clubs of Harlem, the Village, Uptown, 
Broadway and Times Square come alive as scenes of gay life in a period when the 
homosexuals supposedly existed only in the closet. The celebration of the 
drag-queen in the good old days before repression is told in vivid colors, 
highlighting the pleasure and the playfulness, even when the images depict 
arrest and harassment. The tone only changes in the last chapter, which briefly 
describes "the exclusion of homosexuality from the public sphere in the 1930s." 
On the page preceding this chapter, a picture (1940, at right) depicts a 
glowing drag queen emerging from a police van, posing for the camera. 
</P>
<P>
 The juxtaposition -- of the picture and the text, of the celebration and the 
repression -- is illuminating. Victimization, as Chauncey shows here, can also 
be subverted into cultural and political resistance. Homosexuals, although 
persecuted during those years, were able to create a temporary enclave that 
shielded them and much of their culture from harassment. It is Chauncey's 
celebration of this ambivalent space between victimization and self-affirmation 
that has great significance for contemporary understanding of culture, as well 
as for the relationship of different groups, including ethnic and racial 
minorities, among themselves as well as with the state. 
</P>
<P>
 How large was the male gay community in New York? The University of Chicago 
study of current American sexual practices that was released last month 
suggests that the "traditional" figure accepted by gays -- 10% -- may 
characterize only urban areas. Reading this story, one gets the impression that 
this was a "weighted" 10%: gays had a cultural impact on the city far greater 
than their numbers. But Chauncey makes an even more compelling claim: The 
boundaries of homo- and hetero-sexuality are highly culturally specific. Not 
only was homosexuality being defined during this period -- so too was 
heterosexuality, which Chauncey believes emerged from a mainstream cultural 
defense of the male sphere against "the overcivilization and feminization of 
American men." 
</P>
<P>
 The middle-class Angst of masculinity did not invent the fairy, but it did 
turn the fairy into a "potent cultural figure (that) could serve to mark the 
boundaries of acceptable male behavior." However counterintuitive, this 
argument is persuasive when backed by such rich evidence and engaging 
narrative. Thus Chauncey's story reminds us in a powerful way that contemporary 
prejudices -- notwithstanding their seemingly eternal, natural, or obvious 
nature -- are anything but permanent. LOS ANGELES TIMES BOOK PRIZES / HISTORY:

ART NOTES; THE MODERNISM OF GALKA SCHEYER; THE GERMAN-BORN ART PATRON WHO 
SETTLED IN L.A. BROUGHT ATTENTION TO THE FAMOUS 'BLUE FOUR.' A PASADENA SHOW 
TAKES A LOOK AT HER COLLECTION.

 The Norton Simon Museum is preparing to celebrate a proud but rather obscure 
chapter of Southern California's art- collecting history. Unlike the 
oft-lamented litany of treasures that might have been ensconced here but got 
away, this story is about an important collection that stayed. 
</P>
<P>
 The heroine is Galka Scheyer, a German-born art patron who settled in Los 
Angeles in 1928 and promoted the work of the Blue Four -- Lyonel Feininger, 
Alexei Jawlensky, Wassily Kandinsky and Paul Klee. 
</P>
<P>
 At her death in 1945, Scheyer left her collection to UCLA with the proviso 
that the university meet conditions of a 1944 gift of her friend Walter 
Arensberg's modern art collection. Arensberg's donation required UCLA to 
provide a building for his collection within five years; Scheyer further 
stipulated that the university must publish a modest catalogue of her 
collection. When UCLA failed to meet the conditions, the Arensberg collection 
went to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, while the fate of the Scheyer 
collection was left to a committee. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1953, the committee entrusted Scheyer's collection of 450 works by the Blue 
Four and other modern artists (plus a cache of 800 documents) to the Pasadena 
Art Institute, which evolved into the Pasadena Art Museum and moved to a new 
building on Colorado Boulevard. The late Norton Simon took over the facility in 
1974 and fulfilled the Scheyer trust's provisions by publishing a catalogue of 
the collection. 
</P>
<P>
 A sampling of the Scheyer holding is frequently on view at the Norton Simon 
Museum, but the upcoming event is the largest single presentation to date and 
the first to examine Scheyer's role as a collector and proponent of modern art, 
according to museum director Sara Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Spirit of Modernism: Galka Scheyer in the New World," which opens on 
Thursday and runs through Nov. 5, 1995, will present more than 200 works in six 
galleries on the museum's lower floor. Works by the Blue Four will be shown 
with pieces by Pablo Picasso, Oskar Kokoschka, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Imogen 
Cunningham, Edward Weston and other artists, all from the Scheyer collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheyer's commitment to the Blue Four began in 1915, when she first saw the 
work of Russian artist Jawlensky in Switzerland. She was so smitten with his 
Expressionistic painting that she looked him up and became his friend, model 
and agent. In 1921, on a trip to the Bauhaus in Weimar, Germany, Jawlensky 
introduced her to Feininger, Kandinsky and Klee, who were instructors at the 
avant-garde art school. Three years later, while Scheyer was preparing to 
travel to the United States, the four artists signed an agreement designating 
her as their American representative. The artists adopted the name Blue Four 
for the sake of marketing, rather than aesthetic affinity. Although the artists 
shared a devotion to modern ideas, their individual styles were quite 
divergent. Kandinsky suggested that they simply call themselves The Four, but 
they became the Blue Four, apparently because Scheyer equated the color blue 
with spirituality and unity. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheyer, who had lectured on Jawlensky's art and promoted his work through 
exhibitions and sales in Germany, initially took the Blue Four to San 
Francisco, where a local newspaper dubbed her the "prophetess of modern art." 
She moved to Los Angeles in 1928 and spent the last 17 years of her life 
writing, lecturing and organizing exhibitions for the artists. Feininger, who 
resided in New York from the late 1930s until his death in 1956, was the only 
member of the group who traveled to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The Norton Simon Museum has published three catalogues in conjunction with the 
exhibition. The new books -- on Feininger, Kandinsky and Klee -- join an 
earlier publication on Jawlensky in a now-complete boxed series on the Blue 
Four. 
</P>
<P>
 SECOND TIME AROUND: "LAX: The Los Angeles Exhibition" is back. The 1994 
version of the citywide biennial, which made its debut in 1992, features 
exhibitions organized by 10 institutions. No overarching theme links the 
celebration of recent work by Los Angeles artists, according to LAX Director 
Edward Leffingwell. "With this many exhibitions, any theme would become 
meaningless," he says. However, a catalogue will provide maps to participating 
institutions and essays by exhibition curators. Among the offerings, the 
California Afro-American Museum and USC's Fisher Gallery will present "Take 2," 
a collaborative multimedia show featuring 13 female artists (Tuesday through 
Jan. 22). "The Layered Look: Toward an Aesthetic of Accumulation Among Six Los 
Angeles Artists," will be at the Santa Monica Museum of Art (Thursday through 
Jan. 15). 
</P>
<P>
 Otis College of Art and Design will present a group show called "Sincerity and 
Other Peccadillos" (Saturday through Jan. 14). On view at the Armory Center for 
the Arts in Pasadena (through Dec. 23) is "LAX94: COL LA borations: Inside the 
Armory, Out on the Street," featuring works by nine artists who address social 
and political issues. The Municipal Art Gallery and the Junior Arts Center 
Gallery in Barnsdall Art Park will show a variety of works by 16 artists. In 
addition, Cal State Los Angeles will display the work of Harry Gamboa (Saturday 
through Dec. 14); Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions will feature 
photographs, sculpture, drawings and a window installation by four artists 
(Wednesday through Jan. 8), and the Japanese American Cultural and Community 
Center will feature works by five Japanese-born artists who live in Los Angeles 
(through Dec. 18).

 AMERICAN BONANZA: A bequest of seven 19th-Century American paintings from the 
late Charles C. and Elma Ralphs Shoemaker to the Los Angeles County Museum of 
Art is on view through Feb. 6 on the plaza level of LACMA's Ahmanson Building. 
The gift -- consisting of landscapes by Frederic Edwin Church, Jasper Francis 
Cropsey, Fitz Hugh Lane, Martin Johnson Heade and Thompson Bricher and 
still-lifes by John Francis, William Michael Harnett -- includes prime examples 
of Hudson River School, Luminist and trompe l'oeil styles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Shoemakers were longtime supporters of the museum and founding members of 
its American Art Council.*

FROM THE VAULTS; BETTER THE SOURCES THAN BAND BOX 
</P>

<P>
 THE BAND, "Across the Great Divide" ( Capitol ) ** 
</P>
<P>
 How do you turn a 5-star body of work into a 2-star boxed set? Here's a case 
study. 
</P>
<P>
 The Band's first two albums -- 1968's "Music From Big Pink" and 1969's "The 
Band" -- are musts in any library of rock. 
</P>
<P>
 In those landmark collections, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame quintet of 
Robbie Robertson, Rick Danko, Levon Helm, Garth Hudson and Richard Manuel 
celebrated the vitality of the American spirit with music so pure that it 
seemed drawn from the most soulful streams of country, blues and rock. 
</P>
<P>
 For anyone who already has those albums, the problem with this set is it gives 
you 15 of the 23 songs again -- along with tracks from other Band albums plus 
20 rarities, many of the latter interesting but hardly essential to the 
appreciation of the group's music. 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't have the two albums, buy them instead of this set because those 
23 songs are best heard in context -- and then petition Capitol to release the 
rarities as a single disc. Giving you only part of the original albums is akin 
to condensing two great novels. There is much great music here, but you don't 
feel like you have the real goods. Robert Hilburn

 FRANK SINATRA, "Duets II" ( Capitol ) *1/2 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's "Duets" seemed -- at least to these more forgiving ears -- a sweet 
novelty. The unevenness of its live-on-tape vocal collaborations was less 
significant than the idea of legendary voices blending or colliding at last, 
plus, of course, the touching valedictory undertones.Valedictory, 
schmaledictory. "Duets" is simply a franchise, and "Duets II" is a bust. 
</P>
<P>
 With a lineup that includes Jimmy Buffett, Lorrie Morgan, Patti LaBelle, Jon 
Secada, Steve & Eydie, Frank Jr., etc., the Dream Team this ain't -- though, 
with Luis Miguel and Antonio Carlos Jobim aboard, the "international market" 
may be doing cartwheels as we speak. 
</P>
<P>
 The orchestra sounds terrific, as before, and Sinatra's always intriguing, 
playful way of reinventing the phrasing hasn't abandoned him. But by the time 
he and Neil Diamond close out the set with "The House I Live In" in a bout of 
mutual overkill, you could cut the kitsch with "Mack the Knife." 
</P>
<P>
 We're warned "Duets III" is already in the works for Christmas '95, but here's 
hoping for another Sinatra solo album before every adult-contemporary artist in 
North and/or Latin America gets a turn at the karaoke. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

 TLC, "CrazySexyCool" ( La Face ) ** 
</P>
<P>
 The R&B vocal group's second album is more grown-up than its 1992 debut, 
"Ooooooohhh . . . on the TLC Tip," which has sold nearly 3 million -- but it 
isn't nearly as much fun. 
</P>
<P>
 When the trio of Tionne (T-Boz) Watkins, Lisa (Left Eye) Lopes and Rozonda 
(Chilli) Thomas burst on the hip-hop scene, it was a breath of fresh air, 
bringing a cocky, macho sensibility to the prissy girl-group genre.They came 
across as hip, rebellious feminists who looked at relationships as skirmishes 
in which they clearly had the upper hand -- and loved every minute of it. A 
wacky, cartoonish quality coupled with a reckless inhibition made that debut 
something special. Those qualities are missing from the follow-up. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the cuts on this album, mostly produced by Dallas Austin, Jermaine 
Dupri and Babyface, have the sultry, sensuous feel of mid-'80s Prince. But, 
unlike Prince's best slow-tempo material, these tracks tend to drag. The album 
sorely needs some crackling dance tunes, something like the debut album's big 
hit, "Ain't 2 Proud 2 Beg." 
</P>
<P>
 "CrazySexyCool" does have some strong tunes, though, notably the steamy 
Babyface productions "Redlight Special" and "Let's Do It Again." "Creep" and 
"Switch" pack some punch too. Overall, though, this just isn't as good as the 
debut. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

 AMERICAN MUSIC CLUB, "San Francisco" ( Reprise ) *** 1/2 
</P>
<P>
 The San Francisco that the American Music Club evokes is a shrouded, misty 
place -- embracing and claustrophobic, full of both possibility and dead ends. 
It's a perfect habitat for mope-rock genius Mark Eitzel, who kicks off his 
band's seventh album in a voice that struggles to break above a whisper."Lost 
again, am I lost again," he croaks, establishing a ground note of subdued 
desperation. 
</P>
<P>
 Eitzel's Angst isn't fueled just by love's elusiveness; even when it's present 
it's not enough. In one of the album's many images for the heart, he sees it as 
a revolving door -- never open, never tired. And in one of the many images 
involving intoxicants, he offers a classic couplet, "How many six-packs does it 
take to screw in a light / It's good to be alive babe, sometimes it's alright." 
</P>
<P>
 That's about as up as things get, though the band (which plays the Roxy on 
Nov. 22) twice storms out of its pop-noir atmospherics and generally comes up 
with a varied, S.F.-flavored menu of folk-rock, acid-rock, lounge pop and 
exotica. 
</P>
<P>
 It sometimes bogs down in its moroseness, but "San Francisco" can hold its own 
with rock's other great city albums, X's "Los Angeles" and Lou Reed's "New 
York." 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

 Queensryche, "Promised Land," EMI ***. Edgy, brooding, grand sonic gestures 
and gusts of harmonies continue to sweep over Queensryche's hard-rock 
terrain.But in the two years since their last album, they've tempered their 
songs, revealing some subtle new dynamics. "Promised Land" covers much 
territory, from stretches of introspection and social commentary to quiet 
acoustic moments and epic compositions.

 WALK THAT WAY: For years, the word around town was that the only way you could 
get A&R executive John David Kalodner away from Geffen Records was to make him 
the head of his own label. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Kalodner announced earlier this month that he was leaving Geffen, the 
guessing game centered on which label he'd start running.Instead, he told Pop 
Eye, he's going to be joining the A&R team at Columbia Records. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to be a president or anything," he says. "I don't want the crap 
that goes with that job. I just want to sign new bands and make records." 
</P>
<P>
 One old band Kalodner will continue to work with is Aerosmith, which is also 
moving from Geffen to Columbia, its home in the band's '70s heyday. But he says 
it's a mistake to link the two moves, noting that he's had successes with a 
number of other acts, including Foreigner (while at Atlantic in the '70s) and 
Cher. 
</P>
<P>
 What does this move mean for Geffen's A&R department, which lost another 
high-profile executive last year when Gary Gersh left to become Capitol's 
president? Geffen President Eddie Rosenblatt says that the company had already 
been bringing new blood into the department and that he does not anticipate 
making any major moves.  
</P>
<P>
 But industry insiders speculate that Geffen will court at least one major A&R 
figure to join Tom Zutaut, Tony Berg and Mark Kates as a visible presence in 
what is still widely regarded as one of the top A&R departments in the 
business. Steve Hochman

 SMALL FACES: With Michael Jackson's "History" greatest-hits package now 
definitely too late to be in stores by Christmas, Jackson will take his time 
finishing the five or more new songs that will be part of the two-CD set. No 
new release date has been set, but Epic execs are hoping to have it ready 
before Easter. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Another one you can scratch off the Christmas list is Stevie Wonder's new 
album, which has now been bumped to sometime next year, while Wonder sifts 
through a mountain of new songs and takes his notorious time fine-tuning the 
tracks. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 However, there will be Christmas spirit aplenty in a new video featuring Jon 
Bon Jovi and Cindy Crawford, directed by noted photographer Herb Ritts. The 
clip, expected to start airing on MTV in early December, is for Bon Jovi's 
version of Charles Brown's "Please Come Home for Christmas," which can be found 
on the 1992 album "A Very Special Christmas 2." The two "Special Christmas" 
collections have raised more than $30 million for the Special Olympics since 
1987. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Dates are being booked for what will likely be the big R&B tour of the winter: 
Boyz II Men headlining, with Babyface also on the bill for the tour's first 
portion. . . . Naughty by Nature has finished its next album, "Poverty's 
Paradise," but with copyright clearance for the samples of other recordings 
still being secured, the set won't be released until March. . . . Naughty is 
also featured on what should be the winter's biggest rap soundtrack, "New 
Jersey Drive" -- from a movie executive-produced by Spike Lee. The star-studded 
album, due in late February, also features Queen Latifah, Coolio, Bone 
Thugs-N-Harmony and MC Eiht. . . . The Grateful Dead is in the studio working 
on its first new studio album since 1989. Among the songs being recorded are 
the Jerry Garcia-Robert Hunter compositions "Days Between" and "Lazy River 
Road" and a song Bob Weir wrote with the late Willie Dixon titled "Eternity." . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 The reunited L.A. punk icons Circle Jerks are signing to Mercury and will 
start work on a new album soon. The group is also part of the lineup for the 
Ringling Sisters' annual "Fun-Raiser" benefit on Dec. 19 at the Palace. Also on 
the bill so far are Babes in Toyland, 7 Year Bitch, Possum Dixon, Dave Alvin, 
Rosie Flores and John Trudell, along with the Ringlings. Proceeds will go to 
the Hollygrove Orphanage, Rock for Choice, the L.A. Youth Network and the media 
watchdog group F.A.I.R.

 Courtney Love and Metallica? 
</P>
<P>
 No, they're not touring to gether -- at least for now. But the queen of 
alternative rock and the titans of metal may soon have the same manager. 
</P>
<P>
 With Janet Billig, who has managed Love's band Hole for four years, accepting 
a top post at Atlantic Records, Love has been scouting new managers -- and 
reportedly has settled on the New York-based team of Peter Mensch and Cliff 
Burnstein at their Q Prime company. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago band Veruca Salt, which is currently touring with Hole, is already 
with Q Prime -- giving the firm, which has been chiefly identified for years 
with the heavy-metal and hard-rock world, its first entries into the 
alternative rock waters.

 Some industry insiders are wondering about the chemistry of the relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Love is known for her combustible manner, no less so following the April 
suicide of husband Kurt Cobain. Will Mensch and Burnstein be able to handle 
such a free spirit? 
</P>
<P>
 Mensch says that if Hole does indeed sign with his company, he hopes to focus 
attention on the band's music, which has often been overshadowed by a media 
"sideshow aspect." 
</P>
<P>
 Mensch himself became convinced of those musical strengths when he went to see 
Veruca Salt play its first date with Hole last month in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw (Love) play . . . she went up there and cranked it out," he says. 
"It was like John Lydon or Axl Rose or Janis Joplin -- whatever great performer 
you want to name. She ripped her guts out." 
</P>
<P>
 The step into alternative rock is seen in the industry as a savvy one for Q 
Prime, which last year expanded its horizon in a different direction by signing 
adult-pop figure Bruce Hornsby. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a good move for them -- working with new music before the old music 
dies," says a record company executive whose acts have been represented by Q 
Prime. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as Mensch is concerned, the company is just following the music. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're simply professional managers, and when I hear a good record, I want to 
meet the people who made it and manage them," he says. "Dealing with concerns 
of younger, newer bands keeps me from getting stale. It keeps me sharp. I get 
to reinvent my company." Steve Hochman

THE CHARTS: 'ROAD' TO THE TOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Though her album, "Stones in the Road" is more pop than country, Mary Chapin 
Carpenter is still dominating in the country market, topping both The Times' 
Southern California country chart and the national country chart. As expected, 
Nirvana's album "Unplugged In New York" debuted at the top of both the Southern 
California and the national pop charts. The Kurt Cobain mystique lives on. 
Madonna's album "Bedtime Stories" is still going strong, slipping just two 
notches to No. 4 on the regional pop chart. TOP 10 ALBUMS 03,04,37,11 Title,

 HOLE'S HOLE: What about Janet Billig's other acts? Will they stay or follow 
Courtney Love's lead and find new homes? Lots of people will be watching 
because Billig's other Gold Mountain clients included such highly regarded acts 
as the Breeders, Dinosaur Jr. and the Lemonheads. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold Mountain President Ron Stone says the company -- whose alternative rock 
roster also includes Sonic Youth and the Beastie Boys -- will do "everything 
possible" to keep Billig's bands in the fold. Steve Hochman

 Bryan Ferry, "Mamouna," Virgin **1/2. How "atmospheric" do you suppose an 
album will be whose opening cut includes separate credits for "riff gtr," 
"rhythm gtr," "mood gtr," "atmos gtr" and "gull gtr," and that's not even 
withstanding Brian Eno's "sonic awareness"? On some level, this saturated 
palette of loneliness is as empty as it is lush, but -- with or without most of 
Roxy Music in tow -- the woozy sonics are Ab Fab.

 Various artists, "Jason's Lyric" soundtrack, Mercury * 1/2 . Weed out the 
routine rap and corny R&B ballads and there's not much good music left on this 
20-tune soundtrack.Nearly all the quality songs are done by the biggest stars 
-- Scarface, Oleta Adams, LL Cool J and Ahmad. But an unknown -- the vocal 
group B.M.U. -- takes best song honors with the foot-stompin' R&B/gospel tune 
"U Will Know."

 George Strait, "Lead On." MCA ***. Quite simply, this is the best album of the 
Texan's long career.The songs ring true throughout -- with just a slight dip in 
freshness toward the end -- and the plentiful lyric twists always are in 
service of real emotion. His ballad singing takes a giant leap forward, 
displaying the nuanced inflection that separate the pros from the amateurs.

 This 1940 classic reunited "Stagecoach's" John Ford, John Wayne (pictured, 
with Carmen Morales), Thomas Mitchell and writer Dudley Nichols in a robust yet 
poetic adaptation of four short plays by Eugene O'Neill about men caught up in 
the siren call of the sea. The elegiac sensibilities of Ford and O'Neill mesh 
beautifully.(Bravo Friday at 9:30 a.m. and 11:10 p.m.).

15TH ANNUAL LOS ANGELES TIMES BOOK PRIZES; WINNER: CAROLYN FORCHE 'THE ANGEL OF 
HISTORY'; THE PERSONAL AS POLITICAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN SALTER REYNOLDS, Susan Salter Reynolds is an assistant book editor. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Carolyn Forche returned from El Salvador in 1980, where she had been 
working as a human rights activist, she wrote in her poem "Return": "I go mad, 
for example, / in the Safeway, at the many heads / of lettuce, papaya and 
sugar, pineapples / and coffee, especially the coffee. / And when I speak with 
American men, / there is some absence of recognition." 
</P>
<P>
 It may not have been the first time that Forche was witness to the kind of 
cruelty El Salvador became known for at that time, but her response, recorded 
in "The Country Between Us," became a sort of bible for puzzling over cruelty 
and the atrocities of war. The poems feel as though they were written when 
Forche came home, unable to reconcile daily life with what she had seen and 
heard. "Better / people than you were powerless" she wrote in "Return." "You 
have not returned to your country, / but to a life you never left." 
</P>
<P>
 These were Forche's poems of witness. If you were fortunate enough to read 
them in college, when history and the news and literature all left enormous 
black holes in your understanding; when debates in various seminars over the 
artificial/official separation of the personal and the political violated your 
still youthful instincts about how individuals should treat each other, when 
political science professors almost never let their students read poetry or 
novels, then you will never ever forget them, even if your well-worn copy was 
given away in a moment of generous weakness. 
</P>
<P>
 After we had lived with them for a while, digested her experiences, Forche's 
voice became part of our conscience. "To think of the writer as conscience of 
the world," Daniel Boorstin has written in a new collection of essays, "is only 
to recognize that the writer, as we have seen, is inevitably a divided self, 
condemned at the same time to express and to communicate, to speak for the 
writer and speak to others." Forche's next book, "Against Forgetting: Twentieth 
Century Poetry of Witness" collected more than 140 poets from five continents, 
poems in which the reader can hear "the trace of extremity . . . evidence of 
what occurred." These poems are written in this century, from the Armenian 
genocide to Tian An Men Square. The poets must have personally experienced what 
they write about, they must be considered important to their national 
literatures, and they must be "available in quality translation." 
</P>
<P>
 "What comes to us in the newspapers is not necessarily factual, nor is it 
necessarily cogent," Forche reminds. Seeing these poems together in one 
collection reinforces the fact that poetry is an active thing, a triumph of 
will over circumstance, as Forche paraphrases Walter Benjamin in her 
introduction: "a poem is itself an event." "The poetry of witness," she writes, 
"reclaims the social from the political and in so doing defends the individual 
against illegitimate forms of coercion." 
</P>
<P>
 With this collection, Forche gives her readers a place between the personal 
and the political, a realm she calls "the social," in which voices like that of 
the Hungarian poet Miklos Radnoti (1909-1944), whose widow found his last poems 
on his body in a mass grave of prisoners returned from Germany, are respected 
as historical evidence and testimony to the human spirit all at once: "I 
believe in miracles, forgot their days;/above me I see a bomber squadron 
cruise. I was just admiring, up there, your eyes' blue sheen" ( from "Letter to 
My Wife," Lager Heidenau, above Zagubica in the mountains, August-September, 
1944). All of these writers are victims, in one way or another, but their 
dignity is exquisite, and their experience must be trusted. One very fine form 
of revenge, a way of annihilating evil, a hopeful reader could conclude, is to 
make something beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Angel of History," Forche's most recent collection of poems, are so very 
different from the poems in "The Country Between Us." She is not puzzling, not 
trying, first and foremost to figure out what to do with her own experience. 
She is, instead, speaking in the voices of the people whose stories are 
remembered. It is as though, beyond bearing witness and providing conscience, 
she has incorporated the history of others into her own genealogy. And there is 
some calm, some respite from what must be, by now, a terrible roaring inside 
her; respite in the form of children, pear trees, France and the French. Even 
names such as Le Monde, and words such as Mais oui! contain slight comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 These poems don't have the neatness of the earlier poems, they are not 
distinct stories. They are a babble of fragments: "fragments together into a 
story before the shape of the whole/like a madman -- time and again torn from 
my mouth/out of a nearby chimney each child's hand was taken/though this is not 
a fairy tale explained in advance" (from "Book Codes: II"). And, like the 
remains in El Playon or Puerto Diablo ("body dumps" in El Salvador), they 
cannot always be pieced back together to form whole bodies. They are, instead, 
as Forche wrote in "The Testimony of Light," a poem about Hiroshima, " 
Muga-muchu : without self, without center. Thrown up in the sky by a wind." LOS

CRITIC'S PICK: 'THIS BOY'S LIFE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Kenneth Turan 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This 1993 film is every boy's life, every child's nightmare. Told with 
unblinking truthfulness and remarkable sensitivity by writer Robert Getchell, 
its true story of one particular and painful coming of age manages to touch us 
all.The ensemble work of Ellen Barkin, Leonardo DiCaprio (pictured) and Robert 
De Niro is expressive without overdoing it and almost hypnotic in its honesty. 
Although the 18-year-old DiCaprio got lots of justifiable attetion for his 
finely nuanced work as a teen-ager trapped in an inner and outer storm, it is 
De Niro's shattering performance as stepfather Dwight Hansen, the warped 
disciplinarian, that is the film's core (HBO Monday at 4:05 a.m.). Kenneth 
Turan

BUD POWELL GETS HIS LONG OVERDUE DUE; ALMOST 30 YEARS AFTER HIS DEATH, THE 
TROUBLED FATHER OF MODERN JAZZ PIANO IS CELEBRATED IN ARCHIVAL CD SETS FROM 
BLUE NOTE AND VERVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sonny Rollins was approaching the Harlem apartment of pianist Bud Powell when 
he bumped into fellow saxophonist Jackie McLean. Rollins, who was beginning to 
enjoy godly status in modern jazz, dared to challenge Charlie (Bird) Parker's 
supremacy by asking McLean an unspeakable question: 
</P>
<P>
 "Who's the baddest, Bud or Bird?" 
</P>
<P>
 McLean, in an account of the 1950 meeting offered recently to Verve Records, 
feigned surprise. The obvious and redemptive answer was Bird. Parker had just 
transformed jazz, along with Dizzy Gillespie and Thelonious Monk, by creating a 
new vocabulary called bebop, and more than anyone else he was bop's dazzling 
executioner. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rollins, busy learning Powell's intricate original compositions from 
Powell himself, bored in and told McLean, "You better think about that and 
listen ." 
</P>
<P>
 Bud Powell stories are so often like that.  
</P>
<P>
 Powell, who died in 1966, was never widely known. Yet his music and playing -- 
particularly among musicians -- were revered and considered seminal. Bud Powell 
is arguably jazz's leading exemplar of a familiar, rueful truth in all high 
art: True greatness often eludes. 
</P>
<P>
 This apparently stems from the fact that it is defined by the acts of 
individuals whose imaginative grasp often exceeds our aesthetic reach -- or at 
least the vocabulary with which to name what it is they've created. 
</P>
<P>
 Earl (Bud) Powell was at work more invisibly in the 1940s in bringing bebop to 
the keyboard and then taking it farther still: into borderless realms of 
plummeting depth and shocking power.  
</P>
<P>
 With diminishing debt to Monk, Powell created an ultramodern language of 
playing in which his blindingly fast right hand would etch searing, unbroken 
sonic images -- rapid and sweet descending triplets here, a crashing series of 
ascending filled octaves there -- while his left hand stabbed dissonantly at 
chords in the lower and middle registers. 
</P>
<P>
 The sound he created was itself a full breathing personality, unchecked and 
insistent: dark, light, tender, violent, assuring, threatening. He was, 
plainly, the guy with the sparkler: slashing the darkness in ordered frenzy and 
creating art by retinal burn. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell did this on standards of the day -- a schmaltzy "Over the Rainbow" 
became an edgy, modern escapade in his hands -- as well as in a durable canon 
of original, complex compositions that include his aptly titled "Un Poco Loco." 
</P>
<P>
 His invention was of such a scale that anointed leaders of the music studied 
it, deconstructed it and, in the case of most pianists, made it a foundation of 
their playing. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny Griffin would be the one to capture the sentiments of numerous 
musicians when he said the density and unrelenting force of Powell's playing -- 
at times startling, at times inspiring, always astonishingly precise -- would 
"make you afraid." 
</P>
<P>
 Bud Powell just never became a household name, even if successive popular 
pianists of the day were derivative of him. Powell's music just never got its 
due. 
</P>
<P>
 T hat may well change now. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Note and Verve Records have just released archival sets of their Bud 
Powell recording sessions. The releases, occasioned by what would have been 
Powell's 70th birthday in September, are designed to introduce Powell's music 
to an audience beyond musicians and jazz zealots. 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, the sets have an affectionate biographical feel, as they match 
extensive text treatments with '40s and '50s recordings that ebb and flow with 
Powell's disturbed personality. 
</P>
<P>
 The great unspoken and uncomprehended dimension of Bud Powell's music was, in 
fact, his own form of madness. The terrible truth is that Powell was beset by 
emotional problems that landed him, serially, in mental institutions and 
alcohol dependence that landed him, periodically, in the gutter. 
</P>
<P>
 But the nature of his debility, which is forever bound to the protean music 
these sets reveal, leaves an uncomfortable trail of questions: To what extent 
was his art fostered or hindered by his troubles? To what extent was he helped 
or ignored by friends and associate musicians? If Powell had lived a full, 
healthful life -- he died in a Brooklyn hospital of liver failure and 
malnutrition at age 41 -- would his arresting music have expanded still more? 
</P>
<P>
 What, in the end, is left to instruct on the nature of artistic greatness in a 
soul so battered, so tortured, so proximate to a complete loss of dignity? 
</P>
<P>
 There are faint clues in the music and restrained speculations in these 
reissue collections. Taken together, however, they gather strength and wreak a 
subterranean pull that begs the more basic question of what it is that creates 
real art. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell suffered a terrific beating over the head by Philadelphia police 
following a performance in 1945, and many of his contemporaries said that he 
never was the same again. What the same was, however, is widely debated. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell was always reticent and quirky, given to the impulsive, the 
unpredictable, the childlike. What is clear is that the beating marked the 
beginning of a period in which he would face extended stays in hospitals that 
gave him extensive electroshock treatments.  
</P>
<P>
 His time out of the hospitals was thus neatly brokered between playing at New 
York's Birdland or recording for Verve-owned labels and Blue Note. 
Unpredictability so defined Powell that the manager of Birdland became his 
guardian upon release from Creedmore, the New York psychiatric facility, and he 
was kept, under lock, in a Birdland-leased apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 But art has never cottoned to custody, and so Powell talked through the 
keyboard. He wrote "Glass Enclosure," among other vivid and bristling 
compositions, while living in Birdland's mid-town "jail." 
</P>
<P>
 Powell's increasing remoteness and erratic behavior was accompanied by a 
diminishing tolerance of alcohol. One drink would disable him; he would become 
lost, even ghostly. On more than one occasion, musical associates of the era 
recall Powell appearing mysteriously at a club's piano only to play ferociously 
and soundlessly -- he wouldn't let the keys strike fully, or make sound. The 
result was apparitionlike and fleeting: Powell would then run out as suddenly 
as he'd appeared.  
</P>
<P>
 People would not talk to Powell about these episodes, as Powell barely spoke. 
He did, however, speak with vulnerability to pianist Marian McPartland, who 
visited him at Creedmore and offers perhaps the most poignant remembrance in 
the Verve treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marian," she recalls Powell as saying, "do people remember me?" 
</P>
<P>
 F or a while, they did. 
</P>
<P>
 As both the Verve and the Blue Note CDs attest, Powell's surging and seamless 
musical architectures of the late 1940s and early 1950s gave way to episodic 
incoherence and, at worst in the late '50s, a still-pleasing but hologrammatic 
shell suggestive of his former self.  
</P>
<P>
 Powell's move to Paris in 1959 buoyed him, as Parisian audiences knew Powell 
music well but were less inclined than New Yorkers to hold him to previously 
recorded zeniths. Moreover, Powell's most appreciative fan, a Frenchman named 
Francis Paudras, acted as protector and keeper at every level. 
</P>
<P>
 Musicians, of course, have always remembered Powell and his music.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1966, following Powell's death, Herbie Hancock told Down Beat magazine: 
"(Bud Powell) was the foundation out of which stemmed the whole edifice of 
modern jazz piano; every pianist since Bud either came through him or is 
deliberately attempting to get away from playing like him." Twenty years later, 
upon winning the 1986 Oscar for his score to the Powell-based film " 'Round 
Midnight," Hancock again cited Bud Powell. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, years after mainstream audiences have drifted to countless others whose 
very vocabulary can be traced to Powell, the record companies have made another 
go at selling Bud Powell. 
</P>
<P>
 And these releases, in some cases wobbly and thin in their pre-stereo and 
pre-digital technologies, contain some of the most rigorously conceived and 
executed jazz music ever recorded. This is particularly true in the 1949 Clef 
sessions included in the Verve set, in which drummer Max Roach and bassist Ray 
Brown gird Powell through enormous, sustained attacks that, for better and 
worse, crowd this listener with humanity, pain, and delight. It's no doubt a 
filial sense of crowding that leads horn players who look at Powell 
transcriptions to wonder: Where would I breathe? 
</P>
<P>
 The arc of Powell's development is plain through both the Verve and Blue Note 
issues, with Verve being largely in the trio formats and Blue Note including 
bracing quintet sessions with Fats Navarro and Sonny Rollins. 
</P>
<P>
 For those wishing the more obsessive and archival of the treatments, seek out 
the five-disc Verve set. It is packed with smart and touching interviews with 
Powell colleagues and features a rewarding musicological annotation by pianists 
Barry Harris and Michael Weiss, whose pointed banter was taped while listening 
to each track. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-disc Blue Note release is more to the point, a Prado instead of a 
Louvre, with a handsome booklet featuring an Alfred Lion interview and an 
insightful introduction to Powell and his music. 
</P>
<P>
 In either case, there is something both beautiful and haunting in hearing Bud 
Powell go from his stratospheric achievement of "Tempus Fugue-It" in 1949 or 
three evolving takes of "Un Poco Loco" in 1951 to the more muted and at times 
anarchic treatments of "Mediocre" in 1955.  
</P>
<P>
 In so many ways these are map fragments to a great artist's consciousness, 
both troubled and inspired, thwarted and free. And they are dignified evidence 
of an American imagination so large but brief that it nearly got by without its 
full due.*

CRITIC'S PICK: 'ADDAMS FAMILY VALUES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Peter Rainer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The kinetic, nutty 1993 release starts out with a full bag of tricks and keeps 
lobbing them straight at the audience for all of its 93 minutes. It never lets 
up -- director Barry Sonnenfeld and write Paul Rudnick turns its assaultiveness 
into a comic style.With something this scattershot, it's inevitable that tedium 
would eventually set in, and it does, about halfway in. But there are still 
some good laughs -- more than in "The Addams Family," where tedium set in with 
the credits. The film begins with the surprise announcement of Morticia 
(Anjelica Huston) to Gomez (the late Raul Julia, pictured) that she is 
pregnant. The movie's central joke is that the Addamses are lots more stable -- 
-- they have better "family values" -- then the straight-arrows on the outside 
(HBO Saturday at 8 p.m., next Sunday at 4:45 a.m.). Peter Rainer

15TH ANNUAL LOS ANGELES TIMES BOOK PRIZES; WINNER: JONATHAN WEINER 'THE BEAK OF 
THE FINCH'; THE BEAK THAT BRINGS LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. LONSDALE and HARDING E. SMITH, Carol Lonsdale is a research 
scientist at Caltech. Harding Smith is a professor of physics at UC San Diego. 
They were 1994 science book prize judges.

 Charles Darwin never imagined that it would be possible to observe the effects 
of natural selection during a human lifetime, let alone in the mere span of a 
few years. The theory that took seed with his foraging and collecting in the 
Galapagos Archipelago was thought by this scientific visionary to be a matter 
of centuries, with the evidence to be found in the fossil record and the 
diversity of living forms. Most people today still assume that this is the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 Winner of the 1994 Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Science and Technology, 
Jonathan Weiner's new book "The Beak of the Finch" lays to rest this 
supposition with the engaging narrative of a modern scientific study that will 
forever change the way that we view evolution: the work of Princeton biologists 
Peter and Rosemary Grant, who have spent the last two decades studying the 
process of natural selection on the Galapagos finches that caught the attention 
of Darwin 150 years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The Grants have had the vision, the tools and perhaps most critically, the 
perseverance, to return season after lonely season to the small volcanic 
outcropping called Daphne Major to watch the finch population. This isolated 
rock among the isolated Galapagos Islands is perhaps as close as biologists 
will come to the ideal evolutionary laboratory. Here the Grants and their team, 
which often included their daughters, Thalia and Nicola, recorded the response 
of the finches to their environment by painstaking measurement of body 
dimensions, detailed monitoring of eating habits, and tireless monitoring of 
birth and death of the hundreds of finches that they learned to recognize by 
sight. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiner vividly recounts how the finch population dwindles, by 85%, in response 
to a two-year drought, then rebounds as the rains return. But the finch 
population, both in terms of the survival rate among species and the 
characteristics within species, shows dramatic changes in this cycle. 
Remarkably, it is small differences in the size and shape of the beak that 
effect life or death. 
</P>
<P>
 During drought, selection favors the birds with larger beaks, mostly males, 
who can crack the larger, tougher seeds and who can attract the dwindling 
female population; beak size increases in response. When the rains come, 
producing an abundance of smaller seeds, the selection subtly changes and 
smaller beaks have an advantage. The Grants not only recorded the process of 
evolution as they watched, but through careful analysis could also identify the 
selection effects and responses. The Grants' research is a pioneering study, 
but Weiner carefully places it in context among a spectrum of other stories of 
dramatic evolution. This is a rare book: "The Beak of the Finch" is at once 
absorbing science history, deftly crafted popular science treatise and engaging 
personal narrative. Fittingly, it is beautifully illustrated by drawings by 
Charles Darwin and Thalia Grant. It has an important story to tell, not only of 
Darwin's finches and evolution but also of the way that forefront scientific 
research is carried out. And it has an important message: Humans are driving 
Darwin's process in our own modern time, from the appearance of tusk-less 
African elephants to the development of drug-resistant bacteria and 
pesticide-resistant pests. The story is told with humor and perception; the 
message is well documented and plainly stated. The book is eminently accessible 
to the lay reader but thought-provoking to the professional scientist. Both 
will find it a delight to read. In this remarkable book, Jonathan Weiner 
demonstrates that the "Book of life is still being written" and points us 
toward "the hand that writes." LOS ANGELES TIMES BOOK PRIZES / SCIENCE AND

WITH AN EYE ON . . . ; DR. FINLAY'S CASELOAD GETS LIGHTER IN HIS SECOND SEASON 
ON 'MASTERPIECE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a bit jarring when David Rintoul answers the door of a friend's house 
dressed in boots, blue jeans and a tailored white shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans of PBS' "Masterpiece Theatre" are accustomed to seeing the 45-year-old 
Scottish actor in period dress. In 1980's "Pride and Prejudice," he played Jane 
Austen's stuffy 19th-Century hero, Mr. Darcy. And in the current "Dr. Finlay," 
which begins a second season of six episodes Sunday, Rintoul stars as the 
serious-minded doctor working in a small Scottish town after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Rintoul has always had one foot in both the classical and contemporary acting 
worlds. "I left the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in 1971," he explains. 'I 
very much wanted to join a theater group. A lot of people in my generation did. 
I found one called the Joint Stock, which was very much a writer's theater 
group. We worked with writers, usually before the first draft. That was eight 
years of my life, mostly the '70s." 
</P>
<P>
 When plays weren't in production, Rintoul worked on Scottish TV. "A lot of my 
generation of Scots then were much more kind of character actors than leading 
men. So I kind of cornered the market a bit (as a leading man). I did a lot of 
costume stuff as well. It was rather odd doing this kind of classic series and 
radical theater stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1980s, though, he chose to do more classic theater, working with the 
Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre. He was doing theater in 
Sicily when he was offered the role of Dr. John Finlay three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dr. Finlay" is based on characters that Scottish writer A.J. Cronin ("The 
Citadel") created in the early 1960s for the BBC series "Dr. Finlay's 
Casebook." The original series was a huge hit. "It was set in the late '20s and 
early '30s," Rintoul explains. "It was sort of a national institution. So to 
remake it was very cheeky. I mean it could have fallen flat on its face." 
</P>
<P>
 The current "Dr. Finlay" series finds Dr. Finlay as an embittered World War II 
vet grappling with a heavy caseload of patients and his own financial 
difficulties. Concerned about the health and lives of his town's residents, he 
is an ardent supporter of the new idea of the National Health Service. Ian 
Bannen co-stars as Dr. Alexander Cameron, Finlay's older retired partner; 
Annette Crosbie plays housekeeper Janet McPherson; and Jason Flemyng is the new 
substitute physician, Dr. Neil. 
</P>
<P>
 Rintoul is pleased that the series has a somber tone. "I think part of the 
darkness of the series and part of the grittiness was quite deliberate, which 
is not to apologize for it," he says. "But which is to say, this ain't no soap 
and this isn't necessarily a comfortable chocolate-box nostalgia family show." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he says, "I think we are lightening up this year. I think he's 
lightening up. He's not a man who is completely at ease with himself or the 
world. Why should everything be all smiles?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rintoul's father happens to be a retired doctor. "He was a hospital 
consultant. He did a lot of visiting patients in their homes in rural 
communities. He's been quite pleased with the series. We have a medical 
consultant on it. But it's not a documentary; it's a drama. On the other hand, 
I pretty much wanted doctors, particularly doctors of that generation, to like 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 As a young teen, Rintoul harbored thoughts of following in his father's 
footsteps. "It went through my mind," he says. "By my mid-teens, I was pretty 
sure I wanted to do something with theater or TV." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides acting on stage and the small screen, Rintoul also reads novels for 
the popular books-on-tape format. "I've done all the James Bond novels," he 
says. "I've done most of Freddy (Frederick) Forsyth. I've done, like, 40 or 50 
books. I kind of enjoy the one-man band element of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Rintoul would like to work in America, but only "if I'm asked. I'm a bit 
impatient. I've been very lucky in that I've been working for 22 years and I 
haven't been out of work more than three or four weeks. I hate sitting around 
and doing nothing. And the idea of coming to L.A., as much as I like L.A., and 
sitting around (waiting for a job), I'd go up the wall. I enjoy being a British 
actor." 
</P>
<P>
 "Dr. Finlay" begins Sunday at 8 p.m. on KVCR , 9 p.m. on KCET and KPBS and 8 
p.m. on KOCE. A second episode airs at 10 p.m. on KCET.

ON THE SET; WEATHERING 'EARTH 2'; THE NEW MEXICO SHOOTING LOCALES ARE MUCH LIKE 
ANOTHER WORLD FOR THE CAST AND CREW OF THE NBC SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD GINGOLD, Howard Gingold is a Santa Fe-based free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cast and crew are bundled in winter clothing against a harsh wind blowing down 
the northern New Mexico mountainside near Santa Fe. 
</P>
<P>
 They've been shooting here since 7:30 in the morning most of the week, up to 
16 hours a day in wind, rain, bitter nighttime cold and bright fall sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing unusual for the actors and technicians filming "Earth 2," NBC's new 
space-adventure series. Production started in June, just as Santa Fe was 
entering its hottest summer on record. Now, early in the fall, there's already 
been snow. 
</P>
<P>
 At lunch in a drafty mess tent a few feet from the set, first-time director 
Michael Grossman is trying to wolf down a steak and trimmings. He's anxious to 
finish shooting his daytime footage before the light fades, then set up for a 
night scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've found some incredibly unusual areas in New Mexico to shoot," he says 
between bites. "We try to augment them from time to time -- like we have a 
couple of night scenes that have two moons we put in the sky." 
</P>
<P>
 Two moons? Well, this isn't Earth anymore, Toto. This is "Planet G-889," an 
earth-like orb somewhere else in the galaxy and the setting for "Earth 2's" 
space-traveling adventurers 200 years in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, New Mexico's locales for "Earth 2" don't need much "augmenting" to 
resemble another planet. They suffice pretty well on their own, thank you -- 
from a strange geological formation called Tent Rocks on the Cochiti Indian 
reservation to vertical sandstone cliffs near Tesuque; from a gypsum canyon 
near Abiquiu to dense cottonwood groves on the banks of the Rio Grande. 
</P>
<P>
 "We scouted Australia," says supervising producer Tony To, "we scouted Canada, 
we scouted all over the United States to give us a unique look, a terrain that 
was virgin and yet majestic, to remind us that we were on another planet." 
</P>
<P>
 What they found in northern New Mexico was not only spectacular otherwordly 
terrain but a vast range of climate. Just the thing for the story's characters, 
all but one of whom had never set foot on a "real" planet before they 
crash-landed on G-889. They had spent their lives on a sterile Earth-orbiting 
space colony and didn't know wind from rain or snow from dust. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really been an adventure," says To, "not just for the characters in our 
story but for the crew and cast." 
</P>
<P>
 Although "Earth 2" is based at the College of Santa Fe's Garson Studios, most 
of the series is shot outdoors, braving the kind of climate that gives 
special-effects technicians a New Mexico-size headache. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes the weather comes up and it gets too cold for things to work, 
sometimes it's too hot and things melt," special-effects coordinator Kevin Pike 
says ruefully. "You have to deal with that on a weekly basis, and I fear that 
the snow is going to be the biggest challenge that we've got coming." 
</P>
<P>
 Actor Antonio Sabato Jr. ("General Hospital"), who co-stars as a hotshot 
spaceship pilot, isn't fazed by the difficult conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to work under the circumstances," he says during a break in 
filming. "The snow, the rain, the wind, the cold -- what have I left out? I 
love it here. I really, really love it here." 
</P>
<P>
 What he left out was heat; summer temperatures sometimes soar well above 100 
degrees. This is high desert country, after all, and the weather can be 
uncertain -- blistering heat and blustery rain storms in the space of a few 
hours. But it's fall now, and the mountains that flank the high desert already 
are mantled with snow. 
</P>
<P>
 Sabato's enthusiasm for rugged locations and roller-coaster climate is shared 
by co-star Debrah Farentino ("Equal Justice," "NYPD Blue), who plays the 
expedition leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm bruised and battered from this," she says between takes of a difficult 
scene. "But that's what I love. It sure beats sitting on a sound stage." 
</P>
<P>
 A week after leaving the mountainside location, the crew sets up next to a 
towering sandstone cliff near Tesuque. 
</P>
<P>
 Equipment and commissary trucks are parked in a clearing near the highway 
between Santa Fe and Taos, but the set is a mile or so down a rutted dirt road. 
</P>
<P>
 Cameras and lights are perched precariously on the edge of an outcropping, 
directly under a sandstone overhang that looks as though it may crumble if 
someone sneezes. 
</P>
<P>
 The sun is out but the air is still frigid. Waiting to reshoot a scene with 
actor Tim Curry, child actress J. Madison Wright, who just turned 10, wears a 
ski outfit to keep warm. 
</P>
<P>
 When it's time for a take, she peels down to a light shirt and shorts because 
the scene originally was shot in summertime. She does it five or six times 
without complaint, displaying the kind of fortitude that cast and crew will 
need as the days stretch into winter. But northern New Mexico's natural beauty 
may be the buffer they need against a rigorous routine. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the most physically challenging job I've ever had," Farentino says. 
"It's also the most physically stimulating job I've ever had. We are usually 
moving all the time, hiking all the time, yet it's so much more stimulating 
than being on a stage. I love being outside -- especially in New Mexico."' 
</P>
<P>
 "Earth 2" airs Sundays at 7 p.m. on NBC.

ALSO STARRING; AT YOUR SERVICE; PROPER OR NOT, NETWORKS PIT TWO BUTLERS AGAINST 
EACH OTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Whether it's mere chance or a deliberate programming move, TV's toniest 
butlers are currently engaged in a battle of fine china over Monday's 8 p.m. 
time slot. 
</P>
<P>
 And surprisingly enough, "Fresh Prince of Bel-Air's" Joseph Marcell and "The 
Nanny's" Daniel Davis share similar backgrounds. Both actors, who are in their 
late 40s, have strong classical stage backgrounds -- Marcell as a member of the 
Royal Shakespeare Company in London and Davis as a member of state Shakespeare 
Festivals and the American Conservatory Theatre. Both have been working actors 
-- with a strong emphasis in theater -- for more than 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
 And both have had little, if any, contact with actual butlers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I've encountered any real butlers, it's purely by accident, if I strayed 
onto some well-heeled person's property," muses Marcell. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the ever-proper Niles (Davis), who attends to CBS' New York Sheffield 
family, nor the equally attendant Geoffrey (Marcell), who takes care of NBC's 
Bel-Air-based Banks family, is based on any particular person. Both Davis and 
Marcell created their characters based on the work of other actors. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcell, who grew up in London, says Geoffrey is "made up of all the butlers 
I've ever seen, from Arthur Treacher to John Gielgud to Gordon Jackson. What 
I've done is make him an amalgam and tried to make him different." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, an Arkansas native, says, "Niles isn't like anyone I've known, but 
based on a number of actors who have that English-Irish actor tradition. The 
personality comes from various people, but in particular the actor Louis 
Beachner, who had a great sense of timing." 
</P>
<P>
 Given that "Fresh Prince" has three seasons on "The Nanny," it's not 
surprising that more of Geoffrey's background has been revealed (he's actually 
a disgraced English marathon runner, caught cheating in the Olympics by the 
Queen). 
</P>

 So far, little has been revealed about Davis' Niles, since "Nanny" is only in 
its second season. The actor has come up with his story for Niles, which Davis 
says "may not particularly be shared by the writers and producers, but helps me 
play him." 
</P>
<P>
 In Davis' scenario, Niles and Maxwell (Charles Shaunessey) have had a long 
association: "I imagine they grew up in the same household, that Niles' family 
worked for Maxwell's. I think Niles went along to school to attend to Maxwell 
and ended up doing quite a bit of his homework for him, while Maxwell was the 
bon vivant. " 
</P>
<P>
 Davis says the character of Niles is "an old standby, who dates back to the 
Roman comedies, the haughty servant with the acerbic remarks, all knowing, all 
seeing, the wisdom of the family." This description fits Geoffrey as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis adds, "I tried hard to find something new to this standard. Then I 
decided I wanted him to be a member of the family. More ideas about Niles will 
come up in the story line, but the less we know, the more mysterious and funny 
he remains." 
</P>
<P>
 Geoffrey, like Niles, is "proud of what he does and is dedicated and a 
professional and has complete confidence in his abilities," Marcell notes. "But 
most importantly, Geoffrey doesn't confuse who he is with what he does." 
</P>
<P>
 Marcell, who was born on the Caribbean island of St. Lucia, emigrated with his 
family to England at age 5. To the dismay of his family -- "They had a very 
immigrant sensibility to get a stable work situation" -- he decided to become 
an actor ("which they thought was outrageously stupid"). 
</P>
<P>
 Despite success in theater and film -- he appears in the films "Cry Freedom" 
and the current release "Sioux City" -- Marcell wryly points out that his 
father didn't believe in his success until "Fresh Prince." Marcell's second 
wife, Joyce, manages a theater company in London, where she lives with their 
daughter, Jessica, 6. "The long-distance company has a statue of me in gold," 
he says of his daily phone conversations with his family. Marcell's son, Ben, 
16, lives with him in Studio City while "Fresh Prince" shoots. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, with more than 200 plays under his belt, recalls that he was still 
nervous about trying comedy. "But it's a great way to come into the door," he 
says, citing the success many television actors have had on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hardest thing for me to believe is I'm the British butler from Arkansas!" 
His theatrical background helped him develop accents and character and a broad 
emotional range that translates well into television. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis' interest in acting stems from early elocution lessons from his mother, 
which led to public speaking, then children's and community theater. He got his 
first professional role in New York at 18, and has been working ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, who hopes to direct one day, looks forward to traveling to the Greek 
Isles during the show's next hiatus. Marcell conducts Shakespearean workshops 
during down time. 
</P>
<P>
 They both find it ironic that, despite all their classical training, it's 
their butler roles on television that has gotten them the most attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've experienced recognition from people of all ages and all types . . . 
certainly more than I could ever expect," Davis says. 
</P>
<P>
 And Marcell reports, "My father, who's retired to St. Lucia, says it best: 
'Oh, Shakespeare was well and good, but because of "Fresh Prince," the whole 
world knows my son is an actor!' " 
</P>
<P>
 "The Fresh Prince of Bel - Air" airs Monday at 8 p.m. on NBC. "The Nanny" airs 
Monday at 8 p.m. on CBS.

RETRO; HAIL, 'TAXI'; BELOVED SITCOM GETS A FARE SHARE ON NICK AT NITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Taxi," one of the best sitcoms of the past two decades, is driving into the 
Nick at Nite lineup this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The acclaimed series, which aired from 1978 to 1982 on ABC and from 1982 to 
1983 on NBC, won 14 Emmy Awards, including three consecutive Emmys for best 
comedy series. 
</P>
<P>
 "Taxi" was a wonderful ensemble show, a la "The Mary Tyler Moore Show." 
Several creative folks from "MTM" were involved in "Taxi," including James L. 
Brooks, Stan Daniels, David Davis, Ed. Weinberger and Glen and Les Charles. 
</P>
<P>
 Set at the fictitious Sunshine Cab Company in New York, the series followed 
the lives of an odd assortment of cab drivers, their hotheaded boss and an 
immigrant mechanic. Judd Hirsch starred as Alex, the only full-time cabbie and 
the most rational one of the group. Marilu Henner was pretty Elaine Nardo, who 
also worked as an art gallery receptionist. Danny DeVito was the frenetic boss, 
Louie De Palma, who shouted his orders from behind his dispatcher's cage. Jeff 
Conaway was the handsome, struggling actor Bobby Wheeler. Tony Danza was Tony, 
a boxer who couldn't win a fight. The late Andy Kaufman played the mechanic 
Latka Gravas, who spoke in the most bizarre broken English. Then there was 
Christopher Lloyd's spaced-out hippie "Reverend Jim" Ignatowski. During the 
first season, Randall Carver was on hand as naive student John Burns. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides finding it a funny and well-acted series, Nick at Nite's wry 
spokesman, Dr. Will Miller, says "Taxi" is very sweet. 
</P>
<P>
 "This show, I think, was carrying on in the '80s a tradition that began with 
'Mary Tyler Moore' " in the '70s, says Dr. Miller, who, besides appearing on 
Nick at Nite, is a therapist, an ordained Baptist minister, former stand-up 
comic and host of the new NBC daytime series "The Other Side." 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's a situation where people find their primary relationships at work 
versus being at home," he explains. "That's something very unique to American 
life in the past 20 years -- where people's home lives have become more sparse 
because of mobility. They find their family, if you will, at work. Even though 
for comedy purposes (the "Taxi" characters) are drawn very broadly, nonetheless 
there's a real sweetness underlying their relationships with each other. I 
think that's why a lot of people were drawn to the show, because they relate to 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 When Dr. Miller analyzes a series, he also likes to give it a comedic, pop 
psychology spin. "'The energy in the show is Louie," he explains. "I think 
that's a powerful metaphor from a psychoanalytical point of view. The driving 
force in a human being is what Freud called the id -- the raw, primal primary 
energy. And that's Louie. Louie is a little anger ball. He's the id man. I 
think it's fitting he's in a cage. Everyone around him is trying to manage 
Louie and each one has a different strategy. Alex is the most successful 
because he's the most rational. He can get the most out of Louie. All the other 
characters, I think, somehow reflect various struggles human beings have." 
</P>
<P>
 All the characters, he says, are filled with Angst except for Reverend Jim. 
"In many ways, the wonderful character on 'Seinfeld,' Kramer, is like a 
neo-Reverend Jim," Dr. Miller says. "He seems like he might even be psychotic, 
but yet he seems oddly connected at times. These characters are very much in 
the moment. With Jim, his life is the most disintegrated in some ways, but he's 
the most happy moment to moment because he lives moment to moment." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Miller seriously believes successful series such as "Taxi," "Mary Tyler 
Moore" and "Cheers" have remained popular because they are really about 
relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our era, the past 15 years, friendships are the relationships people are 
most starving for," he says. "Not really the romantic relationships, but you 
and me as brother and sister; you and me in a family-like relationship where 
the sexual tension is gone, but yet we are very close. I think that's why these 
shows and new shows like 'Seinfeld,' are very much anchored in friendships: men 
with men, men with women in a brotherly sisterly kind of way." 
</P>
<P>
 "Taxi" airs weeknights at 10 and 10:30 p.m. on Nickelodeon.

ART OR EYESORE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to Christopher Knight's article "Not Just an Exercise in Futility" 
(Oct. 23), I would like to say that if "Ballerina Clown" constitutes public 
art, then Disneyland should be enshrined in a museum. 
</P>
<P>
 What kind of culture victim is this writer? "Ballerina Clown" is a grotesque 
mechanized plastic joke on the Venice-Santa Monica community. This is not art 
-- this is an oversized prop from "Killer Klowns From Outer Space." When it was 
first installed I could barely cross the Rose Avenue intersection without 
wanting to veer into oncoming traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 To imbue this freak show with any kind of social-political context is as 
absurd as the work itself. Many are the "dimwitted vandals" who fantasize about 
how, exactly, this monstrosity could be brought down in the event of any future 
urban unrest. Many of these "dimwits" are the very audience Knight would like 
to claim as constituents in his view of art appreciation. They are the local 
artists, writers and residents who see this sculpture as an eyesore, who from 
time to time manage with great aim and determination to bean this "artwork" 
with paint balloons. 
</P>
<P>
 I would much prefer to see the Carpeteria genie in its place. It would imply 
they were hawking carpet, not some stretched concept of "art." 
</P>
<P>
 I may not even know a lot about art, but I can tell you where you might be 
able to find the missing head from the sculpture at the Citicorp Plaza. Mr. 
Knight, could you please bend over? 
</P>

 The problem with "controversial" public art in public places, such as parks, 
is the imposition of others' taste on our unavoidable line of sight. Where such 
art is most welcome is in public and private museums and galleries. That's 
where one is forewarned and has the option of deliberately going to experience 
such art or choosing to stay away. 
</P>
<P>
 A case in point: In urban areas, open space and vistas of natural or 
landscaped settings are at such a premium that, by popular demand, a halt has 
been called to adding pieces of sculpture to MacArthur Park, an already overly 
"art-occupied" area. 
</P>
<P>
 In Beverly Hills, petitions were signed to remove "Moon Dial" from Beverly 
Gardens Park at the heavily trafficked intersection of Santa Monica Boulevard 
and Beverly Boulevard. Letters to the editor begged for the removal of "Clouds" 
from another part of the same park. People said they resented having to gaze 
upon such works while jogging or awaiting lengthy signal changes. Both have 
been removed. 
</P>
<P>
 Works of art that are required as a percentage of the cost of a private 
developer's project should be placed on the project site. That way we will not 
usurp the few visual oases we have remaining in our urban midst -- public 
parks.

<P>
 No clearer words than Christopher Knight's have illuminated the distinctions 
between success and failure of public art in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 It is true that most art in the public realm is initiated by government 
mandate and more easily approved by the powers that be when there is an 
explainable story associated with the work. However, when successful public art 
does occur, and is then succinctly addressed through articles such as Knight's, 
the road toward acceptance of the unfamiliar and the challenging is then paved 
so more magic can take place in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 As the art adviser to the owners of Citicorp Plaza, the patrons of "Corporate 
Head" and the other Poets' Walk projects, I applaud their trust in the unknown 
and specifically the dedication of Rolf Kleinhans for his never-ending support 
of a difficult endeavor. It has been my greatest joy to conceive and give 
Poets' Walk to the city of Los Angeles.

<P>
 I have no quarrel with public art, but like all art, it should come after a 
civilization can demonstrate a sufficient level of mastery in the two most 
important creative processes: creation of our own lives with balance, depth and 
insight, and creation of future citizens of planet Earth who are aware, 
responsible and involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, we have been woefully ineffective in the execution of these creative 
endeavors, which in turn deflates public art and makes it an exercise in 
futility.

PARTY POLITICS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Though I appreciate Richard Natale discussing my book "The Shadow of the 
Panther" in his story on the forthcoming Mario and Melvin Van Peebles film 
"Panther" ("Black Power in Its Glory," Oct. 30), I've grown weary of distorted 
descriptions of the book's contents, and simplistic sound bites from what I've 
told interviewers about the party as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to what Natale wrote, I never stated that my research goes against 
the scenario of an FBI and police vendetta against the Black Panthers.As David 
Hilliard made clear in the article, any elementary researcher will turn up 
plenty of evidence of a counterintelligence program against the party. What my 
book makes clear is that while there was such a vendetta, the standard leftist 
propaganda that that vendetta was responsible for destroying the party is not 
true. Genuine party members, in addition to informants, were just as 
responsible for the party's demise. 
</P>
<P>
 Though I'm convinced that the party as a whole was less than altruistic, my 
portrayal of it is complex. And my statements about the party always go beyond 
calling it a petty gang. What I have said is that the party started out as a 
petty gang, then grew beyond that, attracting not only those who were into 
gangism but also plenty of well-meaning members. Yet finally it devolved into 
something approximating a black Mafia.

BAD MEDICINE: PHONY SHAMANS PREY ON THE DESPERATE AND THE ILL; SPIRITUALITY: 
CHARLATANS OPERATE IN CITIES, FAR FROM THEIR HOMES, AND CHARGE EXORBITANT FEES. 
ASKING FOR MONEY IS THE TIP-OFF, LEGITIMATE TRIBAL HEALERS SAY -- DOING SO IS 
FORBIDDEN.

 The mystique of pulsing drums and chanting singers, healing rituals depicted 
in movies such as "Dances With Wolves," is causing headaches among authentic 
Native American medicine men. 
</P>
<P>
 Non-Indians with terminal diseases such as AIDS or cancer are seeking them out 
in growing numbers for cures. New-Agers and others, forsaking their own 
heritage, offer cash to attend spiritual ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
 Of even more concern to tribal spokesmen are what they call "plastic" medicine 
men, or frauds posing as medicine men. Often living in the cities, they charge 
exorbitant prices for healing and spiritual ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
 Indian leaders believe medicine men lose their powers and stir up evil and 
disharmony if they leave the place where the Creator gave them their powers. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of their power comes from the area where they were born," said Charles 
Cambridge, a Navajo and anthropologist who teaches ethnic studies at the 
University of Colorado in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 Cambridge belongs to the Folded Arms Clan with family lands near Shiprock, N. 
M., on the Navajo reservation. 
</P>
<P>
 Cambridge says most fraudulent medicine men fall into two categories -- 
apprentices who dropped out, and untrained people who "decided to con 
non-Indians for economic reasons." 
</P>
<P>
 He believes that when an authentic medicine man moves to the city for economic 
reasons, he has become selfish and will start losing his powers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cures and rituals people will undergo with him become dangerous because 
these rituals have become an evil force -- everything that is done becomes 
disruptive instead of healing," Cambridge said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Two Dogs, a respected Oglala Lakota medicine man at Porcupine on the Pine 
Ridge Reservation in South Dakota, traces his medicine-man lineage back at 
least 250 years. 
</P>
<P>
 He says when he received his vision, he was told to stay there and help his 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are an authentic medicine man, the powers you draw from the Earth are 
here; the people we are supposed to help are here," said Two Dogs. "The gift to 
heal follows the blood line." 
</P>
<P>
 "After the movie 'Dances With Wolves,' we've had a lot of people with Sioux 
blood using that as a springboard to line their own pockets" by posing as 
spiritual healers, said Tim Giago, an Oglala Lakota and publisher of Indian 
Country Today in Rapid City, S.D. 
</P>
<P>
 His newspaper has an ongoing series of stories about the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is like someone showed up in Denver with a black robe and white collar 
saying he's an ordained Catholic priest, simply because it's something he 
thinks he should do," Giago said. 
</P>
<P>
 He says heredity is the true test of a shaman, or medicine man. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can find a medicine man who started three or four years ago because he 
had a dream, that's a bunch of baloney," Giago said. "It takes decades of 
instruction to become a legitimately recognized holy man of any tribe." 
</P>
<P>
 The charging of fees -- up to thousands of dollars to "cure" a terminally ill 
AIDS or cancer patient -- is the big tip-off the medicine man is a fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 "Traditional medicine men are not allowed to charge a fee," said Two Dogs. "If 
people want to give us something, we'll accept it. But we can't ask for a fee." 
</P>
<P>
 Such gifts usually include tobacco, food, clothing or other useful items, to 
show respect and appreciation for the medicine man's service. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Dogs, 43, says the last two years has seen a sharp increase in non-Indians 
seeking out medicine men, but the trend began a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Dogs says terminally ill white people approach him on the reservation for 
cures. Others ask him to teach them the Lakota spiritual ways. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had people approach me with cancer and a few people with AIDS, but I 
said I can't help them," Two Dogs said. The first thing they would say is, 'I 
would give you $5,000 or $10,000. . . . ' I say, 'I can't help you because of 
the way you approached me. It is not a question of money.' 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of them want to learn the spiritual ways. I say, 'I can't teach you 
these ways. . . . You can pray in any way you want to, but to learn the true 
Lakota way you must be a Lakota.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Many passing themselves off as medicine men will mix approaches" used by 
different tribes, said John Compton, an elder of the Brule Sioux of the Rosebud 
Reservation in South Dakota and now a director in the federally funded National 
Native Elders Health Care Resource Center in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 "More and more stuff is being published by these people. Sun Bear made big 
bucks selling a lot of how-to-do-it books. This is sad because a lot of people 
out there really are seeking guidance and spiritual renewal and they're ripe 
for this kind of stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Knight, 45, spiritual spokesman for the Ute Mountain Ute tribe in 
southwestern Colorado and son of a respected Ute medicine man, Charley Knight, 
describes himself as a "fledgling ceremonial person." 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people rush into this with the intent of making money and being 
recognized as a medicine man," Knight said. "The true medicine man is not into 
that. It's a lifelong job, a 24-hour-a-day job, a very tough job. I'm in no 
hurry to become a medicine man." 
</P>
<P>
 Knight said he has been approached by non-Indians to perform ceremonies "and 
it's very tempting indeed. But I just tell them I can't do it. It would just be 
sacrilegious." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how a Ute becomes a medicine man, Knight replied: "It's up to the 
Creator and the grandfather spirit that will approve and say you are worthy. . 
. . You've got to have the gift from the Creator and grow into it."

CRIME, SUSPICION OF FOREIGNERS TRAIL RUSSIANS TO CYPRUS; MEDITERRANEAN: ISLE 
BENEFITS FROM THE MISERY AND INSTABILITY, ATTRACTING CAPITAL AND MONEYED 
REFUGEES. 
</P>

<P>
 Even before the kidnaping of his two sons, Roman Minayev was fed up with 
Moscow thuggery. He paid the ransom, packed up his family and moved to Cyprus 
six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble is, he may not have gotten away from Russian gangsters. At least 
that is a growing suspicion among Cypriots who find their serene Mediterranean 
island being inundated by Russians. 
</P>
<P>
 Cyprus traditionally benefits from the misery and instability around it, 
attracting capital and moneyed refugees from hot spots in the Middle East, 
Africa and Eastern Europe. The Russians, however, are viewed as a mixed 
blessing. 
</P>
<P>
 The fuss is not over people like Minayev, a Ukrainian former seaman who 
started a construction business near Moscow. He lives quietly in the beach 
resort of Paphos, running his company by fax and an occasional three-hour 
flight to the Russian capital. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel safe here," he said in his living room while playing a videotaped 
violin recital by his 11-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is over Russians and other former Soviets, like the dozen deported 
recently on suspicion of extortion, and over allegations of money laundering 
here by Russian mobsters. 
</P>
<P>
 Newspapers estimate up to 2,000 Russian trading companies, banks and other 
businesses have set up shop in Cyprus, taking advantage of tax breaks designed 
to lure foreign enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Russia's new rich flock to the island as tourists and spend 
lavishly. One of them, Vladimir Korolev of Moscow, ran his eyes over the 
colorfully garbed crowd at the airport and said with amazement: "It seems 
almost every other person is Russian." 
</P>
<P>
 They pay cash for gold watches, jewelry and satellite dishes, delighting the 
merchants. Travel agents say the Russians are beginning to make up for 
penny-pinching Britons, who account for the bulk of visitors to the former 
colony. 
</P>
<P>
 The forecast of 2 million tourists this year includes 80,000 Russians, and not 
all Cypriots are thrilled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Twenty years ago, you would never have dreamed of anything like this: Russian 
Mafia, crime and all," said Andie Christophorou, a public relations 
representative. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonid Nikolov, an ethnic Greek electronics repairman from the former Soviet 
republic of Georgia, said Cypriots had withdrawn the red carpet they rolled out 
when he arrived two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nowadays," he said, "when I go into the home of a Cypriot to do some work and 
they ask me if I'm Russian, and I say, 'Sort of,' they start complaining that 
all Russians are Mafiosi." 
</P>
<P>
 News reports that Russian criminals use Cyprus to launder billions of dirty 
rubles struck a nerve at the Central Bank, which last year indignantly denied 
allegations that the island was a sanctions-busting clearinghouse for Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
 "If only a fraction of the reports on Cyprus were true, then the island would 
be the world's center of crime, depravity and unscrupulous dealings. . . . This 
is patently absurd," bank spokesman George Georgiou said. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, the Independent newspaper in London quoted Cypriot bankers it did 
not identify as voicing suspicions that much of the Russian money deposited on 
the island was from Moscow criminal gangs and illegal Middle Eastern arms 
dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgiou said it was impossible to launder criminal profits in Cyprus because 
of government restrictions that include mandatory reporting of bank 
transactions over $10,000.

PIT BULLS IN DRUG DEALERS' FIERCE CANINE CORPS; CRIME: FEROCIOUS DOGS ARE BEING 
USED IN HIGH- STAKES AND ILLEGAL DOGFIGHTS AT THE SAME TIME AS THEY SERVE AS 
THE WEAPONS OF CHOICE, 'FOUR-LEGGED GUNS.'

 Sherry DeGenova cringes each time she sees a snarling pit bull being paraded 
down the street, a common sight in inner cities across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's terrible what's being done to these dogs," said DeGenova, kennel manager 
at the Hartford Animal Control Shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 More and more, she said, the dogs are being used against other pit bulls in 
illegal, high-stakes dogfights. Then, when they have been defeated and maimed, 
the injured animals are abandoned and left to roam the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Warring drug dealers also train the dogs to be killers and then use them as 
"four-legged guns." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing a disturbing new trend, a nationwide trend. Members of street 
gangs are using pit bulls as status symbols and as weapons," said Rachel Lamb, 
a spokeswoman for the Humane Society of the U.S., based in Washington, D.C. 
"It's a huge problem in Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 In the nation's capital, the Humane Society's dog pound destroys as many as 10 
to 15 pit bulls each month, said Rosemary Vozobule, director of humane law 
enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are dogs we've found running down the street or left abandoned in 
boarded-up houses," she said. "In some areas of the city there are dogfights 
every single night." 
</P>
<P>
 In Hartford, the dog pound recently had to destroy six pit bulls confiscated 
at an impromptu dogfight in the inner city. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the cases of many of these dogs, it's doing them a favor to put them to 
sleep, considering how they've been treated during their lives," DeGenova said. 
</P>
<P>
 Illegal "back-yard breeders" beat their dogs and bind their legs to make them 
more vicious, she said. They wrap heavy chains around the puppies to build up 
their chests, and sometimes even pen their pit bulls with smaller dogs and 
encourage the pit bulls to tear apart the weaker dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Dog wardens say most of the abandoned pit bulls are either too maimed or too 
vicious to be eligible for adoption. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bridgeport, Connecticut's largest city, the situation is totally out of 
control, said Ralph Corson, the city's chief animal control officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have pit bulls in our shelters that are absolutely wild," Corson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pit bulls are the dog of choice among the gangs now. They use them like 
four-legged guns," he said, adding that the gangs have begun breaking into the 
pound and stealing pit bulls that have been picked up on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 In one recent month, eight pit bulls were stolen from the Bridgeport animal 
shelter and from other shelters around the state, said Richard Johnson, 
president of the Connecticut Humane Society. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said some of the dogs were used as bait to help train other pit bulls 
for high-stakes fights that are held in housing project courtyards and back 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are talking about thousands of dollars that can change hands in one of 
these contests," he said. "That would certainly convince someone to break into 
a shelter and steal a dog." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is not confined to the East Coast. In California, macho dope 
dealers frequently use pit bulls for protection and prestige, said Glenn 
Howell, animal control director for the city of Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of pit-bull fighting in East Oakland, and last year a police 
officer was shot to death when he tried to confiscate a dog that had bitten 
someone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartford canine control officer Jerry Cloutier, who recently arrested two 
teen-agers after coming upon a dogfight, said staged dogfights have become a 
popular form of entertainment among drug dealers and gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 He said a pit bull can be one of several types of fighting dogs, including the 
American Staffordshire terrier and the bull terrier. The dogs, which have 
massive chests, large heads and powerful jaws, are extremely combative and 
often will fight to the death. 
</P>
<P>
 Pit bulls have been banned in Miami, Fla., where it has been a crime to own 
one for the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Humane Society of the United States said the problem isn't so much the 
dogs themselves as the irresponsible breeders and owners who encourage them to 
become vicious and train them to kill other animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Rachel Lamb said the Humane Society has worked for years to wipe out organized 
dog fighting, which is illegal throughout the country and a felony in most 
states. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a great deal of success against organized dog fighting, which 
usually occurs in the South," Lamb said. "In some Southern states there are 
dog-fighting clubs that actually put out newsletters." 
</P>
<P>
 "But," she added, "it's almost impossible to get a handle on these impromptu 
dogfights that are proliferating among the urban gangs; it's very frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 In Coventry, a small town east of Hartford, abandoned pit bulls have found a 
friend in Sharon Veci. She has taken it upon herself to try to find homes for 
some of the abandoned dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of these dogs, when they're finally rescued, have to be put down," Veci 
said. "They'll attack any dog they get close to, and you just can't trust them. 
But if you get them young enough, or if they haven't been mistreated and taught 
to fight, they can make wonderful, gentle pets. They're incredibly loyal." 
</P>
<P>
 Veci became an advocate for the breed after adopting two pit bulls from the 
Hartford pound several years ago. She named them Rita and Ely. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell potential adopters that while they're great family dogs they're also 
independent, sort of like big cats," she said. "And they're not fantastic with 
strangers. My husband and I haven't done a lot of entertaining since Rita and 
Ely came to live with us."

FIERY DEATH AWAITS LAST REMAINING SAMPLES OF DEADLY SMALLPOX VIRUS; MEDICINE: 
STOCKS OF THE FEARED PATHOGEN ARE SECURED IN FREEZERS IN RUSSIA, U.S. THEY ARE 
TO BE SIMULTANEOUSLY DESTROYED NEXT YEAR, EXTERMINATING A SPECIES.

 There will be no last-minute reprieve for smallpox, no candlelight protest of 
supporters outside its guarded prison. 
</P>
<P>
 A scourge of humanity for more than 3,500 years, smallpox has just eight 
months to live before it is burned like a medieval witch. 
</P>
<P>
 Death will come early on June 30 as scientists, dignitaries and public health 
officials in Atlanta and Russia oversee the first deliberate destruction of a 
species so vile it has been called "Spotted Death" and "The Great Fire." 
</P>
<P>
 The execution date was set in September by a panel of scientists with the 
World Health Organization who believe that, if the smallpox virus somehow 
escaped, it could wreak havoc on an unvaccinated world. 
</P>
<P>
 Some researchers object to deliberately destroying an entire species of virus, 
particularly one that might teach them how to fight other diseases. But 
scientists have produced harmless clones of DNA fragments of the smallpox virus 
and are satisfied they have the full genetic blueprint. 
</P>
<P>
 Few, other than researchers interested in smallpox, will mourn the loss of the 
virus. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only reason one might be concerned would be losing a biological species 
from the Earth deliberately," said Dr. Brian Mahy of the federal Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention. "I can see the argument whether man has the 
right to protect his species from another. To wipe out a species is always a 
concern." 
</P>
<P>
 The death sentence affects all of the known remaining stocks of smallpox, 
about 400 samples locked in special freezers at the CDC in Atlanta and another 
200 or so at Russia's State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology. 
</P>
<P>
 Smallpox killed up to 600,000 people a year in Europe from the 16th Century 
through the 18th Century. A vaccine was discovered in the 1790s, but it took 
nearly 200 years of immunizations to wipe smallpox out. 
</P>
<P>
 The virus's own lifestyle played a large role in the success of a worldwide 
effort to eradicate it within three decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "The virus has a remarkable propensity to spread from human to human," Mahy 
said. "It's a virus that can be spread by . . . a blanket from a person with 
lesions to another person. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem the virus had was that it had only one host -- which was a human. 
Viruses which have only a single host . . . in theory are eradicable, because 
it's possible to eradicate all of the virus from humans and then the virus gets 
lost from the world." 
</P>
<P>
 All it takes is a government-issued autoclave to kill smallpox forever, a 
process that will take two hours, according to guidelines developed by WHO. New 
equipment will not be purchased, Mahy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We autoclave masses of glassware, tubes of various types, in order to 
sterilize it," said Mahy, who will help oversee smallpox's destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Smallpox will spend its last minutes alongside plates of sturdy bacteria, 
whose death will confirm that smallpox is no more. 
</P>
<P>
 The execution will be watched by officials at both labs via satellite, and it 
probably will be videotaped. Those present will be vaccinated against the 
dreaded illness. 
</P>
<P>
 The CDC's stock is kept in a liquid nitrogen freezer in Room 318B in a 
maximum-security laboratory building near the Emory University campus. The last 
civilian to see the room, a reporter for the London Times, said in 1991 that 
the samples were kept in a silvery blue freezer that is chained, padlocked and 
wrapped with yards of duct tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Under elaborate security measures -- the CDC won't give exact details -- the 
virus will be taken from the freezer to the autoclave. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers will wear pressurized spacesuits as they pass the test tubes 
into a large autoclave built into the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 The autoclave will automatically heat up to 266 degrees Fahrenheit for 40 
minutes and then repeat the process. Its cycle cannot be stopped. When the 
cycle is complete, scientists will remove the incinerated smallpox samples and 
bacteria from the back of the machine, and their deaths will be confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's extremely encouraging from a public health point of view that it's so 
simple to kill smallpox," Mahy said. 
</P>
<P>
 The last case of naturally occurring smallpox was in Somalia in 1977. Experts 
have recommended since 1986 that the virus be eliminated to prevent its 
accidental release or its use as a biological weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent advances in gene sequencing bolstered that argument. CDC researchers 
have now mapped three strains of the smallpox virus, creating a library of 
information that once would have been available only from the virus itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to rid the world of smallpox has not received final approval, but 
it is mostly just a formality. The final sentence will come in May at a meeting 
of WHO's full assembly of 180 countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The WHO panel that recommended smallpox's destruction has also suggested that 
500,000 doses of smallpox vaccine be kept on hand for emergencies, should the 
virus crop up from an unknown source.

WEIGHT TRAINING MAY BENEFIT DIABETICS; HEALTH: STUDIES INDICATE THAT 
DOCTOR-SUPERVISED WEIGHTLIFTING COULD AID THE BODY'S PROCESSING OF INSULIN IN 
NON-INSULIN- DEPENDENT PATIENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Lifting weights may help to control the most common form of diabetes, 
researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
 Two studies indicate that weight training aids the body in making more 
efficient use of the insulin it produces, which could fight development or 
worsening of non-insulin-dependent diabetes. This condition is estimated to 
account for about 90% of diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
 In non-insulin-dependent diabetes, the pancreas' insulin-producing cells do 
not work well enough to produce the hormone in amounts needed, and the body is 
not able to break down enough glucose, a sugar that cells need for fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially in its early stages, this form of diabetes usually can be 
controlled by diet and exercise under a doctor's supervision. 
</P>
<P>
 Aerobic exercise, which burns glycogen, a form of glucose that is stored in 
muscles, is the type of exercise typically recommended. But reports in the 
American Physiological Society's Journal of Applied Physiology add to evidence 
that weight training works as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably an effect on muscle," said researcher Matthew S. Hickey of East 
Carolina University in Greenville, N.C. "Insulin will bind to muscle and tell 
it to take up the glucose from the blood." 
</P>
<P>
 While he was at Ball State University in Muncie, Ind., Hickey worked on one of 
the journal studies. In this project, researchers looked at 17 people, seven of 
whom were diabetes patients. The diabetes patients averaged 53 years of age, 
not unusual in a disease that typically does not manifest itself until after 
30. Of the healthy subjects, seven were around 27 and the rest were around 51. 
</P>
<P>
 The subjects were tested to see the maximum amount of weight they could lift 
at one try, and were later given a workout, based on their maximums, that would 
be strenuous enough to leave them tired. Before the one-time maximal lifts and 
the workout, the subjects drank 75 grams of glucose. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen hours after the workout, diabetic and non-diabetic patients both 
showed a decrease in total insulin response with no change in the amount of 
glucose in the blood, the report said. This indicates the body was able to use 
insulin more efficiently after exercise in holding the glucose level steady, 
the study says. 
</P>
<P>
 Using exercise to make the body more insulin-efficient could help to counter 
the progression of diabetes, Hickey said. In the condition's early stages, the 
body typically responds to an oversupply of glucose by stimulating 
overproduction of insulin, which burns out the pancreatic cells that make the 
hormone. This creates an insulin shortage later. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes are about what would be expected for a single session of aerobic 
exercise, Hickey said. But this is the first study to see such changes for a 
single session of weight training, the study reported. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate report, researchers at the University of Maryland and the 
Baltimore Veterans Affairs Medical Center found that strength training 
increased insulin action and lowered insulin levels in the blood of healthy men 
ages 50 to 65. 
</P>
<P>
 The change was "as good as you get with aerobic exercise training," said Dr. 
Richard E. Pratley, diabetes researcher with the National Institutes of Health 
in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 While Hickey and Pratley see advantages to weight training, they also see it 
as something that should be done with a doctor's approval in addition to, not 
instead of, aerobics. Hickey suggests that weight training be structured for 
them like aerobics, with low weight levels and high numbers of repetitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Weight training performed improperly can boost blood pressure, and high blood 
pressure is a problem for diabetics, Hickey said. Pratley is especially 
concerned about the possible effects on the eye, because blindness is a common 
result of diabetes.

U.S. LAW LIMITS ADOPTION OF FOREIGN CHILDREN; IMMIGRATION: THE NEWLY DRAFTED 
RULE CONCERNS COUNTRIES THAT DO NOT RECOGNIZE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LEGITIMATE 
AND ILLEGITIMATE BIRTHS. AMERICANS WHO WANT TO ADOPT MUST GET PERMISSION OF 
BOTH PARENTS -- EVEN IF ONE IS UNKNOWN.

 Sgt. Wilfred Cain and his wife had spent 18 months haggling with officials in 
Panama to adopt a baby boy. They thought bringing their son to the United 
States would be a breeze by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 They were wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 The day the Cains got the adoption papers, Oct. 10, they learned the United 
States had changed its immigration laws 10 days earlier. Two-year-old Cameron 
no longer qualified for a visa, and the Cains may not be able to leave Panama 
with him. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cains, who have reared Cameron since he was 6 months old, are tangled in a 
new rule that adoption agency officials say could affect thousands of 
adoptions, particularly in Central and South America. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought the nightmare of this red tape was over, but it's just the 
beginning of another nightmare that continues today," Cain, a native of 
Brockton, Mass., said in a telephone interview from Panama. 
</P>
<P>
 The new rule concerns countries such as Panama and Romania that do not 
recognize a difference between legitimate and illegitimate births. As of Oct. 
1, the United States considers all births in those countries to be legitimate, 
meaning both parents can be accounted for. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Americans trying to adopt babies from these countries must get the 
approval of both parents, or the custodial parent must prove the other parent 
is dead or has abandoned the family. The problem is that often, no one knows 
who both the parents are. 
</P>
<P>
 "In theory, this is to prevent the possibility that the other parent would try 
to recover the child," said Rick Kenny, a spokesman for the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
 "But, in practice, in cases where the mother is giving up the child and 
doesn't name the father, this creates a problem for immigration because we 
can't take the word of one parent." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the Cains' story: Cameron's natural mother is a Panamanian Indian 
living in poverty. She signed a letter of permission for the Cains to adopt her 
son. She says she does not know where the boy's father is. 
</P>
<P>
 The new rules mean the Cains have to wait two years before they can take their 
son out of his native country, in case his father wants custody. Failing to 
show up after two years is sufficient proof of abandonment. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Cains cannot wait long. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilfred Cain's Air Force posting in Panama City ends Nov. 21, and he and his 
wife and their two biological daughters are being moved to Florida. Cain said 
he was supposed to move in April, but the military gave him an extension 
because of the adoption. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cains could proceed with the adoption if they go to Florida, but Cameron 
would have to stay in Panama until the waiting period expires. He would be 
turned over to the state, left in foster care or returned to his birth mother 
in the meantime. 
</P>
<P>
 Adoption agencies that handle foreign placements say the law is so new that 
they don't know yet which countries are affected. The State Department is 
compiling a list of the countries that don't make a distinction between 
legitimate and illegitimate birth, said Linda Perilstein, executive director of 
the Cradle of Hope Adoption Center in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Perilstein criticized the new INS rule as unnecessarily rigid and prejudiced 
against countries that allow private adoptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Agencies are really worried. In Central and South America, it could affect 
thousands," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 INS and adoption officials said they knew of only one other case like that of 
the Cains -- and it's had a happy ending. 
</P>
<P>
 Deborah and Martin Goldstein of Fairfax, Va., had trouble getting their 
adopted son, Matthew, out of Romania. The Goldsteins had to leave the toddler 
behind for 10 days in foster care until Oct. 27, when INS granted the boy 
humanitarian parole status. The boy has since joined the Goldsteins. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cains are hoping for humanitarian parole for their son, too, which would 
allow him to stay with them in the United States during the two-year waiting 
period. The adoption wouldn't be final until after the two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The two years begin from the time the adoption papers are filed in the United 
States, which the Cains have not yet done. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Macdonald, director of the International Social Service American Branch 
Inc., said the new ruling is another reason U.S. citizens must be cautious when 
they try to adopt foreign babies. 
</P>
<P>
 "You would be astounded by the number of calls we get. It's heartbreaking," 
Macdonald said. "Most Americans assume, 'I'm American, this is my kid. What's 
the big deal?' Then they suddenly discover their baby doesn't qualify as an 
orphan." 
</P>
<P>
 Cain says the Air Force briefed him on all U.S. immigration rules before he 
took the adoption to the Panamanian courts last spring. But he says no one told 
him when the rules changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought if we were going to bring another life into this world, we would 
take one who was already here and needed a home," Cain said. "We thought it 
would be easier."

STUDY BACKS CARDIOLOGISTS OVER GENERALISTS; MEDICINE: HEART SPECIALISTS ARE 
MORE LIKELY THAN FAMILY DOCTORS TO PROVIDE THE LATEST AND MOST AGGRESSIVE CARE 
FOR HEART ATTACKS, RESEARCHERS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Heart specialists are more likely than family doctors to provide the latest 
and most aggressive kinds of care for heart attacks, the nation's most common 
medical emergency, a study concludes. 
</P>
<P>
 Its authors question the often-repeated belief that more medical care should 
be turned over to general doctors. In this case, at least, it appears that 
greater medical knowledge actually does translate into better care. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, a variety of research has shown that clot-dissolving drugs 
and aspirin can reduce the severity of heart attacks. Furthermore, long-term 
treatment afterward with aspirin and drugs called beta blockers can also save 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The new study attempted to see whether these widely accepted practices are 
actually being followed by doctors who treat heart attacks. It turns out that 
generally they are, but the chances of getting state-of-the-art care are better 
if the doctor is a cardiologist. 
</P>
<P>
 "For drugs that are clearly shown to benefit patients, cardiologists were more 
likely to recognize their benefit and to use them in practice," said Dr. John 
Z. Ayanian of Harvard Medical School, one of the researchers. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea that specialists know more about a specific area of medicine than 
their generalist colleagues may not seem like a surprise. But until now, there 
has been little evidence that their expertise leads to healthier patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Heart attacks are the nation's biggest killer. This year, they will strike 1.5 
million Americans and kill about one-third of them. Victims are routinely seen 
by cardiologists in large hospitals, but not necessarily in smaller ones. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest study, based on a survey of 1,211 physicians in New York and Texas, 
was published in the Oct. 27 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. The 
doctors compared the approach of cardiologists with that of general internists 
and family practitioners. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the findings: 
</P>
<P>
 * 94% of cardiologists said they were very likely to prescribe clot-dissolving 
drugs for heart attack victims, compared with 82% of internists and 77% of 
family practitioners. 
</P>
<P>
 * About 90% of the general doctors said they would give aspirin, which has 
become a mainstay of heart attack treatment, compared with nearly all of 
cardiologists. 
</P>
<P>
 * Beta blockers were routinely prescribed by half of the family practitioners, 
two-thirds of the internists and three-quarters of the cardiologists. 
</P>
<P>
 * The generalists were more likely than the specialists to use two drugs that 
are worthless and perhaps even hazardous for heart-attack patients. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers speculated that although general doctors may know about the 
newer approaches to heart attack care, they may be reluctant to use them 
because they fear triggering side effects that they cannot control. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of specialists of all kinds has risen dramatically in recent times, 
while the growth in general doctors has been much slower. Currently about 30% 
of all U.S. physicians are generalists, compared with 43% 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the goals of the failed Clinton Administration's health care reform was 
a sharp increase in the proportion of family doctors. Many believe they provide 
adequate care at lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Health maintenance organizations and other managed care plans also stress the 
importance of using general doctors to coordinate care. They routinely limit 
patients' freedom to see specialists as a way of keeping down costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Elliot M. Antman said the Harvard study, which he co-authored, suggests 
this may be bad for the sick. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we are not smart enough to protect patients' access to some of our best 
physicians," he wrote, "we will all be losers."

ADS ON TEAM UNIFORMS RESCUE SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are ads on school team uniforms and ads in high school hallways, and 
even the yellow buses of School District 11 have turned into to roving 
billboards for 7-Up, Burger King and other companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we were not so short of money, we wouldn't have to do stuff like this," 
said Tracy Cooper, a spokeswoman for El Paso County's District 11."We'll 
consider anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Amendment 1, passed two years ago, caps local governments' growth, so the 
32,000-student district, the state's fourth largest, had to look for new 
sources of funds, Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ads have raised about $54,000 since the first one went up in September, 1993. 
That might seem like pocket change for a district with a $133-million budget 
this year, but voters haven't approved a bond issue or new tax for the school 
in 22 years. 
</P>
<P>
 No public outcry has materialized.

SHIFT OF REFUELING TANKERS TO CROWDED AIR FORCE BASES RAISES EYEBROWS; 
MILITARY: MOVE TO MCGUIRE AIR FORCE BASE IN NEW JERSEY WILL COST $150 MILLION 
TO $270 MILLION, CRITICS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nineteen Air Force cargo jets as big as wide-bodies are being moved from their 
Louisiana home to a New Jersey base that has neither the facilities to handle 
them nor the airspace they need to fly formations. 
</P>
<P>
 The move to McGuire Air Force Base, which runs contrary to an Air Force 
recommendation, will cost taxpayers at least $150 million, and some estimates 
approach $270 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say politics are behind the shift. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an absolutely goofy decision," said Sen. J. Bennett Johnston (D-La.), 
whose state is one of two losing the planes. "McGuire should have been closed. 
They were looking for a way to keep McGuire open." 
</P>
<P>
 The big jets, called KC-10s, carry huge amounts of cargo and can refuel B-52s 
aloft. For 13 years, they've been housed at Barksdale Air Force Base outside 
Bossier City, La., at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in North Carolina, and at 
March Air Force Base in California. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the Air Force finishes moving them around in early 1996, its fleet 
of 59 KC-10s will be stationed almost entirely at McGuire and at California's 
Travis Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, a commission appointed by Congress to determine which military 
bases should be closed, and do it without political influence, vetoed an Air 
Force recommendation to downgrade McGuire to a reserve facility, which would 
have cut more than 3,500 military and civilian jobs in central New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 The Air Force wanted to move the KC-10s to Plattsburgh Air Force Base in 
Upstate New York. The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission, however, 
voted not only to keep McGuire open but to upgrade it with the KC-10 post and 
an additional 2,600 jobs. Plattsburgh was ordered closed. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission's chairman then was James Courter, a former New Jersey 
congressman. 
</P>
<P>
 Courter, now in private legal practice in northern New Jersey, did not return 
repeated calls from the Associated Press. But at the time the McGuire decision 
was announced, he said, "I get criticized either way. If my votes hurt New 
Jersey, then I'm demonstrating my independence. If my vote helps the state, I'm 
not independent." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the move was politically dictated," retired Lt. Gen. Edgar Harris of 
Bossier City, a former 8th Air Force commander, said in an interview. "The 
location of the KC-10s there is going to be expensive." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Jim Saxton (R-N.J.) argues that the impetus for the move was not politics 
but the Air Force's own restructuring decision that required putting KC-10s on 
both coasts. He said McGuire was clearly the cheapest location for the East 
Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Is the Air Force wasting money by moving the jets from Barksdale? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not expert enough to know whether the answer is yes or no," said Saxton, 
whose district includes McGuire. "But the Air Force decided it is 
(cost-efficient). I'm not going to second-guess them." 
</P>
<P>
 Saxton put the cost of the switch at less than $150 million; Johnston 
estimated about $180 million. But an Air Force source with expertise in B-52 
and KC-10 operations, speaking on condition of anonymity, estimated that the 
eventual costs of upgrading McGuire and flying the KC-10s out of New Jersey 
could push the price tag to at least $270 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnston and critics in the Air Force assert that McGuire, even after an 
estimated $154.3 million in alterations, may never be suitable for handling the 
jets. Among the potential problems alleged by Air Force sources, all of whom 
spoke on condition of anonymity: 
</P>
<P>
 * McGuire is within one of the nation's heaviest air traffic corridors, just 
35 miles from Philadelphia's airport and roughly 50 miles from the busy skies 
over northern New Jersey and New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 The Air Force requires KC-10 pilots to practice drills flying up to four of 
the jets in formation. "When we talked with the local air traffic control 
people about that, they just laughed," one Air Force source said. "They said 
there was no way." 
</P>
<P>
 KC-10 training normally ranges over hundreds of miles, with uncluttered 
airspace an obvious advantage. One Air Force source said that a refueling 
practice involving B-52s and KC-10s from McGuire in September had to fly all 
the way to Arkansas to find enough free airspace to perform the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Saxton said potential airspace problems had been "thoroughly explored" by the 
base closure commission and the Federal Aviation Administration, which 
concluded that "it would not be a significant problem." 
</P>
<P>
 * McGuire, in the congested corridor, doesn't offer enough clearance for fully 
loaded KC-10s to take off. Sending the planes aloft could require an expensive, 
time-consuming piggyback operation, described by the senior Air Force source: 
"You probably will have to have two KC-10s take off at the same time and have 
one fuel the other. It doesn't make a lot of sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Saxton disagreed, saying McGuire's runway can handle fully loaded KC-10s. 
</P>
<P>
 * Operating the jets in New Jersey's colder weather will drive up costs. One 
Air Force source cited the return flight of a KC-10 from McGuire to Barksdale 
last February; the plane required seven truckloads of de-icing fluid before it 
could take off, which cost $39,200. If the KC-10s continue to make 10 flights a 
day, as they do at Barksdale, winter de-icing costs at McGuire could run 
$392,000 a day, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 * McGuire lacks a hangar large enough for KC-10 maintenance, the sophisticated 
fueling system the big planes require, and a drainage system capable of 
handling large quantities of hazardous de-icing chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, particularly during the Cold War when B-52s were on 24-hour 
alert, the bombers were almost always housed with the KC-10s. 
</P>
<P>
 After the fall of the Soviet Union, the Air Force broke the Strategic Air 
Command into two groups: the Air Combat Command and the Air Mobility Command. 
The bombers are now under ACC, while AMC handles the tanker-cargo jets. The Air 
Force said clustering KC-10s on the East and West coasts would make deployment 
in times of foreign crises easier. 
</P>
<P>
 The Air Force wanted Plattsburgh to be its East Coast "air mobility" base, but 
the commission overruled the recommendation and chose to upgrade McGuire for 
that role. 
</P>
<P>
 McGuire is also getting a center to train air mobility personnel, an operation 
that was previously divided among six facilities around the country, and an 
operations group that specializes in setting up air bases in war zones, Saxton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the long term, there's no question that that's going to save money," 
Saxton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barksdale was not abandoned. As part of the switch, the Louisiana base will be 
doing all B-52 training and getting more B-52s. Johnston initially approved the 
new alignment because of the 25 additional bombers, for a total of 60. But 
after the early estimate was cut back to 35 bombers total, he became a vocal 
critic. 
</P>
<P>
 The Air Force recently increased the number of bombers at Barksdale to 49. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the base closure and realignment system, Congress votes an entire 
package of base decisions either up or down. Lawmakers do not know the 
recommendations until the committee issues them and the moves are "a done 
deal," Johnston said. 
</P>
<P>
 All of Barksdale's 19 KC-10s had transferred to McGuire by late October. 
Nevertheless, Johnston says he'll try to get the McGuire move reversed next 
year when the base closure panel considers its next set of realignments.

N.Y. POLICE TOLD: LOOK SHARP, BE SHARP, TOTE GUN; COMMISSIONER: SINCE TAKING 
OVER, WILLIAM BRATTON HAS SOUGHT TO RID THE DEPARTMENT OF THE IMAGE OF A 
BUREAUCRATIC BEHEMOTH MIRED IN SCANDAL AND LETHARGY. 
</P>

<P>
 The morning sun hangs low, but East Harlem already is like a sauna gone 
haywire. 
</P>
<P>
 The streets inflict a sweaty misery on drug dealers, the cops arresting them, 
bystanders -- everyone, it seems, except Police Commissioner William Bratton. 
</P>
<P>
 His white dress shirt crisp, his loafers tasseled, Bratton steps out of a 
chauffeured black sedan and into a sneaker shop where officers have found bags 
of marijuana stashed in hoods of Malcolm X sweat shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 Two suspects with their hands up against a wall glance back at Bratton as he 
explains a crackdown on storefront drug-dealing to a group of reporters. After 
15 minutes, he heads to his car, pausing only to inspect an officer's 
disheveled uniform and antiquated revolver. 
</P>
<P>
 "See how his gun hangs too low on his belt?" Bratton frets. "Not what I like 
to see." 
</P>
<P>
 Fighting crime may be a dirty job, but the leader of the nation's largest 
police department thinks it's important to look good doing it. 
</P>
<P>
 Since taking over the 31,000-officer New York City Police Department in 
January, Bratton, 47, has sought to make over the image of a department viewed 
by some as a bureaucratic behemoth mired in scandal and lethargy. 
</P>
<P>
 Early on, Bratton used outside donations to hire a private communications 
consultant, and picked a former television reporter as his chief spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 He later installed a new set of fortysomething top chiefs to -- borrowing a 
buzzword from corporate America -- "re-engineer" the department, hastened a 
program for officers to replace their old .38 revolvers with more powerful 
9-mm. semiautomatics with 15-round clips, and introduced myriad "strategies" 
for battling drug-dealers, gunrunners, prostitutes, wife-beaters, even truants. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will fight for every house in this city. We will fight for every street. 
We will fight for every borough," Bratton proclaimed the day he was hired for 
the $110,000-a-year post. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first of many photo ops and sound bites that at times have upstaged 
his boss, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a Republican elected largely on a 
law-and-order platform. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve officers arrested in a corruption scandal? Bratton personally seizes 
their badges. 
</P>
<P>
 Youths staging dog fights in Central Park? An off-duty Bratton scares them 
off, then relates the story to a newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Powder blue police shirts a fashion faux pas? Bratton introduces new dark blue 
uniforms which, he tells reporters, promise a "more professional look. A 
crisper look. A getting-rid-of-the-'Mr. Goodwrench' look." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the Bratton sightings noted in the tabloids: court-side at Knick games. 
Boogieing with his wife, law professor Cheryl Fiandaca, at an HBO party in the 
Hamptons. Dining at Elaine's, the upscale Upper Eastside eatery popular with 
television anchors and soap stars. 
</P>
<P>
 Bratton's style has rankled some local officials clearly more comfortable with 
his predecessor, Raymond Kelly, a tight-lipped ex-Marine. 
</P>
<P>
 "The emerging profile is of someone who is anxious to get his puss on 
television," complained Staten Island Borough President Guy Molinari. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an advantage to being high-profile if there's substance to back it 
up. The jury is still out on him." 
</P>
<P>
 Bratton is unapologetic. 
</P>
<P>
 He readily admits he's equally passionate about running the department and 
promoting it through what the city's first police commissioner, Teddy 
Roosevelt, would have called the "bully pulpit." 
</P>
<P>
 "What sets me apart from many in my business is the appreciation of how 
important the message is . . . and how important the police commissioner is to 
the selling of that message," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bratton arrived in crime-weary New York amid high expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Massachusetts who tweaks the ears of some New Yorkers by 
pronouncing department "depaatment," he rose through the ranks of the Boston 
force before taking over New York's Transit Police Department in 1990. His 
tenure was marked by a drop in serious subway crimes that continued well after 
he returned to Boston as chief in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 After briefly considering retaining Kelly, Giuliani recruited Bratton and 
initially declared the Police Department off-limits to the budget cuts being 
inflicted on other city agencies. Thomas Reppetto, head of a citizens' police 
watchdog group, likened Bratton's arrival to the Yankees taking Babe Ruth from 
the Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Bratton's statistics look strong. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first nine months of 1994, 1,280 people were murdered in the city, 
compared to 1,499 at this time last year, a 14% drop. Reports of robbery, grand 
larceny and auto theft also are declining at double-digit pace -- a rate 
Bratton considers critical to making city residents feel safer. 
</P>
<P>
 Public opinion polls also have been favorable, and Bratton has earned high 
marks from some minority and gay leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we can say he has been listening to us," said the Rev. Calvin Butts 
of Harlem's Abyssinian Baptist Church. "The mayor could learn something from 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Within the department, Bratton is viewed with a mix of awe and skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
 Some see the commissioner and his inner circle advisers as media manipulators 
with little affinity for the cop on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 In a published rebuttal to reports that officers were not making enough 
arrests, Queens patrolman Wayne Brooks blasted Bratton's "spin doctors" for 
their "condescending criticism." 
</P>
<P>
 Those officials, Brooks charged, provided reporters with "a litany of one-line 
answers that made the patrol force look as if it was more interested in its 
next doughnut than its next arrest." 
</P>
<P>
 But most officers have been energized by Bratton's call for more aggressive 
policing, former chief of personnel Michael Julian says. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got the cops' ear," Julian says. "He reminded them that they're 
crime-fighters first. And cops love to fight crime."

 A man charged with biting his neighbor's dog said he was provoked. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was growling at me and they let him run loose for at least four years," 
said William Burgess. "He was messing with my dogs and messing with me every 
time I walked by there." 
</P>
<P>
 Burgess, 39, was charged last week with cruelty to animals and public 
intoxication. He also was charged with two counts of battery for allegedly 
assaulting the dog's owner. A police clerk said she didn't know how serious the 
dog's injuries were.

MASSACHUSETTS WEDDINGS CAN ENJOY AN AMATEUR RING; MARRIAGE: UNDER STATE LAW, 
ANYONE CAN OFFICIATE IF HE OR SHE FILLS OUT SOME FORMS AND PAYS $25.

 The bride joined the groom under the tent at a park as Francis X. Coakley 
began the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've come here today to witness and to celebrate and give our blessing to 
the marriage of . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 He paused. It sounded as if he had forgotten the groom's name. 
</P>
<P>
 "John!" guests shouted. Coakley smiled. He didn't have to be reminded. The 
groom was his son. 
</P>
<P>
 The hesitation was understandable. Coakley, a retired telephone company 
employee from Ocean Township, N.J., was conducting his first and only wedding. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Massachusetts law, he only had to fill out some forms and pay $25 for 
the privilege. 
</P>
<P>
 In the state's bureaucratic parlance, it's called Designation to Solemnize a 
Particular Marriage on a Particular Day. So far this year, more than 500 people 
have received the designation, usually friends or relatives of the bride and 
groom. 
</P>
<P>
 "More and more it seems that people are doing it," said Michael Matarazzo, 
state director of community affairs. "If it's going to be a civil ceremony, 
they prefer that it's going to be someone close to them performing the 
ceremony." 
</P>
<P>
 The one-day authorizations have existed for years, but the fee was $250, and 
anyone wanting to perform a wedding needed specific approval from the 
Legislature. Two years ago, the price was cut and the process simplified. 
</P>
<P>
 Some states make it fairly easy to get certified as clergy or notaries public 
-- positions that sometimes allow people to perform weddings. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gerard G. Monaghan, president of the Assn. of Bridal Consultants in New 
Milford, Conn., said he is not aware of any state besides Massachusetts that 
offers the one-shot wedding authorization. 
</P>
<P>
 When John Coakley and Teresa Triana decided they wanted a civil ceremony in 
August, Triana suggested that Coakley's father marry them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I prefer a person who we know, who cares a lot about us, and who loves us to 
perform the ceremony," Triana said. "We're not just two more people and it's 
not his job. It would be like a labor of love." 
</P>
<P>
 The practice hasn't evoked warm-and-fuzzy feelings from the state's 1,700 
justices of the peace, who don't like the competition. They receive at least 
$45 for officiating and must demonstrate they perform weddings regularly to 
keep their commissions, said Walter McAlvoy, president of the state Justices of 
the Peace Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "A person could walk off the street and do as many as they want at $25 apiece. 
Conceivably, someone could run a business doing that," McAlvoy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jo Marshall Cooper has no plans to turn professional, though some guests 
suggested she consider it after she officiated at the oceanside wedding of her 
friends Pamela Hughes and M. Andrew Ishee in Cape Cod. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was nervous because the waves were loud and there was a lot of wind and I 
had to practically shout for people to hear me," Cooper said. "Once I got into 
it, it was enveloping. All the words we worked so hard to compose seemed just 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 Those officiating don't have to follow a particular ceremony. The only 
requirement is that at some point, they declare the couple married. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper did it with a flourish. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the powers vested in me by his excellency the governor of the commonwealth 
of Massachusetts, I now pronounce you man and wife," she said.

STRAY PUPPY LIVES, THANKS TO HEART SURGERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One-year-old Bobby, suffering from a life-threatening heart defect, was 
homeless and wandering the streets of Calgary, Alberta, last month. Today he is 
recovering from open-heart surgery in an intensive care unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors say he will be up and barking in no time. 
</P>
<P>
 When the stray Swiss Herding dog was picked up by the Society for the 
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Calgary, he was diagnosed with a rare 
congenital heart disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 Canadian Airlines volunteered to fly the puppy to the Western College of 
Veterinary Medicine in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan for the dog-saving surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, we're very happy with his progress," said David Fowler, who 
operated on Bobby with a five-person operating team for more than six hours.

CPR SNATCHES CHILDREN FROM THE BRINK; FIRST AID: STUDY FINDS THAT YOUNGSTERS 
WHO HAVE APPARENTLY DROWNED BUT RECEIVE MOUTH-TO-MOUTH RESUSCITATION ARE MUCH 
MORE LIKELY TO SURVIVE AND ESCAPE BRAIN DAMAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Children who have apparently drowned but who receive immediate mouth-to-mouth 
resuscitation are much more likely to survive and escape brain damage than 
children who don't receive such help, a study has found. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want parents to wait for the arrival of the paramedics," said Dr. 
Demetrios N. Kyriacou, who headed a study of 166 cases of drowning and 
near-drowning treated at Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 No previous study, he said, has tried to measure the benefit of giving 
immediate resuscitation compared with not giving such help or waiting until 
trained emergency workers arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings, reported in the August issue of Pediatrics, are consistent with 
current guidelines for using cardiopulmonary resuscitation on children, which 
call for giving one minute of CPR before calling 911. 
</P>
<P>
 Adults frequently need an electrical jump-start to get their hearts going, 
which requires a defibrillator and a trained person using it, so 911 should be 
called before starting CPR. 
</P>
<P>
 "A child typically has a very strong heart," said Kyriacou, an assistant 
professor of medicine at the UCLA School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 A child who is pulled blue and breathless from a pool or bathtub may have a 
pulse that is too faint to detect, he added, and a little help breathing may be 
all that's needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. John A. Paraskos, who headed the national panel of experts that revised 
CPR guidelines in 1992, said the new study is important. 
</P>
<P>
 "It emphasizes that learning CPR is a family responsibility, and everybody 
should learn it," said Paraskos, director of diagnostic cardiology at the 
University of Massachusetts Medical Center in Worcester. 
</P>
<P>
 Courses in CPR usually take about four hours and are offered by local chapters 
of the American Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the rescuers in the study were parents, relatives or neighbors. The 
study's findings suggest that many revived their children without formal 
training. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seventy-five percent of kids out of the 166 did get mouth-to-mouth or CPR," 
which also involves chest compression, Kyriacou said. But, he said, only a 
small fraction of U.S. adults are certified in the technique. 
</P>
<P>
 That suggests people are learning the basics from television or other sources, 
or are getting enough directions from 911 telephone operators. 
</P>
<P>
 In the study, 148 children who were not breathing received some type of 
resuscitative effort, and of those, 22 -- or 14.9% -- died or had brain damage. 
Of the 18 children who received no such effort, eight -- or 44.4% -- died or 
had brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
 After controlling statistically for differences in children's ages, time of 
submersion and other variables, the researchers found that children who were 
revived and lived without brain damage were 4.75 times more likely to have 
received resuscitative efforts than other children.

 Emil Kijek hit the first hole-in-one of his life. Then he dropped dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was kind of happy, but he wasn't jumping with joy and all that," said one 
of Kijek's golfing partners, Morris Dumont. But then, at the next tee, the 
79-year-old Kijek approached the ball, rolled his eyes, said, "Oh, no," and 
collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of death was not immediately released. Kijek had suffered from high 
blood pressure.

WITCHES OF SIQUIJOR MAY WORK MAGIC FOR TOURISM, OFFICIALS HOPE; PHILIPPINES: 
FOR CENTURIES, THE ISLAND HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED WITH MAGIC AND FAITH HEALING. 
PEOPLE COME HUNDREDS OF MILES FOR 'TREATMENT.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It could be any doctor's office in any poor village: patients waiting 
silently, hoping for a cure. But it isn't. This healer uses herbs, chants and 
magic words. 
</P>
<P>
 Eliseo Bulanan is one of about 75 faith healers on Siquijor, an island of 
50,000 people 400 miles southeast of Manila. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a gift of God," said Bulanan, 28, of his supposed power. "I cannot 
explain it. I am simply a vehicle of the Holy Spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 For centuries, Siquijor has been identified with "kulam," or black magic, with 
mysticism and faith healing. Spanish colonizers named the island Isla del Fuego 
-- Island of Fire -- because of mysterious lights they saw in the 
jungle-covered mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Siquijor's reputation as a haven of witchcraft has spread so far that during 
the Islamic uprising of the 1970s in the Philippines, both soldiers and Muslim 
guerrillas came to buy amulets to protect them from bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 The healers of Siquijor use many techniques. Some treat exclusively with 
herbs, others with mystical chants. The "bolo-bolo" chants phrases from the 
Latin Mass and blows through a straw into a water glass containing a magic 
stone to draw out the sickness. 
</P>
<P>
 Educated Siquijorans find the den-of-witches image embarrassing. "Few people 
here believe in that stuff anymore," said Nicolaas van Roselaar, a Dutchman who 
married a Filipina and runs a small inn. "It's only people outside the island 
that believe." 
</P>
<P>
 As Benjamin Aquino, the provincial governor, explained it: "For the literate 
and those with higher education, they don't believe in magic. But the 
illiterate do. There are people from other provinces who come here for magic." 
</P>
<P>
 Aquino, ever in search of revenue, envisions building an occult-tourism trade 
on the island's unique reputation. When not pursuing their special interest, he 
notes, the visitors could enjoy the white sand beaches and snorkel through the 
rich coral. 
</P>
<P>
 Felix Suamen, who works at the provincial hospital, said faith healers became 
popular before there were doctors on the island, and "the beliefs are passed on 
from parents to their children." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the magic used by the healers is "white magic." But Aquino said black 
magic was common many years ago -- casting spells on a client's enemy, for 
example, to ruin his crops, cause illness or make his business fail. 
</P>
<P>
 The practice of black magic ceased after several bombings in the late 1950s 
and early 1960s that apparently were reprisals for evil spells, the governor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 One faith healer said confidentially, however, that he knew of half a dozen 
"magicians" who would cast an evil spell for 3,000 pesos, the equivalent of 
about $115. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Caribbean voodoo, Siquijor rituals fuse elements of conventional Roman 
Catholicism and beliefs that prevailed before Spanish missionaries brought 
Christianity in the 16th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Amulets and magic potions of herbs, bark and roots are prepared during Easter 
week. Magicians believe their powers are greatest on the Saturday between Good 
Friday and Easter Sunday, because Christ has not yet risen from the dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Bulanan, who considers himself a devout Catholic, said he received his powers 
at age 11 after seeing the Virgin and a golden rosary in the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 His reputation as a healer has spread to other islands; people journey 
hundreds of miles for treatment. In return, he accepts donations, often of just 
a few cents. He lives with his wife and two sons in a stone house complete with 
television set and videotape recorder donated by wealthier clients. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his patients, Nyolito Itik, was brought by his family on a 36-hour 
journey by land and sea from South Cotabato province. He appeared to be 
disoriented, suffering from a nervous disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 Bulanan put Itik on a stool before an altar complete with cross, flowers and a 
picture of Jesus. After massaging the patient's arms and legs, he scribbled 
"God of healing" and other phrases on triangles of rice paper, to be soaked in 
water that Itik would drink. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Itik was taken to another hut, where his relatives covered his 
shoulders with a towel moistened by steam from boiling herbs. 
</P>
<P>
 After half an hour of such treatment, there was no cure, but the patient 
seemed more alert. For the first time that day, Itik began moving his head in 
response to sounds.

DA VINCI'S WRITING ON WATER, COSMOS, BRINGS $28 MILLION

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 72-page manuscript in which Leonardo da Vinci explores the mysteries of 
water and the cosmos through words and pictures sold for $28 million Friday -- 
plus another $2.8 million for Christie's commission, bringing the total to 
$30.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Burge, chairman of Christie's America, said it was the highest 
price for any work of art sold at auction in the last four years.The pre-sale 
estimate had been $10 to $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
 An anonymous private collector, bidding by telephone, won a dramatic bidding 
war against a representative of the Cariplo Foundation of Milan, Italy, who was 
in the auction room at Christie's in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
 The manuscript was sold by the Armand Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural Center 
in Los Angeles. The late oil tycoon Armand Hammer had bought the work, known as 
the Codex Hammer, in 1980 for $5.6 million.

 President Clinton paid tribute to veterans of the nation's battlefields 
Friday, pledging anew not to forget those missing in Vietnam and saluting U.S. 
military men and women now "standing watch for freedom and security." 
</P>
<P>
 "I am proud to share this Veterans Day with you in this magnificent place of 
rest and reverence," Clinton said to an audience of veterans on the steps below 
the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 "And we honor all those who at this very moment are standing watch for freedom 
and security. 
</P>
<P>
 "We say, simply and from the bottom of our hearts, 'Thank you,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The President is bound for the Far East where he will attend ceremonies at 
Corregidor, the former U.S. military fortress in the Philippines, and will 
visit the largest U.S. military cemetery outside the United States.

HARD-CORE GUN ACTIVISTS READY FOR DAY WHEN ARMS ARE NEEDED; MILITIAS: IT'S 
UNCLEAR HOW MANY SUCH GROUPS EXIST NATIONWIDE. SOME SIMPLY LOBBY AND PRESSURE 
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. BUT OTHERS BELIEVE THE ONLY WAY TO TAKE BACK THE GOVERNMENT 
IS THROUGH ARMED RESISTANCE.

 For members of the Northern Michigan Regional Militia, the signs are 
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 They have reports of helicopters hovering over houses, stickers on the backs 
of highway signs with indecipherable codes that just might be messages for 
foreign troops, U.N. military vehicles spotted in Western states. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's all harmless, they say. But maybe not -- maybe the tentacles of a 
foreign-dominated police state are already spreading throughout the continent. 
</P>
<P>
 The militiamen are taking no chances. 
</P>
<P>
 They and other hard-core gun activists around the nation are organizing, 
planning, training for the day when their guns will be weapons of war. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not here playing soldier, we're not foolishly looking for trouble. . . 
. But tyrants should know that they will be met with force," said Norm Olson, 
commander of the Northern Michigan militia. 
</P>
<P>
 It's unclear how many self-styled militias exist nationwide. The FBI keeps no 
list and would monitor them only if they were suspected of violating federal 
law or planning to do so, said agency spokesman Hank Glaspie. 
</P>
<P>
 But mainstream groups on both sides of the gun-control debate agree that the 
militia movement is for real. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some cases, they're setting up what I'd call legitimate groups to lobby 
and pressure local governments," said Alan Gottlieb, chairman of the Citizens' 
Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you're also seeing the more extreme elements . . . who feel the only way 
to take back the government is through armed resistance." 
</P>
<P>
 The militias, said Ray Southwell of the Northern Michigan group, are led by 
spiritual heirs of the Revolutionary-era citizens who took up arms against 
British tyranny. Only now, he said, the U.S. government is the tyrant. 
</P>
<P>
 His evidence: the crime bill, which bans some assault-type weapons; the Brady 
Law's national waiting period for handgun purchases; the "murder" of David 
Koresh and his Branch Davidian followers in Waco, Tex., said to be proof that 
the government will do anything to take guns from civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to take a stand . . . before all our liberties are gone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some see gun control as part of a broader conspiracy to bring about world 
government. If that day comes, they say, Americans will be ruled by a socialist 
United Nations, which will abolish freedom of religion and speech. Foreign 
troops will occupy U.S. soil, confiscating private weapons and property. 
</P>
<P>
 "Am I nuts? Am I paranoid? Maybe, but I'm seeing things that scare me and I 
want to find out what's going on," Southwell said. 
</P>
<P>
 He's not alone. Randy Trochman of Noxon, Mont., believes in the 
world-dictatorship conspiracy. He is a member of the Militia of Montana, which 
has been forming local chapters since February and is assisting similar efforts 
in Idaho and Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our objective is to get organizations similar to ours in every county in the 
country," he said. "People are getting together to defend themselves."

 In Florida, the militia movement is picking up "like a snowball rolling down a 
mountain," said Robert Pummer, a member from Stuart. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, commissioners in four Panhandle counties authorized citizens to 
form militias. Commissioners said their resolutions were symbolic messages to 
Washington to get off gun owners' backs. 
</P>
<P>
 Northern Michigan's "First Brigade" formed last April and has inspired spinoff 
groups in 11 counties, Southwell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The First Brigade meets once a month. Olson, the commander, owns a gun shop in 
Alanson. He's also pastor of the Calvary Baptist Church. 
</P>
<P>
 During assemblies, First Brigade members (65, at a recent meeting) discuss 
ways to mount guerrilla-style resistance, if necessary. They have "field 
exercises," such as building fires and reading a compass. 
</P>
<P>
 Each is required to own a rifle, at least 100 rounds of ammunition and a 
knapsack containing a mess kit, sleeping bag and first-aid supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Members take an oath to defend the Constitution against enemies "foreign and 
domestic." Their conduct code demands a willingness to die for their liberty 
and a promise never to surrender or divulge information about the militia if 
taken "prisoner of war." 
</P>
<P>
 To outsiders, this might seem the stuff of a B-grade movie farce: gun-toting 
men in military fatigues, some with faces blackened for combat, preparing for 
doomsday in rural northern Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's no joke to Mary Hessel, mayor of Pellston, population 580. She feuded 
with the militia this summer because members were bringing unloaded rifles to 
meetings in local parks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't need this kind of thing. We're just a quiet, peaceful little 
community," Hessel said. "I had one person ask me, 'What's next, the KKK? The 
neo-Nazis?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Olson said ordinary citizens have nothing to fear from the militia. "We are 
here to protect their liberties and ours," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The militiamen say the nation's founders believed citizens should arm 
themselves to keep government in line. They cite the Second Amendment reference 
to a "well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state." 
</P>
<P>
 And they say laws in Michigan and many states sanction an "organized militia" 
-- the National Guard and other professional forces -- and an "unorganized 
militia," consisting of able-bodied civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Patrick Henry or George Washington were here today, there's no doubt in my 
mind they would be forming their own militias," Southwell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Henigan, general counsel for Washington, D.C.-based Handgun Control 
Inc., says people charged with firearms law violations sometimes claim 
membership in the so-called unorganized militia. But courts have ruled the 
"militia" in the Second Amendment means an arm of state government, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "What seems to be going on in Michigan is formation of something akin to a 
private army," Henigan said. "It would be profoundly threatening to our 
constitutional system if people thought they had a right to start shooting if 
they felt government was becoming oppressive." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Hessel fears that a flare-up between the militia and police could 
escalate into a Waco-type showdown: "Who knows what might set it off?" 
</P>
<P>
 Southwell said, "My hope is that we can turn this country around without 
firing a shot. But if not, I'm afraid . . . at some point the government will 
cross the line and it will be neighbor coming to the aid of neighbor. Just like 
at Concord and Lexington."

REAL SHAMANS DEAL IN PHYSICAL ILLS, INNER PEACE 
</P>

 American Indian medicine strives to treat a person's spirit as well as his 
physical problems to restore harmony. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the belief that when you have an illness it is not only physical but 
also spiritual, and has a lot to do with your thinking," said Rick Two Dogs, a 
Lakota medicine man on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Western medicine, if you have a pain in your stomach, they'll give you 
something for the pain but not go into what's behind causing the pain, the 
spiritual. If you dig deeper you will find the source. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our work is with the Great Spirit. I know in Western medicine a lot of times, 
if any, there is no prayer involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Banyacya Sr., 85, a spokesman for religious people on the Hopi 
Reservation in Arizona, said most of his people's healers hold spiritual 
ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have to know certain things and songs that go with this healing," 
Banyacya said. "There are herbs they use that could help people. Peyote is one 
of them. It's not a drug, but the white men call it that. Some of the herbs 
have the special gift to heal people." 
</P>
<P>
 Banyacya lives at Oraibi, which he said is the oldest continuously inhabited 
community in the United States. It is near the Third Mesa on the Hopi 
Reservation in northeastern Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Navajo, "a lot of traditional medicine is creating a healthy mental 
acceptance of death," said Charles Cambridge, an anthropologist and a Navajo 
from the Folded Arms Clan. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are evil forces in the universe that go about wreaking havoc on the 
land and traditional people. A lot of what medicine people do is that they have 
to contend with the evilness out there. 
</P>
<P>
 "So the medicine man is extremely important for his community and tribe. He is 
a physician and, not unlike a priest, he represents the moral health of the 
community and tribe. He sets the standards of moral behavior" for his 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 Cambridge said the Navajos believe if a person is ill, there is disharmony. 
</P>
<P>
 "Traditional people always are concerned with harmony -- the balance between 
good and evil, the relation of all parts of the universe, the relation of the 
gods and spirits, the animals and the rocks, how everything behaves in 
relationship to each other," Cambridge said.

DOLLS HELP CHILDREN COPE WITH ILLNESSES; THERAPY: THE TOYS ARE USED IN A 
VARIETY OF WAYS AT HOSPITALS. OFTEN, THEY HELP PREPARE YOUNGSTERS FOR SURGERY 
OR OTHER PAINFUL MEDICAL PROCEDURES. 
</P>

 They are young children dealing with grown-up health problems that would scare 
and frustrate adults. So many hospitals use a specially made doll to help the 
youngsters learn about their illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the dolls from Legacy Products have vinyl overlays of body parts; 
others are adapted so they can be used with real medical equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't tell you how much they've helped our kids," said Holly Schultz, a 
child life specialist at the Gillette Children's Hospital in St. Paul, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
 The dolls are used in a variety of ways at hospitals in more than 35 states. 
Often, they are used to help prepare children for surgery or other painful 
medical procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 After helping a young diabetic give an insulin injection to a Legacy doll, 
Methodist Hospital nurse Connie Shella said, "Sometimes my friend is angry. Why 
do you think he is angry?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Because it hurts," 5-year-old Jared Riley replied. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if I stop giving the injections, what will happen? He won't feel good," 
Shella said, holding up the frowning doll, which had a vinyl overlay of a 
pancreas. 
</P>
<P>
 The soft dolls are made of a fabric similar to the looped side of Velcro, 
which allows the overlays to be easily attached. They come in various sizes, 
but the standard is about 27 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 To help children identify with the dolls, they come with wigs that can be 
changed to match the child's hair color. "Mood masks" also allow the child to 
replace the doll's happy face with one that is sad, angry, sleepy or worried. 
</P>
<P>
 Children tired of being poked and prodded can express their frustrations 
through the dolls. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's positive for kids to express anger to a doll as opposed to 
hitting a sister or a staff person," Schultz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dolls also can help parents whose children are sick. Anne Eccles used a 
"bleeding knee" doll to learn how to give injections to her 1-year-old son, 
Campbell, who has hemophilia. The doll's knee opens, and red fabric surrounding 
the joint simulates a hemorrhage. 
</P>
<P>
 Practicing on the doll "made me feel a lot more comfortable," Eccles said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dolls reflect a variety of medical disorders. Legacy is in the process of 
developing a spina bifida doll and vinyl overlays that show a variety of 
cardiac problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Katherine Miller founded the Cambridge City-based company in 1988, after she 
and her sister made a washable doll and displayed it at a medical conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nurses would come by our exhibit and say, 'Have you ever put in a 
tracheotomy?' or 'Do you think you could put in an IV?' " Miller said. "We 
didn't see why we couldn't. And that's how the whole thing started." 
</P>
<P>
 Most dolls cost about $250, although the price varies depending on their 
features. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller and her sister now have about a dozen people working for them, although 
many employees make the dolls at home in their spare time. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been a bittersweet experience for us," Miller said. "Just about all 
of us are mothers. That's why we dress the dolls in bright, happy clothes and 
try to make them look as normal as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to play a role in positive reinforcement with these children. We want 
them to hope they will be better."

 NAACP officials have extended furloughs for 88 employees for two more weeks as 
it continues to battle financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The original two-week furlough for 88 employees was supposed to end Friday. 
The NAACP said the furloughs were extended to keep costs down while it works on 
a plan to eliminate a $3.8-million deficit.

GIRL TAKES BREATHALYZER TEST TO START CAR FOR DRUNKEN FATHER; 3 DIE IN CRASH

 Gregory Cook decided to take his two daughters to breakfast, starting the car 
after one of the girls apparently blew into a breath-analyzing device that had 
been installed to keep him from driving drunk. 
</P>
<P>
 About half an hour after they set out Sept. 25, the car skidded into a waste 
water treatment pond, drowning Cook, 36, and the girls, 8-year-old Marissa and 
10-year-old Shauna. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, a grand jury indicted the youngsters' mother, Shirley Draper, for 
not stopping the girls from riding with their intoxicated father. 
</P>
<P>
 Draper, 34, could get up to life in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said Draper knew that Cook, her ex-husband, had been drinking and 
wasn't capable of driving safely. 
</P>
<P>
 Draper "told us she was aware one of her children would have to blow into the 
apparatus to get the car running and keep it running," Sheriff Paul Hastings 
said.

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: FINALLY, CHOICES TAILORED TO THE INVESTOR'S AGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES, a financial writer for the Arizona Republic, 
specializes in mutual funds. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Age is a key variable that helps determine what types of mutual funds a person 
should own. Younger investors generally can afford to be more aggressive with 
their money, while older people would want to stay more conservative. 
</P>
<P>
 There's certainly nothing earth-shattering about that, but it is somewhat 
surprising how long it took mutual fund companies to make the connection in 
marketing funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Only within the last year or so have a few fund groups come out with 
portfolios specifically for people in certain age groups. Until then, virtually 
all funds had been categorized and sold either by the types of assets held or 
their risk profiles, not by the age or perceived investment horizons of 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference is a subtle but significant one. By offering people a 
ready-made mix appropriate to their ages, fund companies are making the 
investment process a little simpler. It's one thing to purchase a growth or 
balanced or bond fund, yet quite another to know if it suits your circumstances 
and in what amount. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, some life-cycle funds slowly alter their investment mixes to become more 
conservative over time, so it is unnecessary for shareholders to revamp or even 
readjust their holdings as they grow older. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest player to come out with a series of life-cycle funds is the 
Vanguard Group of Valley Forge, Pa. The company last month started to market 
four LifeStrategy portfolios and has attracted $55 million so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the four LifeStrategy offerings invests in other Vanguard funds, using 
a 30% stake in Vanguard Asset Allocation as an anchor. The Asset Allocation 
portfolio has latitude to make wide shifts among stocks, bonds and cash but 
will tend to maintain roughly a 60-35-5 breakdown among the three. 
</P>
<P>
 The most aggressive of the four is LifeStrategy Growth, for shareholders under 
50. Its mix will tend to stay around 63% in U.S. stocks, 20% in bonds, 15% in 
foreign stocks and 2% in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Least aggressive is LifeStrategy Income, for people 75 and older. For this 
fund, the usual weightings are 23% in U.S. stocks, 75% in bonds and the rest in 
cash, with nothing in foreign stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Rounding out the lineup are LifeStrategy Moderate Growth, with roughly a 63% 
stake in U.S. and foreign stocks, and LifeStrategy Conservative Growth, with 
approximately a 40% exposure. The former is for investors in their 50s; the 
latter is for those between 60 and 75. 
</P>
<P>
 All four portfolios contain some stock holdings, which are among the best 
assets for inflation protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming you like to pick and monitor mutual funds, you probably wouldn't be 
content with the simplified mixtures represented by the LifeStrategy funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are at all active, we feel you will be better off doing your own 
allocations, particularly if you require tax-free securities," said Sheldon 
Jacobs, publisher of the No-Load Fund Investor newsletter in 
Irvington-on-Hudson, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, the LifeStrategy funds keep sparse international holdings and 
have no exposure in the highly promising area of emerging markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can probably create a better mix of Vanguard funds yourself and retain 
control all the while," Daniel Wiener, editor of the Independent Adviser for 
Vanguard Investors in Watertown, Mass., wrote in the newsletter.  
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, for both beginning and advanced investors, the LifeStrategy 
funds can serve as solid core positions to which more exotic fare can be added. 
They also can be good starting points for people who have just a few thousand 
dollars to invest. 
</P>
<P>
 The LifeStrategy products feature very low expenses of roughly 0.33% a year, 
equivalent to an annual charge of about $10 on a minimum $3,000 investment. The 
funds ((800) 992-8845) are sold without a sales load or commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Wells Fargo Nikko of San Francisco came out with five 
Stagecoach LifePath funds, also available without sales charge and accessible 
with a lower minimum investment amount ($1,000) than Vanguard funds, but with 
higher annual expenses (1.2%). 
</P>
<P>
 The most conservative portfolio, designed to be held until the year 2000, will 
maintain roughly a 20% position in stocks. The most aggressive LifePath 
selection, appropriate for people likely to hold until 2040, will keep close to 
100% in stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The maximum foreign stock exposure for any fund is 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 An interesting twist to the LifePath funds is that each one gradually becomes 
less aggressive over time. The implication is that shareholders don't have to 
revamp or even rebalance their holdings as they age. 
</P>
<P>
 "The LifePath funds are designed for people who are not mutual fund 
hobbyists," said Don Luskin, a Wells Fargo Nikko managing director. 
</P>
<P>
 They're especially appropriate for less sophisticated investors in 401(k) or 
other employer-sponsored retirement plans, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The LifePath funds, which count about $250 million in assets, are sold in 
California through Wells Fargo Bank branches or by telephone ((800) 222-8222). 
</P>
<P>
 For people working with a broker, Putnam Investments of Boston has garnered 
about $300 million in its three Lifestage Asset Allocation funds since it 
introduced them last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The Growth portfolio, for people in their 20s and 30s, usually has an 80% 
stake in equities. The Balanced portfolio, for those in their 40s and 50s, 
maintains 65% in stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The third and least risky fund, the Conservative portfolio, caters to people 
60 and older. It keeps only about 35% of its holdings in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
 The Putnam funds ((800) 225-1581) are sold in two versions: Investors can pay 
a maximum 5.75% sales charge or buy no-load shares. 
</P>
<P>
 The no-load shares carry ongoing expenses of about 2% annually, compared to 
less than 1.3% for the load shares. Over time, the latter could prove to be 
cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
 T. Rowe Price Associates of Baltimore ((800) 638-5660) and Sierra Trust ((800) 
222-5852) in Los Angeles are two of the other fund companies that also offer 
asset-allocation products, though without paying much attention to investor 
age.

 Shearson Lehman's mutual funds have been folded into the Smith Barney group a 
little more than a year after they were acquired. The combination creates the 
ninth-largest fund family, with 70 open-end portfolios and assets of $58 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Brokerage Smith Barney and its mutual funds are a subsidiary of the Travelers 
Group financial services firm, which has $115 billion in assets.

CONSUMERS HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE TO PUC PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The article outlining alternative proposals to the state Public Utilities 
Commission's plan to deregulate the electric industry ("Proposals Add Confusion 
for State's Users of Electricity," Oct. 24) reflected the views of the 
utilities and environmentalists but left out the consumer viewpoint altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, there is a consumer-led alternative to the PUC's plan: It is 
called Community Access to Competitive Electricity.Put forth by the consumer 
group Toward Utility Rate Normalization, community access would allow all 
Californians -- not just the big guys -- to share in the benefits of 
competition in the electricity marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the PUC's "direct access" proposal, which gives early competitive 
choice to large customers but holds small customers captive to the utility and 
its high prices until at least 2002, community access would bring lower rates 
through competition to all customers at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 Community access would empower large and small customers within a community to 
harness their collective market power to get better deals for all. Local 
government agencies would serve as purchasing agents for all customers within 
their jurisdiction and negotiate for low-cost power on the wholesale market for 
electricity.  
</P>
<P>
 Communities would be able to choose how much power should come from renewable 
sources and how much funding would be devoted to energy efficiency and other 
social goals. The PUC's plan, on the other hand, could throw all these policy 
goals by the wayside. 
</P>
<P>
 Any reform of the electric industry should provide meaningful choice to all 
consumers. Community access can achieve this goal. The PUC's direct-access 
proposal cannot.

L.A. DOESN'T DESERVE FORTUNE'S DISFAVOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Well, Fortune magazine has given the back of its hand to Los Angeles again 
("Best for Business," Oct. 26). In its latest ranking of the world's best 
cities for international business, Los Angeles didn't make it into the Top 10. 
However, New York, Atlanta, Chicago, San Francisco and Miami did. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fortune seems to be losing its grip. If you look at the small profile 
tables for each city, Fortune has lost things. They give the full Metropolitan 
Statistical Area population for New York, but Los Angeles is credited with just 
the population of the city. Fortune has lost the rest of the county, including 
Long Beach, which has the nation's largest container port. Fortune has also 
lost things in San Francisco, giving that city's population but leaving out the 
rest of the area, including San Francisco International Airport and the Port of 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortune starts its profile of Los Angeles with such tired cliches as 
"earthquake, riot and 511 miles of crowded freeway are all deficits." They have 
lost the 300-plus miles of operating mass transit in the Los Angeles area. Nor 
does Fortune give us credit for the vast support network for international 
trade in the area, including the Export Small Business Development Center, and 
the Greater Los Angeles World Trade Center in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 And, finally, Fortune seems to overlook the 219,000 business firms in Los 
Angeles County, many of which are busy exploring international trade 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 However, we may yet have the last laugh on Fortune. According to "FT 920," 
published by the U.S. Department of Commerce, through the first eight months of 
1994, the total value of two-way international trade in the New York Customs 
District is $91.6 billion. In the Los Angeles Customs District, the eight-month 
cumulative total is $92.8 billion. Doing international trade well may be the 
best revenge.

DISCRIMINATION AWARD AND HUGHES' CULTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "Jury Awards $89.5 Million in Hughes Race Bias Lawsuit" (Oct. 27), Ian 
Herzog, one of the attorneys representing the litigants in this case, is quoted 
as saying that "racism is rampant" at Hughes and that "if Hughes didn't get the 
message from this, and I don't think they did, it (the award) is not enough." 
</P>
<P>
 As a retired Hughes employee, I agree totally with Mr. Herzog's assessment, 
including the part regarding Hughes' not getting the message. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes Aircraft Co. was founded by that great engineer but alleged racist 
Howard Hughes. As a result, its culture has long been typified by a "closed 
elite family" personality. Family membership is reserved for white males who 
are mostly overly impressed with their intellect and arrogant in their 
deference to equal opportunity. A family that nonwhite males have found almost 
impossible to penetrate. 
</P>
<P>
 Basically, Hughes' culture implants, and encourages, the belief that negative 
stereotypes of minorities are valid. Therefore minorities -- from Asians (many 
smart, but not assertive) to Hispanics (some smart, but can be ignored) to 
blacks (few smart, too assertive) -- continually struggle to try to satisfy 
their career goals at a company where they really do not have a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes earns the majority of its revenue from government contracts and, 
therefore, has an agreement with the Department of Defense to provide all 
employees with equal opportunity, under threat of financial penalty. The 
company has often failed to meet the minimum requirements of the Defense 
Department and has survived on special waivers in order to avoid the government 
obligation. Rampant racism at Hughes Aircraft is the only constant in this era 
of decreasing defense budgets and corporate downsizing. 
</P>
<P>
 While I'm sorry that it was necessary, I must applaud the victory of Jeffrey 
Lane and David Villalpando in the hope that a company that has such a great 
technical tradition, one that helped make the United States the greatest 
military power of our time, will finally take significant steps to at last 
clean up its internal act and give its minority employees a well-deserved equal 
and fair chance for advancement.

 Plunder no more! 
</P>
<P>
 The bandits are coming again to ravage and plunder my "village," which 
consists of fellow co-workers at Hughes Aircraft Co. It consists of good and 
hard-working people, cooperating together in lean times of downsizing and 
fierce competition, having high standards of ethics and fair play and pursuing 
the American Dream the old-fashioned way. 
</P>
<P>
 There has long been a tremendous effort to embrace multiethnic diversity with 
numerous seminars, classes, hot lines, clubs, promotions and feedback 
mechanisms for surveys, squawks and ideas. It is virtually inconceivable how 
this could be more zealously pursued. 
</P>
<P>
 The bosses that I have had as an engineer of 13 years at Hughes have included 
women, blacks, Asian Americans, a Hispanic and even whites. 
</P>
<P>
 The bandit in this tragedy is tremendously powerful: It is the current legal 
system in the United States and has come to plunder the village to a tune of 
$89.5 million on this attack wave. The justification that the bandit uses is 
that if Party A offends Party B, then Party C, although innocent, must suffer 
and pay very dearly. Party B in this tragedy is two former employees, Jeffrey 
Lane and David Villalpando, who allege that Hughes denied promotions and pay 
raises to Lane because of race. Party A is one or more individuals that may or 
may not have breached impropriety in their counsel or directions to Party B. It 
is not established that Party A did anything wrong at all, but if it did, it 
was certainly not with the consent and established policies of the people in 
the village, Party C. 
</P>
<P>
 The tens of thousands of people of the village are innocent victims of the 
bandit, with lost competitiveness, resulting in lost contracts, lost wages 
(part of our compensation is profit sharing), lost promotions, lost jobs and 
lost careers. What could the people of the village possibly do (as regular 
workers, managers or even the CEO) that they haven't already done to protect 
themselves from the ravages of the bandit?

 If a one-day shopping blitz at the Mall of America -- the largest indoor 
shopping and entertainment complex in the United States -- is on your to-do 
list, then Northwest Airlines has a one-day deal for you. The airline is 
offering round-trip fares of $159 from LAX to Twin Cities International Airport 
in Minneapolis/St. Paul on Nov. 25 and Dec. 10. Travelers must go and return on 
the same day. Flights leave at 6:45 and 8 a.m., which puts shoppers in 
Minnesota at midday. There's a return flight at 7:45 p.m. Shuttle buses will 
take participants to the mall in Bloomington, which is five minutes from the 
airport, for $2 round trip. Airline tickets may be purchased on the day of 
travel, but Northwest recommends advance purchase. The offer is based on 
availability, which is limited; last year seats sold out quickly, a Northwest 
spokeswoman said. For reservations and information, call (800) 225-2525. Free

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS; NEW TRADITION AT TIVOLI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time in its 151-year history, Copenhagen's Tivoli Gardens will 
be open over Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Tivoli, one of the world's oldest amusement parks and a summertime tradition, 
begins its holiday schedule Friday and ends it with a New Year's Eve fireworks 
display. The park will be closed Dec. 24-26. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100,000 colored lights will twinkle in the park, which was built in 
1843 on the ramparts that once surrounded medieval Copenhagen. The Danish 
capital has since grown around Tivoli. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the park's rides will remain closed, several of its restaurants will 
be open, serving traditional Danish holiday fare -- pork roast, duck and goose 
along with red cabbage, glazed potatoes, sweet dumplings and glogg, hot 
burgundy with almonds, raisins and spices. 
</P>
<P>
 Several shops will also be open, selling Christmas decorations and gifts, and 
Charles Dickens' "Great Expectations" will be performed in Danish at the Glass 
House Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Tivoli's holiday hours will be noon to 11 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday and 
noon to 7 p.m. Sunday. Admission will be free. Five Diamonds for Nine Hotels

first-time awardees are the Ritz-Carlton, Amelia Island, Fla.; the Four 
Seasons, St. Regis Hotel and the Ritz-Carlton in New York City; the Fearrington 
House Inn in Fearrington, N.C. (just south of Chapel Hill), and the Fiesta 
Americana Coral Beach Cancun in Cancun, Mexico. The nine are among 53 lodgings 
and 25 restaurants in North America that this year earned the Five Diamond 
designation, AAA's highest honor. DOT Revises Air Travel Guide 
</P>
<P>
 "Fly-Rights: A Consumer Guide to Air Travel," revised for the first time in 
nine years, is now available from the U.S. Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 The pocket-sized "Fly-Rights" describes federal regulations in areas such as 
overbooking, smoking and refunds, and contains new chapters on frequent-flyer 
programs, travel scams and the rights of disabled travelers, among other 
topics. There is also a list of more than two dozen consumer travel 
publications available from agencies such as the State Department, the Customs 
Service and the Federal Aviation Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The 58-page booklet is available by writing to the Consumer Information 
Center, Department 133-B, Pueblo, Colo. 81009. The price is $1.75. Enclose a 
check or money order payable to the Superintendent of Documents. Rental Car

BOOKS TO GO: BEHIND THE SCENES AT KENNEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 THE AIRPORT; TERMINAL NIGHTS AND RUNAWAY DAYS AT JOHN F. KENNEDY INTERNATIONAL 
by James Kaplan (William Morrow & Co., $23 hardcover).  
</P>
<P>
 Most of us use them, sometimes almost daily. Most of us complain about them, 
but also, in some unlikely way, trust them implicitly. Most of us have no idea 
what goes on behind the scenes in one. James Kaplan does. The subject is 
airports and Kaplan, a well-known magazine writer, has chosen one of the 
world's largest and most complex as the focus of his book. 
</P>
<P>
 He talks to cab drivers, customs agents, pilots, flight attendants, airport 
medics and cops and chaplains, and more. He offers anecdote and history, and 
writes plainly about crashes and crime. He leaves the reader both unsettled and 
impressed by the complexity and unpredictability of the airport's daily 
operation. This may not be the best book for airborne reading, but it's one 
that any frequent flyer ought to read. 
</P>
<P>
 DO'S AND TABOOS OF PREPARING FOR YOUR TRIP ABROAD by Roger E. Axtell and John 
P. Healy (Wiley, $10.95 paper) and TRAVELING INCOGNITO; THE INDEPENDENT 
TRAVELER'S GUIDE TO THE WORLD by Sarah Shockley (Any Road Press, $14.95 paper). 
 
</P>
<P>
 Here are two books aimed at what might be called the timid traveler. Both 
offer packing checklists, suggestions on how to plan itineraries, notes on 
health and safety and the like. Both dispense advice on changing money, 
choosing hotels and restaurants and dealing with that pesky language barrier. 
</P>
<P>
 At least a couple of volumes of this sort seem to come out every year. They're 
always well-intentioned; they're always written by experienced travelers who 
aim to share the fruits of their experience; they always contain at least some 
useful counsel. But they're also usually padded with so much self-evident fluff 
that they end up seeming condescending -- as do these two. Does anybody need to 
buy "Do's and Taboos" for such pearls of wisdom as "When making airline 
reservations, try to obtain a pre-assigned seat" or "Hotels exist in many sizes 
and classes of service"? Most of what the novice traveler needs to know for 
most destinations would fit into a magazine article; so would most of the 
genuine service in these books. 
</P>
<P>
 Quick trips: 
</P>
<P>
 AROUND THE WORLD IN 18 HOLES by Tom Callahan and Dave Kindred (Doubleday, $23 
hardcover). A golf-loving traveler's fantasy manual -- the account of a 
37,000-mile jaunt undertaken by two sportswriters for the express purpose of 
playing 18 holes of golf on courses in 21 countries, on four continents. The 
authors' tone is (appropriately) breezy, and their adventures, on and off the 
links, from Iceland to Nepal, Sun City to Ft. Worth, will amuse even the 
non-golfer. 
</P>
<P>
 THE HEART OF THE SKY; TRAVELS AMONG THE MAYA by Peter Canby (Kodansha 
International, $13 paper). Since this book first appeared in hardcover two 
years ago, notes the author in a new preface, "Things have changed dramatically 
for the Chiapas Mayas." He helps explain who they are, and why dramatic change 
was inevitable in this well-written account of his travels through Mexico's 
Chiapas Highlands, a tale well-spiced with history and cultural lore. 
</P>

 Books to Go appears the second and fourth week of every month. For information

HIKING: ANGELES NATIONAL FOREST: STODDARD PEAK'S PEEK AT L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For most of the winter and early spring, 4,624-foot Stoddard Peak seems 
strategically positioned just below the snow line and just above the smog line. 
Its summit offers great clear-day views of Claremont and the San Gabriel Valley 
below, and of Mt. Baldy and its neighboring peaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The hike to Stoddard Peak is along a dirt fire road for most of its length.  
</P>
<P>
 Directions to trail head: From Interstate 10 (San Bernardino Freeway) in 
Upland, exit on Euclid Avenue and follow it a few miles, first through a 
commercial district then on a winding climb through the residential district of 
San Antonio Heights to Mt. Baldy Road. Turn right and follow it to the signed 
junction with dead-end Mountain Avenue and turn right. (The turnoff is also 
indicated by road paddle 1.07.) Descend a short paved road to a small parking 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 The hike: Ignore the old paved road heading south into the canyon and instead 
join the dirt road that heads east past a teensy-tiny hydroelectric plant. 
</P>
<P>
 The road crosses the creek at the bottom of San Antonio Canyon. Three-quarters 
of a mile from the trail head, you'll reach a couple of private cabins. Step 
over or duck under a vehicle gate, and enjoy the mellow ascent through an oak 
woodland. 
</P>
<P>
 The path rounds Cascade Canyon and climbs to a saddle, a fairly level area 
called Stoddard Flat. Just as the dirt road reaches the flat, look sharply 
right for the unsigned path to Stoddard Peak. 
</P>
<P>
 The brushy trail plunges west into the chaparral, ascending to a ridge top and 
turning south. You'll gain one false summit, then a second, before reaching the 
true Stoddard Peak.  
</P>
<P>
 Enjoy the panorama from Stoddard summit, which includes San Antonio Canyon, 
Mt. Baldy, San Gabriel Valley, Pomona and the Chino Hills. Stoddard Peak Trail 
Where: Base of Mt. Baldy, Angeles National Forest. Distance: 6 miles round 
trip; 1,000-foot elevation gain. Terrain: Oak-shaded, chaparral-covered hills. 
Highlights: Convenient getaway, metropolitan views. Degree of Difficulty: 
Moderate. For More Information: Mt. Baldy Ranger District, Angeles National 
Forest, 110 N. Wabash Ave., Glendora, Calif. 91740; tel. (818) 335-1251. Main 
Angeles National Forest office is (818) 574-5200.

 An increasing number of seniors are enjoying snow skiing. The ascendancy of

gone even further and offer discounted rates in chalets and ski lodges during

BACKPACK & BUDGET: MONEY'S UP DOWN UNDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCY IZON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Backpackers are worth big bucks to the tourism industry in Australia, 
according to several recent studies. In fact, the study results have impressed 
the Australian federal government so much they have allocated over the next 
four years $2,960,000 to promote backpacking. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though backpackers spend less each day on accommodations and 
transportation than other tourists, their visits are longer, and they rank 
among Australia's biggest-spending visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 A study by Jeff Jarvis, marketing lecturer of the Monash University graduate 
tourism program, found that the average backpacker is 24 years old, spends 
$29.40 per day, and stays in Australia for 195 days. Considering the estimated 
number of backpackers expected in Australia this year is 250,000, it's easier 
to comprehend Jarvis' estimate that backpackers are now worth a whopping $1.5 
billion a year to the Australian economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the financial support by the federal government, backpacking 
visitors can expect to see more information geared to their style of travel in 
government publications distributed overseas. For example, the Travel and 
Tourist Corporation of the popular state of Queensland established a backpacker 
industry advisory committee last year. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who plan to use Sydney as their gateway, two backpackers hostels are 
offering guests free transportation from the airport to their doors. 
</P>
<P>
 The 250-bed Hereford YHA Lodge at 51 Hereford St., Glebe 2037; telephone 
011-61-2-660-5577, is 10 miles from the airport. Here budget travelers can find 
dormitory beds for $11 to $12.50 per night, or $16.25 per person in a twin 
room. The hostel is in a quiet residential area. It has a TV/video room, sauna 
and a swimming pool. If you use the KST bus service from the airport to the 
hostel and get a receipt, the fare will be deducted from your overnight 
accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
 The airport bus transportation discount is in effect for the 15-bed 
Sydney-Glebe Point YHA Hostel at 262-264 Glebe Point Road, Glebe 2037; tel. 
011-61-2-692-8418. Here dormitory beds are available for $11-$12 per person. 
Both hostels accept major credit cards.

LETTERS PACKING PERIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Readers should exercise caution when using one of James T. Yenckel's packing 
tips ("Is Your Luggage a Mess?" Aug. 28) -- namely, "take old clothes on a trip 
and discard them along the way."For a recent trip to Palm Springs, I packed an 
old swimsuit, but bought a new one there. I tossed the old one in the 
wastebasket. A few days later, a package arrived containing the discarded 
swimsuit and some thongs somebody else had left behind. Now if I leave anything 
behind in a hotel room, even paperback books, I also leave a little note 
letting the staff know it is being left behind on purpose.

 In "Say Howdy to Two Very Different Ranches" (July 17), Christopher Reynolds 
indicated that he wasn't sure when the Eatons bought their ranch.The ranch was 
previously owned by my great-uncle Austin Devol. My grandmother and Austin 
Devol's wife were sisters. 
</P>
<P>
 My grandfather was living in the Platte River Valley in southern Wyoming in 
1901-02 and lost his job when a mine closed. They moved up to Wolf Creek and my 
grandfather worked on the ranch until he heard there was work at a new smelter 
in Douglas, Ariz. I have my grandparent's diaries, plus a photograph of the big 
ranch house, which I can still see in the picture accompanying your article.

 While driving in Italy this fall, we stopped at Hotel Grand Fasano, which you 
wrote about in July ("Lakeside Romances").We were surprised that this 
first-class hotel did not accept credit cards. We were short of cash and 
travelers checks, so we didn't stay. In times past, we always got by with 
credit cards. This time, stopping in other than major tourist spots, we found 
that one better have more than credit cards. Next time, more travelers checks 
and a PIN for the Visa for ATM use will be a priority.

LESS GOVERNMENT, BUT SAME PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Susan Estrich, Susan Estrich, a contributing editor to Opinion, is a law 
professor at USC. She served as campaign manager for Michael S. Dukakis in 
1988. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Everything you've ever wanted from your government. And less. Less spending. 
Less regulation. Lower taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 If there was an affirmative agenda to come out of Tuesday's vote, it was the 
demand for less govern ment. It is the theme of the GOP's "Contract for 
America." It is the mantra of conservative talk radio. It is the mandate for 
the Republican Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the measure of hypocrisy. 
</P>
<P>
 The demands Americans place on government are inconsistent and conflicting. We 
are all for less government -- except when we need government to solve our 
problems. We are for less spending -- on them, not us. We are for less 
regulation -- of us, not them. We are for lower taxes, but not for fewer 
benefits for our retired parents or our college-aged children. 
</P>
<P>
 Smart politicians play us like a piccolo. Republican Rep. Newt Gingrich of 
Georgia has been one of the smartest. 
</P>
<P>
 For years now, Gingrich has been playing the outsiders' game that hundreds of 
conservative talk-show hosts play every day. You get up in the morning and you 
look for a federal program to ridicule, a bureaucrat to rake over the coals. 
It's good politics and good radio -- and when you really find pork, it's even 
good policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes worthwhile programs suffer: Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.) is still gunning 
for midnight basketball, though studies confirm such programs are one of the 
few tools that reduce juvenile crime. And sometimes good people are sacrificed: 
Not every administrator is a do-nothing bureaucrat; some in the Department of 
Education, a frequent target, do useful work. 
</P>
<P>
 But the larger problem is that none of it adds up to very much. It's all well 
and good for newly elected senators to pledge to reduce their staffs -- as one 
Republican did when pressed on how he meant to translate his "less government" 
promise into action. But it's middle-class entitlements that threaten our 
fiscal stability, not midnight basketball or welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 If you really want to spend less, you have to deal with the sacred cows in 
U.S. politics: Social Security and Medicare. Entitlements, interest on the debt 
and defense spending account for roughly 82% of the federal budget. The Social 
Security trust fund will be broke by 2029. That's a fact, attested to by the 
fund's trustees, by a bipartisan commission on entitlements and by every 
independent assessment. Within 20 years, entitlements and interest payments on 
the national debt will eat up every penny in the federal budget, according to 
retiring GOP Sen. John Danforth of Missouri. You can close down the Capitol, 
the federal prisons, the executive branch and Congress, and we'll still be out 
of money. Less spending, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 We all know the truth, even if we don't like to admit it. That's why President 
Bill Clinton's desperation effort to shore up Democratic support by playing the 
Social Security card sounded hollow even to many of his own supporters. Now 
that we're all pledging allegiance to the ideal of less government, will we 
have the courage to embrace the commission's report, and make the hard choices? 
Will Gingrich? 
</P>
<P>
 The same goes with respect to government regulation. Nobody is for needless 
red tape. There are federal mandates in every area that should be reviewed. But 
ardent though he is in his opposition to unnecessary and expensive economic 
regulation, Gingrich and his conserva- tive allies sing a different tune when 
it comes to government regulation of people's personal lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The divisive social-cultural agenda of the Republican right calls for 
government to play a bigger role in our religious observances, our reproductive 
choices and our personal lives. Is this an agenda of more government, or less? 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich's fondness for blaming the "counterculture" for society's problems -- 
last week, he blamed the "counterculture" for the killing of the Smith children 
in South Carolina, and dismissed the President and First Lady as counterculture 
"McGovernicks" -- may strike a chord among those who see the civil-rights and 
feminist movements as the source of their own frustrations, and may cement his 
ties to the religious right. But it is an invitation for precisely the sort of 
polarizing debate that frightens many moderate Americans -- even if they agree 
with the individual positions expressed. 
</P>
<P>
 School prayer is popular, but will a divisive debate about it win converts to 
Gingrich's cause? Is this the less government we want? In the long run, a 
congressional repeat of the 1992 Republican convention could just as easily 
lead to a repeat of the 1992 general election.

<P>
 Moreover, while Americans may have voted for less government on Tuesday, it 
does not necessarily follow that they were voting for declining schools and 
dangerous streets. Clinton, certainly, has failed to persuade voters that 
government can succeed in solving the nation's fundamental problems. But the 
GOP has yet to explain how these problems can be solved without government. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone agrees, as Gingrich repeatedly points out, that it is wrong for 
12-year-olds to have babies, for 14-year-olds to bring guns to schools, for 
17-year-olds to get diplomas they cannot read. But what if they keep having 
babies even after you end welfare? What if the new prisons -- a form of big 
government no one is protesting -- don't cut into juvenile crime? What if all 
the speeches on family values don't improve test scores? If parents don't do 
their jobs, if they aren't responsible, who will fill the void? 
</P>
<P>
 No one is addressing these questions, yet. The most likely answer from 
Republicans in Washington, when they do, is that these problems can't be solved 
from Washington. The issues that dominate the debate in America today -- crime, 
drugs, education, health care, even here in California, immigration -- are 
issues being addressed primarily at the state and local level. While Washington 
engages in symbolic debates, mayors and governors have no choice but to 
confront the difficult problems that individuals cannot or will solve on their 
own. The bottom line on Tuesday's election may not be less government, but less 
federal government.*

IN A LAMENT OF THE OLD 'ESTABLISHMENT,' HOLLYWOOD ENCOUNTERS ANTI-SEMITISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Neal Gabler, Neal Gabler is author of An Empire of Their Own: How the Jews 
Invented Hollywood (Knopf). His new book, Walter Winchell: Gossip, Power and

 Reading an article, "The New Establishment," in the October Vanity Fair and 
scanning the accompanying photo of 16 movers and shakers in America's new 
communications megalith, William Cash says he was piqued. Cash, a Hollywood 
reporter for London's conservative Daily Tele- graph, was irked by the 
magazine's own coy question, "Is there anything that binds this group of men?" 
</P>
<P>
 That answer, as Cash delivers it in a scurrilous piece in the Oct. 29 issue of 
England's Spectator, is that they are "predominantly" Jewish. (Actually, nine 
of the 16 are Jewish -- but Cash isn't about to let a little arithmetic get in 
the way of a polemic.) More, Cash writes that the reason the New Establishment 
is predominantly Jewish is that it actively excludes Gentiles. 
</P>
<P>
 The article might be dismissed as an anti-Semitic bleat from a reactionary 
crackpot if it didn't have a respectable platform in the Spectator and didn't 
play to a pre-existing prejudice -- that Jews control the U.S. media. But here 
the canard is given new impetus in an environment of anti- political 
correctness, where hostility often passes for honesty. 
</P>
<P>
 Cash realizes his discovery will trigger the "inevitable shrieks of 
anti-Semitism" -- and it has -- though he seems willing to brave these attacks 
in the interest of social science. This New Establishment is a "culturally 
maladroit and culturally nihilist ( sic )" band, Titans of Tripe, Cash calls 
them after Auberon Waugh, who wear, "nylon jogging anoraks, fluffy white socks, 
digital watches and faded jeans." You call this a power structure! 
</P>
<P>
 Once upon a glorious time, Cash laments, power was in the hands (or the feet) 
of a white-shoe aristocracy. These were well-born, well-educated, well-dressed 
men (at least when wearing wingtips) -- culturally adroit and not at all 
nihilistic. They looked and acted the part of the Establishment -- in fact, 
very much like the British Establishment. Nothing arriviste here. They ruled 
seigneurially and sartorially. 
</P>
<P>
 But now the big feet of the New Establishment wear white socks -- and 
sneakers. These power brokers -- including Rupert Murdoch of Fox Film and 
Television, Bill Gates of Microsoft computer-operating systems, John C. Malone 
of the Tele-Communications cable empire, not to mention the Jews among them -- 
have not only nudged aside the Old Establishment. Their cabal practices, in 
Cash's analysis, are a "reverse form of class or racial discrimination," 
denying access to "Wasps, blacks and Brits." French, too? 
</P>
<P>
 As evidence of what he calls the feudal power structure of Hollywood, Cash 
adduces the recent formation of a new studio by Jewish director Steven 
Spielberg, Jewish record mogul David Geffen and Jewish former Disney executive 
Jeffrey Katzenberg, whom Cash castigates for green-lighting two movies, "Aspen 
Extreme" and "Love Trouble." "Beauty and the Beast" "Aladdin" and "The Lion 
King," which Katzenberg also green-lighted, apparently escaped his attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoting from an account in the Wall Street Journal, Cash recounts how this 
triumvirate sought the "rabbinical" blessing of MCA's long-time Chairman Lew R. 
Wasserman, the "last surviving Jewish founder-builder of a studio," in Cash's 
description. (Wasserman is a man of legendary proportions, but it would have 
taken preternatural precociousness for him to have founded Universal Pictures 
in 1912 -- before he was born.) 
</P>
<P>
 For Cash, this is sinister, like a capo petitioning a godfather -- Cash's own 
analogy. It seems never to have occurred to him that the three sought 
Wasserman's advice or wanted to know what Wasserman was going to do with his 
bosses at MCA's parent company, Mashushita, before they made their own move. 
</P>
<P>
 Did I say bosses? Can it be that the godfather of the Jewish cabal that 
excludes Wasps, blacks and Brits pays obeisance to a higher authority? It can, 
because the studios and telecommunications empires that Cash identifies as 
predominantly Jewish are owned and controlled by non-Jews: MCA by Mashushita, 
Columbia and Tri-Star by Sony, Fox by Murdoch, Time-Warner by stockholders and 
a corporate board.  
</P>
<P>
 Ignoring the facts to suit his myth of Jewish control, Cash is in a long 
tradition of anti-Semites who began smiting Jewish movie executives almost from 
the moment the Jews entered the film industry in the 1910s. 
</P>
<P>
 One reform group demanded that movies be liberated "from the hands of the 
devil and 500 un-Christian Jews." Another religious zealot blasted Hollywood 
Jews for the "seduction of hundreds of thoughtless girls every day," which he 
ascribed, euphemistically, to a general "Europeanization" of the country. Henry 
Ford, in his Dearborn Independent, cited Jewish control of the film industry 
and said, "It is the genius of that race to create problems of a moral 
character in whatever business they achieve a majority." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea was that Jews were somehow different from the majority of Gentile 
Americans. Jews didn't subscribe to the same values. They had taken control of 
this powerful instrument of social control, but they couldn't use it 
responsibly. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether by design or sheer ignorance, they were said to be using the movies to 
subvert so-called traditional values, though anyone who studies film history 
knows, no group was more conscious of traditional values or more eagerly sought 
to purvey them than the Jewish movie pioneers -- who regarded themselves as 
American first, Jewish second. 
</P>
<P>
 In those days, opponents characterized the Jews as vulgar and mercenary. Cash 
characterizes them, at best, as "compulsive story-tellers and talented 
negotiators," at worst, as parvenu protectionists. In his ugliest aside, he 
describes a beleaguered Gentile would-be producer who has dressed as a Jew, 
attempting to pass. His uniform? A black nylon track suit, gold chains on his 
wrists and a "chunky" Star of David around his neck. 
</P>
<P>
 No one could, or should, deny that the motion-picture industry is 
disproportionately Jewish at the creative executive level -- since Jews 
constitute roughly 4% of the population. Nor could, or should, anyone deny that 
the first generation of Hollywood pioneers created the industry, in part, as an 
empire they could govern after being denied access to the old, East Coast 
Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, it never seems to have occurred to Cash that what unites the members of 
the New Establishment -- as it united the Jews and Catholics of the old 
Hollywood -- is a sense of marginality. Looking over the roster of Vanity 
Fair's "16," one sees children of the middle class struggling to reach the top, 
college dropouts, even a few dyslexics who said they had to work harder because 
they were regarded as stupid. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it doesn't occur to Cash because to stigmatize these high achievers 
would be stigmatizing effort, achievement, merit. Stigmatizing Jews is much 
easier -- especially since many are loath to fight back. (In a New York Times 
article on the Cash controversy, not one Jewish executive was willing to go on 
record.) 
</P>
<P>
 But Jews are only an excuse and opportunity. The deeper issue has always been 
power. Genteel elitists couldn't abide the fact that they were losing control 
of the culture to individuals they regarded as socially inferior -- even 
though, as Cash points out, citing my book, "An Empire of Their Own: How the 
Jews Invented Hollywood" in approving support, the Jewish moguls slavishly 
imitated the old Establishment as they unwittingly helped destroy it. They 
attempted to remake themselves in its image. 
</P>
<P>
 The cardinal sin of the New Establishment in its symbolic white socks is that 
it doesn't give a damn about white shoes. Its members don't want to imitate 
their social betters because, in Cash's view, they are too myopic to recognize 
that the old Establishment is better than they. They have the temerity to see 
the old elite and its institutions as, in Cash's words, "anachronistic jokes." 
</P>
<P>
 This seems to hit Cash where he lives, but at least he is no hypocrite about 
it. He obviously believes Hollywood and the world would be better places if the 
New Establishment and its nine Jews would hand culture back to the people who 
deserve it -- people presumably like Cash. At the very least, they should share 
their power. He closes by citing the "white-sock mediocracy" as "another 
example of how driven Jews have always dealt with exclusion. Barred from one 
form of Establishment, they have ended up helping to create their own." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, an article like Cash's is another example of how powerless elitists 
have always dealt with exclusion. Barred from one form of Establishment, they 
end up spewing anti-Semitic bile.*

AT THE BIRTH OF A NEW -- AND YOUNGER -- LATINO ACTIVISM

<P>
 On Election Day, a friend of mine, a Mexican American school administrator, 
called me. Earlier that day, one of his students, a 12-year-old girl, had 
approached him before class and cautiously asked him if she was still allowed 
to come to school the next day. As an educator, my friend has seen drug abuse, 
child abuse and classroom neglect. Still, he told me, in a voice choked with 
emotion, this was his most painful experience yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this the intention of Proposition 187, which would, among other things, 
deny a public education to illegal immigrants? Is this the message that Gov. 
Pete Wilson, and all who voted for the initiative, wanted to send to Washington 
concerning the nation's fastest-growing ethnic group? Was it, "stop growing?" 
</P>
<P>
 I was not really surprised that some Latinos -- presumably, some of my fellow 
Mexican Americans -- would vote for such a spiteful initiative. Indeed, a Los 
Angeles Times exit poll found that 22% of them voted to "save our state." But 
from whom? From those who share our surnames, skin color and Catholic saints? 
</P>
<P>
 For months, Mexican Americans op- posed to 187 had been confessing their anger 
and frustration that some of our gente would tacitly support it. The diagnosis 
was amnesia. It was said that, in our eagerness to be accepted by the white 
mainstream, we had forgotten where we come from and the significance of those 
old black-and-white photographs in Grandmother's dresser drawer. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Election Day, we did not forget where we come from; more times than 
not, we remembered. Just a few weeks earlier, a Times poll had revealed that up 
to 52% of surveyed Latinos favored Proposition 187, a figure that was cut in 
half when the generic "illegal alien" assumed a brown face and, thanks to Gov. 
Wilson, a name, "Pedro." 
</P>
<P>
 That is only part of the silver lining to this black cloud. Finally, scores of 
angry Mexican Americans are realizing that, in times of crisis, the sidelines 
are an irresponsible place to stand. My phone rings endlessly with people 
asking, "What should we do now?" The school administrator assures that even if 
187 is upheld in the courts, he will not enforce it. "They can fire me. They 
can arrest me. But I won't do it!" 
</P>
<P>
 A young Mexican-American surgeon tells me the same thing. "I hope the jail 
cells are big enough for me to operate in . . . because that's where they'll 
have to put me." The Mexican-American Christian youth minister is rambling on 
about some higher law, and preparing meetings of young people to invent 
creative ways to "circumvent" what he considers an immoral man-made law. The 
signs are everywhere. La resistance is forming. 
</P>
<P>
 Look beyond the Mexican flags in the newspaper photographs. There! That young 
girl, barely 15, speaking with such passion about an issue that hit close to 
home. Disproving the myth that Generation X lacks a political soul, she is the 
answer to the dreams of scores of Latino grandmothers. She is also the 
nightmare of old guard Mexican American leadership, teetering on irrelevancy at 
the brink of a new century. She is our 21st Century mayor, our governor. All 
this has been her political baptism -- her Chicago Democratic convention, her 
Kent State. If she becomes naturalized, if she registers, if she votes, the 
fire in her belly will warm us all. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the road to political empowerment is a bumpy one. Without much of a 
blueprint to follow, such youngsters are sure to make mistakes. They may revert 
to the familiar apathy -- Latin American fatalism -- that paralyzed those who 
came before them. They may assume, wrongly, that there are no allies to be 
found among non-Latinos. They may follow their elders down the narrow path of 
devotion to only one political party, cutting off important avenues of 
communication and cooperation. They may even cannibalize themselves, turning on 
one another instead of working together toward common ends. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, these political novices will stumble along in much the same way 
older politicos did years ago. Inevitably, along the way, the paths of the old 
and the young will meet. Expect hotly contested political races -- Latino vs. 
Latino. Expect a shifting of power away from Gloria Molina and Mike Hernandez 
and Richard Allatorre and toward a new crop of charismatic immigrant leaders 
with youth and energy. 
</P>
<P>
 When I was a child, my father used to tell me stories about a Sleeping Giant. 
Look at a map: Latinos are 40% of this city, 60% of that one. So much political 
dynamite, he'd lament, and no spark to light it. For much of my lifetime, 
people have teased the Giant; knowing he wouldn't wake up, they poked and 
prodded. Last year, in Fresno, when the City Council rescinded an earlier order 
to rename a street after the late Cesar Chavez, there were complaints and 
grumblings. Old politicos cursed the council for its gesture of political 
disrespect but, in the end, they reverted to their familiar cynicism and the 
Giant slept on. Somehow, as I study the pictures in the morning paper and hear 
the passionate testimony of young people savoring their first taste of 
politics, I cannot imagine that a new generation will continue to be as 
resigned to insult as previous ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Make no mistake. No matter how many champagne corks were popped in celebration 
last week, this is not the end. What distinguishes the new Latino activism from 
that of previous generations is, among other things, fierce immigrant identity 
among the young, who seem more interested in a devout nationalism than in the 
lofty American traditions of assimilation. The new activists want not so much 
to be accepted as to be respected. They seem to have already learned the first 
lesson of American politics: Power concedes nothing without demand. 
</P>
<P>
 At the threshold of a new century in which the population of Latinos will 
continue to grow -- as Jack Kemp and William Bennett noted "with or without 
immigration" -- this is, for a new and more politically active generation, a 
new beginning.*

THE NATION; ROSTENKOWSKI'S LAST RACE: THE DEATH OF THE OLD MACHINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ben Joravsky, Ben Joravsky, a staff writer for the Chicago Reader, is 
writing a book based on the movie Hoop Dreams. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chicago's great Democratic Machine died last week when Rep. Dan Rostenkowski 
was ousted after 36 years in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 When the polls closed, a breathy TV reporter predicted we'd be up all night, 
waiting for results. But it was over early -- and wasn't even close. 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski -- the Polish kid from Damen Avenue who chaired the House Ways 
and Means Committee, wrote tax laws and made favor-seeking rich guys wait in 
his outer office -- lost to a Republican. And it wasn't even a charismatic 
Republican, but a pudgy little guy named Michael Patrick Flanagan, who nibbles 
at the end of his mustache like a mouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The voters, experts said, were tired of Rostenkowski's arrogance and 
embarrassed by his recent 17-count indictment, alleging he stole almost 
$700,000 in taxpayer and campaign money. "You can't expect people to elect a 
guy with so many flaws." one ward committeeman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, I don't know. Old Mayor Richard J. Daley got voters, dead and alive to 
elect some of the world's sleaziest ruffi-ans. 
</P>
<P>
 No. Rostenkowski lost because the machine that produced him has gone the way 
of its counterparts in Jersey City, Boston, Kansas City and Baton Rouge. Many 
of its leaders jumped ship and became Republicans after Harold Washington, a 
black Democrat, got elected mayor. Its army of precinct workers is low. "You 
can't make them care if the party loses," one committeeman lament ed. "Thanks 
to civil service they're not dependent on us for jobs anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 There is a fine tradition in Chicago of insurrections against the machine. 
They're usually led by a motley bunch of misfits -- anarchists, Republicans, 
socialists, starry-eyed college kids, renegade regulars bearing a personal 
grudge. They agree on one thing only: They despise the incumbent. Ah, what 
thrilling escapades their campaigns are: good vs. evil in a door-to-door war 
waged in the streets. The machine goes down fighting -- slashing posters, 
smashing windows, knocking pregnant women to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Flanagan's forces faced nothing like that. He shouldn't even get full credit 
for his victory -- an asterisk should follow his name, like there was for Roger 
Maris, who beat Babe Ruth's home-run record by playing in more games. 
Flanagan's no giant killer. He beat a tired old man. 
</P>
<P>
 When enough votes were counted, Flanagan waddled before the cameras and 
promised to trim taxes. You call that a big-city congressman? I want my 
congressman to go out and tax rich suburbanites and spend their money filling 
my potholes and paving my streets. I want my congressman to walk with a swagger 
and call people "pal." 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski once called me "pal." In 1983, I approached him at a political 
rally and asked if he was going to endorse Washington for mayor. After all, 
they were both Democrats. "I don't think so, pal," he said, slapping my back. 
"I need Harold in Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, I covered a protest of factory workers outside Rostenkowski's 
Damen Avenue office. It was a rainy day in late fall. The organizers hoped for 
100 protesters but with the rain, only 30 or so showed up. They walked in a 
circle and waved their signs, while their leaders bellowed incomprehensible 
declarations of defiance over a bullhorn that cackled and snorted. They were 
worried because a local auto-parts factory, which once employed 10,000, might 
close. Its work force had been halved, wages frozen and plans were afoot to 
move more operations to factories in Tennessee and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski and the company's CEO, it turned out, were golfing buddies. The 
protesters wanted Rostenkowski to use his influence to persuade the CEO to keep 
jobs in Chicago. Alas, they walked in the rain for an hour before a baby-faced 
aide came out. "The congressman's not here -- he's in Washington," the aide 
said. "But you can make an appointment to meet with him through me." 
</P>
<P>
 Then and there, I should have recognized the signs of Rostenkowski's ruin. The 
machine that elected him was rooted in stable, blue-collar communities. When 
the factories left, the communities shriveled and the machine lost its base. 
You can see the results in row after row of desolation -- vacant lots, 
boarded-up buildings, dope dealers on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 I guess Rostenkowski forgot his place was on that picket line with those 
workers and not with the rich guys waiting in his outer office. Years in power 
must have turned his head. He forgot he was just another Polish kid from Damen 
Avenue. Just another cog in Daley's machine. The CEO may play a great round of 
golf -- but he didn't vote in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski never did meet with those protesters. A few years later, the 
factory closed and most of its workers are still unemployed. The factory itself 
was recently cleared to make way for 200 or so upscale townhouses. They're 
being marketed to young singles, junior partners who want to live closer to 
their downtown offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Flanagan will get their votes, but not many more. His support remains 
weak. On Election Day I bumped into an old friend named Rich, who's about as 
liberal as they get. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who did you vote for?" he asked, as I emerged from our polling place. "the 
crook or the fascist?" 
</P>
<P>
 "The crook," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich shook his head. "I voted for the fascist," he said. "I figure he'll be in 
office for two years and then we'll vote some Democrat in." 
</P>
<P>
 Rich may be right. Already several prominent local Democrats are whispering 
about their 1996 ambitions. I can see them now, going to the townhouses where 
the factory had stood, and promising voters to trim taxes. Not a one of them 
can fill a pothole or pave a street.*

THE NATION; TRANSPLANTED CALIFORNIANS HELPED TO RETIRE FOLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John Arthur Wilson, John Arthur Wilson is political editor of the Seattle 
Weekly and a producer for ABC News. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By Tuesday's election, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley knew he would have to 
carry his hometown of Spokane big if there was any hope of winning a 16th term 
to Congress. But this was a different Spokane from the one Foley knew. An 
influx of newcomers, from around Washington state but especially from 
California, had changed local political dynamics. And it was these newcomers -- 
who lacked decades of loyalty to Foley -- who would cost him his cherished seat 
in the House. 
</P>
<P>
 Foley narrowly won Spokane County, but as of late last week, he trailed 
Republican George Nethercutt by 2,500 votes -- ending a legislative career that 
began with the 1964 landslide of Lyndon B. Johnson. True, Foley paid dearly for 
his backing of an assault-weapons ban. He was clobbered in the more rural 
counties of Eastern Washington's 5th District. That had been always rough 
territory for the courtly Foley, a man more partial to Brooks Brothers than 
Day-Glo hunting vests. But in the past, Foley had always mopped up in Spokane 
-- forging a coalition of business leaders, well-heeled farmers and union 
members from the local aluminum plant. 
</P>
<P>
 But Spokane has been changing while 65-year-old Foley has been in that other 
Washington. The city's population has grown to 185,600, from 177,165 in 1990, 
and in Spokane County, total population (including the city) has swollen to 
392,000, from 361,364 just four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 A December, 1993, survey indicated these newcomers were coming from one state 
more than any other. Once you got beyond in-state migration, the largest 
percentage of new arrivals (16%) were from California. Neighboring Idaho was 
second, but at only 7%. The survey, by Robinson Research Spokane, showed these 
California arrivals to be younger, better educated, more with children than the 
area average and with a lower household income. Equity fat from selling their 
homes in California, they snatched up $250,000 homes in Spokane for cash, 
driving real-estate prices skyward. 
</P>
<P>
 In many cases, they were fleeing from the Golden State's sour economy, shaky 
school system and gang warfare. Even now, the Spokane Chamber of Commerce 
reports that almost half its requests for relocation information come from 
Californians. Chamber volunteer Janice Parr knows what's driving them; she just 
arrived in the Lilac City from Fresno two months ago. "There was just too much 
gang activity," says Parr, mother of an 8-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
 Parr didn't arrive and register in time to vote in the Foley-Nethercutt race, 
but she's symbolic of the changing voter in Spokane. Foley's own polling, while 
not specifically surveying whether potential voters were Spokane-area 
newcomers, highlighted the Speaker's problem. He did well with women voters, 
aged 25 to 55, and seniors, generally long-time locals who retain fond memories 
of Foley before Congress was daily vilified on talk radio. His problem came, 
according to Janet Gilpatrick, Foley's top aide in the district, with younger 
voters, especially males, 18 to 33 -- just the kind of voter moving into the 
area from California. 
</P>
<P>
 The contrast between the young and old voter, and the long-time resident 
versus the newcomer, also came through loud and clear as you traveled the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months ago, I dropped into the Pine Shed Cafe along Spokane's neon-lit 
North Division Street. It was bedrock Spokane: a classic, smoky, greasy spoon 
where they don't serve espresso drinks but they'll happily get you two eggs, 
bacon, hash browns and a side of local politics. I got the trio -- two men and 
one woman, all in their 50s -- sitting adjacent to me talking about Foley. 
"He's just on the wrong side of the fence," said Rhett Mullis in his native 
Carolinians' drawl. "He's saved Fairchild," countered Marion Sawyer, referring 
to the Air Force base outside Spokane. 
</P>
<P>
 On a downtown street corner, amid boarded-up storefronts, I spoke to a small 
group of young women waiting for a bus. Foley's long career, his clout, even 
the Speakership, didn't mean much to them. They were worried about layoffs at a 
local hospital (thanks to talk of health-care reform), soaring rents as real 
estate boomed and increasing gang violence (another of those benefits brought 
by transplanted L.A. gang members). 
</P>
<P>
 To these voters new to the district -- to those California transplants and 
thousands of others -- he was the personal embodiment of Congress and the 
Democrats' 40-year control of the House. Foley's predecessor, the late Speaker 
Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill, was wrong in this case. This time, politics wasn't 
local; it was national -- the Republican flip side of the kind of partisan 
sweep that brought a young Foley to Congress 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1964, Foley defeated 22-year veteran GOP Congressman Walt Horan, arguing it 
was time for a change. This year, Nethercutt, a 50-year-old lawyer and former 
Senate aide, like Foley was when he first ran for Congress, made the same case. 
To the newer voters, said Seattle Democratic political analyst Ron Dotzauer, 
"It was time to give Tom the gold watch."*

THE WORLD; CLINTON'S TASK IN ASIA: WOOING A PARTNER WITH INDEPENDENT WAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert A. Manning, Robert A. Manning, a senior fellow at the Progressive 
Policy Institute, is a former State Department official. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Air Force One sets down in Jakarta today, Bill Clinton will try to 
reassure anxious Asian leaders, gathering for an Asia Pacific Economic 
Cooperation summit, that he is still in charge of U.S. policy toward the 
region. A year ago, the President strutted to Seattle to host the conference 
armed with a congressional OK for the North American Free Trade Agreement. This 
year, he shows up without similar approval for a new global-trade accord, or 
even "fast track" authority to negotiate the trade pacts that will be a central 
theme in Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony is that although Clinton was weakened on Election Day, his Asian 
policy has been increasingly in tune with Asian trends. Last May, he wisely 
decoupled human rights from China's trade status. In September, he put aside 
sharp words and negotiated a modest trade accord with Japan. And after edging 
to the brink of conflict with North Korea, he reached a deal that, if 
implemented, could end Pyongyang's nuclear threat. 
</P>
<P>
 This hardly amounts to the ambitious "New Pacific Community" that Clinton has 
called for. But his Administration is learning and, along the way, recouping 
some of its lost credibility in Asia. The challenge in Indonesia will be to 
demonstrate to Americans back home that U.S. economic and political engagement 
in Asia is good for the country and that its price is not abandonment of human 
rights. As for Asians, Clinton must persuade them that the United States will 
be a reliable, long-term partner, not an imperious, condescending one. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in the best of political times, balancing these competing and sometimes 
conflicting goals is a near impossible task. With some $360 billion in two-way 
trade across the Pacific -- one-third of U.S. exports -- and about 3 million 
jobs depending on our continued ties to the region, the stakes are enormous. 
</P>
<P>
 But Americans, generally, and the Administration, particularly, have a rough 
time facing a central fact: Our stake in East Asia is increasing even as our 
leverage is decreasing. East Asia has come of age. It is no longer dependent on 
U.S. aid and less dependent on U.S. markets. Japan and Taiwan now trade more 
within Asia than with the United States. The enormously high Asian savings 
rates allow East Asians to invest more and more in each other's economies. And 
although the U.S. military presence and various security alliances remain 
crucial to regional stability, East Asians are now talking about ways to ensure 
their own mutual security and are modernize their own military forces in 
anticipation of a diminished U.S. role. But they all want us as a major 
partner. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure of Clinton's success, or failure, at the conference will be 
twofold: Will the APEC forum be strengthened, and will the United States come 
away with stronger and more stable relations with host Indonesia? 
</P>
<P>
 The debate within APEC is over whether to commit all its 18 members to 
achieving a Pacific free-trade zone by a certain date. While freer 
trans-Pacific trade is a noble goal, there is real danger that grandiose 
visions may undercut more practical approaches and support for the Asia-Pacific 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 Few Asian economies are as open as that of the United States. Many of their 
trade barriers are not traditional ones like tariffs but invisible or 
structural hurdles, such as Japan's clubby business culture and labyrinthine 
regulations or China's lack of clear rules. For Clinton, whose Administration 
barely got NAFTA through Congress because of congressional worries about 
Mexican cheap labor, raising the specter of free-trade accords with China and 
Indonesia, the world's largest pool of cheap labor, would be a protectionist's 
delight. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, five years after its inception, Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation 
has yet to achieve any concrete results. While there is no harm in upholding a 
vision of an open-trade zone, Clinton would be wise to put the focus on a 
building-block approach to such issues as harmonizing standards and customs 
procedures and liberalizing important sectors like telecommunications. APEC 
must demonstrate to the private sector its ability to facilitate trade and 
investment in the near term. 
</P>
<P>
 The matter of improving U.S.-Indonesian relations is as important -- and 
difficult. There are a host of contentious issues -- human rights, labor 
rights, press freedoms, repression in East Timor, to name a few -- on the 
table. But Indonesia is a dynamic society in transition. It is a major oil and 
gas producer, the largest Islamic nation and a country that favors a U.S. 
security role in Asia, working closely with Washington on regional issues like 
the Cambodia peace accord. 
</P>
<P>
 Indonesia is also a metaphor for the tension between interests and values that 
dogs U.S. policy in Asia. One can focus on Indonesia's human-rights problems 
(and there are many) and threaten to cut back already miniscule amounts of aid, 
or one can pursue a course of constructive engagement. Indonesia is also 
representative of larger trends in Asia, all favorable to U.S. goals: Jakarta 
has been slowly, but steadily, deregulating its economy, opening up its 
markets, and welcoming foreign investment. Although autocratic, human-rights 
and labor groups are permitted to operate, though all too often face 
repression. 
</P>
<P>
 As Indonesia's economy has expanded at a 6% annual clip for more than two 
decades and has diversified from oil, gas and timber into manufacturing, a 
class of technocrats (many educated at UC Berkeley) has come onto the scene to 
steer its success. In the last 10 years, the experience in Asia has been that 
such economic dynamism produces large, urban middle classes who gradually 
demand more pluralist, accountable governments. Democratization occurred in the 
Philippines in 1986, in South Korea in 1988, and more recently in Taiwan and 
Thailand. There are bound to be setbacks, as at Tian An Men. But the trends are 
clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton would thus be well-advised to pursue a policy that understands Asian 
dynamics, exhibits patience as well as firmness and forges a more equal 
partnership across the Pacific. It is a challenge we must meet, and an 
opportunity that could put new energy into the Clinton presidency.*

LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW; RUDOLPH GIULIANI; WILL A CROSS-PARTY ENDORSEMENT 
RESULT IN YEARS OF REPERCUSSIONS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Thomas Plate, Thomas Plate is editor of the editorial pages of The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rudolph W. Giuliani is the mayor of New York City and a Republican. Therein 
lies the tale. 
</P>
<P>
 The last such endangered species was John V. Lindsay, a patrician Republican 
from Yale. Before that was the flamboyant Fiorello H. La Guardia -- the kind of 
Republican Giuliani, 50, wants to be -- a GOPer who sails against the wind and 
can thus govern this overwhelmingly Democratic city. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, on a Saturday afternoon right before the election, this Republican -- 
married to former TV newscaster Donna Hanover and the father of Andrew, 8, and 
Caroline, 5 -- was working the phones in his sumptuous City Hall office on 
behalf of a Democrat. He was trying to get incumbent Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, whom 
he had endorsed earlier that week in a stunning move, reelected to a fourth 
term. Giuliani sincerely believed the New York City-born Cuomo would pursue 
policies far more favorable to the metropolis than the challenger, a heretofore 
relatively obscure state senator named George E. Pataki, who was born and 
raised in upstate New York -- a culture with as much sympathy for New York City 
as, say, San Franciscans have for Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point during the conversation in his office, the White House returned 
Giuliani's call to find out what else he thought the President should do to 
help Cuomo. The mayor asked for one more visit to New York by Clinton. But as 
the results on Nov. 8 showed, nothing could save Cuomo. Not even an 
electrifying endorsement by one of America's most interesting new politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 But now perhaps one of its most besieged. It may be a long time before New 
York Republicans forgive Giuliani for his betrayal of the party's nominee. And 
long-time political rival Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato is likely to make sure that 
absolutely no one in his party ever forgets it. But in Democratic New York 
City, the former federal prosecutor, by appearing to put the interests of the 
city over that of his party, may just have advanced his dream: to be the new La 
Guardia.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: We have a Republican mayor in Los Angeles who endorsed the Democrat 
Dianne Feinstein for reelection, and there's a Republican mayor in New York 
City who endorsed Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo. What's going on?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Dick Riordan and I analyze things very much the same way, which is, 
that we realize that we have to put the good of our city ahead of blind party 
loyalty. If we can, in any way, consistently support our party, consistent with 
the interests of the city, then we'll do that, even if you have to give the 
benefit of the doubt to your party . . . . But when there is a wide 
discrepancy, as the one that I faced between Mario Cuomo and George Pataki, you 
have to do what is best for your city. I assume the same thing is true with 
Dick Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: When you see big cities, you think Democrats, but in two of the biggest, 
New York and Los Angeles, you see Republican mayors. What are you and Riordan 
doing that people are responding to?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I believe we're both using what I consider the core principles of the 
Republican Party, and it energizes people. Trying to deal with the problems of 
poverty -- whether it's the lack of a home, or a co-op or a condominium -- and 
look to small business as a way in which you can work to meet the needs. The 
Republican direction we've been going in has more freedom to offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You think that's a sellable concept?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, I think it works, and the heavier emphasis on law enforcement and 
individual responsibility is also a corrective to the more kind of 
environmental or societal approach that had occurred before . . . . The crime 
bill expressed the new emphasis. But now, of course, (with our success) the 
Republican Party is feeling the responsibility of having two mayors who run 
America's two largest cities. And, over the next year or two, the debate will 
be: Does the Republican Party work? Does it broaden to embrace this new 
responsibility? If it does, then the base of the Republican Party can be 
expanded immeasurably. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: On that point, then, you endorsed a Democrat. People like that -- you are 
your own guy. But still, there's a lot of dissatisfaction out there. And a lot 
of unhappiness with both parties, to the point where there's even a growing 
interest in a third party.  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. I see it in the politics of the state today. But I'm probably more 
comfortable with that than would normally be the case. I was the candidate of 
two third parties each time I ran for mayor. I was a candidate not only of the 
Republican Party -- but of the Liberal Party, which has been an established 
third party for years in New York, and also of a new party. That, probably as 
much as anything else, got me elected mayor. Third-party upsurge says that 
people are uncomfortable with the usual two parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Municipal financing is increasingly difficult. There's less money to go 
around. Your job, I guess, is to lower expectations as to what city government 
can do for you. How do you diminish those expectations?  
</P>
<P>
 A: People are all complaining about the cutbacks. So I go to meet them and try 
to show them the budget, to show them the amount of money that we have, the 
amount of money that we realistically can take out of the economy, the amount 
of money we have to work with . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 My job is to try to show why we can manage with 10% less, and that that's 
needed to help the overall economy and the competitive position of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 It may also be in New York that we didn't have these pressures before. Our 
economy has changed dramatically. What I often say is that a mayor in the 
position that I'm in 30 years ago could just have increased taxes and not 
worried about it. Nobody was gonna leave. They had to be here. Now, people can 
use faxes, they can use telecommunication. They're not geographically locked to 
the city . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Q: One thing you have in common with Dick Riordan is that you both came into 
office on a plank of great concern for crime and doing something about it.  
</P>
<P>
 A: Could I just give you an observation about Dick and me. We were on the same 
Sunday morning TV talk show, and he had been in office about seven or eight 
months; I had just been elected. By this time, we had spoken on the phone -- 
spoken to each other no more than a half hour. Yet, on the TV show, we gave 
basically the same answers to almost every question. The point is, we're facing 
the same problems, and the pragmatic and rational solutions turn out to be 
pretty much the same thing. That's why we end up in the same position. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: One problem he faces, more immediately, is the illegal-immigration issue -- 
which, you know, has ballooned in California into Proposition 187 -- which you 
op posed. But the reason it's now a big problem is it's been allowed to fester 
for so long.  
</P>
<P>
 A: Our cities differ (on this) . . . . and this may be something that both I 
and (former Mayor) David Dinkins owe to Ed Koch. Ed Koch faced this problem in 
1987 with a very rational solution that he put into an executive order . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The executive order essentially says: Focus your attention on the illegal and 
undocumented aliens who commit crimes . Since there are more of them than the 
INS and the federal government are willing to handle, anyway, when you start 
handling that effectively, then we can start to handle the rest of it -- which 
is sort of a Koch pragmatic approach. 
</P>
<P>
 So, what the executive order did was, it said that if a person who gets 
arrested for a crime, or suspected of a crime, is illegal or undocumented, that 
information is turned over to the INS immediately, and we urge the INS to 
deport them . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 However, if the person is seeking treatment in a hospital for a contagious 
disease or an injury, if the person is putting their child in a public school 
or the person is reporting a crime that they're the victim of, then that person 
will be protected. 
</P>
<P>
 This I spent a lot of time talking to Koch about -- because I was the U.S. 
attorney when he first put this policy into effect. His analysis of it is, I 
think, flawless. He says, look, even if you can't see the humanity of this, ask 
yourself the following question: If you have 100,000 children, conceivably, in 
a city or a state, who are the children of illegal or undocumented aliens, and 
the federal government, at least at this point in history, can't do anything 
about it -- how can the city? 
</P>
<P>
 Now, do you want them on the streets? Or do you want them in the school? Of 
course, you want them in the school.  
</P>
<P>
 If a person has just been knifed by someone, and they go into a hospital, do 
you want the hospital to say, "Because you don't have a green card, die"? Or do 
you want a city that says, "We'll care for you, we consider life important." . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 Q: I know you favor small business and entrepreneurship. But one difficulty 
for you and Dick Riordan down the road is if the cities are worse, people will 
say they can't be revived without massive federal help. And you're not going to 
get federal help. How can you get out of this box?  
</P>
<P>
 A: What I promised people is improvement, not miracles. Even with massive 
federal help, you wouldn't have miracles. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of what we're dealing with is beyond the absolute capacity of federal, 
state or local government to deal with. So what I try to do is to get people 
focused on slow but steady improvement. Let's show a city getting cleaner. A 
city is getting safer -- but not perfectly safe. Let's show a city in which the 
educational system starts to do better -- though it's not gonna reach 
perfection. 
</P>
<P>
 It is necessary to scale down peoples' expectation. Because one of the cruel 
things that we've done to people is to raise their expectations of what 
government can do for them. Government then fails. It could never have done it 
in the first place. People become alienated from government, angry about 
themselves. Then they go to the opposite extreme and say government can't do 
anything right, which is also wrong . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I have this sort of faith that if you do the little things well, and you show 
improvement, and people figure out how to do the major sociological 
improvements themselves -- you give them the foundation on which to do it . . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: How bad or good a job is Bill Clinton doing?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I like Bill Clinton. I've developed a good relationship with him. I think 
that he did a very good job on the crime bill. I think his health-care program 
obviously stalled, hadn't been thought out as effectively as it could be, 
wasn't organized as well. We'll have to see what happens to it next year. But I 
think that Republicans make a terrible mistake by trying to figure out how 
we're gonna run against Bill Clinton now, as opposed to when you get there . . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 Maybe this comes out of not having spent a lifetime in partisan politics; you 
have to root for the President. This is going to be totally counterproductive, 
even for Republicans. If you don't work with the President, you don't root for 
the President, you don't try to help him be a success and then if he isn't, 
then you have some legitimate positions on which to run against him. But just 
to run against him for the purpose of running against him -- I mean I don't see 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 You certainly can't do that if you want to run a city. You've got to be 
willing to work with the President. That's where you strike a responsive chord. 
Because what you're saying is partisanship for partisanship's sake is not gonna 
cut it anymore. It adds to peoples' cynicism and turns people off . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Q: Can you work with the new governor?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It's not a matter of can. Both of us have a responsibility to do it. New 
York City is the principal contributor of tax dollars to the state of New York. 
We contribute $3 million-$4 million more than we receive back from state; so 
the economy of the city is crucial to the success of the state. Both the mayor 
and the governor have an interest in the economy of the city continuing to do 
well. After a partisan election, there are always hard feelings to get over. A 
sign of leadership is the ability to get over them. I supported President Bush, 
and President Clinton supported my opponent in the last election. Yet, I am 
capable of working with President Clinton on areas of mutual interest.*

KEEPING AN OPEN MIND ABOUT NEW TAX IDEAS; GOP LAWMAKERS HAVE PLANS -- SOME 
WORTHY, SOME FLAKY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some of the Republicans who will be prime movers when the GOP becomes 
Congress' majority party in January are starting to detail their agendas for 
change. None of the plans appears to be more ambitious than that of Bill 
Archer, who is expected to head the all-important House Ways and Means 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 To a large extent the Texan's ideas reflect the debatable "contract with 
America" that many Republican congressional candidates signed two months before 
last week's election. Legislation will be pushed to deprive most welfare 
recipients of their eligibility after two years; a $500 tax credit for each 
child under the age of 17 will be sought; there will be a major effort to slash 
the capital gains tax rate from 28% to 14%. 
</P>
<P>
 But Archer wants to see GOP tax policy go much further. Notably, he wants to 
explore doing away with the federal income tax, which the 16th Amendment to the 
Constitution gave Congress the power to levy 81 years ago. In place of a tax on 
income he would impose a form of national sales tax -- at what rate he hasn't 
specified -- an idea long resisted by liberals and others who argue, 
persuasively, that it would disproportionately burden the less-well-off. 
</P>
<P>
 A DISTANT GOAL: The philosophical core of Archer's argument is that tax policy 
shouldn't penalize individual initiative or discourage private savings, which 
Republicans believe is now the case. Archer recognizes, of course, that an idea 
as radical as abolishing the income tax is likely to remain only a topic of 
debate for years to come. If nothing else, that debate ought to produce some 
interesting studies and arguments touching on issues of both practical 
economics and social justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Plainly, federal revenues would fall dramatically if the income tax were 
replaced by a consumption tax. One question that immediately occurs is how much 
states and municipalities would have to boost their taxes to make up for the 
inevitable loss of federal subventions. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Republican tax-cutting proposals in particular do seem to us worthy of 
adoption. At the top of the list should be elimination of the so-called 
marriage penalty. Under current law, most married couples who file jointly have 
to pay more in taxes than two single people with the same incomes who file 
separately. This anti-family inequity, which never made any sense, should go. 
</P>
<P>
 So should the tax penalty that now limits Social Security recipients between 
the ages of 65 and 70 to $11,000 a year in earned income. The effect of this 
discriminatory rule is to dissuade people who may still have much to contribute 
to the economy and society from continuing to use their skills. America needs 
more experience in the workplace, not less. 
</P>
<P>
 TROUBLESOME NUMBERS: Finally, we like the idea of restoring tax breaks to all 
savers by broadening eligibility for IRAs, individual retirement accounts. The 
nation has an alarmingly low 3% personal savings rate, making the United States 
heavily dependent on foreign lenders and investors. Boosting the savings rate 
is essential, and incentives to do so are certainly valid tax policy. 
</P>
<P>
 All these estimable ideas, of course, would reduce revenues to the federal 
Treasury, and as always the problem is how to balance the books so that the 
government can keep doing those things that even the most conservative of 
Republicans agree must be done -- paying interest on the national debt, funding 
defense, maintaining the Social Security system. The "contract with America" 
doesn't offer a lot of help here. 
</P>
<P>
 According to House Republican numbers crunchers, the GOP program would produce 
nearly $220 billion in tax cuts by the year 2000 but only $70 billion in 
spending reductions. So where is that other $150 billion to come from? If Bill 
Archer and other tax-hating players in the 104th Congress have an answer, 
they're not revealing it yet.

POST-ELECTION: MORE ORDER IN THE COURTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The resounding passage of Proposition 184, the "three-strikes-and-you're-out" 
initiative, is only one of the new electoral changes that will affect the 
courts of California. Two other measures that were on the Nov. 8 ballot -- and 
perhaps some proposals that weren't -- also portend major shifts in the way our 
trial and appellate courts operate and, possibly, who sits on those courts. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the passage of Proposition 184, following enactment of the 
virtually identical "three-strikes" law last March, means that state courts 
will be preoccupied as never before with criminal trials and appeals. The law 
enacted earlier this year, which mandates terms of 25 years to life in state 
prison for those convicted of a third felony, has already discouraged plea 
bargains, resulting in many more trials. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Downtown courthouse of the Los Angeles Superior Court, judges who hear 
civil matters are already postponing civil cases so they can hear the 
increasing volume of criminal matters that, by statute, must be taken up more 
quickly. By December, court officials predict, fully half of the Downtown civil 
courtrooms will be assigned to hear criminal cases. Civil litigants, no matter 
how pressing their claims, will have to wait, possibly for years, for an open 
courtroom.  
</P>
<P>
 The answer, if there is one, to this gathering storm is greater efficiency and 
more judges. But given the huge costs of "three-strikes" enforcement, including 
outlays for prison construction and operation, the addition of new judges is 
unlikely. Streamlining court operation alone cannot compensate for the added 
caseload generated by the "three-strikes" measures. But some efficiencies have 
been accomplished and more are possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 191, also passed last Tuesday, will eliminate the state's few 
remaining justice courts and merge them with the municipal courts. The justice 
courts are largely an artifact of a time when California was a much more rural 
state. The merger could result in better use of judges' time. 
</P>
<P>
 A more ambitious and more promising plan involves unification of all trial 
courts; municipal courts would become superior courts. Such a step, which other 
states have taken, would require voter approval. The Legislature last summer 
considered letting the voters decide this issue but shrank from the 
opportunity. It should revisit the issue soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters last week clearly signaled their impatience with the state's outdated 
and ineffective system of disciplining judges. The overwhelming passage of 
Proposition 190 ensures greater public participation and accountability in that 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 More changes should follow. Some concern so-called merit selection of judges, 
which, generally speaking, means removing politics as much as possible from the 
process of selecting judges, focusing instead on objective criteria and the 
candidates' judicial philosophies. These proposals are still a long way from 
implementation but they are worth exploring as we enter the "three strikes" 
era.

SCORE ONE FOR THE SCOOPER; THE NEWLY LEASED CRAFT PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN QUELLING 
CITY OF INDUSTRY FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors made an eminently wise decision 
recently to lease two amphibious "Super Scooper" aircraft. Yet for a time this 
fire season it looked as if the planes might lack fires to combat, ultimately 
giving skeptics an opportunity to brand the county experiment a failure and a 
waste. 
</P>
<P>
 However, few who saw the Canadair CL-215 in action last Monday against a 
fast-moving brush fire would agree with such a charge: A load of water and a 
load of foam dumped from the craft stopped flames that were bearing down on 
several homes in the City of Industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginner's luck? Not by a long shot. The Canadian-built craft have been used 
in California with success before. In 1970, the planes -- which can pick up 
1,600 gallons of water on the fly -- were enlisted to fight fires in Berkeley 
and Malibu. Nearly a decade later the Los Angeles County Fire Department tested 
the Scooper, using it to help knock down a huge blaze in Laurel Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite those successes and a clear need for better equipment during infernos 
in the Berkeley hills in 1991 and in Altadena, Laguna and Malibu in 1993, Gov. 
Pete Wilson refused to sign legislation that allocated state funds to buy or 
lease Super Scoopers. What's more, the state Forestry Department traditionally 
has resisted expensive equipment out of fear that the outlays would result in 
cuts in its budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County, helped by insurers, had the good sense to put up $719,000 
for mechanics and two crews rather than wait for state action. The county and 
the insurers will also pay $500 for each hour the CL-215s are in flight. Surely 
that's a decision that the threatened residents of Industry were thankful for 
last Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 What's needed now is a lasting commitment by government for the sake of 
communities in Southern California and the entire West. Gov. Wilson should take 
the initiative, not only by proposing funding to lease firefighting aircraft 
but also by exploring the possibility of sharing the planes in a Super Scooper 
force for the western United States.

BANNING HANDGUNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "That Shiny Little Killer in the Closet," editorial Nov. 3: 
</P>
<P>
 Jiminy H. Cricket, I wish you would lay off the B-word. I have been around 
guns and advocated gun control all my life, and I don't give a good goddamn if 
that 30% (Milwaukee handgun owners who indicated they are willing to turn in 
their pistols to police) keep guns or not. I know them; they're the rare gun 
owners who observe every safety precaution, lock up their guns and guard the 
combination from their children like a state secret. When they sell their guns, 
you would think they were negotiating a nuclear weapons deal. They don't worry 
me, and I desperately want such responsible people on my side. 
</P>
<P>
 However, I cannot expect them to respect my right to be safe and free from the 
effects of gun proliferation and irresponsible gun sales and ownership unless I 
respect their right -- and I don't mean constitutional unless they're in the 
National Guard -- to enjoy their pleasures within reasonable restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 There is common ground in this debate. I cannot end this letter without noting 
that easily concealable guns are the ones to be most concerned about, and that 
the onus for compromise rests with the handgun owner. I am impatient, and 
justifiably so, as is everyone else who has examined this issue with a clear 
head. 
</P>

 * So how does the Oct. 29 assault rifle attack on the White House justify 
banning assault rifles? Why don't we ban private possession of Cessna 
airplanes? 
</P>
<P>
 Even better, let's stop persecuting each other and look for sensible 
regulations such as fine-tuning background checks so they can look at 
out-of-state criminal records. (This would have stopped New York resident Colin 
Ferguson from buying, from a California gun store, the pistol he would use in 
the Long Island subway massacre.) The would-be assassin had just gotten out of 
a military prison before buying the SKS rifle in Colorado. California's 
background check would have stopped him. Instead of suggesting that Colorado 
should upgrade its background check system, there were cries that we should ban 
SKS rifles. 
</P>
<P>
 This is like people saying we ought to ban cars to prevent traffic fatalities. 
Instead we embarked on a long-term commitment to make driver training available 
in high schools, enforce seat belt laws and stop drunk driving. You might say 
we don't need guns as badly as we need cars. Then again, it's not your place to 
tell me what I need or don't need. Three million NRA members obviously feel 
they need their guns.

 * The prison population has doubled since 1984. There are now 1 million people 
in prison (Oct. 28). Do you feel safer than you did 10 years ago? 
</P>
<P>
 Locking people up is obviously not the answer to the crime problem. Training 
people for jobs, and giving them hope, is one answer. The money that needs to 
be going into education and job training is going into prisons and jails. It is 
very largely money wasted. 
</P>
<P>
 Passing laws to outlaw possession of automatic weapons, and collecting and 
destroying those now in private possession and in the hands of gun dealers, 
would be a second answer. We would have sensible and effective gun laws if 
scores of thousands wrote Rep. Newt Gingrich and Sen. Bob Dole, saying they 
held the Republican Party responsible for every crime committed with a gun. 
Write today. Members of the National Rifle Assn. write often.

HOUSING EXPERIMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "A Fresh Start," Nov. 8: It could have been no more ironic than on Election 
Day to focus on the attempt by public officials to initiate what you referred 
to as a "national experiment" to provide better housing conditions for public 
housing residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea behind the Moving to Opportunity program started by HUD is simple and 
consistent with the dreams Americans have pursued for centuries.Move to a 
better neighborhood; put your kids in better schools and get a better job.  
</P>
<P>
 If this limited public effort to liberate a mere 1,325 families from the 
debilitating confines of public housing is only an "experiment," it's because 
we have lost touch with the basic need to nurture self-improvement as a 
national goal. If this program is only an "experiment," perhaps we have grown 
so complacent that the concept of fair housing and integrated communities is 
now only a distant, faint national memory. 
</P>
<P>
 You referred to Patricia Williams as "guinea pig" in this "national experiment 
about housing, education, race and social mobility" because she wants to move 
from Watts' Jordan Downs project to a better neighborhood. If she is, we need 
more like her and the renewed commitment of our nation to embark upon more such 
experiments whose positive results have already been proven.

PREDICTED COLLEGE ENROLLMENT SURGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The bitter competition for California higher education seats by children of 
the baby boomers ("Colleges Gird for Children of Baby Boomers," Oct. 31) would 
be greatly mitigated if the Master Plan for Higher Education was changed to 
encourage all students to complete their first year, maybe even two years, at a 
community college. That would make room at the four-year universities for all 
students who made it to their junior year.  
</P>
<P>
 There are many good reasons to implement this plan. First of all, there is a 
huge dropout rate among freshmen at all campuses, but the state pays much more 
to start these students at four-year universities than at community college 
campuses. Secondly, the four-year schools, especially the UC campuses, are 
primarily research institutions with world-class laboratories and research 
libraries that students do not fully utilize until after completing their 
lower-division work. For this reason, it is also much less expensive to expand 
the community college system than to build more UC campuses. Thirdly, the 
lower-division education at community colleges is comparable to that found at 
large universities: The transfer courses are the same, having been approved as 
such by the four-year universities; the textbooks are the same; typically the 
classes are smaller. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, transfer students have done as well as, if not slightly better 
than, native freshmen at the four-year universities.

 * My appreciation to Jonathan Peterson for his insightful coverage of the 
community college dilemma ("Can Junior Colleges Train Work Force of the 
Future?," Nov. 2). As an instructor at Pasadena City College, I can personally 
attest to the challenges faced by our very diverse student body. As president 
of the Faculty Assn. of California Community Colleges (FACCC) I can also attest 
to the challenges faced by the instructors who teach these students -- these 
days hamstrung by larger class sizes, smaller budgets, fewer course sections, 
deteriorating facilities and decrepit equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 As detailed in a new report from the California Higher Education Policy 
Center, "Broken Promises: The Impact of Budget Cuts and Fee Increases on the 
California Community Colleges," higher fees and chronic underfunding have 
crippled the state's community college system. The community colleges were 
envisioned by the state's Master Plan for Higher Education, the report points 
out, "as the backbone of California's system of higher education, the last 
bastion of low-cost access, the place where undergraduate students could get 
into classes" when other colleges and universities were closed to them. Now, 
sadly, "they are no longer playing that role."

A WORD FOR JUSTICE AT INDONESIA'S TRADE SUMMIT; HUMAN RIGHTS: CLINTON'S VISIT 
COULD SHED LIGHT ON THE GENOCIDAL OCCUPATION OF EAST TIMOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIREAD CORRIGAN MAGUIRE, Mairead Corrigan Maguire is co-founder of the 
Northern Ireland Community of the Peace People and shared the Nobel Peace Prize 
in 1976. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When President Clinton meets with President Suharto of Indonesia during the 
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation conference this week, he should not overlook 
the haunting situation in East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
 It is normally extremely difficult to focus public awareness on the former 
Portuguese colony near Australia, which was invaded by Indonesia in 1975. 
Perhaps one-third or more of a population of 700,000 have perished as a 
consequence of a harsh Indonesian occupation. But President Clinton's trip, 
which includes a state visit in Jakarta on Wednesday, provides a unique 
opportunity to highlight a tragedy that refuses to go away. 
</P>
<P>
 Nov. 12 marked the third anniversary of the massacre at Santa Cruz cemetery in 
Dili, the capital of East Timor, where Indonesian troops killed hundreds of 
mourners and demonstrators at a funeral commemoration -- a scene recorded by a 
journalist from British television. These shocking images were seen by millions 
of people throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately thereafter, a 26-year-old East Timorese student, Fernando Araujo, 
tried to contact Amnesty International to provide them with information about 
the Santa Cruz massacre. For this and other nonviolent acts, Araujo received a 
a nine-year prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Araujo was also charged with having discussions on how to bring East Timor to 
the attention of the international community. Still another charge involved 
sending a letter to former President Bush likening the Indonesian occupation of 
East Timor to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait -- not an inaccurate comparison, but 
a dangerous one to make in Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also perilous for courageous Indonesians who dare to speak out on the 
East Timor situation. Last month, I attended an international conference in 
Portugal with Dr. George Aditjondro, a respected scholar and environmentalist 
who has done firsthand studies on the Timor situation. 
</P>
<P>
 The last night of the conference, Aditjondro received a summons from the 
Indonesian police for interrogation about comments he made during a university 
panel discussion on the future of Indonesian politics. Amnesty International 
believes that this was an attempt by authorities to punish Aditjondro for his 
criticism of government policy on human rights and environmental concerns in 
Indonesia and East Timor. In recent weeks, Aditjondro has been interrogated for 
many hours by police about the university panel discussion. After one five-hour 
session, he became ill. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton should intervene with Indonesian authorities with the aim of 
ensuring that such harassment is ended and that Araujo be released. 
</P>
<P>
 These two courageous individuals are only the tip of the iceberg. People 
further down in society, lacking international networks of support, suffer much 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
 I have had my own experience with the lengths Jakarta will go to muzzle 
criticism. It pressured allies in the region, such as the Philippines, to 
prevent a conference on East Timor from taking place in June. Upon arrival in 
Manila for the conference, after 18 hours of travel, I was summarily deported 
by the Philippine authorities, under obvious pressure from Jakarta. 
</P>
<P>
 The Catholic Bishop of East Timor, Carlos Ximenes Belo, has inspired me as he 
speaks out courageously for truth, justice and in defense of human rights in 
spite of death threats. The bishop is trying to find ways to end the conflict 
through support for dialogue under the auspices of the United Nations, in 
accordance with the principles of international law. He deserves the backing of 
the United States. As we have learned in my home country of Northern Ireland, 
it is only through all-inclusive dialogue and the cessation of all violence 
that we can begin to solve our problems together.

 "We did all the right things . . . met with the leaders of the major 
civil-rights organizations and the ministers of the big churches . . . We 
toured a housing project and even had a great photo-op with those African 
American students at that inner-city school . . . the fund-raiser at that 
lawyer's house was well-attended . . . Position papers were issued supporting 
civil rights for all minorities . . . We did everything possible to increase 
African American voter turnout . . . But they just don't seem to vote." 
</P>
<P>
 These candidates just don't get it. 
</P>
<P>
 The African American community is ready and willing to support candidates who 
represent our interests. But low voter turnouts can almost be assured as long 
as candidates continue to believe it's a matter of which candidate will best 
represent African American interests. There is little difference between a 
conservative candidate who will dismiss our concerns out of hand without giving 
us an audience and a liberal candidate always delivering the message that we 
should trust and wait for them to determine the right opportunity to make a 
stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, we vote. But not for the lesser of two evils.

after two years, even if they couldn't find a job: "You lose your welfare 
benefits and if the children cannot be supported by you, they have to be put 
into foster homes." 
</P>
<P>
 Understand clearly the savagery of this man's message. He would steal the 
child from a welfare mother even if she had been out there doing everything 
possible to find a job but, like thousands of other Americans, had failed. 
Without a job, she is judged worthless as a mother. So much for family values. 
Do the Republicans really prefer the costly warehousing of millions of children 
in state-funded homes? 
</P>
<P>
 Archer is just an extremist, you might say. Nonsense, he is now a top 
congressional leader of the party that swept to power Tuesday precisely because 
it espouses a rough and ready social Darwinism in which only the strong 
prevail. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is he out of line with our own once-moderate governor who is determined to 
prove that he is up there with the wildest of the yahoos. Some had hoped that 
Pete Wilson's full-throated support for Proposition 187 was only a campaign 
aberration, that once safely elected he would bring us all back together. 
</P>
<P>
 This expectation did not reckon with the man's presidential ambitions, which 
have come to be based on his ability to play the cards of hate. There he was on 
election night, totally lacking in magnanimity, once again dividing and 
conquering, separating the good Californians from the bad. The good were the 
ones who voted for him: " . . . working Californians, those who work hard, who 
play by the rules, who pay their taxes, and who have raised their children to 
obey the law and to respect themselves and others." Who, then, are the bad 
others?  
</P>
<P>
 The inference is clear: the more than 3 million of us who voted against his 
heartless nostrums -- tax-dodging shirkers who never do an honest day's work 
and who raise our children to be criminals.  
</P>
<P>
 This is in lock step with the polarizing ideology of House Speaker-to-be Newt 
Gingrich, who proclaimed that the President is an "enemy of normal Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 Just how far is it from this notion of "normal Americans" to talk about Aryan 
superiority? Shouldn't alarm bells be going off? They do for me. 
</P>
<P>
 As the first-generation product of a Lithuanian Jewish mother and German 
Protestant father, my stomach still churns at the notion of "good Germans," 
"normal Germans" -- descriptions I heard often as a kid in New York's German 
neighborhood during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 I have paid a dozen visits to my relatives in Germany, still trying to 
understand how my soldier-uncles on my father's side could have served the 
government that killed my aunts and uncles on my mother's side. The answer is 
always the same: "Times were hard then, we were only farmers, Hitler was just a 
voice on the radio, we were told the Jews and the other foreigners were 
responsible. What did we know?" 
</P>
<P>
 I tell them what they should have known. That there are no "others," that 
there is never a valid excuse for denying the essential humanity of any person, 
no matter how confused the social climate. How could my uncle, who is still 
alive and whom I love as a good family man, not have put himself in the shoes 
of a Jewish father? But he didn't, and I can't forgive him for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, it's an enormous leap to connect such experiences with what is 
going on in our country and state right now. But the common thread is 
unmistakably there: "They" are not like "us." Otherwise, how could any parent 
want the child of another parent removed from school because of nationality? 
How could any mother seek to deny prenatal care to a mother who doesn't have 
the right papers?  
</P>
<P>
 The language is chilling. Item No. 6 in the Governor's Executive Order 
W-113-94: "The Director of Health Services shall immediately notify providers 
that prenatal services for aliens without legal immigrant status will be 
discontinued. . . . "  
</P>
<P>
 Forget that the fetus in question will be a U.S. citizen by virtue of being 
born here. Think only about why the governor would want any baby condemned to 
low birth weight and otherwise bleaker prospects for a healthy life.  
</P>
<P>
 It must be that when he looks at that baby, he does not see one of his own.

THE STATE; THE GROWING ECONOMY THAT WILSON IGNORES AT HIS OWN PERIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Joel Kotkin, Joel Kotkin, a contributing editor to Opinion, is a senior 
fellow at the Center for the New West and international fellow at the 
Pepperdine University School of Business in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Having won reelection on the mostly negative issues of crime and illegal 
immigration, Pete Wilson needs an uplifting message to govern. He should follow 
the lead of his political mentor, Richard M. Nixon, who reinivented himself and 
went to China, and create "a new Wilson" who appeals to hope as well as to 
fear. 
</P>
<P>
 To do this, Wilson will have to re-educate himself about California's economy. 
In many ways, the governor is unaware of the economic activity going on in his 
back and front yards and that, in some respects, helped seal his victory. Long 
a protector of large-scale defense and manufacturing interests, he has all but 
ignored many of the industries -- mostly service- and design-oriented -- that 
are creating jobs today in California. 
</P>
<P>
 An analysis of the 150,000 net new jobs created since March, 1993, discloses 
few, if any, among Wilson's historic economic allies. According to Center for 
the Continuing Study of the California Economy, most have sprung up in 
high-wage non-manufacturing sectors -- such as software and motion-picture 
production, which each added 15,000 positions last year -- or in engineering 
and management services -- which added a combined 30,000 slots. The center 
estimates these companies are creating 10,000 new jobs in California every 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in defense-dependent Southern California, such industries are beginning 
to surpass aerospace in total employment. Today, for example, the percentage of 
people employed in defense-related jobs in the Los Angeles Basin has fallen to 
2.5%, from 5% about 10 years ago. Entertainment now employs more people in 
Southern California than aerospace. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, California boasts the nation's two largest concentrations of 
computer-oriented jobs. Statewide employment in biomedical manufacturing, now 
at 134,000, is larger than in New York and New Jersey combined, two states 
where such manufacturing also flourishes. In such low-tech industries as 
textiles -- where an estimated 11,000 work -- and cosmetics -- another 7,700 -- 
Los Angeles County ranks first among all urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the state is home to the largest port and to more than 60% of the 
nation's fastest-growing exporters; it has more than doubled its share of 
America's global trade during the past 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to common perceptions, salaries in these growing industries generally 
are far higher than those attached to lost aerospace jobs. The companies are 
also better suited for multicultural California. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason the state's new economy has largely gone unnoticed is that it is 
difficult to measure. Many are "micro-businesses" employing one or two people 
who frequently work out of their homes. Indeed, five of the top 10 metropolitan 
subregions -- locally, Century City/Beverly Hills, Calabasas and Santa Monica 
-- in which people work at home and travel the information superhighway, 
instead of the freeway, are in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 California's economic future will increasingly depend on such "micro," small 
and mid-sized firms. Fortunately, even as the big companies in the state 
continued to restructure, many of these smaller firms were beginning to show 
signs of revival in 1994, according to a recent report, with their prospects 
for growth, profits and new employment considered superior to their 
counterparts nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, these companies face different challenges and have different needs from 
the old industrial warhorses. For example, most rely heavily on an ability to 
attract and hold onto talented personnel who might be lured away to other 
states by "quality of life" considerations. Others are intricately tied to 
networks of local producers and thus are unlikely to benefit from the 
broad-brush incentive packages beloved by politicians and corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, some of Wilson's late accomplishments -- particularly, reform of 
the workers' compensation system -- helped to slow the exodus of companies from 
the state. But rather than dust off such old standbys as tax breaks, the 
governor should pursue policies that aim to foster a business-friendly 
infrastructure, starting with a "one-stop" permitting process. Approaches that 
encourage links between new and growing companies and university and college 
research programs would also help grease the economic engine much as the 
Silicone Valley profited from its academic ties. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of these growing firms, furthermore, place a higher priority on 
regulatory relief than lower taxes. Wilson would do well to address this need 
by reinventing the state's horrendously awkward regulatory regime. And he 
should promote a more interactive relationship between state and local 
government to overcome what many companies feel is Sacramento's indifference to 
their needs. 
</P>
<P>
 A particular challenge for Wilson lies in the international arena. With 
California exports up by 13.5% over last year, foreign markets are continuing 
to supplant the Pentagon as the state's key customer. At the same time, foreign 
tourists account for virtually all the new net growth in the state's travel 
industry, which remains the nation's largest, employing more than 200,000 
people in the Los Angeles Basin alone. 
</P>
<P>
 By attaching himself to the anti-immigrant Proposition 187, Wilson risks 
alienating some of the fastest-growing and most dynamic elements in the state's 
economic life. Already, California's relations with Mexico have suffered, an 
outcome that may hurt Republican strongholds. For example, Mexico is a growing 
market for Orange County businesses, which have seen their southbound exports 
grow from slightly more than $300 million to an estimated $1.4 billion this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Wilson may be culturally uncomfortable with the idea, immigrants 
increasingly predominate as investors, owners of and managers at many of the 
smaller companies now replenishing the state's depleted job rolls. Moreover, 
his ill-founded assertions that immigrants primarily come to California to 
enjoy its welfare benefits have contributed to the general -- and false -- 
impression that the newcomers comprise an economically worthless lump of 
unskilled and uneducated proletarians. But Wilson must learn that immigrants 
who are ill-educated, even illegal, have demonstrated a remarkable work ethic, 
albeit often in the oft-overlooked "underground economy." Politically impotent, 
these immigrants remain vital to such key state industries as textiles, 
garments and agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 For Wilson to learn the new economic forces at work in his state, and to take 
a "bottom-up" approach to pushing them forward, would mean changing a life's 
worth of experience identifying "business" with the wishes of well-heeled 
corporate lobbyists. But as the "new" Nixon went to China, so a "new" Wilson 
must make his pilgrimage to the new California, or risk hindering the state's 
full economic and psychological recovery -- and his political ambitions.*

IN A LAMENT OF THE OLD 'ESTABLISHMENT,' HOLLYWOOD ENCOUNTERS ANTI-SEMITISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By The following is a response by William Cash to the uproar created by his 
piece in The Spectator. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The reaction to my pointing out that Hollywood's feudal power structure is 
predominantly Jewish has been wholly misconstrued. If I have injured any 
feelings, I unconditionally apologize -- but certainly no anti-Semitism was 
intended, or felt.Indeed, the editor of The Spectator, Dominic Lawson, who 
published the piece, is Jewish, as is his deputy. Moreover, the historical data 
I referred to, along with words that have been objected to, came directly from 
Neal Gabler's book. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the article was to contrast and challenge Vanity Fair's 
criteria of the New Establishment with the original definition of the 
Establishment by the Spectator in 1955 -- that an Establishment is, by 
definition, exclusionary and exercises its power socially. Since the magazine 
made so much play about the background and Protestant religion of the old Wasp 
Establishment, it seemed legitimate to observe the majority of the "New Boy 
Network" are Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
 My point was to rebut the idea that moguls featured as "the leaders of the 
computer, entertainment and communication industries" were, in fact, a real 
Establishment -- observing that the common background the majority shared was 
that they are Jewish. Far from constituting a "cabal," this fact amounted to 
the equivalent influence of -- to quote one Hollywood executive -- "(English) 
public schoolboys working in the City." 
</P>
<P>
 The subtext is that a double standard seems to exist. While it is acceptable 
for a Jewish writer, like Gabler, to use words like "Jewish cabal," when a Brit 
uses the same phrase, he is publicly barbecued. Likewise, while Hollywood 
movies regularly stereotype or caricature blacks, Brits, gays, Italians and so 
on, when an outsider uses a phrase like "fiercely competitive" he is publicly 
attacked.*

PREHISTORIC ANASAZI RUINS AT HOME IN MODERN SUBDIVISION; SOUTHWEST: THOSE WHO 
BUY INTO THE DEVELOPMENT IN FOUR CORNERS AREA MUST AGREE TO PRESERVE THE RUINS, 
WHICH MAY BE EXCAVATED ONLY UNDER SUPERVISION OF A CERTIFIED ARCHEOLOGIST. 
ARTIFACTS CANNOT BE SOLD; UPON THE PROPERTY OWNER'S DEATH, THEY MUST BE GIVEN

 Views from Nancy Reynolds' log house high above this Four Corners town 
resemble scenes from a classic Western film. 
</P>
<P>
 The deck offers a panorama of Shiprock, N.M., more than 40 miles away, 
Sleeping Ute Mountain, Mesa Verde National Park and the La Plata and San Juan 
Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's different weather on each side," Reynolds said, adding that the 
"sunsets, double rainbows and crackling lightning make this the best show in 
town." 
</P>
<P>
 But it's the back yard that makes her Indian Camp home unique. It has its own 
Anasazi ruin, left by the prehistoric people who lived here for more than 1,000 
years, mysteriously disappearing about the year 1300. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who buys one of the 31 sites among the junipers, pinons and sage at 
Indian Camp, six miles east of Mesa Verde, must agree to preserve the pueblos 
and semi-subterranean ceremonial kivas of those the Navajos call the "Ancient 
Ones." 
</P>
<P>
 They may only be excavated under the supervision of a certified archeologist, 
excavations must be covered and artifacts cannot be sold. Upon the owner's 
death, they must be given to a museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Archie and Mary Hanson of Templeton, Calif., whose family has developed the 
exclusive Rolling Hills, Hidden Hills and Hidden Valley subdivisions of 
Southern California, decided to buy land here after taking an archeological 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Once they had acquired more than 800 acres they decided to build Indian Camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "We fell in love with the Southwest many, many years ago and then we went on 
this trip to Crow Canyon and thought it would it be great fun to live in the 
area. And then it grew sort of topsy-turvy. We had no choice but to develop 
along archeological lines because there they were," said Archie Hanson. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't massive intelligence. We just fell into this. We're trying to have 
our cake and eat it too." 
</P>
<P>
 Four more housing starts are expected next year. Seventeen sites have been 
sold. 
</P>
<P>
 The sites, all at least 35 acres, are selling for between $151,000 and 
$200,000, with utility connections provided but homes to be built by owners. 
Covenants bar trailers or modular homes, and archeologists approve building 
sites for homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "For my husband, money is only spent to do something well," said Mary Hanson. 
Only one home and one guest home are allowed per site. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds is the first Indian Camp resident to build a house. She had it 
blessed by a Navajo chanter before moving in last August. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's fantastic. It's unique. Archie's got the foresight to see that 
the people who are going to buy their lots are into preservation and love the 
rules," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds says she expects most of those who buy into Indian Camp will be 
amateur archeologists like her who studied at neighboring Crow Canyon 
Archaeological Center. Thousands of students, many of them retired people, have 
paid the privately run research center to take part in archeological digs. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 sites have been found at Indian Camp, the highest recorded site 
density in Colorado, said Archie Hanson. More than 10,000 artifacts have been 
recovered from the pueblo the Hansons have excavated on their own site. 
</P>
<P>
 Home sites are marked by metal statues of Kokopelli, the legendary humpbacked, 
flute-playing magician and medicine man who supposedly traveled the Southwest 
seducing women and bringing fertility to the land and its people. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So far the project hasn't drawn any public opposition, although William Doelle 
of Desert Archaeology Inc. of Tucson, Ariz., says that in most areas local or 
state laws would preclude this kind of development. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy Thompson of the Crow Canyon Center said that "given the alternative" -- 
the likely ransacking of the sites if the area is developed piecemeal -- Indian 
Camp is a good idea. There are thousands of sites in Montezuma County, where 
Mesa Verde is located, and some landowners have sold archeological rights to 
pothunters who peddle their finds. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Knight-Frank, chairman of the Ute Mountain Ute tribe, isn't so sure. "If 
anybody disturbed my bones I'd haunt them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Hanson said any bones uncovered are reinterred immediately at the site.  
</P>
<P>
 "The only bones we encounter are found in kivas," Archie Hanson said. "We 
avoid burial grounds like the plague."

SAGUARO CACTUS GETS THUMBS UP FOR NATIONAL PARK STATUS IN ARIZONA; ENVIRONMENT: 
CLINTON SIGNS BILL REDESIGNATING THE NATIONAL MONUMENT NEAR TUCSON. FUNDS WILL 
BE SET ASIDE TO BUY LAND AS A BUFFER AGAINST SUBURBS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARTHUR H. ROTSTEIN, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The saguaro cactus, stately sentinel of the Old West, has won a new level of 
recognition and protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Its preserve in Tucson since early this century -- Saguaro National Monument 
-- has been elevated to national park status. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton signed legislation in October redesignating it as Saguaro 
National Park and setting aside money to buy land as a buffer against 
encroaching suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists are less excited about the new name than about the 
authorization to add 3,460 acres to the park, which consists of 114,659 acres 
in separate tracts on opposite sides of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will provide protection of the wildlife habitat and critical open 
spaces," said Steve Anderson of the Pima Trails Assn. "Development has been 
going crazy in that immediate vicinity." 
</P>
<P>
 The saguaro (pronounced sa-HWAH-ro) is found only in the Sonoran Desert, which 
stretches from northern Mexico to central Arizona and includes the southeastern 
tip of California. 
</P>
<P>
 The cacti can live 200 years or longer. They grow 50 feet tall, sprout their 
first arms after 50 to 70 years and sometimes grow as many as four dozen arms. 
The cacti, second-largest in the world after Mexico's cardon, weigh tons, most 
of which is water. The saguaro isn't endangered, but the species is afflicted 
with a mysterious disease that's being studied in the park. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2.4 million visitors a year drive or bike the park's scenic loop roads 
or hike its many trails. Tohono O'odham Indians set up camp here in July and 
August to harvest the saguaro fruit for making syrup, jam, and a wine used in 
ceremonies to call down the desert rains. 
</P>
<P>
 The park designation is a testament to the diversity of plant life in the 
area's six life zones. They range from the saguaros found along the desert 
floor to grasslands to pine, aspen and fir forest more than a vertical mile up 
in the mountains the park encompasses. 
</P>
<P>
 Saguaro is the nation's 52nd national park and Arizona's third, after the 
Grand Canyon and Petrified Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 There are few operational differences between a monument and a park; both are 
managed by the National Park Service. The park designation is reserved for 
areas of special significance and must be created by an act of Congress as 
opposed to executive order. 
</P>
<P>
 Park Supt. Doug Morris says he doubts the change will significantly increase 
the number of visitors, and some business leaders agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who go there will go whether it's a national monument or a national 
park," said Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce spokesman Tom Collier. "People 
will go there because they're interested in the uniqueness of the ecology and 
the flora and fauna."

FOR MEN, IT'S NOT A MATTER OF LEARNING -- BUT UNLEARNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Phil Berardelli's column on male-female relationships in our society ("What a 
Father Dreads Most for His Little Girls," Oct. 31) blames male contempt for 
women in our society on lack of civilization. He is mistaken. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not schoolboy vulgarity that is the source of the contempt men feel 
toward women and female sexuality in our society. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, it is the Augustinian tradition of regarding devotion to moral purpose 
as a "higher, spiritual" function of the mind, as contrasted with the cravings 
for bodily pleasure, which are, to this day, regarded as "lower, non-spiritual" 
feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the attraction of a man for a woman is looked upon as the result of the 
"lower" cravings, female sexuality is looked upon as appealing to human 
"weakness." Men fight these cravings not by denigrating their own sexuality, 
but by denigrating the female's capacity to enhance and satisfy these cravings. 
</P>
<P>
 So you see, it is not lack of civilization that causes men to denigrate and 
act brutally toward women; it is an excess of the wrong kind of civilization. 
Thus, men in our society do not have a lot to learn -- they have a lot to 
unlearn. 
</P>

 Phil Berardelli paints a poignant picture of a father's concerns for his 
daughters. He is certainly justified in that feeling and he has my complete 
sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
 But he should know that any place where teens gather you will find girls on 
the prowl. You will find many boys, who would otherwise mind their own 
business, forced into aggressive behavior so they won't appear like wimps. 
</P>
<P>
 The plain truth is that men are only a half of the wicked population. 
</P>

<P>
 Another male mea culpa. OK. But: We are still, after thousands of years, 
attributing lousy human behavior to our so-called animal nature. If humans 
behave badly, they are beasts in the throes of "animal, inhuman rage." 
</P>
<P>
 I propose that animals never behave with the cruelty and depravity of humans. 
They certainly don't mix sex and rage. As a matter of fact, the females of most 
species make males earn their favors by growing fabulous plumage, gorgeous 
stripes or huge horns. 
</P>
<P>
 The scorn and contempt women have endured in our society for millennia is not 
found in other animal populations. So please, spare us the beast metaphor and 
own up to the truth: Human behavior can be uniquely despicable and malignant.

 Phil Berardelli's article stated very well most fathers' concerns for their 
daughters.

 However, atrocities are perpetrated against our sons as well, mentally and 
physically.

 We all bear responsibility for this behavior. We all fail, women and men, at 
some point in our lives to instill proper respect and concern for fellow human

SOCIAL CLIMES / UP ALL NIGHT: SEVEN MINUTES OF FAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HILLARY JOHNSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nasmo King says by way of a punch line, "Which is scarier to you, a big pot of 
hairy fondue or a cleanshaven Bigfoot?" 
</P>
<P>
 He is finishing off a story in which various elusive characters are finally 
traced to a fondue restaurant on Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene is the Tuesday night comedy open mike at Petterson's Frish Rost, a 
coffee shop (er, make that coffee house) on an undistinguished stretch of 
Venice Boulevard somewhere in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 Vance Bean has been running the show on Tuesdays since February, and the venue 
has gained a reputation among comedians and audiences as one of the best open 
mikes in town. 
</P>
<P>
 "It draws an actual audience, rather that just other comedians, who tend to be 
a hard room," says Bean. 
</P>
<P>
 Each performer is held to a strict seven minutes, with things wrapping up 
about 11 p.m. Between sets, Bean reads selections from "The Gentle Conqueror," 
the official Fabio newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 The decor is standard post-Starbuck's, kind of cozy cool, if not exactly hip, 
with warm pink walls, black Formica tables and a large blackboard to display 
the coffee menu. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the questionable Culver City Matisse on the walls, the best that can be 
said is that more than one comic was able to use it onstage. 
</P>
<P>
 There might not be any beatniks on duty, but this appears to be the hot place 
among members of the Culver City Police Department. Most of the evening, there 
seems to be a squad car parked in the red zone out front and an officer or two 
at the counter ordering a cappuccino to go. 
</P>
<P>
 On election night, almost everyone does politics. Don Friesen's take on 
negative campaign slogans has Kathleen Brown torturing children in her 
basement, while "Pete Wilson used to be a woman. What's more, he was an illegal 
immigrant." 
</P>
<P>
 The best political humor came from the popular Gary Brussell, introduced as 
"the priest of the acid-washed jeans." ("I love them because they are never 
going to come back.") 
</P>
<P>
 Brussell creates a scenario in which Abe Lincoln and Clara Barton frolic on a 
water bed in a Motel 6. And you thought historical humor was dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Diversity keeps things lively. Carol Margraf does an impersonation of Bette 
Davis as a baby. Tracy Berna tells the best ferret jokes in town. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Agronsky, a frequent participant, sees open-mike comedy as a good way of 
practicing the actor's craft. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's the point in going to the (American) Academy of Dramatic Arts and 
studying Shakespeare and Chekhov, then going out and doing a Molson commercial? 
At least here you can say things that are real." 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Petterson's Frish Rost, 10019 Venice Blvd., Culver City. (310) 
839-3359. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Comedy open mike every Tuesday. Sign-ups at 7 p.m. for 7:30 show. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost: A small coffee of the day is 95 cents. Cappuccino starts at $2.15; cafe 
au lait, at $1.65. Muffins and desserts also available.

 Not all party favors at charity events come in little vials and smell like 
grass or musk or citrus, or whatever are the perfume flavors of the moment.

 (Then again, we've been loading up on an awful lot of charity-logo T-shirts 
lately.)

 Not in that category are the gifts to be presented to each couple attending

Suggested use for the two-inch enameled and gold-plated "Duomo" clock, which

<P>
 The best part is the patriotic angle. The clocks are red, white or blue

BRITISH BOUGHT FOR THE FUTURE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Your article on Merrick Baker-Bates ("A Busy Briton, Indeed," Oct. 30) might 
have indicated that the British consul general lives in not just a 1920s-era 
Hancock Park home but in a Wallace Neff original that was bought years ago by a 
foresighted British government. Neff, known as the architect to Hollywood 
stars, produced an house that is the jewel of the neighborhood and has an 
enduring quality immediately apparent.

 I have long been a subscriber to The Times and have seen your paper go through

the first things I turn to now. 
</P>

 The column is a welcome addition and I often laugh out loud.

 The morning's news of murder, mayhem and various examples of man's inhumanity 
to man is a depressing way to start the day. But the mood can be brightened by 
reading your wonderful daily "Laugh Lines," which features our better side. 
Rich Tosche's article about the amazing personal habits of the late Mao Zedong 
("If You Want to Follow This Leader, Just Sniff," Nov. 1) is funny enough to 
brighten a whole week.

TROJANS FEEL OK AFTER SHOOTOUT; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: ROB JOHNSON HAS ANOTHER HUGE 
GAME IN 45-28 VICTORY OVER ARIZONA, SETTING UP BIG ONE AGAINST UCLA NEXT 
SATURDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rob Johnson picked Arizona's vaunted defense to pieces Saturday, completing 
his last 15 passes in a 45-28 shootout victory over the Wildcats.  
</P>
<P>
 In just over three quarters, Johnson completed 25 of 35 passes for 390 yards 
-- two yards short of the school record -- and three touchdowns. The 
quarterback then tweaked his tender right ankle again early in the fourth 
quarter and retired for the day.  
</P>
<P>
 Unexpectedly, it was a wild, free-scoring aerial circus, one won by Johnson 
over Arizona quarterback Danny White, who passed for 370 yards and three 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 USC pulled it out only after the teams combined for a 35-point third quarter, 
shortly after which the Trojan defense stopped Arizona on four downs inside the 
seven-yard line. Then, Johnson and his relief pitcher, Brad Otton, took USC 98 
yards for a 42-28 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, a week after leading his team to a 23-10 victory over another 
outstanding defensive team, Washington State, was even sharper Saturday, before 
61,264 at the Coliseum.  
</P>
<P>
 Early in the fourth quarter, he had taken USC from the Trojan two to midfield 
when he resprained his right ankle and had to be helped off the field. Two more 
completions and he would have tied the Pac-10 record for consecutive 
completions in a single game, 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson has been so sharp lately his coaches are getting sort of ho-hum about 
it. "To tell you the truth, I kind of expect Rob to play like that now," said 
his offensive coordinator, Mike Riley. "That's how good he really is." 
</P>
<P>
 His head coach gushed.  
</P>
<P>
 "Arizona is a great defensive team, but what did we get, a thousand yards?" 
Coach John Robinson said afterward. It was 550 yards. Arizona had 443. "Rob's 
performance the last two games has been phenomenal. These two teams (Washington 
State and Arizona) try to destroy quarterbacks." 
</P>
<P>
 To reach the Rose Bowl, USC (7-2, 6-1 in the Pac-10) must defeat UCLA next 
Saturday and hope Oregon, which routed Stanford, 55-21, loses to Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
 On a day when USC tied its longest winning streak since 1989, five, these were 
the big plays that contributed to what USC defensive coordinator Don Lindsey 
called "an old-fashioned, OK Corral shootout:" 
</P>
<P>
 -- A third-and-10, 36-yard Arizona touchdown pass from Danny White to Richard 
Dice for a 14-7 second-quarter Wildcat lead.  
</P>
<P>
 -- A catch by Keyshawn Johnson, on his knees, of Rob Johnson's 28-yard pass 
that set up a short touchdown by Rodney Sermons to tie the score, 14-14, at the 
half.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Another outstanding catch by Dice (he had nine for 171 yards), this one for 
38 yards, to USC's five, setting up a touchdown for a 21-14 lead.  
</P>
<P>
 -- After a seven-yard touchdown pass to Johnny McWilliams, the Wildcats pulled 
off the day's longest play, a 65-yard White-to-Ontiwaun Carter play for a 28-21 
Arizona lead, midway through the third quarter.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Johnson then found Ed Hervey -- who had five catches for 120 yards -- on a 
tying 32-yard pass play. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Trojans then pulled off the first of two goal-line stands, with 
cornerback John Herpin -- two plays after a 43-yard run by Carter -- 
intercepting White in the end zone. Johnson then took his team 65 yards, 
scoring on a rollout from the one, to put USC ahead for good, 35-28. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd, USC players said later, then became a factor on a memorable 
goal-line stand at the Coliseum's tunnel end, with 8:06 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona (7-3, 6-2) threatened another tie when it had first and goal at the 
Trojan seven, but the Wildcats couldn't put it over. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter gained one, White passed to Gary Taylor to the one, but from there 
Carter lost one yard on two carries, and Trojan partisans exploded with an 
ovation that fueled USC on what followed: a six-play, 98-yard drive.  
</P>
<P>
 Johnson had taken USC to the Trojan 47, but couldn't rise after Tedy Bruschi 
sacked him.  
</P>
<P>
 Enter Otton.  
</P>
<P>
 On his first play, the sophomore connected with Keyshawn Johnson on another 
spectacular play. Johnson, leaping over two defenders, fell to the ground with 
the ball at Arizona's 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Two plays later, tailback Leonard Green -- filling in for starter Shawn 
Walters, who didn't play because of a thumb injury -- scored through Arizona's 
left side from the 11 for a 42-28 lead.  
</P>
<P>
 For Green, who had 92 yards in 16 carries, it was redemption. He had lost a 
fumble at Arizona's 13 in the second quarter, setting up the Wildcat score that 
tied it, 7-7. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, everyone figured a low-scoring game was still in the cards. 
Green's bobble looked huge.  
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I'd cost us the game," Green said. "Coach told me 'Stay in it . . . 
put it behind you,' and I did. I'd never fumbled the ball away in my career 
before." 
</P>
<P>
 Green was one of the players who said the stirring goal-line stand 
jump-started the offense. "I was really pumped up over that, and so was the 
rest of the offense," he said. "It really got my adrenaline going." 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Johnson's ankle was the key subject. Surprisingly, Johnson walked 
up the tunnel to the locker room without a limp.  
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be fine, it just took me a couple of minutes to walk it off," he said. 
"I could have gone back in. I tweaked it pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the game plan, simply put, was "quick or deep." 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt they couldn't stop our passing game if we threw quickly or deep," he 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Coach Riley called a phenomenal game; they didn't have a clue where we were 
going. It was a huge win, the biggest since I've been here. They're a tough 
defense, but they weren't ready for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona Coach Dick Tomey didn't like what he saw. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the kind of game that's terrible to coach," he said. "Everything is out 
of control. "To USC's credit, they made big defensive plays when it counted." 
</P>
<P>
 On why he chose to try a run on fourth down at the one in the fourth quarter, 
Tomey said "We would only try that if we were having trouble playing defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Quite a tribute to USC's offense, which gained 116 rushing yards against a 
defense that had given up an average of 47 over the last 33 games and 57 this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans' 45 points were the most scored against Arizona since UCLA had 54 
in 1992. The Wildcats had been giving up 11.3 points per game -- second in the 
nation -- until Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Trojans' 434 passing yards Saturday -- Otton had 44 in relief -- is a 
school record. Keyshawn Johnson, who had five catches for 109 yards, posted his 
fifth consecutive 100-yard game.  
</P>
<P>
 In the second half, USC scored on five of its six possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Robinson wouldn't even discuss Oregon-Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no comment on that game," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have UCLA next week, and . . . the next game, after that." 
</P>
<P>
 He meant Notre Dame, of course.

PENN STATE EARNS ITS WAY WEST; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: NITTANY LIONS IN ROSE BOWL 
AFTER 35-31 COME-FROM-WAY-BEHIND VICTORY OVER ILLINOIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Penn State clinched the Big Ten Conference championship and a January trip to 
Pasadena on Saturday, but not before the Nittany Lions nearly pricked 
themselves on those Rose Bowl thorns. 
</P>
<P>
 Down by three touchdowns late in the first quarter, No. 2-ranked Penn State 
recovered just in time to defeat Illinois, 35-31, in the dreary mist and cold 
of Memorial Stadium. It took a 14-play, 96-yard scoring drive in the waning 
minutes to do it, but Nittany Lion Coach Joe Paterno didn't seem to mind the 
wait. 
</P>
<P>
 "All's well that ends well, I guess" said Paterno, who became only the fourth 
coach to take a team to the Orange, Sugar, Cotton and Rose bowls. 
</P>
<P>
 That's easy for Paterno to say now. But before the end of the first period, 
the Nittany Lions trailed, 21-0, and had three quarters left against the No. 1 
defense in the Big Ten. The Penn State offense, rated first in the country, had 
19 yards and not a single first down. And the less said about the Nittany Lion 
defense, the better. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were a little disappointed," linebacker Willie Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 What he should have been was a little nervous. But Paterno wouldn't allow it. 
Trailing, 28-14, after two quarters, Paterno jogged to the locker room, 
gathered his team around him and preached patience. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, just play our game," he told the Nittany Lions. "Everybody relax. Don't 
lose your poise. Don't try to make big plays. Let's just go out and get five 
and six (yards) and stay in the game. Play our game and we'll be all right." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Pa talks. Penn State listens. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nittany Lions scored 21-second half points, Illinois scored three. 
</P>
<P>
 "They played a 60-minute game," said Illini star linebacker Dana Howard, "and 
we played almost 60 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Illinois' lapse in those crucial final minutes that cost it the game. 
The Illini (6-4) had Penn State pinned at the Nittany Lions' four-yard line 
with 6:07 to play and a 15-m.p.h. wind in quarterback Kerry Collins' face. Hold 
them and Illinois ends Penn State's undefeated season, postpones the Nittany 
Lion Rose Bowl celebration and jeopardizes Paterno's chances of another 
national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Collins, rated first nationally in pass efficiency, led the Nittany 
Lions on what he later called "my most memorable drive." 
</P>
<P>
 No kidding. Collins completed his seven attempts and never once appeared 
flustered as Simeon Rice, the nation's leader in sacks, bore down on him. When 
he wasn't picking away at a now-confused Illinois defense, he was handing the 
ball to running backs Ki-Jana Carter or fullback Brian Milne. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, you know about. The Heisman Trophy candidate finished the day with 22 
carries, 110 yards and one touchdown. But it was Milne who made the difference. 
Thanks to starter Jon Witman's ankle injury, Milne got the call on nearly every 
short-yardage situation. 
</P>
<P>
 The final Penn State drive was no exception. Milne's two-yard run on first and 
goal with 57 seconds remaining gave the Nittany Lions their first lead of the 
day. Milne had only 25 yards in seven carries, but three of those rushes ended 
with touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just do what I'm told," said Milne, who sat out the 1992 season after 
successfully overcoming Hodgkin's disease. 
</P>
<P>
 After the touchdown, Milne returned to the sideline as if he were bored with 
the whole thing, but inside, "I wasn't calm at all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because Illinois still had one possession and nearly a minute to cover 
80 yards. It also had quarterback Johnny Johnson, who led the Illini to two 
fourth-quarter touchdowns in last week's come-from-behind victory over 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Penn State's players gathered in front of the bench and watched as 
the Nittany Lion defense tried to make a final stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "We held hands all down the sideline," Milne said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the field, linebacker Brian Gelzheiser appealed to a higher authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was praying," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Illinois got as far as the Penn State 31, but then Johnson, with no time left 
on the clock, threw an interception to free safety Kim Herring, who was tackled 
immediately by his own man, cornerback Marlon Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
 "With our offense we knew if we just kept it close they could pull it out," 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 They did, but the Nittany Lions needed that 96-yard drive and a 99-yarder in 
the second quarter. They also needed lots of faith. At one point, that lone 
unknown coach who voted Penn State an incredible No. 6 in last week's USA 
Today/CNN poll looked like a genius. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, he voted us No. 6," guard Marco Rivera said. "Maybe he hates us. But 
we're 9-0 and we beat the best defense in the Big Ten." 
</P>
<P>
 No need to mention that to Illinois defensive coordinator Denny Marcin. Marcin 
couldn't bear to glance at the final numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't even want to look at the stats," he said. "They're ugly. You've got 
to shut the water off sometime." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Penn State dripped its way to 300 passing yards and 160 rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 Early on, Penn State was leaky. Every time Paterno looked up, his team was 
being undone by a Ty -- Douthard or Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Douthard who scored Illinois' first touchdown, a one-yard run with 
11:31 gone in the period. And it was Washington who intercepted Collins' 
ill-advised pass to Bobby Engram midway through the quarter, putting the ball 
on the Penn State 23. 
</P>
<P>
 That done, it was Douthard's turn. Douthard ran four consecutive times, got it 
to the one-yard line and then, on second and goal, Johnson found tight end Ken 
Dilger wide open in the end zone for the touchdown. Illinois added another 
score with 12 seconds left in the period. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, it didn't matter. The Nittany Lions left the field as Big Ten 
champions, but not before Carter made a detour toward Penn State's contingent 
of fans. It was there that Carter said hello to his mother and then accepted a 
gift from a hometown friend from Westerville, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a rose. Saturday, it smelled especially sweet.

BRUINS SPIN THEIR RECORDS; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: COOK, STOKES, JORDAN AND SHAH 
DAZZLE ARIZONA STATE, 59-23. UCLA ROLLS UP 680 YARDS OF OFFENSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It was an expected Saturday night shootout that became an unexpected Saturday 
night blowout because only UCLA came in armed. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Cook passed for 380 yards, best of his career by far. Sharmon Shah went 
past 1,000 yards for the first time in his career, and J.J. Stokes caught two 
touchdown passes for the umpteenth time in his career to lead the Bruins to a 
59-23 victory over Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact on the Bruin record books went well beyond a game or a night. 
Cook's total gave him 2,283 yards for the season, his second 2,000-plus year in 
a row. Only Tommy Maddox and Troy Aikman have done that at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 His four touchdown passes tied a school record, but only he has done it three 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 Shah's 180 yards in 14 carries give him 1,092 and make him the first Bruin in 
four digits since Kevin Williams was there in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 And Stokes, well, he's back. 
</P>
<P>
 With 175 yards in seven receptions, he showed his recovery from a leg injury 
sustained in the opening game of the season is complete. 
</P>
<P>
 With his second reception, he broke Sean LaChapelle's record for a career, 
142. That came in the second quarter when Cook lofted the ball over Marcus 
Soward to the Arizona State eight-yard line. Skip Hicks scored on the next play 
to give the Bruins a 21-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 That was cut to 21-10 when Jon Baker kicked a 37-yard field goal, but Stokes 
came back with a highlight film reception to give UCLA a 28-10 advantage at 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 On second down from the Bruin 31, Cook faded back and spotted Stokes alone 
with Soward. The pass was low, but Stokes reached down, beat Soward to the ball 
and set sail. Eddie Cade came over to challenge, but Stokes slipped his tackle 
and headed down the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 The final stumbling block was Lee Cole, who got a Stokes stiff-arm in his face 
on the five and lost a wrestling match. Stokes scored standing up after walking 
a tightrope with his final steps. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Jordan had six catches for 175 yards and a touchdown. That gives him 
1,190 yards for the season, breaking Stokes' mark of 1,181, set last year. 
</P>
<P>
 To give everybody a feeling of belonging, the Bruins had 680 yards of total 
offense, a school record by nine yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The highlight film offering to Stokes gave Cook 247 passing yards in a first 
half in which the Bruins made things as difficult as possible for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 They scored on a 122-yard drive that included a successful conversion on third 
and 39, and on a conventional 85-yard drive to open the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The drive was long because Sale Isiah's debut on offense was short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior had played defensive tackle his entire career, but moved to offense 
for this game because the Bruins were short-handed up front. 
</P>
<P>
 His first effort began on the UCLA eight and lasted eight plays. On the 
eighth, Daron Washington's run up the middle for one yard to the Arizona State 
23, Isiah took exception to Cade's jumping on top of the pile. Isiah pushed 
Cade, drawing an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, then was ejected when he took 
exception to the call. 
</P>
<P>
 When officials had finished their hike across Sun Devil Stadium, the Bruins 
had second down on their 47. After an incomplete pass made it third down, Cook 
hit Jordan, who wrestled the ball from Arizona State's Craig Newsome on the 
three. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook passed to tight end Brian Richards for a touchdown on the next play to 
make it 14-0, and Richards drew his own unsportsmanlike conduct for celebrating 
the first touchdown of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, UCLA, the least penalized team in the Pacific 10, drew seven penalties 
for 88 yards in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins had made it look easy on their first drive, 85 yards in nine plays 
that included Cook-to-Jordan passes of 27 and 14 yards and Shah runs of 22 and 
12 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The lead was cut to 14-7 when Jake Plummer hit Keith Poole on an 11-yard 
touchdown pass, inside of cornerback Teddy Lawrence. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA showed no signs of letting up in the second half, coming out and rolling 
69 yards in seven plays, plus the usual penalty, this for holding. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the plays were passes to Stokes, for 28, 12 and the final eight yards 
of the drive to a 35-10 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Shah also had a 26-yard run en route. That put him over 1,000 yards for the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins (4-6, 2-5 in Pac-10) extended the lead to 42-10 on the next series, 
the rout being on. Backed up on their 12 after Andy Colbert had knocked down 
Plummer's fourth-down pass in the end zone, UCLA got space when Cook hit Stokes 
for 15 yards. Two Shah runs netted another first down, and then Cook passed 
twice to Jordan, first for 15 yards, then for 47 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona State (3-7, 2-5) countered with a Plummer-to-Poole touchdown hookup of 
33 yards, but Shah got that back in one play, a 65-yard run on the first play 
after the next kickoff. Now leading, 49-17, the Bruins decided Shah had had 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Cook, Jordan and Stokes, with quarterback heir apparent Ryan Fien leading 
a new group onto the field with 1:28 to play in the third quarter.

BANKRUPTCY: A FINANCIAL DESTINY FOR SOME ATHLETES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HERRMANN, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Harmon Killebrew had 573 career home runs, a Most Valuable Player award and, 
14 years after he retired from baseball, not a penny to his Hall of Fame name. 
Brooks Robinson could stop just about anything at third base, but he could 
barely lay a glove on the debts that piled up in the 1970s. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 
was the greatest basketball player of his time, yet his cash flow nearly ran 
out before his time did. 
</P>
<P>
 For all their huge contracts and lavish lifestyles, more than a few 
professional athletes have learned that money can't buy financial security. 
Yes, even the rich and famous can go broke. It was not a short list that former 
New York Islander Bryan Trottier joined recently when he filed for Chapter 7 
protection under the Federal Bankruptcy Code. Many other stars have attested to 
the pitfalls that can cost a fortune: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bad advice. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Extravagant spending. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Exorbitant loans from lenders who think an athlete is a good risk because 
he makes so much. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Can't-miss" business schemes pitched by relatives and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bad luck. 
</P>
<P>
 It can happen to the best of them. Johnny Unitas filed for bankruptcy in 1991. 
So did former Detroit Lions running back Billy Sims. Four-time batting champion 
Bill Madlock owed the Internal Revenue Service nearly $1 million at the start 
of this year. Graig Nettles filed for bankruptcy in 1988, before his 21st and 
final big league season. Relief pitcher Rollie Fingers lost much of his savings 
in business ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Gwynn filed for bankruptcy in 1987, the year he earned $600,000 and hit 
.370. Willie Mays was near bankruptcy after one of the greatest careers in 
baseball history. Even Mickey Mantle was not financially secure until the 
memorabilia boom in the '80s made him a valued property. 
</P>
<P>
 Trottier's case -- $9.5 million in debts against $141,000 in assets, mainly 
because of a failed office building and ice rink -- wasn't even unique to the 
past month or so. Former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Danny White filed for 
bankruptcy protection three weeks before Trottier, listing nearly $13 million 
in debts and $50,000 in assets and citing real estate transactions gone wrong. 
"The last 10 years, every penny I made went into a black hole," White said 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is so widespread that one prominent agent said roughly half of 
major league ballplayers with salaries of $500,000 or more in the 1980s had 
little or none of their baseball earnings left four years after they retired. 
Some financial managers specialize in setting up programs to keep athletes 
afloat. It has become part of every agent's job to make sure that their 
clients' massive earnings don't wind up going, going, gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the fellows believe the same thing the public does about them, that 
they have so much money, it just can't run out," said Jim Barrons, president of 
First Financial Strategies Inc. of Phoenix. "They're just competitors by nature 
and they believe they can always succeed." 
</P>
<P>
 Barrons, a certified public accountant, established his firm six years ago 
when an acquaintance, Alan Bannister, said he and other former major leaguers 
needed advice. Now he represents Andre Dawson, Jack Morris, Scott Sanderson and 
at least one ex-pitcher whom Barrons had to convince to move out of a luxury 
home, pay off his car loans, move into a modest house and start working as a 
sales rep. "He's not earning a six-figure income," Barrons said, "but he's 
living comfortably." 
</P>
<P>
 That some utility infielders and long-relief pitchers are set for life is 
testimony to the kind of planning that eluded some big stars. "There's nothing 
magic about it," agent Jim Bronner said. "It's merely making a budget for a 
lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We work backwards. We try to understand what a player's long-term goals are 
and show them how to make assumptions: How long they're going to play, what 
their earnings are going to be. And then we take a conservative approach to 
investing that will help them reach their goals very easily," Bronner said. "It 
isn't so much 'Do this or do that, invest in this or invest in that.' It's more 
a matter of making sure they don't spend it all." 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Shapiro is the agent whose studies indicated that about half of the 
$500,000-a-year ballplayers lost most or all of their money in the '80s. As a 
result, he encourages his clients to invest conservatively and passively -- in 
larger, traditional businesses rather than any venture that requires the 
athlete to be a hands-on owner, such as a sports bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrons tells his clients to start their portfolios with low-risk municipal 
bonds. He also lets them know that business, like any sport, isn't as easy as 
it looks from the outside. "Honestly, I've had players tell me, 'Jim, if I 
can't make it in baseball, I'll make it outside of baseball.' I have to tell 
them they probably won't be earning 10% of what they're making now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Every agent would like to keep his client from becoming the next Jack Clark. A 
three-year, $8.7-million deal with the Boston Red Sox was not enough to keep 
the power hitter from going nearly $7 million in debt two years ago. Clark had 
splurged on a $2.4-million home and 18 cars, including a $700,000 Ferrari. He 
filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, then jumped into the risky world of drag 
racing. He's a rookie driver on the National Hot Rod Assn. circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I paid everybody back 100% on the dollar," he told reporters this past 
summer, referring to his Chapter 11 filing. "It's one of those things where you 
couldn't keep up with everybody all at once. It's a business decision that's 
available to everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 As Trottier said: "It's just a new challenge for Bryan Trottier. I like to hit 
challenges head on. That's the way I played hockey, that's the way I am in 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 But life and sports sometimes don't offer the same rewards. The very qualities 
that can make someone a champion can make him a big debtor. An athlete can 
recall how tenacity and resolve fueled a comeback from four runs down in the 
bottom of the ninth or scored a touchdown in the last second, and believes the 
same can happen in business. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a sort of macho outlook that doesn't allow them to recognize trouble 
when they're sinking deeper and deeper into a hole," Shapiro said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro was the securities commissioner for Maryland in the early 1970s -- 
"the age of tax shelters," he said. "Doctors and professional athletes were the 
two primary targets of bad investment deals." 
</P>
<P>
 After he left that post, someone with the Baltimore Orioles called him about 
helping the nearly-bankrupt Robinson to overcome debts caused by some of those 
bad deals. Shapiro did that, and soon established his own sports management 
company -- with Robinson as a partner -- that now represents Dennis Martinez, 
Eddie Murray and others. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have done -- and not always with the level of success I'd like -- is 
battled the lifestyle-earning curve. In this country, as we earn, we spend. 
That's all of us: teachers, journalists, lawyers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletes are just like anyone else, only more so, as they say. Business 
managers have to talk players out of buying the most unique house in town or a 
convoy of classic autos. Convincing them isn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it's like negotiating a whole new contract," Shapiro said. "That 
isn't saying a guy earning 5 or 6 million isn't entitled to a luxury car. But 
two or three of them means trouble."

GOLDEN STATE LEAVES THE LAKERS BEWILDERED AND BEATEN, 121-99; PRO BASKETBALL: 
WARRIORS ARE OFF TO THEIR BEST START SINCE PHILADELPHIA DAYS. LOS ANGELES, 
MEANWHILE, IS 'A DISASTER,' COACH SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Increasing their degree of difficulty, the Lakers trailed by 22 points at the 
start of the fourth quarter this time and hoped for at least another graceful 
exit, only to get something much worse. 
</P>
<P>
 A belly flop. 
</P>
<P>
 The night after erasing an 18-point deficit with 12 minutes to go against 
Denver at the Forum to force overtime, the Lakers could not delay the 
inevitable against Golden State. They should not have wanted to. They should 
only have worried about escaping Oakland Coliseum Arena on Saturday with 
whatever remained of their scalps. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played poorly," Laker Coach Del Harris said after the Warriors' 121-99 
rout before 15,025. "There's no two ways around it. Hopefully now that we have 
this segment behind us, we can have a good week ahead. Six games since last 
Friday is a tough row to hoe, and I thought we held together pretty well. But 
tonight, we were a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "At halftime, I said there wasn't one thing to talk about. I said our problem 
was basketball." 
</P>
<P>
 The problems with the problem started to mount early, the Warriors needing 
only about 8 1/2 minutes to build an 11-point lead. That would become 19 by 
late in the second quarter, when Golden State beat the Laker defense back with 
regularity for easy transition baskets, and then 24 on several occasions in the 
third period. 
</P>
<P>
 The comeback never came, only more water inside the boat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope the guys were thinking that -- that we weren't really out of it," said 
Tony Smith, who provided the only real Laker highlight with five three-pointers 
in the fourth quarter to set a team single-quarter record for three-pointers. 
"But the effort that we came with (Friday) night, we just didn't come with that 
tonight. We were in kind of a funk." 
</P>
<P>
 With Smith going five of nine and four Warriors taking at least five 
three-pointers, the teams set an NBA record with 48 long-range attempts, 
breaking the mark of 47 accomplished twice, including Friday night when Phoenix 
played Seattle. Latrell Sprewell made only one of his six attempts from there, 
but still finished nine of 18 overall while scoring a game-high 24 points for 
Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedric Ceballos led the Lakers -- who shot only 34.6% overall -- with 20 
points and Smith had 18. Nick Van Exel had 12 points and 10 assists, Vlade 
Divac 10 points and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden State came in looking to improve to 5-0 and set a Bay Area-era record 
best start, trailing only the 9-0 opening by Wilt Chamberlain and Philadelphia 
in 1960. These Warriors not only had beaten three 1994 playoff teams on the 
road in the first four games, but did so without key elements Chris Webber 
(unsigned) and Chris Mullin (injured). One of the victories came after trailing 
by 17 points, another by 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Strange twists abound with this team, the latest being Don Nelson, the coach 
and general manager, volunteering to resign and move upstairs if that will help 
make Webber happy. The few people Nelson has to answer to in an organization he 
once owned a piece of told him to stay put. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, they play on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't even think we're very good yet," Nelson said. "I think we're going to 
be real good." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers are having a tough time with the "going to be" part. Again shaking 
up the lineup while starting Chris Gatling and Rod Higgins at the forward spots 
that (they hope) eventually will belong to Webber and Mullin, the Warriors gave 
the visitors an overdose of speed the night after muscle did the Lakers in at 
the Forum against Denver, going for 64 points in the first two quarters and a 
commanding 17-point lead by intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the third quarter, the Warrior lead was up to 90-68, and the 
Lakers, shooting 33.8%, were summoning ghosts of the night before. That didn't 
mean any had to listen.

CLIPPERS NO MATCH FOR SUNS; PRO BASKETBALL: DANNY MANNING AND FRIENDS SHOW LOS 
ANGELES EXACTLY WHAT IT IS MISSING IN EASY, 108-101 VICTORY AT THE POND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Clippers, who have yet to win a game this season, could sure use all-star 
forward Danny Manning. 
</P>
<P>
 But Manning is long gone. 
</P>
<P>
 After spending the first 5 1/2 seasons of his NBA career with the Clippers, 
Manning faced his old team Saturday night for the second time since he was 
traded last February to the Atlanta Hawks for all-star forward Dominique 
Wilkins and a first-round draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
 Signed by the Phoenix Suns last September, Manning had 15 points and seven 
rebounds as the Suns handed the Clippers their fourth loss in as many games, 
108-101, before a sellout crowd of 18,018 at The Pond of Anaheim, their home 
away from home, where they'll play six regular-season games. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning, who was booed before the game, took it in stride. "They can boo me if 
they want; they're entitled to their opinion," he said. "The thing about it is, 
I expect it because that's how it is here. It's upsetting for me because I play 
hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Majerle had a game-high 33 points, making 10 of 18 shots, including four 
three-pointers, and former Laker forward A.C. Green had 14 points and 12 
rebounds as the Suns beat the Clippers for the sixth game in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonight, Dan had the hot hand and we tried to go with him," Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who lost their first three games by an average of 18.3 points, 
played perhaps their best game of the season, coming back from a 18-point 
fourth-quarter deficit with a 22-11 run in the final 6:40. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Terry Dehere led the Clippers with 19 points and six assists, and point 
guard Pooh Richardson had 16 points and nine assists. Forward Loy Vaught had 15 
points and eight rebounds. Rookie forward Lamond Murray, the Clippers' top 
draft pick, had 15 points in a reserve role. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time that Manning, the Clippers' all-time leading scorer with 
7,120 points, had played in Southern California since the trade. He seemed 
nervous in his first game against the Clippers last season, scoring six points 
as the Hawks lost to the Clippers, 97-94, in March. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking forward to seeing a lot of friends," Manning said. "Every game I 
play I want to win. Does this one make me a little bit hungrier? Yes, it does." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers made the playoffs two seasons in a row under former coach Larry 
Brown, extending the Houston Rockets to five games before losing in the first 
round in 1993 and taking the Utah Jazz to five games before losing in the first 
round in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 But it quickly fell apart and the Clippers are rebuilding again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had good times and I had bad times," Manning said of his time with the 
Clippers. "I'm just sorry that we didn't get a chance to play together for a 
very long time because we took a lot of lumps at first and it would have been 
nice to reap some of the fruits." 
</P>
<P>
 With Manning in the lineup, the Suns, who lost to the Chicago Bulls in the 
1993 NBA finals, are considered by many to have a shot at winning the NBA title 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It (signing with Phoenix) was pretty much an easy decision for me," Manning 
said. "When I went to Phoenix this summer, the next day I was supposed to go to 
L.A. and talk to the Lakers. I walked into America West (Arena) and said, 'I 
could come work here every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Manning has blended in well, averaging a team-high 20.3 points, 6.3 rebounds 
and three assists in his first four games with Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's fit in here well," guard Kevin Johnson said. "One of his greatest 
assets, other than his skills, is the fact that he's such a good complementary 
player. He can be an asset to whatever group of guys he's assembled with just 
because he can do so many things out there on the court both offensively and 
defensively."

NBA ROUNDUP; MAVERICKS RIDE MASHBURN (50) OVER BULLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jamal Mashburn and Jim Jackson came out galloping and the rest of the Dallas 
Mavericks hung on for the joy ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Mashburn set a team record with 50 points and Jackson added a career-high 38 
as the Mavericks defeated the Chicago Bulls, 124-120, in overtime Saturday 
night, ending a 12-game losing streak against the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually I've had two good scorers on teams that I coached, but not who took 
on the scoring load like these guys did tonight. I guess we kind of went with 
them," Dallas Coach Dick Motta said. "Sometimes you've just got to ride those 
horses." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson scored seven points in overtime after scoring 16 in the fourth 
quarter. Mashburn had 17 in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Mashburn's previous career high was 37 points, accomplished twice last season 
when he was a rookie. 
</P>
<P>
 The Maverick record of 49 was set by Mark Aguirre against the Philadelphia 
76ers on Jan. 28, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's layup with 21 seconds to play in regulation gave the Mavericks a 
109-107 lead, but Will Perdue of the Bulls was fouled by Popeye Jones with 
seven seconds left. Perdue, who scored 19 points, made both free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones missed a last-second shot, forcing overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 100, New Jersey 84 -- Hakeem Olajuwon had 31 points, 10 rebounds and 
five blocks for the unbeaten Rockets at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockets, who are 6-0 after opening last season with 15 consecutive 
victories, haven't lost a game in November since Nov. 28, 1992, when they 
dropped a 108-99 decision to the Utah Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny Anderson led the Nets with 26 points. Derrick Coleman had 14 rebounds 
but only seven points, making one of 15 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando 116, Philadelphia 103 -- Shaquille O'Neal had 28 points, 12 rebounds 
and a season-high six assists at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neal punctuated his night with eight fourth-quarter points, all on dunks, as 
the Magic pulled away with a 15-6 spurt that made the score 109-91 with 4:13 to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Malone of the 76ers led all scorers with 30 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte 113, Detroit 100 -- Alonzo Mourning scored 28 points to lead the 
Hornets at Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Mourning made 11 of 15 shots and had a team-high eight rebounds. Muggsy Bogues 
had 22 points and 13 assists for the Hornets, who won for the second time in as 
many nights after losing their first three games. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Grant Hill led the Pistons with 25 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana 93, Cleveland 86 -- The Cavaliers missed nine of their first 10 shots 
and never recovered at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie Miller scored 23 points and Derrick McKey and Rik Smits each scored 12 
for the Pacers, who had lost their previous seven road games against the 
Cavaliers. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington 109, Miami 99 -- Rex Chapman scored 30 points and set a team record 
with eight three-point goals at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman made eight of 14 shots from three-point range to break the old mark of 
six set by Michael Adams against the San Antonio Spurs on Dec. 18, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Reserve Ledell Eackles led the Heat with 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 114, Minnesota 101 -- Xavier McDaniel led a balanced attack with 21 
points as the Celtics survived a battle of winless teams at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota (0-6) is off to its worst start in six seasons in the league. Sean 
Rooks led the Timberwolves with 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
 San Antonio 101, New York 82 -- David Robinson had 35 points and 13 rebounds 
at San Antonio to help the Spurs hand the Knicks their first loss in four 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the second season in a row that the Spurs have dealt the Knicks their 
first loss. They ended a seven-game Knick winning streak at the start of last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Ewing scored 22 points to lead the Knicks, who made only 38% of their 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver 119, Utah 110 -- Rookie Jalen Rose made four free throws in the final 
40 seconds and Robert Pack scored 26 points for the Nuggets at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Hornacek scored 33 points for the Jazz to break out of a slump. He had 
scored only 32 points and made 33% of his shots in his previous four games. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento 105, Atlanta 97 -- Mitch Richmond scored 10 points in the final 
four minutes and surpassed the 10,000-point mark for his career with 32 to lead 
the Kings at Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie forward Michael Smith added 18 points and Spud Webb had 17 points and a 
game-high 11 assists for the Kings, who trailed by 14 points midway through the 
second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Clipper Ken Norman led the Hawks with 21 points.

SOUTHWEST ROUNDUP; TEXAS A&M MAKES PLAYS TO HOLD OFF LOUISVILLE, 26-10 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Louisville tight end Jamie Asher said the Cardinals were as good as 
ninth-ranked Texas A&M for all but five or six plays Saturday at Louisville, 
Ky. 
</P>
<P>
 But those five or six plays made the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Corey Pullig completed a 25-yard touchdown pass to Chris Sanders and Leeland 
McElroy ran eight yards for a score as the Aggies defeated Louisville, 26-10. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aggies (9-0-1) came up with the defensive plays when they needed them, 
recovering a fumble in Louisville territory that led to the decisive touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Marty Lowe of Louisville (5-5) was sacked seven times and his team had 
minus-eight yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 Baylor 19, Rice 14 -- Bradford Lewis sprinted through the Owls' defense for a 
24-yard touchdown with 8:05 to play at Houston, helping the Bears keep their 
Cotton Bowl hopes alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Baylor, 7-3 overall and 4-2 in the Southwest Conference, led throughout the 
game, then fell behind in the fourth quarter as Josh LaRocca of Rice (4-5, 3-3) 
passed for two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas 48, Houston 13 -- James Brown tied a school record with four touchdown 
passes at Austin, Tex., helping the Longhorns (6-4, 3-3) send the Cougars (1-8, 
1-4) to their third consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas Christian 35, Southern Methodist 14 -- Max Knake passed for three 
touchdowns and Andre Davis scored twice at Dallas as the Horned Frogs (6-3, 
3-2) kept their Cotton Bowl hopes alive while keeping the Mustangs (1-9-1, 
0-6-1) winless in their last eight games. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas Tech 39, Southwestern Louisiana 7 -- Zebbie Lethridge passed for one 
touchdown and ran for two as the Red Raiders (5-4) romped over the Ragin' 
Cajuns (5-5) at Lubbock, Tex.

WESTERN ATHLETIC ROUNDUP; AIR FORCE SURPRISES NO. 12 UTAH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Air Force cadets, showing a rare lack of military discipline, tore down the 
goalposts on Saturday for the first time since a victory over Notre Dame in 
1982, and Falcon Coach Fisher DeBerry gave the marauders his blessing. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Beau Morgan, making his first start, completed two touchdown passes 
to halfback Jake Campbell, and Morgan and Campbell each ran for another score, 
as Air Force stunned No. 12 Utah, 40-33, at Air Force Academy, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 "If any spectator didn't get his money's worth this afternoon, then he's brain 
dead," DeBerry said. "That was an unbelievable game, one that went back and 
forth. I've been here 15 years, and I think this is as fine a win as we have 
ever had. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our team just beat the 12th-ranked football team in America. Maybe that will 
open some eyes now to the reality of this team." 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons, 7-3 overall and 5-2 in the Western Athletic Conference after an 
0-3 start, got two key field goals from Randy Roberts, both into a stiff wind, 
including a 42-yarder with 12:39 to play for a 34-31 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 After stopping Utah on fourth down, Air Force tacked on another score as 
fullback Jake Maloy sprinted 41 yards with 1:20 to play. The extra-point kick 
was blocked, however, and Utah's Kareem Leary ran the other direction for two 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss was the second in a row for Utah (8-2, 5-2) and severely damaged the 
Utes' hopes for their first WAC title and ended Holiday Bowl berth hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the whole season," Ute Coach Ron McBride insisted. "We're still 
playing to win the WAC." 
</P>
<P>
 Utah's task is much more difficult, however. By beating Air Force, Utah could 
have determined its own fate with a victory over Brigham Young (9-2, 6-1) this 
week. Now, Colorado State (9-1, 6-1) has the inside track. If the Rams beat 
Fresno State this week, they'll earn the Holiday Bowl berth regardless of the 
BYU-Utah outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Air Force could conceivably tie for the WAC title, but the Falcons have no 
chance for the Holiday Bowl because of tiebreakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah's Mike McCoy passed for three touchdowns and the Utes led at one point, 
17-0. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 10 Colorado State 48, Arkansas State 3 -- Anthoney Hill passed for three 
touchdowns and reserve running back Renard Carn ran for 113 yards and a 
touchdown at Ft. Collins, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, who played a little more than two quarters before giving way to freshman 
Moses Moreno, passed for touchdowns of four, 10 and 18 yards as the Rams (9-1) 
romped over the Indians (1-9). 
</P>
<P>
 Fresno State 30, Texas El Paso 30 -- Armen Torigian missed an extra-point kick 
after Reggie Brown's one-foot touchdown dive with 36 seconds to play and the 
Bulldogs had to settle for a WAC tie at El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresno State (4-6-1, 2-3-1) was outplayed most of the second half by the 
Miners (3-6-1, 1-5-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Wyoming 38, New Mexico 28 -- John Gustin passed for 427 yards, including a 
63-yard touchdown pass to Marcus Harris late in the fourth quarter, to lead the 
Cowboys (5-6, 3-4) over the Lobos (4-7, 3-4) at Laramie, Wyo.

SOUTHEASTERN ROUNDUP; FLORIDA WINS EAST WITH ROUT OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With an opportunity to clinch its third consecutive Southeastern Conference 
Eastern Division title, fourth-ranked Florida left nothing to chance against 
South Carolina on Saturday at Gainesville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach (Steve) Spurrier told us to get ready for a championship-type game. We 
came in with the attitude that we had to win it," defensive end Kevin Carter 
said after a 48-17 victory assured the Gators a trip to Atlanta for the SEC 
championship game on Dec. 3 against sixth-ranked Alabama. The Crimson Tide 
clinched the Western Division title Saturday with a 29-25 victory over 
Mississippi State. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida, 8-1 overall and 6-1 in the SEC, improved its record at home to 29-2 
under Spurrier, who noted this division title is different from the others 
because the Gators clinched before their last conference game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Wuerffel passed for 357 yards and four touchdowns, including two 
second-quarter scoring passes to Jack Jackson, who became Florida's career 
touchdown reception leader with 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, returning to the starting lineup after being benched for what 
Spurrier said was a sub-par performance against Georgia two weeks ago, caught 
his 11th and 12th touchdown passes of the season to tie the school mark set by 
Carlos Alvarez in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 South Carolina (5-5, 4-4) led, 10-7, before Florida scored 31 consecutive 
points. The Gamecocks finally answered with Steve Taneyhill's 12-yard touchdown 
pass to Boomer Foster in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's six-catch, 80-yard performance capped a tumultuous week in which he 
criticized Spurrier's coaching after a 55-17 victory over Southern Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
 The receiver not only was unhappy about being benched and later suspended for 
a half for missing a team meeting, but voiced concern about Spurrier's handling 
of the Gators' much-publicized quarterback controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Wuerffel replaced one-time Heisman Trophy contender Terry Dean as Florida's 
starter three games ago. Jackson said that decision, and others, have players 
wondering about job security. 
</P>
<P>
 The receiver apologized for his comments after a meeting with Spurrier and was 
back in the starting lineup on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't bother me when a player gets mad at his coach," Spurrier said. "He 
maybe went a little overboard, but you've got to know how Jack is and that when 
he's upset he says some things that maybe he wishes he didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Tennessee 24, Memphis 13 -- Nilo Silvan set up all of Tennessee's points with 
punt returns and the Volunteer defense did the rest at Knoxville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 Silvan's 136 yards on four punt returns broke the school record of 135 set by 
Bert Rechichar in 1950 and helped the Volunteers (5-4) improve to 15-0 against 
Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss means that Memphis (6-4) will have to beat East Carolina next week to 
gain a berth in the Liberty Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Arkansas 30, Northern Illinois 27 -- Barry Lunney Jr. scored the game-winning 
touchdown on a one-yard run with 8:11 to play at Fayetteville, Ark., four plays 
after Del Delco recovered Sean Algood's ill-advised pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Northern Illinois (4-7) led, 24-14, early in the third quarter and Arkansas 
(4-6) wasted two excellent opportunities prior to Delco's recovery. Allgood 
made the pitch while in the grasp of defensive back Dean Peevy, and Delco 
recovered at the Northern Illinois 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Northeast Louisiana 21, Kentucky 14 -- Raymond Philyaw connected with Stepfret 
Williams on a 54-yard touchdown pass in the fourth quarter at Lexington, Ky., 
as the Indians (2-8) sent the Wildcats to their ninth consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Northeast Louisiana stopped Kentucky (1-9) at the Indians' two-yard line as 
time expired. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Mississippi 20, Louisiana State 18 -- Chris Pierce made up for misses 
from 40 and 37 yards by kicking his second field goal of the fourth quarter, a 
52-yarder with two minutes left, to give the Golden Eagles (6-5) a victory over 
the Tigers (2-7) at Baton Rogue, La. 
</P>
<P>
 LSU quarterback Jamie Howard, who threw for two touchdowns, took the Tigers to 
the Southern Miss 28 before a penalty halted the drive, and Andre Lafleur 
missed a 50-yard field goal attempt with 15 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Mississippi 38, Tulane 0 -- Dou Innocent ran for 111 yards and two touchdowns 
and the Rebels' defense forced seven turnovers at New Orleans. Ole Miss (4-6) 
had five interceptions, two by Alundus Brice, and recovered two fumbles. Tulane 
fell to 1-9.

A FIRST FOR BOWDEN: AUBURN DOESN'T WIN; SEC: TIGERS SETTLE FOR 23-23 TIE WITH 
GEORGIA WHEN FIELD GOAL GOES WIDE.

<P>
 Matt Hawkins had waited almost four years for this chance: tie score, a few 
seconds left in the game, victory only one straight kick away. 
</P>
<P>
 He knelt beside the net where he practices his kicks on the sideline as his 
Auburn teammates moved into position to bail out the nation's longest winning 
streak Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 When Hawkins finally trotted onto the field with 13 seconds to play, the 
third-ranked Tigers were tied with Georgia 23-23, and 44 yards away were the 
goalposts that would decide if Auburn's two-year fantasy continued for another 
week or ended at 20 victories. 
</P>
<P>
 One chance to be hero or goat. The kind of moment a kicker lives for. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't worried about it. I went in thinking God's will will be done no 
matter what happens," Hawkins said. "Unfortunately, things did not turn out the 
way I had hoped." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins' kick had plenty of distance, but it sailed about three feet wide. 
</P>
<P>
 Auburn Coach Terry Bowden threw his arms up, thinking the kick was good. Then 
he clasped his hands on top of his head when he realized the winning streak was 
over. 
</P>
<P>
 While several thousand Georgia fans celebrated at the opposite end of 
Jordan-Hare Stadium, most of the remaining 84,214 sat in stunned silence. 
</P>
<P>
 It had been nearly two years since their team didn't leave the field a winner, 
and they didn't know how to react. 
</P>
<P>
 "This feels like a loss for us," Bowden said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers, 9-0-1 overall and 6-0-1 in the Southeastern Conference, squandered 
a chance to put the Bulldogs (5-4-1, 3-4-1) away in the second half, then came 
to regret it when Eric Zeier threw two touchdown passes to overcome a 14-point 
deficit.

ALABAMA HAS ENOUGH TO REMAIN UNBEATEN; SEC: CRIMSON TIDE RALLIES TO DEFEAT 
MISSISSIPPI STATE, 29-25, TO REACH CONFERENCE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME AGAIN.

 Alabama doesn't win by much, but the sixth-ranked Crimson Tide is still 
undefeated and headed to the Southeastern Conference championship game for the 
third consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
 Seldom-used freshman tailback Dennis Riddle scored on a one-yard run with 51 
seconds to play as the Crimson Tide, 10-0 overall and 7-0 in the SEC, defeated 
No. 20 Mississippi State on Saturday, 29-25, to clinch the SEC Western Division 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is, we won the game under tough conditions," Alabama Coach Gene 
Stallings said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mississippi State (7-3, 4-3) led, 25-15, after Tim Rogers kicked a 21-yard 
field goal with 7:57 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 But Alabama, which has beaten its nine Division I-A opponents by an average 
margin of only 8.1 points, scored two touchdowns after that to defeat the 
Bulldogs for the 14th consecutive time and 36th time in the last 37 meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Barker completed 26 of 35 passes for 325 yards and three touchdowns to 
improve to 33-1-1 as Alabama's starter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing that helped Alabama today was No. 7 (Barker)," said 
Mississippi State Coach Jackie Sherrill, who is 0-6 against his alma mater, 
including four losses at Mississippi State. "They don't win games the last 
three years without 7." 
</P>
<P>
 Alabama will play Florida in the SEC title game on Dec. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Riddle, whose three carries Saturday gave him 23 for the season, capped the 
game-winning 10-play, 66-yard drive by powering over left tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 The big play on the drive was Barker's 28-yard pass to Sherman Williams, who 
made a diving catch to the Mississippi State 16.

BIG TEN ROUNDUP; KICKOFF RETURN HELPS OHIO STATE WIN, 32-17 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So much for Ohio State's first-half scoring jinx on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Joey Galloway scored on a 93-yard kickoff return and Eddie George rushed for 
two first-half touchdowns as the Buckeyes recorded a 32-17 Big Ten victory over 
Indiana on Saturday at Bloomington, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio State, 8-3 overall and 5-2 in the Big Ten, hadn't scored a first-half 
touchdown away from home all season. But that streak ended on Galloway's long 
return midway through the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 George, who finished with 118 yards, also scored on short runs in the first 
and second quarters as Ohio State took a 19-17 lead at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buckeyes added two touchdowns in the fourth quarter on passes by Bobby 
Hoying of two yards to Rickey Dudley and 20 yards to Chris Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana (5-5, 2-5) lost its fourth consecutive game, its longest losing streak 
in nine years. Tailback Alex Smith's 98 yards gave him 1,230 for the season, 10 
short of the Big Ten freshman record set by Minnesota's Darrell Thompson in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hoosiers' only lead was at 7-0 on a 13-yard touchdown reception by Ajamu 
Stoner from Chris Dittoe, who was elevated to starting quarterback last week in 
place of John Paci. 
</P>
<P>
 But Galloway took the following kickoff, broke free and raced down the right 
sideline for the score, the first touchdown off an Indiana kickoff since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 19 Michigan 38, Minnesota 22 -- Todd Collins passed for a school-record 
352 yards and two touchdowns as the Wolverines overcame a terrible first half 
at Ann Arbor, Mich., to keep their Citrus Bowl hopes alive. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the eighth consecutive year the Wolverines (7-3, 5-2) managed to win 
the Little Brown Jug from the Gophers (3-7, 1-6), but this year Minnesota 
managed to make a game of it for at least a half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gophers, outscored in their last four games against Michigan, 173-26, led 
after the first half, 15-10, as they held Michigan to one yard rushing and 165 
yards overall while forcing two turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Wolverines scored on their first four possessions of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Iowa 49, Northwestern 13 -- Matt Sherman passed for three touchdowns in his 
first collegiate start and Sedrick Shaw ran for 114 yards and a score as the 
Hawkeyes (4-5-1, 2-4-1) won at Iowa City. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman, a redshirt freshman who started the year as the No. 2 quarterback, 
recovered from a broken foot suffered in the fourth week of the season and 
started against the Wildcats because of injuries to Iowa's four other 
quarterbacks. He completed 19 of 24 passes for 331 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Northwestern (3-6-1, 2-5) has lost 21 in a row against Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin 38, Cincinnati 7 -- Senior Terrell Fletcher ran for 165 yards and 
scored twice in 21 carries as the Badgers (5-4-1) won a nonconference game at 
Madison, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati is 1-8-1.

SPARTANS DELIVER FOR PERLES; BIG TEN: MICHIGAN STATE PRESENTS COACH WITH A 
42-30 VICTORY OVER PURDUE IN HIS FINAL HOME GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was an emotional struggle, both on the field and off. Yet a tearful George 
Perles was able to walk out a winner in his final game at Spartan Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of embarrassing to let your emotions go," Perles said. "It happens 
at wakes and funerals. I've always had a tendency to let go at these events." 
</P>
<P>
 This was a heart-tugging game, one the Spartans were in danger of losing. 
</P>
<P>
 It took the passing of Tony Banks, plus the running of Duane Goulbourne and 
Marc Renaud, to bring the Spartans back from an 18-point deficit for a 42-30 
victory over Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
 Perles, who was fired Tuesday, will coach his final game Nov. 26 when the 
Spartans, 5-5 overall and 4-3 in the Big Ten, close out the regular season at 
Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't agree with what happened this week, so we went out there to win 
this one for Coach Perles," said Banks, who completed 15 of 20 passes for 176 
yards and one touchdown, without an interception. "Everyone on this team loves 
him, and that's why we played so hard." 
</P>
<P>
 As the final seconds ticked down, players gathered around Perles on the 
sideline. The obligatory Gatorade dousing came with 17 seconds to play as 
Renaud was diving into the line on the final play. 
</P>
<P>
 The portly Perles was hoisted on many shoulders and carried about 10 yards 
toward the center of the field. He doffed his cap, then players and 
well-wishers tousled his hair. Purdue Coach Jim Colletto walked over and gave 
him a hug. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't tell you what Jim Colletto said to me in private," Perles said. "He 
was very, very compassionate. It would be embarrassing to tell you what a guy 
he is." 
</P>
<P>
 "Thanks, George," read a large banner near the tunnel as Perles headed up 
toward the dressing rooms. Perles, who is 9-2-1 against Purdue, will take a 
73-61-4 record into the final game at Penn State. He was 39-29-2 in Spartan 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Purdue (4-4-2, 2-3-2), getting three touchdowns from Mike Alstott, led, 21-3, 
with 7:55 left in the half. But the Spartans scored 25 unanswered points to 
take a 28-21 lead. The Boilermakers kept threatening, but the Spartans never 
gave up the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The go-ahead touchdown came in the third quarter when Ike Reese picked up a 
fumble by Alstott and ran 38 yards.

NO REPEAT AS NEBRASKA SURVIVES SCARE; BIG EIGHT: NO. 1 CORNHUSKERS DEFEAT IOWA 
STATE, 28-12, IN CYCLONE STADIUM, WHERE THEY WERE UPSET TWO YEARS AGO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Nebraska got out of Cyclone Stadium with a victory this time, but not without 
a scare. 
</P>
<P>
 The No. 1-ranked Cornhuskers led winless Iowa State only 7-6 late in the first 
half and, 14-12, in the fourth quarter Saturday before winning, 28-12, to 
clinch a berth in the Orange Bowl and a share of the Big Eight championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska, 11-0 overall and 6-0 in the Big Eight, finally secured the victory 
with fourth-quarter touchdown runs by Damon Benning and Lawrence Phillips after 
putting aside memories of Iowa State's upset of Nebraska in Ames two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was hard to keep from thinking of that (1992) game," Nebraska quarterback 
Brook Berringer said. "The biggest thing we needed to do was stay focused and 
not panic and I think we did that." 
</P>
<P>
 Berringer passed for one touchdown and set up Benning's touchdown with a 
28-yard run. Phillips finished with 183 yards and two touchdowns in 36 carries 
after being held to 30 yards in 15 first-half carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Iowa State (0-9-1, 0-5-1) stayed close in what might have been Jim Walden's 
final game as coach. Walden will resign at the end of the season and has been 
suspended for next Saturday's finale with Colorado, although he has said he is 
looking for a way to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very proud of the way our guys played," said Walden, who is in his eighth 
season at Iowa State. "For a non-winning team, that's not a bad effort." 
</P>
<P>
 Iowa State, last in the Big Eight in total defense, made Nebraska earn 
everything and kept Phillips in check until the fourth quarter. The Cornhuskers 
led at halftime, 14-6, only because of Berringer's 38-yard touchdown pass to 
Abdul Muhammad in the final minute of the half. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were moving around a lot, a lot of slants, a lot of interior movement," 
Benning said. "We knew from the get-go they were going to play hard. It was 
their last home game, senior day, the coach's last game, not to mention all the 
Nebraska guys on their team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew we were going to get their best effort." 
</P>
<P>
 Iowa State cut the lead to 14-12 when Calvin Branch beat defensive back Kareem 
Moss down the left sideline and caught Todd Doxzon's perfectly lofted pass for 
a 58-yard touchdown with 3:42 to play in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nebraska stopped Doxzon on a two-point conversion run and eventually 
gained some breathing room after forcing the Cyclones to punt from their eight 
early in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cornhuskers took over at the Iowa State 41 and three plays later, 
Berringer ran 28 yards to the six. Benning ran untouched up the middle on the 
next play, stretching the lead to 21-12 with 12:09 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt good to go up by more than seven," Benning said. "That kind of 
ensured the game."

 No. 25-ranked Boston College ran its unbeaten streak to seven games by 
defeating No. 14 Syracuse, 31-0, on Saturday behind Mark Hartsell, who passed 
for three touchdowns, and a relentless pass rush. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles had six sacks, five against Kevin Mason, who was second in the 
nation in passing efficiency.Mason had been sacked only 11 times in the 
previous eight games. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you've ever played anything competitively when the other team can't score, 
it's a wonderful experience," said Boston College Coach Dan Henning. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles, 6-2-1 overall and 3-1-1 in the Big East, moved from fourth place 
to second in the conference. Syracuse (6-3, 4-2) dropped out of second after 
its second consecutive game without a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never felt like this before in my life," Orangemen offensive tackle Jim 
Ledger said. "This is the biggest disappointment I've ever gone through." 
</P>
<P>
 A tie with Rutgers is the only blemish on Boston College's record since 
opening with losses to Michigan and Virginia Tech.

 The charmed season of 18th-ranked Duke hit the skids Saturday as North 
Carolina State rallied in the second half for a 24-23 victory in a game with 
major bowl implications. 
</P>
<P>
 It kept alive the hopes of the Wolfpack, 7-2 overall and 5-1 in the Atlantic 
Coast Conference, for at least a share of the ACC title with league-leading 
Florida State (8-1, 7-0), which plays at Raleigh next weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "It (winning the ACC title) is still a long shot but we have that 
opportunity," said Wolfpack Coach Mike O'Cain. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke (8-2, 5-2), seeking its first nine-victory season since the 1941 Rose 
Bowl team, took advantage of three turnovers by Terry Harvey in the first half 
to build a 20-7 halftime lead.

FLORIDA STATE RUNS OVER NOTRE DAME, 23-16; NONCONFERENCE: DUNN AND PRESTON LEAD 
GROUND GAME THAT ACCOUNTS FOR 332 YARDS FOR SEMINOLES.

 No. 8-ranked Florida State had 332 of its 517 totals yards on the ground 
Saturday and handed Notre Dame its third loss in four games, 23-16. 
</P>
<P>
 Warrick Dunn rushed for 165 yards and Rock Preston 163 for the Seminoles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a long time since two guys had that many," said Notre Dame Coach 
Lou Holtz. "They broke a lot of tackles. They saw the seam." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Holtz: "I thought they'd throw the ball a little more." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunn, with his fifth 100-yard game of the season, needs only 144 yards to 
reach 1,000. Preston has 469 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunn's five-yard touchdown run with 2:53 to play was the game-winner. It was 
set up by a 49-yard pass play from Danny Kanell to Kez McCorvey on the first 
play from scrimmage after Notre Dame missed a chance to take the lead when 
Scott Cengia's extra-point attempt hit the left upright. 
</P>
<P>
 "From there on, we were fighting an uphill struggle," Holtz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said McCorvey, who caught six passes for 96 yards: "We practiced that play 
earlier in the week and knew we could do it. He threw the ball right there." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Kanell, who struggled most of the game, losing two fumbles and being 
sacked four times for 39 yards in losses: "When you can run the ball, it opens 
things up like the play action and the drop-back passing." 
</P>
<P>
 Kanell completed 14 of 27 passes for 185 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Buoyed by a brilliant defense, Florida State (8-1) kept alive its slim hopes 
of repeating as national champion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seminoles finish the season by playing against North Carolina State and 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame (5-4) managed only 211 yards, 73 passing, and was unable to do 
anything on its final two offensive series. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as you have Notre Dame's offense off the field, you're doing well," 
Florida State defensive end Derrick Alexander said. "We said they'd have to 
make adjustments to us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Irish tied the score, 16-16, with 5:17 left on an 11-yard pass from 
freshman quarterback Ron Powlus to Derrick Mayes on fourth and two before 
Cengia's missed conversion attempt. Mayes caught Powlus' pass in the corner of 
the end zone.

ARIZONA GOES FROM DESERT STORM TO DESERT SQUIRM; PACIFIC 10: WILDCATS' GRANITE 
DEFENSE TURNS TO SAND UNDER PRESSURE FROM USC PASSING GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 It was fun while it lasted. The clever play of words and war, the Sports 
Illustrated cover, the notoriety. 
</P>
<P>
 Desert Swarm had a nice run until Saturday but might now be retired. Not back 
to Tucson, but to Tombstone. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-five points and 550 yards will put holes in a Wild West legend faster 
than Billy the Kid. 
</P>
<P>
 USC's 45-28 victory over Arizona at the Coliseum did more than knock the 
Wildcats out of the Rose Bowl picture. It cut deep into a program's psyche. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just took us apart," Wildcat defensive back Spencer Wray said. "I would 
have never imagined that. I can't imagine that. It's just something we don't 
understand. They hit us with so many different receivers, five, six guys 
(seven, actually) got receptions, they just spread it around to whoever was 
open." 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't take long to become Desert Swarmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona began the game as the nation's sixth-best defense, first in rushing 
defense, second in points given up per game. 
</P>
<P>
 It left in tatters, unwilling to accept what had just happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "How many passing yards did they have?" one Wildcat wondered. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't like the answer: 434. USC totaled more than twice as many yards as 
Arizona surrenders on average per game. 
</P>
<P>
 Trojan quarterback Rob Johnson, in a short passing-game clinic, baffled the 
Arizona defense with his three-step drop and quick release. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we have trouble getting to the quarterback, it's hard for us, because of 
all the one-on-ones (coverages) out there in the way we play defense," Wildcat 
Coach Dick Tomey explained. "We blitzed a lot. We tried everything. There were 
no answers. The answer is players have got to make plays. And we didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 USC won most of the battles. The most compelling was the matchup between Tony 
Boselli, the Trojans' best tackle prospect since Anthony Munoz, and Arizona 
defensive end Tedy Bruschi, the Lombardi Award finalist. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruschi thought he held his own. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a tough battle all day," he said. "He did a good job, I think I did a 
good job." 
</P>
<P>
 Wait until Bruschi sees the film. 
</P>
<P>
 With the way Johnson was throwing, Arizona could only hope it could knock the 
Trojan quarterback out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 That Wildcat wish came true with 7:06 remaining, when Johnson reinjured his 
right ankle and hobbled off the field with USC leading by a touchdown, 35-28. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a glimmer of hope," Bruschi said. "The backup quarterback comes in, it 
was like, 'Let's see what he can do.' Then he throws a bomb to No. 3." 
</P>
<P>
 He was reserve Brad Otton, who came in cold off the bench and, on his first 
play, heaved a deep hanging pass for Keyshawn Johnson, who leaped above two 
defenders to complete a 43-yard reception at the Arizona 12. That set up 
Leonard Green's game-securing 11-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a tough day all around. Defending on Johnson's catch was Wray, who 
happens to be the receiver's cousin. 
</P>
<P>
 Wray said he'd discuss it later with Johnson at dinner. Look for Keyshawn, who 
finished with five catches for 109 yards, to do most of the talking. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-five points are the most Arizona has given up since 1991, when the 
Wildcats surrendered 54 to UCLA and Washington in consecutive weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was pre-Desert Swarm. Before running against Arizona was supposed to 
be like hurling yourself into cactus. Before a national magazine arranged 
players for a cover photo-shoot and proclaimed this bunch as the nation's best. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't have those expectations," said Tomey, whose team fell to 7-3 and 
now considers all bowls not beginning with Rose. "If you asked me if it was the 
goal to be the No. 1 team in the nation, it was not. We're just trying to win 
every week. The expectations were put on us by someone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Tomey said one game does not undo all that has been done. 
</P>
<P>
 "By no stretch of the imagination did we do what we were supposed to do," 
Tomey said. "But I wouldn't trade anybody in the world for this defense, 
either." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, neither would USC.

CAL DOES DAMAGE, STILL LOSES; PACIFIC 10: BARNES PASSES FOR 389 YARDS, BUT 
HUSKIES WIN, 31-19. 
</P>

<P>
 California's highly regarded sophomore quarterback, Pat Barnes, passed for 389 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Napoleon Kaufman, Washington's all-time rushing leader, re-injured the big toe 
on his left foot in the first half, did not play in the second and gained only 
11 yards in six carries. 
</P>
<P>
 But the No. 22-ranked Huskies turned four first-quarter turnovers into 20 
points for a 31-19 Pacific 10 Conference victory Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like the 'Nightmare on Elm Street,' " Cal Coach Keith Gilbertson said. 
"It's heartbreaking to see your team do so many good things and then turn the 
ball over so many times." 
</P>
<P>
 In the second start of his career, Barnes completed 33 of 44 passes and passed 
for two touchdowns. He had two passes intercepted. His touchdown passes came in 
the final 5:12. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second-best passing performance ever by a Cal quarterback. Rich 
Campbell passed for 421 yards against Florida in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stats are nice, but we've got to get a 'W,' " Barnes said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a disappointing final home game for Kaufman. He had his lowest rushing 
total since gaining 10 yards against Washington State as a freshman in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of hard to sit out the second half," Kaufman said. "But I can't 
complain much. I've broken almost every record they have here. I'm not going to 
hang my head because I'm very proud of what I've accomplished." 
</P>
<P>
 The Huskies, 7-3 overall and 4-3 in the Pac-10, handed the Bears (3-7, 2-5) 
their fifth consecutive loss, Cal's longest losing streak since 1986, when it 
lost eight in a row.

OREGON STATE PRIMED FOR SHOWDOWN; PACIFIC 10: BEAVERS GET READY FOR KEY GAME 
AGAINST OREGON BY DEFEATING WASHINGTON STATE, 21-3. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Oregon State served notice to Oregon that it won't be a pushover next 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon only needs a victory over Oregon State to win the Pacific 10 Conference 
title and earn a trip to the Rose Bowl, but the Ducks will have to do better 
against the Beavers' defense than No. 24 Washington State did Saturday in a 
21-3 loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beaver defense smothered the Cougars in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today there were two great defenses on the field," Oregon State linebacker 
Kane Rogers said. "It was a defensive game and whoever had the best defense was 
going to win. Today I think our defense was better." 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon State, 4-6 overall and 2-5 in the Pac 10, defeated the Cougars (6-4, 
4-3) for the first time since 1978 and avenged a 51-6 rout a year ago in 
Pullman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody was emotionally ready to play today more than any other game this 
year," defensive end Packy Ena said. "We had something to prove from last 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 The Beavers sacked Washington State quarterbacks eight times, five in the 
third quarter when Oregon State scored two touchdowns and held the Cougars to 
minus-30 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think we were particularly sky high for the game, but I thought we 
were ready enough to win it," Washington State Coach Mike Price said. "Then it 
got so close. We were in a fistfight and we had to deliver, but we didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars, coming off a 23-10 loss to USC that knocked them out of the Rose 
Bowl race, finished with minus-seven yards rushing and 134 yards overall.  
</P>
<P>
 "We got smacked last week against USC and then when we were down Oregon State 
came and kicked us in the jaw," Cougar wide receiver Jay Dumas said. "It 
hurts." 
</P>
<P>
 The Beavers' defense scored two touchdowns. They came on a 26-yard fumble 
return by Tom Holmes and a 47-yard interception return by Reggie Tongue. The 
18-point victory was Oregon State's biggest margin over a Pac-10 opponent in 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that Rocky Long, our defensive coordinator, put together the finest 
game plan I've seen in 29 years of coaching," Beaver Coach Jerry Pettibone 
said.

COMMENTARY; O'NEAL VS. EWING STIRS OLD GARDEN MEMORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE LUPICA, THE SPORTING NEWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was a moment early in the game when Shaquille O'Neal tried to spin to 
the baseline against Patrick Ewing, but Ewing took the baseline away from him. 
This was Madison Square Garden, which means Ewing's court. He stood his ground. 
He would not let O'Neal come into the Garden and treat him like some aging 
sparring partner. Now O'Neal gave up his dribble and Ewing seemed to surround 
him. It did not matter. O'Neal turned slightly away and pushed his own soft 
version of a hook shot toward the basket. The hook shot went in. Ewing has been 
the big man at the Garden for a long time. He had the position. O'Neal made him 
look small. More and more, even on nights when he comes up one basket short, 
Shaquille O'Neal does that to the rest of basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fifth row of seats, Red Holzman smiled. Suddenly, it was not the Garden 
of 1994 for Holzman, the Garden of 33rd Street and Eighth Avenue. This was the 
old Garden, and it was 1959, and Holzman was not looking at O'Neal, he was was 
looking at the young Wilt Chamberlain. 
</P>
<P>
 Holzman was a scout for the Knicks 35 years ago. He was asked the other night 
what he thought the first time he saw Wilt Chamberlain play. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to know what I thought?" Holzman said. "I thought I was having a 
nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
 The ball came back to O'Neal's end of the court. They gave it to him on the 
left side this time. He did not wait, he just turned and hit a soft jumper. 
Holzman nodded. "I feel the same way watching this kid," he said, his eyes on 
the court. "I feel like I'm having the same nightmare all over again." 
</P>
<P>
 Holzman had a rolled-up program in his hand, the way he always had a rolled-up 
program in his hand when he coached the Knicks against Wilt. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know what you wish for when you get to be my age?" Red Holzman said. "You 
want to see the old guys like Wilt go up against a kid like that." At the 
Knicks' end of the court, Ewing stepped back at the top of the key and O'Neal, 
who is lazy a lot of the time on defense, did not come out on him. Ewing, on 
his way to 16 points in the first half, made a jump shot of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 It went this way all night. It was O'Neal against Ewing at the Garden of 33rd 
St., and that was enough. The Knicks tried to put the game away several times 
but never could. O'Neal would end up with 41 points and 17 rebounds. His last 
basket, hard inside, tied the score at 99. Then Ewing won the game with a 
baseline jumper, a jumper out of the playoffs, from the right side with 2.4 
seconds left. The second week of November felt like the second week of June at 
the Garden. O'Neal did that to the night. 
</P>
<P>
 He is 7 feet, 1 inch tall and weighs over 300 pounds and can run and jump. 
This is only his third season, and even before the Magic have done anything in 
the playoffs, O'Neal seems to have become the biggest star in professional 
sports. Barry Bonds has never been the biggest sports star, even as he has 
played like one of the great baseball players of all time. Maybe Junior Griffey 
would have gotten there with 60 home runs, but baseball was called off. The 
biggest star from football is a whole team, the Dallas Cowboys. Magic Johnson 
is gone, Larry Bird is gone, Michael Jordan is a minor league baseball player. 
The stage has been left wide open, and Shaquille O'Neal, known as Shaq, has 
come crashing through the curtains to take it. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no real art in his game. There may never be. Wilt, at the beginning, 
was dunk shots and fall-away jump shots, and he missed even more free throws 
than O'Neal misses. Wednesday night, before he came to New York, O'Neal had 46 
points against the Hornets. There was a time in sports when the progression, 
even for people who became huge stars, went something like this: Talent, 
achievement, recognition, unbelievable riches. Now talent and recognition are 
enough to make you an international celebrity, before your team has ever won a 
playoff game. O'Neal sells his awful rap music, he sells soft drinks, he sells 
sneakers, he sells anything with his name and number on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Things change very fast in sports. A couple of weeks ago, there was an 
embarrassingly bad farewell television special for Jordan. The longer he stays 
in baseball, the quicker he will fade. In a few years, O'Neal will be as big 
with the kids as Jordan ever was. 
</P>
<P>
 "People love size," Chuck Daly was saying before the game. Daly, in the Hall 
of Fame as a coach, now works Thursday night NBA games for WTBS. "They love big 
action guys, and he's a big action guy. He comes crashing into the whole thing 
like it's a Schwarzenegger movie, like he's going to annihilate the backboard 
and everything else." 
</P>
<P>
 Behind Daly, O'Neal warmed up with a game of one-on-one against Horace Grant. 
O'Neal started backing in from the right side of the basket. Grant tried to 
throw his chest out and stop him that way. It was like trying to stop a school 
bus that way. O'Neal looked like he would back him all the way into the seats, 
but at the last second, he wheeled around Grant with a scoop shot. In the third 
quarter of the game, he would use the same kind of move against Anthony Mason, 
who had done a pretty good defensive job on Shaquille O'Neal up until then. 
</P>
<P>
 "I keep hearing that this is some kind of make-or-break year for this kid," 
Daly said. "Come on. He's a kid and he's learning all the time. He's not some 
hot dog. He's got a good demeanor, he's got a good work ethic. He plays hard 
every night. I mean, what the hell is there not to like? He's the player of the 
'90s." 
</P>
<P>
 He has not won anything yet. Neither had Jordan when he was in his third year. 
The Magic try to build around him with talented young players like Anfernee 
Hardaway and Nick Anderson. If they do not make it to The NBA Finals this 
season, it will be next season, or the season after that. The things about 
basketball O'Neal does not yet know, he can learn, because he seems willing to 
learn, and willing to work. And with speed, strength and youth, at 7-1 and 300 
pounds, he comes in as the new Wilt. 
</P>
<P>
 "And this kid is much further along than Wilt was when Wilt first came into 
the league," Red Holzman said later. 
</P>
<P>
 This was only the third game of the season for the Knicks. O'Neal and the 
Magic coming into the Garden made it feel like much more. This was not a game 
that made you think about the long regular season to come. This was a game that 
felt like it belonged in the playoffs, or in a pennant race, or a fight for 
first place in the Atlantic Division. O'Neal vs. Ewing did that, O'Neal vs. the 
Knicks did that, O'Neal in New York did that.

 Fred Couples and Davis Love III moved one round closer to knocking Jack 
Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer out of the record books at the World Cup of Golf.

<P>
 Couples, who had a third-round 68, and Love, who shot 69, lost four strokes 
off their lead as the U.S. representative in the 32-country field at Dorado 
Beach, Puerto Rico, but it was still nine shots to second-place Zimbabwe. 
</P>
<P>
 Couples and Love were 34 under par after three trips around the Hyatt Dorado 
Beach east course. They are looking for their third consecutive title in the 
event and that would break their tie with Nicklaus and Palmer, who combined to 
win the title in 1962 and 1963.

 Michael Schumacher won the Formula One championship today when he and 
archrival Damon Hill were involved in a crash on Lap 36 of the Australian Grand 
Prix. 
</P>
<P>
 The 25-year-old German was leading the race when Hill tried to overtake him on 
the inside and clipped the side of Schumacher's car.

 Schumacher became the first German to win the Formula One championship and the 
youngest champion since Emerson Fittipaldi in 1972.

 Pasadena Muir High erased a five-point halftime deficit and defeated Pasadena, 
34-20, Saturday in the 41st annual Turkey Tussle game in front of about 15,000 
at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs, ranked 11th by The Times, will enter the Southern Section 
Division II playoffs with an 8-2 record and a Pacific League title after going 
undefeated in five league games.Pasadena, ranked 19th, finishes at 7-3 and 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a crazy year," said Muir Coach Mike Harrison, whose team has won 
all six of its games since he took over the coaching duties from Jack Allen. 
"We don't have any stars on this team -- just a bunch of kids who come to play 
every week." 
</P>
<P>
 Muir, trailing, 14-9, at the half, took a 15-14 lead with 10:33 remaining in 
the third quarter when Michael Hughes scored on a six-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs never trailed after that, although the Bulldogs had a chance to 
get close with 2:44 remaining in the game and Muir holding a 28-20 lead. But 
Pasadena quarterback Chris McAlister was stopped on a fourth and two on the 
Muir 21-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 Muir's Charles Dunn put the game away moments later with a 62-yard touchdown 
run. MARK STRODER

HOLLYWOOD PARK; URBANE TAKES MOCCASIN IN STRIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Going from victory in a maiden claimer to success in a stakes is a parlay 
trainer Brian Mayberry and owners Jan, Mace and Samantha Siegel had pulled off 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Zealous Connection followed a victory over $50,000 rivals with 
a convincing score in the Landaluce. 
</P>
<P>
 A month after Urbane won her debut by seven lengths for the same $50,000 price 
tag, the 2-year-old Citidancer filly rolled home by 3 1/2 lengths in the 
$79,100 Moccasin Stakes Saturday at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Closest to 7-5 favorite and runaway pacesetter Inthefastlane early, Urbane, 
the second longest shot in the field of five at 5-1, got the lead approaching 
the sixteenth pole and drew away. She completed the seven furlongs in a 
stakes-record 1:21 3/5 under Corey Black. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean Cat, the 17-10 second choice, was 3 1/2 lengths in front of 
Inthefastlane, who fell apart after leading through a :44 4/5 half-mile and a 
1:09 1/5 six furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Martial Reward, breaking her maiden in her 14th try, triggered a record 
superfecta payoff in the ninth race Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Trained by Ruben Cosme and ridden by John Atherton, the 3-year-old Martial Law 
filly paid $176.20 and was followed across the wire by 24-1 shot Monarchs 
Latinlady, 5-2 third choice Natural Value and 34-1 outsider Who The Heck Cares. 
</P>
<P>
 The superfecta, which requires a bettor to pick the first four finishers, paid 
$190,769.80. There was only one ticket with the 12-4-10-8 combination and it 
was purchased at Atlantic City. The previous record for a superfecta at 
Hollywood Park was $59,487.60 on July 25, 1993. Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 In something of a surprise, trainer Wayne Lukas said Breeders' Cup Classic 
runner-up Tabasco Cat will run in the $400,000 Hollywood Derby a week from 
today. The Derby will be Tabasco Cat's 12th start of the year and he has been 
worse than third only once. Included in his five victories are the Preakness 
and Belmont Stakes and his second behind Concern in the Breeders' Cup pushed 
his 1994 earnings to $2,164,334. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a two-day carryover of $261,909.93 in the Pick Six.

BACKGROUND SHOULD SERVE MIJARES WELL; SANTA ANA SCHOOLS CHIEF HAS RIGHT SKILLS 
FOR TOUGH JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A reading of the resume of the new superintendent of the Santa Ana school 
system, Alfred Mijares, shows that he has a master's degree and doctorate not 
in education, but in social welfare and social work. That background could 
serve him well in his new job. 
</P>
<P>
 All school districts confront the problem of teaching the children within 
their classrooms. But the Santa Ana Unified School District, more than most, 
faces difficulties in getting students into the classroom to begin with, and in 
keeping them there. Mijares' predecessor, Rudy Castruita, had much of the 
social worker in his makeup, and it was one reason he did so well. 
</P>
<P>
 Castruita once noted that if children were coming to school hungry, the school 
needed a breakfast program. If they were coming without inoculations, or with 
diseases, then the school needed a health program. Castruita played social 
worker as much as educator in cajoling parents to keep their children in school 
and support their studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Castruita left for San Diego last summer, and Mijares is due around Jan. 1 to 
assume the job of superintendent. His credentials are impressive, his 
recommendations good, his talents apparent. 
</P>
<P>
 In a district where 87% of the students are Latino, many of them immigrants or 
children of immigrants from Mexico, it is fitting that the superintendent 
should share that ethnic background. He can talk to students in Spanish as well 
as English, and nearly 75% of all the students have a native language other 
than English. Mijares said the demographics of the district will enable him "to 
lead and take risks." That is a good attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 We hope that he is in Santa Ana for the long haul, for his tendency to leave 
school districts quickly is one troublesome note in his work history. He was 
superintendent in Coachella Valley Unified, near Indio, for only three years. 
He will have been the Bakersfield superintendent only two years. Castruita was 
in Santa Ana over six years, and it would be good if Mijares can stay even 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Support from the Santa Ana school board could help achieve that goal. The 
unanimous vote of the five board members to hire Mijares was impressive, and 
surprising. The board too often has seemed permanently split along 3-2 lines; 
although Castruita said the split was not a factor in his departure, several of 
his friends said divisions on the board wore him down. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Castruita's achievements was leading the school system in reducing the 
dropout rate dramatically, from more than 40% in 1986, not long before his 
arrival, to 16.2% several years later. Mijares will need to keep the dropout 
rate low and take the next step, improving students' test scores and education. 
 
</P>
<P>
 He also will have to cope with the aftermath of Proposition 187, which would 
deny education to children who are in the country illegally, by assuring 
parents that their children are safe at school while the issue is in the 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees wisely said they do not expect Mijares to be a clone of Castruita. He 
will need time to learn the district and to bring his own style of 
administration. But he also must be ready for a daunting task: Santa Ana has 
more than 48,000 students, nearly twice as many as in Bakersfield. If he can 
get the support and praise in Santa Ana that he won in Bakersfield, the 
district can continue to improve.

TAKING BACK NEIGHBORHOODS BY THE BLOCK; PRAISEWORTHY ORANGE COUNTY TOGETHER 
DISHES OUT MORE OF SAME TO DESERVING GROUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Block by block, neighborhood by neighborhood, Orange County residents have 
fought back against gangs, criminals and the fear they cause. In a number of 
cities, residents and police have scored notable successes worthy of 
recognition and praise. 
</P>
<P>
 The group Orange County Together, which deserves praise itself, gave awards to 
individuals and police last month as a way to encourage community policing. 
That concept centers on neighborhood involvement, getting police out of cars to 
talk to residents and learn what is going on, and getting help from government 
agencies to help cure problems. 
</P>
<P>
 One honoree was Elodia Gonzalez, who once was afraid to clean up her Anaheim 
yard because she knew drug peddlers and their friends had used it as a dumping 
ground for syringes and condoms. But Gonzalez pounded on the doors of City Hall 
and got help and energy from Orange County Congregation Community Organization, 
a church-based coalition of community groups that has been active in getting 
neighborhoods to organize. She persuaded 10 of her neighbors to speak out at a 
meeting with city officials, overcoming fear of gang retribution. 
</P>
<P>
 The next week police assigned a community action team to Gonzalez' 
neighborhood. Crime rates went down, the drug dealers disappeared, and Gonzalez 
became less fearful of letting her two daughters go outside her home. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove police won an award as well, which they shared with a residents' 
group that began a newsletter and organized tenants and landlords to start 
improving a crime-ridden street, Stuart Drive. Garden Grove had already won a 
$660,000 federal grant for community policing, and used some of those funds to 
expand a police officer's effort to improve the Stuart Drive area. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Together was founded after the 1992 Los Angeles riots. Cobbled 
together by the Orange County Human Relations Commission and United Way of 
Orange County, funded by county businesses, the group has done good work in 
identifying the county's problems and trying to find solutions. The awards are 
a good example of that work. They are deserved recognition that police need 
help from the community and that although much work remains to be done, the 
efforts thus far are appreciated.

 I'm afraid Stephen Moore (Letters, Nov. 6) needs a local history lesson. In 
his foolish call for partisanship in city elections, Moore falsely points to 
what he calls my "antics and efforts" as mayor to make Irvine a "nuclear-free 
zone."One problem: I never proposed that Irvine be a nuclear-free zone. 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, my "antics and efforts" as mayor did produce the following for 
Irvine: an open-space preservation program ratified by more than 80% of 
Irvine's voters; curbside recycling; the toughest toxics and pollution controls 
in the country; special housing and transportation programs for the elderly and 
disabled; stepped-up support for our police; investment in earthquake and 
emergency preparedness; award-winning child-care programs; and an end to salary 
discrimination against women in local government. 
</P>
<P>
 Incidentally, we accomplished these things while cutting waste, setting aside 
a multimillion-dollar "rainy day" reserve, and earning the highest bond rating 
for any city our size in California. All of these achievements involved 
Republicans, Democrats and Independents setting aside partisanship and joining 
together for the good of our city.

 Rudy Domenie's description of his encounter with the ferocious rabbits of 
Leisure World ("Not Everyone Adores Rabbits," Letters, Oct. 30) would be 
amusing if it were not so idiotic. He describes that he actually observed four 
-- count them, FOUR -- wild rabbits on his neighbor's lawn and three on his 
lawn every evening.Undoubtedly from the tone of his letter this has caused him 
deep distress. The rabbits could be shot to provide sport for those who enjoy 
hunting, but the possibility of hitting a resident who is picking up his 
morning Times might be a detriment. Better yet, set over 100 traps, spread 
enough poison to kill an elephant to be quite sure that the rabbit dies very, 
very slowly over a period of at least eight days. That will show the little 
rotter just who runs this world, or at least this Leisure World. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps someday someone will be kind enough to explain to me why people pour 
into California, both to work and to retire, and then complain of, and destroy, 
the very things that brought them to California in the first place. Yes, we 
have wild rabbits, as well as very wild coyotes, snakes, mountain lions and 
bears, to name a few. They are all very dangerous, although I've never heard of 
an attack rabbit. We have taken over their space and they seem to be taking 
exception to it. If rabbits cause you fear and frustration, please stay out of 
our wooded areas. Better still, why not consider leaving California?

A PRUDENT REALITY CHECK IN FANTASY LAND; THERE CAN BE NO QUARREL WITH A MORE 
MODEST DISNEYLAND EXPANSION IN THIS ECONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael Eisner's recent update on the Westcot project 
at Disneyland was not all that might have been hoped for, but it was not all 
that it might have been on the negative side, either.  
</P>
<P>
 In announcing that the scale of the project was being reconsidered, Eisner was 
vague on specifics, but at least left the impression that the company was 
looking for an economically feasible way to do the project. For some time, it 
has been relegated to limbo status, leaving Anaheim and the region uncertain as 
to how to plan. It could have been worse; Eisner might have announced that the 
company was abandoning the project altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea that there will be something rather than nothing was reinforced by 
the subsequent announcement that Paul Pressler, the head of the company's 
Disney Stores division, had been appointed president of Disneyland. Pressler 
has overseen considerable growth in the stores and was described by the 
chairman as a "star executive" within the company. 
</P>
<P>
 There can be no real quarrel with a more modest plan for the expansion in view 
of the general economic climate. In his remarks this month, Eisner acknowledged 
that the company was still smarting from the more than $550 million in losses 
from Euro Disneyland in France. It is hard to argue with the assessment that it 
might be wiser to go forward in increments rather than trying to take on a 
colossal project.  
</P>
<P>
 The city of Anaheim continues to handle the frustrating uncertainty as well as 
can be expected. It has made its own wise decision about the need to go ahead 
with urban renovation in the Disneyland area as an investment in its future. 
The company's outstanding demand for $800 million in financial support from the 
city, Orange County, and state and federal agencies still must be resolved, and 
the city has to mind its pocketbook.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the comments on the new project, it was heartening to hear an 
affirmation of the company's commitment to the core Disneyland enterprise. 
Eisner said that the company was going to continue putting money in. "We're 
never going to let Disneyland become an aging theme park," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the company has spread in many directions, Disneyland remains an 
important part of the Orange County economy and a draw for tourism. Building on 
what has worked in the past makes sense in a changing environment. If it means 
going ahead with the new project in a less ambitious way, so be it. This is a 
time for realistic assessments.

LAS PALMAS SCHOOL IS LIKELY TO EXCEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I read with great interest your "Checking It Out," (Oct. 18). The lead -- in 
which it was stated, "The next Bobby Fischer could come from an unlikely place 
. . .," however, left me, frankly, perplexed. 
</P>
<P>
 For those of us who have endured the arduous task of researching, interviewing 
and evaluating every school from the south Orange County border to the San 
Diego County line, a club of this caliber being established at Las Palmas 
School is anything but unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 When I chose Las Palmas School for my daughter's elementary education, its 
commitment to intellectual-based extracurricular activities -- such as the 
chess club (the next nearest club is in Long Beach), a creative writers club, 
and the school newspaper, which is written and produced on a voluntary basis by 
53 of the school's 60 sixth-graders in cooperation with the local media, 
private enterprise and Saddleback College -- were but a few of the many 
attributes this school offers that others in our area -- public or private -- 
simply do not. 
</P>
<P>
 Las Palmas also boasts an impressive two-way language immersion program, the 
envy of other immersion programs throughout the country, which, like Las 
Palmas, strive to better equip children whose educational needs are 
increasingly more global. 
</P>
<P>
 Other qualities tops on my list include a principal whose vision and 
leadership capabilities clearly articulate a student-centered plan of 
excellence. I am continually impressed by teachers who not only envelop my 
child in love on a daily basis, but who also have the professional commitment 
to implement extensive educational programs.  
</P>
<P>
 True, Las Palmas Elementary School, founded in 1927 as the original San 
Clemente Grammar School, is the oldest in its district. And while our buildings 
may be in need of fresh coats of paint, our halls are rich in the history and 
tradition we share with generations of San Clementians.

TAKING A CLOSER LOOK AT SOBERING MESSAGES FROM VOTING MAJORITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wow! Now the Grand Old Party can give us what we want! Right! 
</P>
<P>
 1. Term limits. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Line-item veto. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Balanced budget. 
</P>
<P>
 4. No more illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Not much to expect, or is it? Well, we could see more changes in 1996. Let's 
see which congressmen will be the first to put any one of these bills on the 
House floor. Is it going to be Dornan, Royce, Cox, Rohrabacher, Kim or Packard? 
Let's see how strong these congressmen from Orange County really are. 
</P>
<P>
 Or is this the shoo-in for President Clinton in 1996? 
</P>

<P>
 * For a long time, we Republicans have been saying, give us a chance. Throw 
the "bad" guys out (which didn't necessarily mean Democrats). 
</P>
<P>
 Well, we have thrown out the "bad" guys. We now have our chance. The 
Republicans had better come through -- or the Chicago Cubs will get to the 
World Series before the Republicans get another chance. 
</P>

 * Several conclusions can be drawn from the elections for Orange County school 
boards. First, it will be a long, hard road for conservatives to defeat the 
teachers unions' political and financial firepower; although countywide the 
unions had to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars, in the middle of a 
conservative Republican landslide voters elected liberal Democrats to school 
boards. Very impressive. Of course, the unions get away with buying school 
boards because the media has no desire to report on the huge sums spent by 
school district teachers unions to elect school boards who agree with the 
unions' views on teacher compensation, contract conditions and curriculum. One 
reporter I talked with dismissed this topic as "old news" that "everyone 
knows." 
</P>
<P>
 Second, the education Establishment's McCarthyite smear campaign may have 
worked, pending post-election analysis. This tactic will be used until 
candidates who feel they are subjected to unwarranted personal attacks based on 
their religious beliefs file civil rights lawsuits. Here, again, the media 
aided and abetted. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, if we want to take control of the schools away from the teachers 
unions, maybe we'll have to do an end-run around them. Perhaps a state ballot 
initiative banning contributions or independent expenditures by public employee 
unions in elections for public employer trustee positions (school boards, city 
councils).

 * Orange County comes through again. Business as usual. Electing Dana 
Rohrabacher (to Congress) over Brett Williamson. Do people have their heads in 
the sand? Do they follow Rohrabacher's activities/accomplishments or lack 
thereof? What a shame for us. What a waste. 
</P>
<P>
 I've lived in Orange County for 30 years. I love the area, have many really 
good people as friends here -- but the politics suck! I just cringe when I read 
about locals gushing over the likes of Mike Huffington.  
</P>
<P>
 Oh well, I can take solace in knowing that the next two years will be 
blissful. The Republicans will fix all our county's and nation's ills. I can 
rest assured in that.

<P>
 ANNETTE COOPER

</P>
<P>
 * Los Angeles' Cardinal Roger Mahony was the most audible voice of opposition 
on Proposition 187. Since the Catholic Church is taking such a voice of 
opposition, it should also assume a much greater position of responsibility in 
caring for these illegal immigrants that are abusing our hard-earned tax 
dollars for social services that a legal California resident has provided. 
</P>
<P>
 The very real problem of illegal immigration manifests itself in people 
fleeing countries of oppression. The Catholic Church would better serve the 
legal immigrants in California by effecting positive change in countries where 
exploding populations are accompanied by illiteracy. 
</P>
<P>
 When these people illegally enter California and the Catholic Church continues 
to encourage this process, hold the Catholic Church solely responsible for 
providing medical services and educational instruction in privately funded 
Catholic hospitals and schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal California residents have spoken. Proposition 187 has passed. Los 
Angeles Cardinal Mahony and the Catholic Church should either assume greater 
responsibility for this concern or agree with the legal voting majority. 
</P>

 DONALD C. COLLIE

<P>
 * I vote in each election. However, I sympathize with the informed "non-voter" 
as an expression of protest.  
</P>
<P>
 Our form of government is an oligarchy masquerading as a democracy. 
Essentially, a voter has the choice between two "Establishment-sponsored 
candidates." 
</P>
<P>
 We have a one-party system. Democrat and Republican parties are distinguished 
only in form, not in substance. All major communications are owned by an 
increasingly small number of entities. 
</P>
<P>
 What is needed is true democracy instigated by 100% equal financing (equal 
time) of all political candidates, including minority parties. Until then, no 
meaningful reforms will occur toward fair taxation, medical care, crime, 
education, housing, and those multitude of problems in need of attention.

 * The passage of Proposition 187 has sent a message -- that the majority of 
voters in California are mean-spirited and shortsighted. It would be 
interesting if these "illegals" could withhold their labors and their spending 
power from this society for about a month. Including rents.

TAX-FUNDED STUDY OF RICH A POOR IDEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Professors spending a $300,000 grant to see if the instant rich are happy and 
working ("$300,000 Study to Yield Wealth of Data on the Rich," Nov. 8)? 
Instead, why don't they have their graduate students in psychology and 
sociology do a joint thesis on "The Instant Rich Versus the Protestant Work 
Ethic." The $300,000 grant could be used to shelter, clothe and immediately 
employ homeless families. The same students could then study the effects on the 
necessities of life and self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 SUSAN KNIGHT

<P>
 * Wow! So that's where our tax money goes; $300,000 in federal money to study 
the lifestyles of the rich and famous. How urgent -- national security and all 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 Why not ask Geraldo, Robin Leach or "60 Minutes" to do it at their expense? If 
this interesting research is really urgent, the California Lottery could pay 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
 The $300,000 was reported to result in 400 interviews -- at $750 per I hope 
it's more than a questionnaire in the mail. Not to criticize the distinguished 
faculty (4) who scoop up $75,000 each, but let's add a few interviews with the 
geniuses at National Science Foundation who doled out our tax dough. 
</P>
<P>
 PAUL ARTHUR

 RICHARD SHOWSTACK

<P>
 Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
 * Talk about modern-day Frankenstein, the thought of Eric Smith ("Boy, 14, 
Sentenced to 9 Years in Prison for Killing Child," Nov. 8) leaving prison 
frightens me. After spending puberty and the first two years of adulthood in 
prison, Eric will have only learned better ways to break the law and new 
methods of killing and torture. Throughout his productive nine-year term, 
taxpayers will have paid approximately $25,000 per year for his room, board and 
"education," as we do for all criminals currently in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 While Eric is waiting to be released, the federal government's National 
Science Foundation has granted $300,000 to the study of wealth and its impact 
on people who have won the lottery. 
</P>
<P>
 Am I the only one who doesn't understand the priorities here? More than a 
slight probability exists that those waiting on Death Row or sentenced to life 
in prison have demonstrated the same murderous tendencies as Eric Smith when 
they were 13. I would feel a lot safer at night if our government granted 
funding to the study of "intermittent explosive disorder" rather than whether 
money can buy happiness. If we were ever to invest any time, energy or funding 
into criminal analysis, perhaps we could prevent the evolution of monsters 
rather than allow the creation of more.

A DEEPER LOOK AT COUNTY TAX GLITCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This letter is a response to the article "Officials Fume Over Tax Glitch" 
(Oct. 26). 
</P>
<P>
 I am a tax agent and work on the side of the property owners. 
</P>
<P>
 However, I believe your indictment of the county officials is exaggerated, and 
the $1.7 million you claim the county lost is blatantly overstated. 
</P>
<P>
 A little closer look at the situation and you could have come to that 
conclusion yourself: 
</P>
<P>
 * When the property owners filed their appeals, they believed the assessed 
value was higher than the market value, which means they believed the county 
was collecting too much tax to begin with. 
</P>
<P>
 * Even if the appeals had been scheduled within the two-year deadline, the 
vast majority would have had their assessed values reduced to some extent 
anyway. Maybe not as low as the amount requested, but nevertheless the values 
would have been lowered. And many likely would have received the values they 
requested. 
</P>
<P>
 Had you been more thorough in your investigation, the $1.7 million would have 
been significantly reduced (but of course that would have diminished the impact 
of your "story"). 
</P>
<P>
 I acknowledge that some mistakes were made by the county. 
</P>
<P>
 However, I believe your inaccurate characterization of the amounts involved is 
a significant mistake, which could have been avoided with a little more 
professional journalistic scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 Who is going to write the headline story about your mistakes? 
</P>
<P>
 BARRY GARCIA 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
 $10.7 million! That's the amount The Times reported has been lost to the 
Orange County coffers because "somehow" tax assessment protests were allowed to 
lapse. 
</P>
<P>
 The county assessor and (appeals board) clerk are pointing fingers at each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 The tragedy and irony is that $10.7 million is almost exactly the amount the 
county library system needs to restore reductions in library hours, staff and 
books. 
</P>
<P>
 So, who will suffer? Not the ones responsible, but Orange County library 
patrons!

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gus Owen is perched this morning on what Lyndon Johnson liked to call the 
"catbird seat." 
</P>
<P>
 He is a longtime friend of House Speaker-in-waiting Newt Gingrich, and his 
confirmation to the Interstate Commerce Commission was backed by Bob Dole, new 
leader of the Senate. And let us not forget that Owen's wife, developer Kathryn 
Thompson, is a confidante of President Bill Clinton. Through hard work, 
patience and not a little moxie, the Owen-Thompson clan is well placed indeed 
following Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
 For local Republican stalwarts like Owen, former head of the GOP's powerful 
Lincoln Club, last Wednesday morning dawned sweet indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican Jim Morrisey's election to the state Assembly means that not an 
inch of Orange County will be represented in the state Legislature by a 
Democrat. Other than a few months after former state Sen. Paul Carpenter 
resigned to join the State Board of Equalization, it's the first time no 
Democrat has had a voice for at least some corner or strip of Orange County 
since 1956 -- and even then there was a vacant seat, later filled by a 
Democrat. In fact, it has been 51 years since every one of the county's 
legislative offices was filled by the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Silva, who worked his way up from relative obscurity to become a county 
supervisor, keeps all five (putatively nonpartisan) board seats squarely 
Republican. With all local congressional offices held by conservative 
Republicans and a 100% Republican Board of Supervisors, it may be the first 
time ever that all elected officials above the city level are Republican. We 
have finally lived up to our national reputation as undiluted Republican 
territory. Small comfort for the four out of 10 residents who call themselves 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Newt Gingrich's ascendancy in Congress has profound implications for Orange 
County. We're not used to having members of Congress who can actually shape 
legislation, since the GOP has been out of power in the House for 40 years. 
When we needed help with major public works, county business people turned to 
Los Angeles' Rep. Glen Anderson, a Democrat, to shepherd bills through the 
House. 
</P>
<P>
 All that has changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach's Rep. Christopher Cox is widely regarded as one of the smartest 
and wisest on the Republican back bench. Cox is a former deputy White House 
counsel to Ronald Reagan, an expert on Eastern Europe and Russia and a budget 
hawk. Since he took office, he has published an annual report on the federal 
government similar to what a corporation gives its stockholders. Look for Cox 
to now get his annual report published nationally. And, hopefully, Cox will 
also succeed in his persistent efforts to roll back the 100% increase in beer 
taxes that George Bush and a Democratically controlled Congress rammed through 
in 1991. Dana Rohrabacher, with a scythe-like pen sharpened as a writer for 
Ronald Reagan, will also play a key role in the new House whether or not he 
receives a titled post. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, GOP gains in the Congress may be good news for one Clinton 
Administration figure -- Laguna Beach's Roger Johnson, head of the General 
Services Administration and the highest-ranking Republican on the Clinton team. 
Johnson has faced great frustration trying to reinvent the federal government 
but often meeting roadblocks from at least one powerful Democratic committee 
chair -- former chair, that is. Johnson has Clinton's confidence, and he could 
become a major resource for the President's people as they grapple with the new 
realities of Sodom on the Potomac in the days of Newt and Bob. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County also gained huge prestige through the reelection of Gov. Pete 
Wilson. Wilson, the West Coast "Comeback Kid," turned to Orange County for a 
major share of his margin of victory and for plenty of financial support. 
Visionary landowner Donald Bren trained with Wilson in the Marine Corps and has 
played an important role in every one of the governor's elections. California 
Secretary of Commerce Julie Wright, from Mission Viejo, would be a strong 
favorite for a Cabinet post in a national Wilson Administration, and county 
Supervisors Gaddi H. Vasquez and William G. Steiner would undoubtedly be tapped 
for major posts as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Did I mention a federal Administration headed by Pete Wilson? 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Nixon -- probably the smartest political consultant ever -- predicted 
shortly before his death that Wilson would win reelection as governor, go on to 
win the GOP nomination for President, then win the whole banana in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 It's far from impossible. While many Orange County Republicans (your erstwhile 
correspondent proudly included) abandoned George Bush in favor of Bill Clinton, 
Pete Wilson held loyalty from the vast majority of us. Through his years as a 
mayor, a state legislator, a U.S. senator and a governor, Wilson has always 
appealed to the mainstream, not to the fringes where hatred breeds and 
elections are lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider this scenario: Favorite son Pete Wilson wins all of California's 
Republican delegate votes in the March, 1996, winner-take-all primary. As the 
champion of Proposition 187, he takes his anti-illegal-immigrant message to 
vote-rich Texas and Florida, states facing immigration issues similar to our 
own. He picks up big numbers of delegates in these and other 
proportional-representation states, though his moderate views make him a 
front-runner nowhere. At the convention, Wilson and longtime friend and former 
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney cut a deal to join their delegates, with Wilson 
as the nominee for President and Cheney as vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 The man to arrange the deal is Stu Spencer of Newport Beach. Spencer, 
mastermind of Ronald Reagan's presidential campaigns, met Wilson when the 
latter served as an advance person for Richard Nixon's 1960 campaign. He has 
been a close adviser and friend of the governor since Wilson first ran for the 
state Assembly 30 years ago. Spencer worked with Cheney in the Gerald Ford 
White House, and they have been friends and political allies since. If anyone 
could broker this kind of long-term plan, it is Spencer; and Stu is probably 
the best handler to put the game together against President Clinton's back-room 
expert, James Carville. 
</P>
<P>
 It could happen. Or not. 
</P>
<P>
 If Wilson becomes President, Democrat Gray Davis becomes governor in his place 
-- not necessarily bad news, considering Davis' strong working relationship 
with most of California's major employers, but a tough issue for Wilson to 
discuss with some party loyalists. 
</P>
<P>
 There were huge Republican gains throughout the state, which could result in 
the end of Willie Brown's historic tenure as Speaker of the state Assembly. It 
would be ironic indeed if Brown were to be unseated just as he has built a 
working relationship with Wilson and much of the business community to reform 
workers' compensation and corporate tax laws and help keep companies like Taco 
Bell in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the GOP swept the field for most of the state constitutional 
offices, voters rejected two Republican extremists, lieutenant governor hopeful 
Cathie Wright and state controller nominee Tom McClintock. Unlike Wilson, 
Wright and McClintock are anti-choice and anti-gay and favor government funding 
of religious schools. Just as voters in Virginia wisely rejected Ollie North, 
so did Californians pick moderate Democrat Dianne Feinstein for the U.S. Senate 
and two qualified moderate Democrats for important state posts rather than make 
a hard right turn with McClintock and Wright. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all the Republican gains, there were warning signs for the GOP that 
voters are not the fools that some people seem to believe. A Republican once 
said, "You can't fool all the people all the time." Someone should have 
mentioned this to Mike Huffington, whose campaign was headed by former Orange 
County Supervisor Bruce Nestande. 
</P>
<P>
 Not since William Randolph Hearst tried to buy his way into the Senate has 
anyone attempted such a shameless scheme to purchase high office. 
</P>
<P>
 At least Hearst was a Californian.

WORKING TOGETHER ON WETLANDS ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Bolsa Chica Alliance is very pleased that the county has heard our 
comments regarding the tidal inlet. ("County Planners Offer 3rd Plan for 
Wetlands," Nov. 7). We believe that the county's third option is the best 
alternative because it has addressed the concern of density while allowing for 
a tidal inlet to create a superior wetlands restoration. 
</P>
<P>
 The opposition continues to state that this inlet will pollute the ocean. Yet 
it's a known fact that the wetlands will act as a natural filtration system for 
the flood control system; the jetties and revetments will actually help prevent 
further erosion of the Huntington cliffs, and the inlet will solve the flooding 
problem that forces closure of Pacific Coast Highway during the rains. 
</P>
<P>
 We congratulate the staff for their foresight to come up with this 
alternative. Now let's approve it and get started. 
</P>
<P>
 PAM JULIEN 
</P>
<P>
 President, Bolsa Chica Alliance 
</P>
<P>
 * On Oct. 25, you published an article entitled "Huntington Beach Preparing 
Own Plan for Bolsa Chica." The article included a comment made by the president 
of the Amigos de Bolsa Chica, that ". . . the wetlands undeveloped was 
tantamount to having the council members bury their heads in the sand." He is 
additionally quoted as saying "We (i.e., Amigos de Bolsa Chica) think the city 
needs to be realistically addressing the possibility of development." 
</P>
<P>
 We find it incredible that the Amigos de Bolsa Chica still call themselves 
"Amigos," Spanish for friends, when they support some form of development on 
this ecosystem. We suggest that they reconsider their stand, change their name 
to something more descriptive, or both.  
</P>
<P>
 Neither logic nor scientific fact support a stand for housing development. 
Scientists know that urban runoff from housing poisons kills wetlands 
vegetation, which is a habitat for endangered wildlife species. It does not 
matter whether you build above or on the wetlands. The runoff, cat and dog 
pets, traffic noise and toxic exhaust fumes will destroy the wildlife species 
that are to be protected under federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 The Amigos have done important work in prior years. Only recently has their 
leadership compromised the public's wishes and that of many of their members 
for preservation without development. Let's reason together about what is best 
and what ought to be.

<P>
 * I would like to applaud the county of Orange on its professionalism and 
decorum during the Bolsa Chica hearings. It was refreshing to hear positive 
comments for a change when dealing with a public entity. All too often, and 
particularly on this issue, we hear only negative responses and complaints 
about attitude, unreasonable positions and unwillingness on the part of the 
governmental officials to be objective when considering issues.

REDEVELOPMENT WORKS IN FULLERTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The limitations of space prevent a point-by-point rebuttal of Councilman Chris 
Norby's distortions and misstatements (to put it politely) about redevelopment 
in Fullerton (Letters, Oct. 30). 
</P>
<P>
 But a few are so bizarre they need immediate correction. 
</P>
<P>
 Norby calls Loehmann's the anchor store of the Metro Center. This is absurd. 
To name but two, Montgomery Ward and Sportmart do much more business, and 
Loehmann's has been there only two years. As for Norby's statement that there 
was no net gain of sales tax revenue to Fullerton because the store only moved 
from another location in the city: Is he saying that Loehmann's generates no 
more sales volume at its present high-traffic location than it did at its 
previous isolated locations? That simply isn't so. 
</P>
<P>
 Does Norby want Fullerton to step aside and allow other cities and counties to 
take the businesses that have made it possible for homeowners to enjoy splendid 
police and fire protection and the other amenities of a fine city for so many 
years without any significant increased costs? It sounds like Norby is more 
interested in trashing government than in finding practicable solutions that 
benefit taxpayers.

 Other cities may have had problems with redevelopment. But it works in 
Fullerton, and it works very well indeed.

 Ismail Abdullah scored two second-half touchdowns as El Dorado gained a share 
of the Empire League championship with a 17-3 victory over Loara Saturday night 
at Valencia High. 
</P>
<P>
 With the victory, El Dorado (6-4, 4-1) tied Century for the league title. 
Century will receive the league's top seeding in the Division V playoffs by 
virtue of its 6-3 victory over El Dorado. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy will receive the third playoff berth, but Loara (4-6, 3-2) must wait 
to see if it receives a wild-card berth. 
</P>
<P>
 Abdullah broke a 3-3 halftime tie by scoring on a four-yard run with 3 minutes 
7 seconds left in the third quarter, giving the Golden Hawks a 10-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Abdullah then clinched the game in the fourth quarter. He fielded a punt at 
Loara's 44, weaved through coverage and scored with 6:42 left. 
</P>
<P>
 El Dorado outgained Loara, 252 yards to 138. Abdullah led the Golden Hawks 
with 97 yards in 13 carries, and David Myers added 95 in 18 carries. John Duhon 
led Loara with 90 yards in 17 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden Hawks' defense sacked Loara quarterback Jim Kirkland five times, 
including four by Mike McAdam. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Sea View League game: 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Margarita 21, Irvine 18 -- Host Irvine not only lost its the Sea View 
League finale, but the three-time defending Southern Section champions also 
lost a coin flip with El Toro immediately after the game to determine the 
league's third-place representative in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine (4-5-1, 2-2-1) finished in a tie for third with El Toro (5-4-1, 2-2-1). 
</P>
<P>
 But the Chargers will advance to the playoffs. Irvine, because it has an 
overall record under .500, will not be considered for an at-large berth. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Margarita (5-5, 2-3) broke the game open when David Munoz scored a 
17-yard touchdown run with 7:10 remaining for a 21-10 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine closed the gap to 21-18 when quarterback Scott Larsen completed a 
five-yard touchdown pass to Zubin Irani with 44 seconds left. Larsen then hit 
Mike Snyder for a two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 But Irvine was unable to recover the on-side kick. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Margarita took an early 6-0 lead on a two-yard touchdown run by Billy 
Newman with 3:47 left in the first quarter. The kick failed. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Century League game: 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Park 27, Santa Ana Valley 8 -- The Spartans (9-1,4-1) warmed up for next 
week's playoffs behind Tony D'Amato's running and the arm of quarterback Sean 
McMahon. 
</P>
<P>
 D'Amato started in place of Franklin Haynes, the team's leading rusher who did 
not play for disciplinary reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 D'Amato, a senior, responded by gaining 101 yards in 12 carries and scoring 
two touchdowns. The first, a two-yard run in the second quarter, gave Villa 
Park a 7-0 lead. D'Amato also caught a seven-yard pass from McMahon in the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 McMahon completed 10 of 15 passes for 160 yards and two touchdowns. His 
second, a five-yard pass to Kris Fisher, closed out the Spartans' scoring early 
in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Valley (3-7, 1-4) scored its only points on a 49-yard pass from 
reserve quarterback Ricky Chavez to Adrian Buenrostro. The pair also connected 
on the two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Park's defense held the Falcons in check most of the game limiting them 
to 63 yards in the first half. Chavez completed 11 of 25 passes for 175 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 In a nonleague game: 
</P>
<P>
 North Hollywood Harvard-Westlake 46, La Quinta 7 -- La Quinta (1-9), which 
gained only 131 total yards, was paced by Tony Tran, who gained 37 yards in 
eight carries. Tran had a two-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter to avoid 
the shutout. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Jason Gondringer completed five of 12 passes for 78 yards and one 
interception. Harvard-Westlake took a 26-0 lead in the first quarter, then 
added another touchdown in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolverines (8-1-1) entered the game ranked No. 3 in the Southern Section 
Division IX poll. GABE LACQUES and SCOTT JONES and DAVE DESMOND

 Sunny Hills rallied and defeated previously unbeaten Orange, 14-16, 15-10, 
4-15, 15-12, 15-6, in the second round of the Southern Section Division II 
girls' volleyball playoffs Saturday at Orange High. 
</P>
<P>
 Tegan Catlin and Jennifer Coopman led the Lancers with 22 kills each. Sunny 
Hills plays Long Beach Poly in the next round.

<P>
 The Lancers (17-1) jumped to an early lead in the fifth game and held on with 
Catlin's serve, which produced the final four points. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlene Conley led the Panthers with 23 kills. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunny Hills Coach Ron Kasser said his team prevailed with timely passing and 
clutch serving, elements he felt the Lancers lacked in the early going. 
</P>
<P>
 "We stress ball control, passing and defense, and we lost a lot of points 
early that we made up for in the end," Kasser said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers gained momentum in the fourth game, taking a 9-1 lead on Coopman's 
serve and Shannon Rosenkranz's four kills. After Orange climbed back into the 
game trailing, 14-12, Catlin responded with a hard sideline spike on Coopman's

COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOOTBALL ROUNDUP; RANCHO SANTIAGO CLINCHES SHARE OF TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Rancho Santiago got a championship-caliber performance from its defense 
Saturday and the result was just that. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons beat Fullerton, 34-7, to win a share of the Central Division title of 
the Mission Conference before about 3,500 at Titan Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams were tied (4-0) for the division lead coming into the game. It was 
the eighth consecutive victory for the Dons (8-1), the top-ranked team in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss stopped Fullerton's four-game winning streak. The Hornets are 5-3-1. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons' swarming defensive unit made life horrible for Fullerton quarterback 
Marc O'Brien, who was sacked six times for minus 49 yards. He was pressured on 
almost every one of his 39 attempts. To his credit, he completed 22 passes for 
187 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton was held to 252 yards in total offense; Rancho Santiago had 404. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our whole game plan was to put pressure on their quarterback and get him 
riled," Rancho Santiago defensive coordinator Tom Nelson said. "And we did." 
</P>
<P>
 Andre Holmes, a freshman defensive back, was especially annoying. He had a 
couple of sacks, a key tackle behind the line of scrimmage and also got a hand 
on two field-goal attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the swarm," Holmes said. "I just have to give it up to the coaches. 
They got us prepared." 
</P>
<P>
 The key series in the game came when Rancho Santiago botched a punt attempt 
and Fullerton had a first down at the Dons' six. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton reached the three but Holmes sacked O'Brien for an 11-yard loss on 
third down. He then partly blocked a field-goal attempt and Rancho Santiago 
held on to a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago quarterback Simon Fuentes completed 11 of 15 passes for 215 
yards and two touchdowns. The two touchdowns gave him a Rancho Santiago 
single-season record 18. 
</P>
<P>
 He had a touchdown pass of 42 yards to Jon Daniels with 13 minutes 27 seconds 
left in the first quarter and had another for 32 yards to Hector Flores. That 
one came with 3:01 left in the half and put Rancho Santiago ahead, 20-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his exploits, Fuentes was more impressed with the play of the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe our defense," he said. "It was a team effort but they played 
great." 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Pola added touchdown runs of 13 and four yards and Ernie Wilson also 
scored on a two-yard run. Pola finished with 81 yards and Wilson had 70. 
</P>
<P>
 The title is the first for Rancho Santiago since 1971. It also means the Dons 
have earned an invitation to the Simple Green Orange County Bowl at Orange 
Coast on Dec. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory gives Rancho Santiago a 34-33-4 lead in the series, the oldest in 
the State. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel good," said Rancho Santiago Coach Dave Ogas just before he was carried 
off the field by his players. "My coaching staff and the players, that says it 
all right there." 
</P>
<P>
 In other Mission Conference games: 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Coast 23, Saddleback 19 -- Visiting Orange Coast jumped to a 23-13 
lead, then held on for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Matt Sauk threw for 224 yards and two touchdowns and Jeff Clayton 
ran for 72 yards a touchdown in 25 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback pulled to within 23-19 when quarterback Pat Wood hit Todd Thomas on 
a two-yard touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Patton, who had returned an interception for a touchdown in the first 
quarter, intercepted his second pass of the night and returned it 29 yards into 
Orange Coast territory. Saddleback drove to the nine-yard line, but three 
incomplete passes by Wood ended Saddleback's drive with 26 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside 31, Golden West 17 -- Damien Cook rushed for 82 yards and one 
touchdown and Brian Schneider threw for 158 yards and one touchdown for Golden 
West.

CHAPMAN BACKS UP ALL ITS TALK WITH VICTORY; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: PANTHERS MOVE 
CONFIDENTLY DOWN THE FIELD TO HAND CAL LUTHERAN A 27-7 LOSS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Chapman's 27-7 victory over Cal Lutheran on Saturday can be explained in large 
part by one simple fact, supplied by Chapman defensive end Robert Ernster. 
</P>
<P>
 "They couldn't backpedal as fast as we could run forward," said Ernster, who 
spent much of the game running around the Cal Lutheran backfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernster sacked quarterback Ryan Huisenga 2 1/2 times, made three other tackles 
for losses, knocked down a pass and recovered a fumble. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had fun watching him the whole game," said Chapman's Efriam Miranda, who 
plays next to Ernster on the line and had 1 1/2 sacks. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a fun day all around for the Panthers (6-2-1), who completed their 
first football season since 1932 with a convincing victory in front of 2,000 at 
Cal Lutheran's Mt. Clef Field. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Panthers started slow on offense -- scoreless for the first 26 
minutes -- they pounced quickly when given the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 With 5 minutes 34 seconds left in the first half, Oscar Ford seemed to have 
drawn first blood, returning a punt 64 yards for a touchdown, but it was 
nullified because of an illegal block. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers struck again in short order when Curtis Robinson completed a 
45-yard pass to Terrance Green, moving the ball down to the seven-yard line. 
Two plays later, Juan Garcia scored on a three-yard run for a 7-0 lead with 
3:21 left. 
</P>
<P>
 After three Cal Lutheran plays netted minus four yards, Ford returned a punt 
33 yards to the 22. Robinson gained 20 yards on a keeper, and Aaron Meschuk 
scored from two yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman scored on the first possession of the second half. Todd Stock returned 
the kickoff 29 yards to the Chapman 45 and took it the rest of the way with 
seven rushing plays. Meschuk gained two yards, Garcia gained four, Darnell 
Morgan eight, Ford 28 and Robinson 13, including the five-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Simple as that, Chapman had a 21-0 lead, and although 12:13 remained in the 
third quarter it seemed quite safe, considering how the Panthers' defense was 
playing. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran (4-5) got some early breaks -- the Kingsmen recovered a fumble by 
Ford on Chapman's first possession of the game and blocked Mario Acosta's punt 
on the Panthers' second -- but kept running into a wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Terrence Thomas, one of the Kingsmen's best offensive weapons, was well 
contained. Thomas, a 5-foot-9, 200-pound senior with breakaway speed, was held 
to 102 yards -- 40 short of his average -- in 29 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 He was often hit behind the line of scrimmage and was stopped for losses 
totaling 17 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if their offensive line came to play," Miranda said, "but that 
running back sure did. He just didn't have any help."

NORTHRIDGE SET BACK TO THE SIXTIES; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: NORTHERN ARIZONA ADDS TO 
THE MATADORS' DISASTROUS SEASON WITH 60-7 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Here's to the third-stringers, or whatever they are. Third-rate, they aren't. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressed into emergency service Saturday because of disciplinary action taken 
against several of their Cal State Northridge teammates, tight end Travis Hall 
and receiver David Romines started in the defensive secondary. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair and some of their mix-and-match mates almost pitched a shutout during 
their moment in the sun. It wasn't a complete return to one-platoon football, 
but this pair definitely earned their stripes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did pretty good," said Hall, who caught four passes. "They never threw the 
ball to our side." 
</P>
<P>
 When the regulars returned after one quarter, though, the other side threw 
often and effectively as Northern Arizona chalked up a 60-7 blowout in a 
nonconference game before 2,018 at North Campus Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 For the starting defense, it was fun while it lasted, which pretty much 
describes the early flow of the game. With the ad-lib lineup in place -- a 
handful of Northridge starters were held out because they boycotted practice 
Tuesday -- Northern Arizona managed only a 7-0 lead after one quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was fun for the first series, but then I started getting tired," said 
Romines, who caught five passes for 104 yards and a touchdown. "Then it wasn't 
fun anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 His teammates would echo the latter sentiment. Northern Arizona quarterback 
Jeff Lewis threw five touchdown passes and ran for two more as Northridge (3-6) 
surrendered 60 points for the first time since 1985, the season before Bob Burt 
took over as the coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge, which lost its fourth game in a row, allowed a season-high 504 
yards and the Lumberjacks averaged 6.6 yards a play. Hard to believe, but with 
the patchwork defense on the field for the entire first quarter, Northern 
Arizona managed 101 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 In the secondary, only Jim Rose, a regular at cornerback, started. Linebacker 
Joe Pierro started at safety. Romines, a junior, hadn't played defensive back 
since his senior year at Simi Valley High. Hall worked out at safety in 
preseason practice before moving to tight end. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still needed a refresher course," Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
 The starters needed an oxygen tent. All of Northridge's benched regulars were 
inserted to begin the second quarter and Northern Arizona (7-4) started 
rolling. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis, who completed 25 of 39 for 307 yards, threw a three-yard scoring pass 
to Jesus Reyes for a 13-0 lead only seven plays after the defensive starters 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 19-0, Northridge scored on a 51-yard pass play from J.J. O'Laughlin 
to Romines with 6 minutes 9 seconds left in the half. O'Laughlin, pressured 
repeatedly, completed 16 of 44 for 209 yards and had two passes intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
 Things were looking up. One play after Romines' score, senior safety Joseph 
Vaughn intercepted Lewis' pass and returned it 10 yards to the Northern Arizona 
35-yard line. In the process, he set an NCAA Division I-AA single-season record 
for return yardage. He expanded the record to 265 yards with an interception 
and six-yard return in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 The celebration didn't last a heartbeat in either instance. After Vaughn's 
first theft, Northridge fullback Shaun Coleman fumbled the ball away on the 
second play. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn picked off his second pass early in the third quarter to tie the school 
single-season record of nine interceptions, set by Danny Garrett in 1975. 
Again, the Matadors had a look at the game. Again, they blinked. 
</P>
<P>
 Darren Walton lost a fumble at the Northridge 29 on the next play. Northern 
Arizona scored 43 seconds later on a one-yard keeper by Lewis for a 26-7 lead 
with 10:07 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The deluge was unstoppable. 
</P>
<P>
 Tailback Len Raney scored on a 68-yard screen pass for a 33-7 lead on Northern 
Arizona's next offensive play. Rod Alexander scored on a seven-yard pass from 
Lewis on the Lumberjacks' next possession. 
</P>
<P>
 During the horrific third-quarter stretch, Northern Arizona scored three 
touchdowns on seven offensive plays. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense chipped in moments later. Dereck Williams, who played at Crespi 
High, intercepted his second pass of the game and cruised 14 yards for a 
touchdown and a 53-7 lead with 12:30 left. Northridge committed six turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 "What can you do?" Hall said. "We did everything we could. Everything 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
 In a distraction-filled season, truer words were never spoken. Matador Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge was held to six yards on the ground. Freshman tailback DeWayne 
Johnson, who started because of the benchings, gained three yards in nine 
carries. No rushing play accounted for more than five yards and Northridge 
averaged 0.21 yards in 28 carries. . . . Senior quarterback J.J. O'Laughlin has 
passed for 2,095 yards over nine games to become the first Matador quarterback 
since Chris Parker (1985) to reach the 2,000-yard mark.  
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Vaughn also broke the Matador career record for interception return 
yardage -- and he did it in one season. Vaughn, a transfer from Cal State 
Fullerton, did not intercept a pass as a junior. The record of 258 interception 
return yards was held by Danny Garrett (1975-76). . . . Northridge has been 
outscored, 155-43, over the past four games and has been limited to one 
touchdown in three of the losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Northern Arizona defeated American West Conference members Northridge, Cal 
Poly San Luis Obispo and Southern Utah by a combined score of 163-49. . . . 
With his five scoring passes, junior quarterback Jeff Lewis set a Northern 
Arizona record with 26 this season.

THOUSAND OAKS BOYS' VICTORY IS EASY AS 1-2-3; CROSS-COUNTRY: O'DOHERTY, FISCHER 
AND MARSDEN LEAD LANCERS TO TOP FINISH IN SOUTHERN SECTION PRELIMS AT MT. SAC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With teammates Keith O'Doherty, Jeff Fischer and Kevin Marsden running three 
abreast at the head of the pack after the first mile of a Division I-A heat of 
the Southern Section preliminaries at Mt. San Antonio College on Saturday, it 
had the look of a staged publicity photo for the Thousand Oaks High boys' 
cross-country team. 
</P>
<P>
 Although O'Doherty eventually broke away from fellow seniors Fischer and 
Marsden to win with a time of 15 minutes 17 seconds over the three-mile course, 
that did little to diminish the dominance of Thousand Oaks' victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers, led by the 1-2-3 finish of O'Doherty, Fischer (15:40) and Marsden 
(15:48), placed five runners among the top seven finishers to total 18 points. 
Orange, the No. 5-ranked team in the Southern Section Division I poll, was 
second with 66 points followed by seventh-ranked Corona with 70. 
</P>
<P>
 The top three teams in each heat and the first four individuals not on a 
qualifying team, but among the top eight finishers, advanced to the Southern 
Section championships to be held Nov. 19 at Mt. SAC. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really know what to make of the boys' race," Thousand Oaks Coach Jack 
Farrell said. "We wanted to run well as a group today, but I didn't expect them 
to run as fast as they did. . . . The boys looked a lot sharper than I 
expected." 
</P>
<P>
 Although O'Doherty & Co. appeared to be saving something for the section 
finals, the Lancers' time of 78:32 ranks fourth on the all-time Mt. SAC list 
for Southern Section teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks set the team-time record of 77:56 in winning the Division I 
title last year and the Lancers appear capable of lowering that mark in the 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as we don't come down with any unforeseen injuries or illnesses next 
week, we should be in good shape for the finals," Farrell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Amy Skieresz of Agoura, Elaine Canchola of Nordhoff and the Thousand Oaks 
girls' team turned in other top performances among local competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Skieresz, the section's two-time defending Division I champion, produced the 
fastest girls' time of the meet in winning a Division II-AA heat in 17:45. 
</P>
<P>
 The Charger senior finished a distant third (18:15) in the individual 
sweepstakes race of last month's Mt. SAC Invitational, but led Agoura to a 
second-place finish Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers tied Yucaipa for first with 42 points, but the Thunderbirds were 
awarded the victory on the basis of a better sixth runner. 
</P>
<P>
 Canchola, who gained notoriety by finishing third behind Skieresz and Kim 
Mortensen of Thousand Oaks in the Ventura County championships two weeks ago, 
topped that performance with a 17:53 clocking to win her Division III heat by 
nearly a minute. 
</P>
<P>
 The time was the second-fastest of the meet and moved her to third on the 
all-time freshman list at Mt. SAC behind Deena Drossin of Agoura (17:37 in 
1987) and Tracey Williams of El Monte Mountain View (17:47 in 1984). 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks, the 14th-ranked team in the nation, won the first Division I-A 
heat with 37 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortensen, first in 18:25, and Bridget Roy, third in 18:59, led the Lancers.

HANCOCK STIFLES GLENDALE, 27-24

<P>
 After a 27-24 Western State Conference loss to Hancock College at Righetti 
High Saturday night, Glendale wasn't about to call the area inside the 
opponent's 20 the red zone. 
</P>
<P>
 It was more like the Dead Zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale (4-5, 3-5 in WSC, 1-3 in division), clinging to a 14-7 lead in a 
North Division game, entered Hancock's red zone three times during the second 
quarter. But a blocked field goal, an interception and a fumble ended the 
threats. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Powell of Hancock (6-3, 5-3, 3-1) set a school single-game record with 13 
catches for 196 yards, including a 35-yarder that set up the go-ahead touchdown 
with 5 minutes 18 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale's Tony Delgado passed for 241 yards, but had three interceptions.

 LISTENING, ST. LOUIS? If the Los Angeles Rams, who host the cross-freeway 
Raiders today (C1) think they have fair-weather fans, others agree. Bob 
Glauber, in his column for the Sporting News, has rated the fans of the 28 NFL 
teams, based on things such as loyalty during losing seasons and patience with 
struggling quarterbacks. . . . How did Rams fans rate? Dead last.

 HAPPY DONKEY: The Republicans gave the opposition a good thumping in last 
week's election, but Margie Rice, 65, was one Democrat who was too much for 
them. . . . Rice won twice , and was the top vote-getter in both elections. She 
captured a seat on the Westminster City Council and was reelected to a 
four-year term on the Midway City Sanitary District board. Both races were 
nonpartisan, but Rice was endorsed by the Democratic Party. Says Rice: "I don't 
have a full-time job. I have plenty of time for these positions."

 INSIDE TRACK: Ronald Reagan's announcement about his illness has spurred added

there and we've always had fun."

 Two bombs exploded in Baghdad on Saturday, killing a suspected bomber and 
wounding three students, state-run media reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The fatal bomb, containing up to 6 1/2 pounds of explosives, went off near the 
downtown Baghdad Hotel, the state-run Iraqi News Agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
 INA said the dead person was believed to be the bomber, but Baghdad radio 
reported that police were unable to identify the body because of the force of 
the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the fourth bombing in less than a month in the Iraqi capital.

PHILIPPINES WILL CONSIDER OFFSHORE U.S. MILITARY DEPOT; ASIA: PRESIDENT RAMOS 
TO DISCUSS TOPIC WITH CLINTON DURING FIRST VISIT BY AN AMERICAN HEAD OF STATE 
SINCE 1975. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 On the eve of talks with President Clinton, Philippine President Fidel V. 
Ramos said Saturday that his country might consent to having the United States 
set up nearby the kind of floating military depot the Pentagon says it badly 
needs for regional crises. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramos stressed that the idea has already been formally rejected by Thailand 
and that it would need to go through several stages of consideration by 
Filipino and U.S. officials. But he also indicated that, at a time when he is 
trying to cultivate stronger U.S. economic ties, he did not want to reject the 
idea out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've not seen any formal proposal . . . but looking at this at a working 
level is a possibility," Ramos said in an interview at Malacanang Palace. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is likely to be highly controversial in the Philippines, which two 
years ago voted to eject U.S. troops from two colonial-era military bases, and 
where many citizens remain suspicious of U.S. intentions. That was demonstrated 
Saturday, when several hundred supporters of the leftist federation Sanlakas 
marched toward Clinton's hotel, shouting their opposition to any such 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 They yelled "Clinton out!" and called Ramos a "puppet" until they were 
dispersed by tear gas and water cannons. 
</P>
<P>
 The first U.S. President to visit the 7,000-island archipelago since Gerald 
Ford in 1975, Clinton and his wife, Hillary, arrived to a low-key ceremony at 
Ninoy Aquino Airport near midnight local time. 
</P>
<P>
 At talks with Clinton today, Ramos is expected to strongly stress that the 
country needs more American investment if it is to continue its recent economic 
growth and stability. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton will also commemorate the joint World War II sacrifices of the 
Filipino and U.S. Army forces in appearances at the huge U.S. military cemetery 
in Manila and the Corregidor battle site in Manila Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, Clinton heads to Jakarta, Indonesia, for talks with Asian leaders and 
a meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials would like to have a floating depot where they could store 
enough equipment and supplies to sustain one heavy brigade for 15 days, for 
military or disaster relief operations in the Mideast or the Korean peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 As proposed to Thai officials, the plan would include up to 850,000 square 
feet of storage for equipment that would include M-1A1 Abrams tanks and M-2A2 
Bradley fighting vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 The gear would be stored on half a dozen huge ships or barges outside 
territorial limits. Some maintenance would be required, but the plan envisions 
no need for accompanying troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Thailand turned down the proposal. "Establishing any armed depot in the Gulf 
of Thailand could lead to misunderstanding among other countries of the 
region," a spokesman for the Thai government said. He was presumably referring 
to China, which with its great size and growing power is a source of anxiety to 
many governments in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Indonesia and Malaysia are also reportedly wary of the plan, although State 
Department officials say they were never formally asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Abdullah Alatas has been quoted as saying that 
the balance of a U.S. presence in Asia is needed, but not in the form of 
military bases. Negative reactions by Indonesia and Malaysia may have also been 
prompted by their unwillingness to be a party in any military action against an 
Islamic country in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 In his interview, Ramos stressed the continuing strong mutual security 
commitments of the United States and the Philippines, noting that the two had 
recently conducted joint military exercises and that the Philippines had 
supported U.S. actions in Haiti and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been responsive," said Ramos, a West Point-trained soldier who 
formerly directed the Philippine armed forces. "We have supported U.S. and U.N. 
peacekeeping initiatives." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramos said any plan for a floating depot would need to go before a review 
board of U.S. and Filipino officials that was set up under a mutual security 
treaty in 1951. The plan would then be reviewed by U.S. and Filipino diplomatic 
officials and considered by the legislature and other government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. and Philippine officials last week announced a new agreement that will 
allow their warships to refuel and pick up food supplies in each other's 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite some Filipinos' anxieties about U.S. influence in the region, Ramos 
has been pitching hard his desire for more U.S. investment to lift a country 
that is only slowly coming out of the setbacks of the era of President 
Ferdinand E. Marcos. The Philippines' growth rate has recently risen to about 
4%, but unemployment is high, and the country desperately needs infrastructure 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 But the nervousness of some Filipinos has been evident this weekend in 
demonstrations to publicize charges that the United States did not clean up 
environmental damage at the bases before pulling out its thousands of GIs. 
</P>
<P>
 The talks between Clinton and Ramos may include other sensitive subjects 
related to the U.S. troop presence in the country. There is substantial 
domestic pressure for Ramos to bring up the financial claims of former Filipino 
soldiers who fought alongside the United States, and of the Amerasian children 
of American GIs formerly stationed in the Philippines.

 Twelve soldiers were executed by hanging and firing squad Saturday in the 
military government's first crackdown on renegade troops. 
</P>
<P>
 The soldiers, who ranged in rank from private to a 77-year-old warrant 
officer, were convicted in a military court of armed robbery, murder and other 
serious crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 The executions at the maximum security prison were the first ordered by the 
court to be carried out. Several other soldiers are awaiting trial, including 
one accused in an attack that killed an Irish priest, a Dutch doctor and his 
family.

FRED (SONIC) SMITH, 44; GUITARIST FOR BAND MC5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fred (Sonic) Smith, original guitarist for the rock band MC5 and several other 
groups, including his Sonic's Rendezvous Band, has died. He was 44. 
</P>
<P>
 He died Nov. 4 of heart failure in Detroit, said his wife, Patti Smith, a poet 
and singer from the mid-1970s punk movement. 
</P>
<P>
 A native of West Virginia, the guitarist spent most of his life in Detroit. He 
began his career playing with local bands when he was a teen-ager and joined 
MC5 in the mid-1960s. The group pioneered the Detroit sound, a forerunner to 
heavy metal and punk rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith later made recordings with his wife, including the album "Dream of Life" 
in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his wife, Smith is survived by a son, Jackson; a daughter, 
Jesse; his parents and two sisters, all of Detroit.

CHEER, DANCE TEAMS JUMP AT CHANCE TO REACH THE NATIONALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HSU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A dozen cheerleading and song squads from Southern California schools -- most 
from Orange County -- are on their way to the national cheerleading and dance 
championships in March after qualifying in Saturday's regional competition at 
Capistrano Valley High School. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1994 Fall Regional Cheer and Dance Championships drew more than 700 
students in 28 squads from 17 schools. Elementary to high school-age students 
in cheerleading outfits filled the gymnasium with noise as they whooped and 
cheered each other on. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a chance to show the world what they really do," said Julie Mitchell, 
the school's activities director. "Cheerleaders are not seen as athletic, but 
if you watch them, they are athletic. They need to practice every day." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,500 spectators, sporting school logos and carrying banners, packed 
the bleachers to see the choreographed routines in two separate competitions, 
one for teams of cheerleaders, the other for dance and song squads. 
</P>
<P>
 Each team had two minutes to perform its routine, which included a number of 
required moves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cheerleaders must mount and tumble," she said. "Song teams have to pivot, 
twirl and do leg lifts. Each time a girl falls or misses a move, they lose 
points." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the teams performed to hip-hop music, but the crowd went wild when 
Servite High School's song squad began dancing to a mix of songs from the 
soundtrack of Disney's Aladdin. Though Servite is a private boy's school in 
Anaheim, girls from Fullerton's Rosary High School and Connelly High School in 
Anaheim cheer for Servite's sports teams, said Laura Detterich, the squad's 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to make it a lot different from everyone else," Detterich said. "I 
like them to have a little fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Judges from the Cheerleaders of America organization evaluated the 28 squads 
from three age groups on communication, enthusiasm, timing, motion techniques 
and overall skill. Out of a possible 100 points, a team needed to score 80 to 
qualify for the nationals in Jacksonville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams practiced throughout the summer to prepare for Saturday's regional 
competition. For some squads, such as the one from MacArthur Middle School, 
which made it to the national championships, the practicing paid off. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm excited," said Breanne Killing, 11, after the scores were announced. "But 
we don't have enough money. It's $750 per person and we have 24 people." 
</P>
<P>
 Team coach Eric Anderson said the cheerleaders will try to raise the money 
from sponsors and by holding fund-raisers. "It's an awesome team," he said. 
"We're in Santa Ana and we're not from rich schools. We're always fund-raising, 
but it's hard." 
</P>
<P>
 For many of the squads, Saturday's event was the first competition ever. One 
of the more experienced teams, Mater Dei High School's co-ed squad, scored 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cheerleading is pretty important at Mater Dei," said Dana Cormie, 17, a 
varsity cheerleader. "It's not just a little thing, it's a sport. We practice 
seven hours a week, go to games and do schoolwork. It takes a lot of juggling." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the competition, there was a camaraderie among the teams as they 
cheered each other on and responded to the rallying cries of the squad 
performing. While everyone waited anxiously for the judges to announce the 
scores, many of the squads formed a circle and showed off their moves. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's for support," said Becky Harkins, 15, a cheerleader for Trabuco Hills 
High School in Mission Viejo as the De Portola Middle School squad went through 
its routine on the gym floor. "When you're out there, it makes you feel a lot 
better to get a response." 
</P>
<P>
 The students say that constantly practicing their craft brings them together. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the most unified squad," said Julianne Bixler, 16, of Rancho Buena 
Vista High School as teammates in purple and white sweaters and matching skirts 
gathered around her. "We don't try to compete against our competition. We 
compete for ourselves. We don't have a coach either, so we sometimes meet after 
school and make up our own cheers. It's more personal." 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Passalacqua, 17, a member of Aliso Niguel High School's co-ed team, saved 
a teammate from falling during a mount. Being one of the five male cheerleaders 
has its advantages, despite the teasing he must endure, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say, 'Uh, cheerleader?' but in the end, we're here with all the 
girls," Passalacqua said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County schools which qualified teams for the national competition are: 
MacArthur Intermediate School, Mater Dei High School, Capistrano Valley High 
School, Trabuco Hills High School, Santa Margarita High School, Pilgrims School 
and Servite High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Buena Vista High School in Vista and two teams composed of students 
from several schools in Bell Gardens also qualified.

NEW TURF TO GUARD; SAN CLEMENTE OFFICERS ADJUST TO BORDER REDEPLOYMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. Border Patrol Agent Elizabeth Briones likes excitement, and she's gotten 
plenty since being reassigned from the San Clemente checkpoint down to the busy 
and dangerous international border with Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, Briones is helping catch thousands of illegal immigrants, an effort that 
went into high gear on Oct. 1 when the federal government beefed up its border 
enforcement as part of Operation Gatekeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 But like other agents redeployed to the border, Briones, 28, of Temecula gives 
the clear impression she'd rather be back at the San Clemente checkpoint, where 
it may have been less intense but there were more different kinds of action -- 
and fewer personal sacrifices. 
</P>
<P>
 "Down here, I'm just assigned to run and chase illegal aliens and catch them," 
she said. "It's like a game here." 
</P>
<P>
 "We do need agents down here at the border," Briones conceded. "But I feel 
they need us at the checkpoint too. Up there, it's not just illegal aliens. 
We're capturing car thieves and recovering stolen cars. We're stopping drugs 
going through and helping to keep them off the street." 
</P>
<P>
 For many of the more than 90 border agents who were stationed at the 
now-closed checkpoint, the redeployment has also meant longer hours, more 
stress, unfamiliar terrain and new co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Gordon, 28, who also lives in Riverside County, has traded in his 
40-minute commute to the checkpoint for a 90-minute trip to the border. Now, he 
meets half a dozen other agents at the checkpoint and they car-pool for the 
trek south. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sort of like being a trainee again," Gordon said. "But we have all this 
experience behind us and it's just learning the area, the tactics of the aliens 
and the smugglers out here." 
</P>
<P>
 The reassignment has also changed the domestic situation for some agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Briones' husband, Carlos, had worked for the Border Patrol at the checkpoint, 
but since Operation Gatekeeper began, she works swing shift and he works night 
shift. "At home, usually he's going to work and I'm coming home. We hardly see 
each other any more," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And the agents don't know whether things will ever go back to the way they 
were. 
</P>
<P>
 The checkpoint is being evaluated to determine whether it should reopen or be 
closed permanently, according to Border Patrol officials. It is expected to 
reopen temporarily, and agents are eagerly waiting to go back -- and hoping 
it'll be for good. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first they told us 10 days, then 15 days. Now it's been 30 days. We just 
stopped asking," said agent Roy D. Villareal, 24, of San Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
 The government's emphasis in having more uniforms at the border rather than at 
distant checkpoints is forcing agents to adapt. 
</P>
<P>
 When Operation Gatekeeper started, Ted Swofford, 44, the assistant Border 
Patrol agent in charge of the checkpoint, said San Clemente agents had to 
familiarize themselves with their new border post and get used to the large 
contingent of agents deployed there. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we have 12 people on duty at the checkpoint, we think we got it made 
because that's what it takes to operate it at any one time," Swofford said. 
"And, down here at Imperial Beach station, they have close to 80 people working 
at one time. At the checkpoint, the agents know each (other) and each knows 
what to expect of each other in different jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the checkpoint, which operated day and night, border 
surveillance is primarily night work. 
</P>
<P>
 At the border, agents are routinely briefed about 3 p.m. and then assigned 
patrol areas. They spend nights scouting darkened canyons, hoping to intercept 
and apprehend immigrants in the rugged terrain. 
</P>
<P>
 Agents on horseback, bicycles, sedans, all-terrain vehicles and small, 
high-speed boats are spread out in a three-tiered formation along the busiest 
14 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border. 
</P>
<P>
 "Down here," Swofford said, "we got people from several different stations, 
and although the uniform's the same color, they don't know much about the other 
agents. We're also trying to give them the benefit of the local agents' 
knowledge so they can teach the San Clemente agents their way around, rather 
than just throwing them out there." 
</P>
<P>
 "Out there" is often dangerous, and the victims are typically migrants preyed 
upon by robbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Heightening the peril, there are signs of mounting tension between agents and 
smugglers of illegal immigrants since the increased effort to seal off the 
border. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 29, a speeding pickup truck crashed through a closed gate at San 
Ysidro's port of entry, and later that day, two cars did the same. The 
suspected smugglers eluded pursuing agents each time, and officials cited the 
incidents as evidence of growing frustration among smugglers with the border 
crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Operation Gatekeeper also put a brighter political spotlight on the border. 
Last month, U.S. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno paid another visit to the Imperial Beach 
station, followed by Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris 
Meissner a week later. And Mexicans protested in Tijuana at the border over 
Proposition 187, and its perceived link to the border crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Swofford, who worked at the border three years ago, recalled changes in that 
time on such improvements as fencing and lighting. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I left here," Swofford said, "basically the fence was a dilapidated 
chain link fence with more holes than you could count. Now there's a 
solid-steel fence 10 feet tall." 
</P>
<P>
 The improvements were part of a $45-million congressional allocation last 
February that also enabled the Border Patrol to buy 220 new all-terrain 
vehicles, Swofford said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I left, we didn't have enough vehicles to supply two shifts of agents," 
Swofford said. "One shift would be out there, and in order to transition we had 
to bring the vehicles in during a shift change, leaving no one out there. Now 
we got two lines of agents out there." 
</P>
<P>
 The reassignment of checkpoint agents to the border has had its advantages. 
</P>
<P>
 Villareal said he gets to see illegal immigration from its beginning and 
"probably the most interesting aspect of being down here is watching the 
network of the smugglers. The way they allocate their people, it's just like 
transporting cargo. You see a group of 100 aliens sitting somewhere and 
somebody will say, 'OK, we're going to move.' It's so intriguing that a couple 
of whistles or hand signals is all they need and the next thing you know, all 
100 will just shift and move out, now!"  
</P>
<P>
 It has been on-the-job training, the agents acknowledged, but checkpoint work 
has prepared them for their new assignment. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the checkpoint was the nation's busiest with 122,000 motorists 
passing through daily. More than 46,000 illegal immigrants were apprehended at 
the checkpoint in the 1993 fiscal year, Border Patrol officials said. During 
the same period, agents seized 7,552 pounds of marijuana, 63 1/2 pounds of 
cocaine and 9 1/2 pounds of heroin. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the agents said, they seize items that usually are not mentioned 
in news accounts, such as untaxed cigarettes from Mexico, and sometimes, weird, 
illegally imported wildlife such as black clams. 
</P>
<P>
 "The misconception in the general public is that we only stop smuggling of 
aliens," Gordon said, referring to the checkpoint. "But that's like only half 
of what we do. The San Diego Freeway is the major south-to-north corridor that 
we have in the state. You're bound to come across a whole lot of other crimes." 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember we got a description of two carjackers who hijacked a taxi in San 
Diego," Gordon said. "They had beaten up a man pretty bad. Police put out a 
bulletin and it said that we might expect them to be headed our way. Sure 
enough, they blew through our checkpoint and we got them near the (San Onofre) 
power plant." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it was the human cargo smuggled north that made up half of their job at 
the checkpoint, agents said. 
</P>
<P>
 Briones recalled stopping a small sports car and making a surprise discovery 
in the engine compartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lifted the hood to the engine and there was a carpet over the engine which 
caught our attention," Briones said. "We pulled it back and there was a person 
there!" 
</P>
<P>
 And, Gordon said he has uncovered illegal drugs in secret, electrically 
operated compartments. "You name it, we've seen it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had people trying to pass the inspection point sitting on top of each 
other, thinking we won't notice," Gordon said. "I stopped a motor home once 
that had a ceiling raised 12 inches. We got 19 aliens out of that RV." 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon said one characteristic applies to both the checkpoint and the border: 
It's nearly impossible to predict the behavior of illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can have 10 agents down here at the border and they'll still jump over 
the fence right in front of you," Gordon said. "Or, you can be standing on the 
freeway at the checkpoint and they'll jump out of their vehicles right in front 
of you and start running. It's amazing."

MDS, NURSES, LEARN TO DEAL WITH THE PAIN; HEALTH: THOSE AT A CONFERENCE IN 
IRVINE ARE SHOWN THE LATEST PEDIATRIC TECHNIQUES -- MEDICAL AND NON-MEDICAL -- 
TO RELIEVE SUFFERING OF YOUNG PATIENTS. 
</P>

<P>
 The sight of a toddler blowing a storm of bubbles while ignoring a doctor who 
was inserting a needle in her arm sent a ripple of laughter Saturday through an 
audience of Orange County nurses and physicians who watched the procedure on 
videotape. 
</P>
<P>
 Encouraging children to blow bubbles is part of a broad arsenal of medical and 
non-medical methods, including narcotic-laced lollipops, self-hypnosis or 
simply the company of a friendly dog, that are being used to help youngsters 
cope with pain. 
</P>
<P>
 About 80 medical professionals gathered at an all-day conference at the Atrium 
Marquis Hotel in Irvine to learn about the latest in pain control and the need 
for increasing attention to pediatric pain -- the extent of which has only been 
acknowledged within the last decade by national associations of pediatricians 
and anesthesiologists.  
</P>
<P>
 "Up until fairly recently, there were major pediatric centers in the country 
that did major surgery on newborns with little or no anesthesia," said Dr. 
Robert Truog, associate professor of anesthesiology and pediatrics at Harvard 
Medical School and one of the conference speakers. There is now sufficient 
scientific evidence, the speakers said, to firmly disprove the once widespread 
belief that newborns cannot feel pain or that painkillers are too dangerous to 
administer to children. "In most cases there is good evidence now that pain 
control promotes healing," said Truog. 
</P>
<P>
 The pain of newborns has been most neglected in part because physicians have 
had difficulty assessing their suffering, said Dr. Robert Wilder, director of 
the Pain Treatment Center at Children's Hospital in Boston. After all, infants 
can't speak up, and a baby's crying can be misinterpreted as a call for food or 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilder said research shows that a reliable indicator of an infant's pain 
is facial expression, such as a grimacing mouth and a furrowed brow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Around the country, still half of the circumcisions are done without any 
anesthesia or pain medication," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several speakers said improvements in the management of pediatric pain from 
illnesses and medical treatments will ultimately be brought about by the 
demands of parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be parents who will take this as a battle cry and go to bat for 
their children," said Leora Kuttner, a clinical psychologist and assistant 
professor in the department of pediatrics at the University of British 
Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuttner said parents are getting more involved in all aspects of the hospital 
care of their children. "Whereas parents 20 years ago would drop the children 
in the ward and come only during visiting time, now they are often staying at 
their children's bedside," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The presence of a parent comforts a child, Kuttner said. During a painful 
procedure, she said, a parent can hold the child's hand, tell stories or lead 
the child in taking deep, rhythmic breaths, all of which can be pain relieving. 
 
</P>
<P>
 And being with the child, Kuttner added, gives the parent an opportunity to 
act as the child's advocate. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Robert L. Manniello, medical director of Children's Hospital of Orange 
County, said the hospital's staff is in the process of upgrading its pain 
management program in response to complaints received from parents and nurses.  
</P>
<P>
 A survey of the hospital's 600 staff physicians found that many physicians, 
including surgeons, didn't understand the importance of treating pain in 
children or know the most current pain control methods, Manniello said. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's conference was organized by CHOC with a $6,000 grant from Abbott 
Laboratories. Manniello said the program is a first step toward better 
educating nurses and doctors. About half of those who attended the conference 
were CHOC staff members. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he said, the hospital is creating a pain management team that 
includes nurses, pediatric surgeons, and pediatric physicians and will set 
policies and procedures for pain management in every department. 
</P>
<P>
 CHOC already has tried some innovations, Manniello said, including the 
introduction this year of a pet therapy program.  
</P>
<P>
 Manniello told about David, a 10-year-old who died of cystic fibrosis at the 
hospital several weeks ago. In one of David's last coherent moments, he 
received a visit from a German shepherd named Becks that he had come to love. 
</P>
<P>
 "David opened his eyes, and the dog came up and barked to say hello, and David 
petted him," Manniello said. "It gave David five minutes away from his pain and 
anguish. At that point, the pain was gone."PEDIATRICS

DANA PARSONS: IDLING AWAY THE HOURS SITTING REALLY CLOSE TO THE FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The clock on my computer is reading 18:49. Make that 18:50. 
</P>
<P>
 That means it's 6:50 p.m. on Friday, and a Sunday column that was due an hour 
ago is not done. Not only is it not done, the subject for it has not yet been 
thought of. It's a condition we in the business call "writer's block." If it 
persists, it becomes known as "grounds for firing." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that I haven't tried to think of something. I've considered topics 
from politics to sports to the natural sciences to "strange coincidences." Nor 
am I limiting myself to a particular writing style -- I'm prepared to go with 
anything from trenchant analysis to sharply barbed humor to maudlin slop. If I 
could sketch, I'd try that. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, nothing. Column ideas that sound promising one second are consigned 
to oblivion the next. In a world now judged to be at least 8 billion years old, 
I'm unable to think of anything that ever happened about which to write. 
</P>
<P>
 To make matters worse, the clock on the computer screen can't be removed, 
which means that I have to continually stare at it as ideas go down the drain. 
Each passing minute mocks my ineptitude. 18:59 and counting. I wish there were 
a fuse connected to it so when it hit 19:00 I would vaporize into a time 
traveler and be 13 and back in Omaha playing baseball in the alley. 
</P>
<P>
 The office is virtually empty, because the other staffers have completed their 
assigned duties on time. Hooray for them, the little do-gooders. I wish them a 
nice weekend, but you can't imagine how hollow that sentiment is. 
</P>
<P>
 I've been telling my boss all afternoon that I have no ideas, but all he did 
was shift his weight and look down at his shoes. That's how I know he wishes he 
were somewhere else. He thinks this is a game I play with him, that I'm crying 
wolf. He thinks I enjoy acting for hours like I have no ideas, only to spring 
one on him at the last minute in a twisted attempt to gain favor. How little 
the man knows of me. 
</P>
<P>
 Around dinner time, I humbled myself and begged him for help. OK, he said, how 
about a column on how the government could save money by selling Alaska. I 
shifted my weight and looked down at my shoes. We branched out from there to a 
possible column identifying a number of states that could be sold, along with 
the reasons why and potential costs savings. That killed about 10 minutes, and 
then I went and had some barbecued chicken and macaroni in the cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
 The clock now reads 19:21. I just polished off my third Coke in the last 90 
minutes. Now, in addition to not having any ideas, I'm extremely jumpy. 
</P>
<P>
 19:23. I decided to visit our library, hoping that one of the dozens of 
reference books would trigger an idea. Sometimes that's all it takes, a tiny 
spark to set off the slightly damp kindling that constitutes my brain matter. 
</P>
<P>
 I glanced at some of the titles: 
</P>
<P>
 "100 Years of Public Education in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 "Plants and Animals of the Santa Ana River in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 "The New Oxford Companion to Music. Vol. 1 A-J." 
</P>
<P>
 "The New Oxford Companion to Music. Vol. 2 K-Z." 
</P>
<P>
 My eye caught a book titled "American Nicknames." I opened to a page at random 
and came upon this passage: "Hard-headed Pete, Headstrong Pete or Hardkopping 
Piet, Old Silver Leg or Old Silver Nails, The One-Legged Governor and Wooden 
Leg are sobriquets which have been applied to Peter Stuyvesant." 
</P>
<P>
 19:52 and still a blank. In desperation, I fell back on the oldest columnist 
trick in the book: Interesting Things That Have Happened to Me in My Life. 
</P>
<P>
 19:53. That subject exhausted, I began leafing through things in my office. 
Surely, in four years of sitting back here in this Godforsaken hostage cell, I 
had accumulated something that could be grist for a column -- a scrap of paper, 
a note with smudged lettering, a mysterious yellowing document, a secret 
correspondence from an anonymous source. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, more dead ends. At best, I could only produce a rubber band and 
stapler, some hand lotion, dental floss, a 1994-95 Mighty Ducks official 
yearbook, a large number of paper clips neatly arranged on my desktop and the 
owner's manual for my automatic garage door opener, which I had misplaced 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Temporarily brightened by finding the manual, I smiled for the first time all 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 20:40. My boss just went home. He stopped by to ask how things were going, and 
I replied, "Really good."  
</P>
<P>
 Relieved, he asked what I finally settled on, but I didn't have the heart to 
tell him I hadn't settled on anything. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, why not let him enjoy his weekend? 
</P>
<P>
 Why make him fire me on a Friday night? 
</P>
<P>

GIRL DETAILS HORROR AT SCENE OF FATAL SHOOTING; CRIME: ASSAILANTS FLEE AFTER 
DISAGREEMENT LEAVES TWO MEN DEAD AND A THIRD WOUNDED IN ORANGE. YOUNG WITNESS 
SAYS SHE PLEADED FOR MERCY AS HER LITTLE SISTER RAN FOR HER LIFE.

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 14-year-old girl who begged for her life was spared by assailants who shot 
three of her friends, killing two and critically wounding one in a sudden 
attack heard by residents of a quiet cul-de-sac, the youth and authorities said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The young girl frequently broke into tears as she recounted the brazen 
shooting of three men as they congregated around a car on North Highland Street 
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought they were going to shoot me," the teen-ager said in Spanish. "I 
said to them, 'You know me, I'm your friend. I'm a woman.' I said, 'Please 
don't kill me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The girl's younger sister, who fled as the attack occurred, also escaped 
injury, the two youths said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said they heard at least a dozen gunshots followed by the teen-ager 
pleading with the attackers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard a woman screaming, 'No! No! Not me!' " said a man who asked not to be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Police confirmed that the 14-year-old was in the car in the 2000 block of 
North Highland when 19-year-old Julio Damian Cerroblanco and 21-year-old Jorge 
Orozco were shot and killed around 9:30 p.m. by gunmen with whom they had been 
arguing. A third victim, 19-year-old Jorge Avalos, was in critical condition at 
UCI Medical Center in Orange Saturday. The victims, who suffered multiple 
gunshot wounds to their heads, were residents of Orange, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl was sitting inside the car at the end of the cul-de-sac with two of 
the victims, while her sister and another victim were outside the car at the 
time of the attack, police said. The victims had been arguing with the suspects 
via a third party who was acting as messenger, said Police Lt. Timm Browne. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and witnesses said that after the final message was delivered, 
22-year-old Maximino Garcia, his brother, 20-year-old Juan Jose Garcia, and a 
17-year-old male charged out of an apartment. One of them repeatedly fired at 
the victims with a 9-millimeter handgun, according to authorities.  
</P>
<P>
 "I heard many, many shots. I don't know how many," the 14-year-old recalled 
Saturday. "I said, 'Please don't hit my sister.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a lot of fear (today)," she added. "I'm scared. My head and ears hurt. 
I can still hear the shots." 
</P>
<P>
 "The boys killed my friend," the younger sister said. "Then I ran." 
</P>
<P>
 Browne said the argument "just kind of escalated rather quickly. The suspects 
were in the apartment, the victims were outside and the argument was being 
carried on by a messenger." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the shooters and victims knew each other, but declined to discuss 
details of the argument. Neighbors said tensions between the two groups had 
been simmering for some time, and that threats had been made. 
</P>
<P>
 The Garcia brothers had been living in an apartment on the street for the last 
two months but had not been involved in any previous altercations, police and 
neighbors said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims' blood was still on the grass Saturday, as friends set up a small 
memorial of flowers and candles at the spot where they were shot. Neighbors 
were huddled together in groups, still talking about the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's kind of surprised," said 60-year-old Robert Torres, who has lived 
on the street for 15 years. "This is a great neighborhood. Unfortunately, there 
were some people who came in from the outside looking for trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Browne said the neighborhood, located near the Costa Mesa Freeway, has not 
been particularly violent in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 The shootings are the eighth and ninth homicides in Orange this year, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects remained at large Saturday and may be headed for Mexico, police 
said. According to investigators, they were last seen fleeing the area in a 
1973 black or dark brown Mercury Cougar, with a California license plate of: 
2YVA800. Anyone with information about the shooting or the suspects' 
whereabouts is asked to call Orange Police Detective Cathie Ralph at (714) 
744-7575 or 744-7494.

ACLU CRITICIZES LACK OF ASIAN FIREFIGHTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Davee Hazama has wanted to be a firefighter since he was 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in awe of the firefighters when I toured the station as a kid," he said 
of his hometown Fire Department in San Gabriel. "I was only as high as the 
wheel of the firetruck." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly two decades later, after a career change, some strenuous physical 
training, two extra years of schooling and service as a volunteer fire cadet, 
Hazama is finally a firefighter -- one of the few Asian Americans who hold that 
job in Los Angeles County. And he's working in the same station he visited as a 
child. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hazama's dream come true is an exception. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent report by the American Civil Liberties Union found that there are few 
Asian American firefighters in Southern California. Some of the cities with the 
worst records are San Gabriel, Monterey Park and Alhambra, each with a 
population that is at least 30% Asian. Hazama, for example, is the only Asian 
American firefighter in the San Gabriel department. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in those cities defend their efforts, however. They say they are 
doing all they can to recruit Asian Americans, but that qualified applicants 
are hard to find and their small departments with limited openings cannot keep 
pace with the area's rapidly changing demographics. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't hire at the same rate as the population changes," said Pam Hyland, 
personnel director for Monterey Park. "People start with us in their 20s and 
retire with us. We don't have a lot of openings. That makes it hard for us to 
meet the affirmative action goals." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the ACLU report, which surveyed about 100 fire and police 
departments in Southern California between June and September, 1994, San 
Gabriel ranked among the 15 most segregated fire departments compared to the 
racial makeup of the cities they serve. 
</P>
<P>
 Hyland said Monterey Park hired its first Asian American firefighter from its 
reserve program, one of the most productive ways many cities integrate largely 
white departments. Hazama, for instance, got his full-time job after serving in 
San Gabriel's reserve program. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hyland and San Gabriel Fire Chief Gene Murry agreed that it is difficult 
to keep minority candidates in reserve programs because larger departments lure 
them away with better pay when they have openings. 
</P>
<P>
 Hyland also said that first-generation Asian Americans "do not see a positive 
role in becoming a firefighter. "(They) are not applying. They want to be 
businessmen or doctors." 
</P>
<P>
 Monterey Park Mayor Judy Chu, however, said it is a stereotype to say Asian 
Americans are not interested in the profession. Chu said she has met with Asian 
Americans who are frustrated about getting into the field. The fact that the 
city's Police Department is 20% Asian American indicates they are interested in 
civil service jobs, she said, adding that part of the Police Department's 
success is that it has a higher turnover rate and its recruitment efforts are 
more thorough. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents of the San Gabriel Valley communities cited in the ACLU study 
said more should be done to recruit Asian Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying you have to match the resident ratio," said Jimmy Chao, a 
volunteer with Monterey Park's Police Department. "But I think it's good to 
catch up some. (The numbers) are way behind now. "It's probably better to have 
20% to 30%. In case something happens, you don't need interpreters to tell 
people to escape. It could save lives." 
</P>
<P>
 When Hazama was finally able to join the San Gabriel Fire Department in 
August, 1993, he became an important link to the Asian American community. 
</P>
<P>
 "About 90% of our calls are medical calls, at least half of them are from 
Asians," Hazama said. "A lot of times, Asian people would come to me, even 
though I don't speak their language per se, they usually come to me to try to 
explain what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Hazama loves his job, even if it means making sacrifices. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can probably make twice as much money as an accountant, but I chose to 
leave all that behind," said Hazama, 29, a third-generation Japanese American.  
</P>
<P>
 After deciding to change careers, Hazama enrolled at Pasadena City College and 
learned to be a certified paramedic. Then he attended Rio Hondo College's fire 
academy and acquired fire rescue and prevention skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Because many departments only hire recruits from reserve programs, he applied 
in Monterey Park and San Gabriel. He was one of the 12 cadets accepted out of 
about 100 applicants who took written, oral and physical tests necessary to get 
into the San Gabriel reserve program. Those in the reserve program are 
essentially firefighters in training. 
</P>
<P>
 To prepare for his physical agility tests, the 5-foot, 7-inch, 155-pound 
former high school and college athlete would run up and down stairs with 25 
pounds of water bottles in his backpack. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't have gotten into the Fire Department if Chief Murry didn't sponsor 
me," Hazama said about his current boss and former instructor at the Pasadena 
community college. 
</P>
<P>
 Murry said he has been teaching fire technology at Pasadena City College for 
15 years and looks for minority recruits for his reserve program. The problem, 
he said, is retention of qualified candidates at smaller departments like his, 
where there are only 33 staffers and few openings. 
</P>
<P>
 Hazama is grateful that a spot finally opened for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know a handful of Asian Americans who desire to become firefighters who are 
volunteering," he said. "There are no openings for them."

PREVALENCE OF DRUG-TAINTED MONEY VOIDS CASE; LAW: COURT CITES FINDINGS THAT

 More than three-quarters of all the paper money in Los Angeles has some amount 
of cocaine or some other drug stuck to it, according to a federal appeals court 
decision that vividly illuminates how extensively the drug trade touches 
mainstream commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 On the average, of every four bills in circulation in Los Angeles, more than 
three have traces of cocaine or another illicit drug stuck to the paper, 
according to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which relied on that fact 
to dismiss a case against a man suspected of drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
 In powdered form, the court said, cocaine is so sticky that a bit remains when 
a drug dealer wraps it in a bill folded like an envelope or a user snorts it 
through a dollar used as a makeshift straw. As that bill is pressed against 
another in a wallet or combined with others in a bank or cash register, other 
bills get contaminated, too. 
</P>
<P>
 That means, the court said, that virtually everyone in Los Angeles is 
conceivably at risk of being barked at by drug-sniffing police dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line," said Sherman Oaks attorney Jerold L. Bloom, who defended an 
Inglewood man carrying $30,060 that prosecutors charged was drug money, "is 
that anyone with tainted currency can be stopped and alleged to be a drug 
dealer. That's guilt by association." 
</P>
<P>
 The notion that most U.S. currency is tainted with drugs has been well known 
in law enforcement and scientific circles for about 10 years. However, the 9th 
Circuit decision, issued Tuesday by the San Francisco-based court, underscores 
just how amazingly widespread the tainting has become. 
</P>
<P>
 Because it is so widespread, the court ruled, the ability of police and 
prosecutors to rely in court on a "positive alert" from a drug-sniffing dog 
will now be seriously diminished -- a serious drawback in cases in which 
authorities have seized cash and the federal government is seeking the 
forfeiture of drug money. 
</P>
<P>
 Such an alert used to be strong evidence that a person bought or intended to 
buy drugs. No more, the court said, ordering police officers to show other 
evidence "clearly connecting the money to drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, which made the 
traffic stop that led to the ruling, said they plan to meet this week with 
federal authorities to "discuss what impact this may have on us," said Lt. Bob 
Hoffman of the department's narcotics detail. 
</P>
<P>
 The Inglewood case began April 24, 1990, when deputies stopped a car driven by 
Albert Joseph Alexander, then 30, near 107th Street and Denker Avenue. Deputies 
alleged that he had run a stop sign. 
</P>
<P>
 On the front seat was a plastic bag filled with $30,060. The money was 
arranged in $1,000 stacks bound by rubber bands; it was made up of $5, $10, 
$20, $50 and $100 bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander, a mechanic, said last week that he had plans to buy into a friend's 
trucking business and was carrying the cash to that meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have no reason to hide it," he said of the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies used a dog, who sensed drugs in the bag of money. They searched 
Alexander and his car for drugs, but found none. 
</P>
<P>
 State criminal charges were dismissed. But in a proceeding in the civil 
courts, federal prosecutors sought to keep the $30,060 as drug money. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander's attorney Bloom argued that there was not enough evidence to 
connect the money to drugs, as the law requires. In April, 1992, U.S. District 
Judge Ronald S.W. Lew agreed. Prosecutors appealed to the 9th Circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 In its decision, the appeals court relied on uncontradicted evidence that more 
than three of every four bills circulating in Los Angeles were tainted with 
drug residue. 
</P>
<P>
 That evidence was provided by Ojai-based forensic toxicologist Jay B. 
Williams, who said he had done numerous studies since 1982 that turned up drugs 
on samples of $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50 and $100 bills taken from throughout 
the West -- from banks, casinos, stores and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who has specialized in drug and alcohol tests for 27 years, said 
last week that the percentage of contaminated bills ranged from 15% in Bozeman, 
Mont., to a little more than 75% in Los Angeles and Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 The bills he tested contained quantities of cocaine as small as a nanogram, 
meaning one-billionth of a gram, to as much as a milligram, one-thousandth of a 
gram.  
</P>
<P>
 Williams' tests are consistent with other research nationwide. In one study, 
Florida researchers analyzed 135 bills gathered randomly from cities around the 
United States; all but four tested positive for cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those researchers, Lee Hearn, now the chief toxicologist for the 
medical examiner's office in Dade County, Fla., said: "The only bills that 
didn't have contamination were crisp new ones that had limited circulation, if 
any at all." 
</P>
<P>
 It is possible for money to retain residue from crack cocaine, Williams said. 
But it is far more likely that it is from water-soluble powdered cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a powder, it's in a very fine form -- as opposed to a rock," Williams 
said. "There's not a lot of science to that. That's a lot of common sense." 
</P>
<P>
 The most likely denomination to be contaminated, he said, is a $20 bill. But 
that is also common sense, he said, because "when you're trading $100,000 or 
$200,000 (for drugs) you don't give it to a guy in ones." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the 9th Circuit said, other researchers have estimated that 
one of three bills has been used in a drug transaction -- and that a single 
bill in contact with cocaine during a deal or used to snort coke can 
contaminate an entire cash drawer through a combination of friction, body heat 
or body moisture. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the court said, it would hardly be a surprise that a bag of bills adding 
up to $30,060 could be detected by a police dog's sensitive nose. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Lee S. Arian, who handled the appeal, said prosecutors 
are not planning to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. He declined further 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander said he was gratified by the decision. But he added that he wants 
his money back and soon: "I won't feel I've won till I got my money in my 
hands."

FAREWELL PRESENT; IN OWNERS' DYING WISH, STORE'S CONTENTS ARE GIVEN TO NEEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 For 40 years they gave the Eastside their love. On Saturday, Lucy and Jerry 
Barron gave the community their store. 
</P>
<P>
 As their dying wish, the elderly couple decided to donate the entire inventory 
of their City Terrace Drive dry goods store to homeless and poor people. 
</P>
<P>
 The Barrons also forgave all unpaid debts -- more than $20,000 worth -- left 
from credit they extended to generations of low-income families who shopped at 
their business, the Popular Department Store. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Barron was 87 when he died Wednesday of a circulatory ailment. Lucy 
Barron, 74, has been hospitalized since heart problems caused her to slip into 
a coma eight months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad said again last week this is what he wanted done," daughter Sylvia 
Martinoff said as workmen from the St. Vincent de Paul Society loaded boxes 
with girls' dresses, men's shirts and trousers, toiletries and toys. "My mom 
had always said that if anything happened to them, we should donate it to the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 The Popular Department Store had been closed since Jan. 17, when the 
Northridge earthquake caused part of the floor to buckle. 
</P>
<P>
 The sight of the front doors open once more sent longtime customers hurrying 
in Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 But they were shocked to learn of Jerry Barron's death and of Lucy's critical 
illness. And they were sad to say goodby to the 2,500-square-foot shop that had 
been the neighborhood's general store for so many years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came here as a little boy for clothes," said Alberto Angelo, a 35-year-old 
Eastside cook. "When I was 17, Lucy gave me credit so I could buy a pair of 
pants. She'd let me make payments when I had money." 
</P>
<P>
 Carmen Oliveres, 69, broke down and cried as she watched display racks of yarn 
and other sewing supplies being taken away. She remembered spending hours in 
the store chatting as Lucy Barron crocheted tablecloths. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew them for 30 years. They were friends to everyone," Oliveres said after 
being helped to a chair. It was one that Jerry Barron used each day when he sat 
by the front door chomping on a fat cigar -- kept unlit out of consideration 
for his beloved Lucy. 
</P>
<P>
 Remedios Aguirre, 65, came in hopes of buying a $79 gold pendant that she had 
admired for years in the store's jewelry display case. She'd set aside grocery 
money for it, Aguirre said. Martinoff took $10 for it and donated the money to 
the St. Vincent de Paul Catholic charity. 
</P>
<P>
 The merchandise, valued at $25,000, will be distributed to low-income families 
or sold to help support a Skid Row shelter, according to Bobby Jimenez, 
assistant director of St. Vincent's thrift store and warehouse in Lincoln 
Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucy and Jerry Barron's six children picked that charity because it seemed 
most likely to distribute the merchandise to those needing it, according to son 
Frank Barron, a 30-year-old mail clerk at Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
 "We kids were raised in this store," Barron said. "We used to live upstairs in 
an apartment. Sometimes we'd sneak down at night to play with the store's toys. 
I played soldier down in the basement, back behind where the Christmas 
decorations were kept. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over there, beneath the coatrack, is where I'd hide from my dad. See that 
little purple jacket? I can remember seeing that as a boy and wondering if we'd 
ever sell that goofy-looking thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The Barron children all worked at the store. Frank Barron's job was to keep 
track of utility bills that customers could pay there. Often, he said, his 
parents would pay the bills themselves to prevent customers' water and 
electricity from being turned off. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinoff, a 35-year-old graduate student, said many of the store's shelves 
and display racks were built by jobless neighbors hired by her father. 
</P>
<P>
 Local schoolchildren needing supplies or gym uniforms for Roosevelt High or El 
Sereno and Belvedere junior highs could "owe" the Barrons money if they came up 
short, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of families were given credit to do all their shopping there. "A lot 
of people around here didn't have credit cards or bank accounts," she said, 
pointing to more than 200 purchase records filed in a battered wooden box. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the store's worn counter, an antique cash register still had a few 
dollars inside Saturday. Nearby, a roll-top desk was crammed with old receipts, 
money order forms and memories. 
</P>
<P>
 There were photographs of Lucy and Jerry Barron taken at various Eastside 
events. Old snapshots showed them after their 1942 marriage and him in his 
World War II Navy uniform. There was a view of the Popular Department Store 
shortly after its opening in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
 It took more than five hours for the St. Vincent workers to remove the 
merchandise and box up the bottles of perfume, aspirin and hundreds of other 
sundries that lined store shelves. Then they took most of the shelving too: it 
will be used at their thrift shop. 
</P>
<P>
 The stream of visitors remained steady. Old customers who had become old 
friends listened grimly as Martinoff said that Jerry Barron's funeral is 
planned for 8:30 a.m. Tuesday at the Sacred Heart of Jesus Church in Lincoln 
Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 And that Lucy Barron isn't coming back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been coming here since 1957. I bought clothing, shoes, gloves on credit 
for many years," said Jose Villapando, 70. "I will miss them." 
</P>
<P>
 Christine Miramontez, who has operated a barber shop two doors down from the 
store, said nobody on City Terrace Drive should be surprised that the Barrons 
gave their store to the community in the end. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lucy and Jerry have given so much to this community," she said. "They were 
pillars of strength for all of us."

SCOTT HARRIS: WRESTLING WITH THEIR CONSCIENCE; IN THE RING AT SLAMMERS, AS IN 
LIFE, CHEATERS OFTEN PROSPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In one corner stood Hombre de Oro, the barefoot "Man of Gold" from Sonora, 
Mexico, a crowd favorite resplendent in his gilded mask. Lusty boos greeted his 
opponent, Beautiful Bruce Beaudine of Santa Monica. His trunks were a hot pink, 
with a red heart on his butt. And his hair was perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 The bell clanged. Inside this curious little gym in Sun Valley, Good and Evil 
were at war once again. 
</P>
<P>
 The wrestlers prowled the ring looking for an opening. Hombre de Oro was 
quick, but Beautiful Bruce managed to slip away, provoking catcalls from the 
hecklers. The zebra-clad ref ordered Bruce to wrestle. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the gladiators engaged in a tangle of arms and legs. Hombre de Oro 
had the advantage, but Beautiful Bruce managed to reach the turnbuckle. 
"Break!" the ref ordered. The Man of Gold released his grip -- and then reached 
out and mussed Bruce's coiffure. Fifty-odd spectators laughed and cheered. 
</P>
<P>
 Enraged, Beautiful Bruce counterattacked, but soon Hombre dazed him with a 
body slam. Then, in a remarkable display of athletic prowess, Hombre balanced 
on a top rope and then bounded to another, slingshotting himself into the 
befuddled Bruce. Then Hombre locked his legs around the pretty boy's head. 
</P>
<P>
 A heckler couldn't resist a political question. "Bruce!" he called out. "This 
may be a bad time, but how do feel about 187?" 
</P>
<P>
 Funny, but I can't remember the result. Did Hombre de Oro defeat Beautiful 
Bruce fair and square? Or did Bruce cheat and triumph? My notes are unclear. 
Bruce, bad guy that he is, definitely cheated. It's that way in pro wrestling. 
The ref gets distracted and the bad guy pulls a dirty trick. Bruce's favorite 
move was to strangle Hombre with his pink towel. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes Good wins. Sometimes Evil wins. At the Slammers Wrestling 
Federation, as in life, cheaters often prosper -- at least temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
 People who complain that the San Fernando Valley is a cultural wasteland may 
not be aware of Slammers, a unique institution tucked among the auto-salvage 
yards at 12165 Branford St. It's the headquarters of Verne (The Head Slammer) 
Langdon's homage to the sport, art and drama that is pro wrestling. Here, 
Langdon, a veteran wrestler, has created a living, breathing, grunting, 
groaning, sweating, bleeding diorama to one of America's most flamboyant and 
enduring pastimes. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a school where Langdon teaches guys off the street the tricks of the 
trade. It's a venue where a card of "grudge matches" between Langdon's students 
are staged on the first Sunday of each month. And it's home to what Langdon 
says is the only museum in the world devoted to pro wrestling, boasting an 
impressive collection of memorabilia from the incomparable Gorgeous George, the 
champ who packed arenas in the '40s and '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 Langdon's collection includes the sterling-silver flit gun that Gorgeous 
George's valet would use to spray the ring with "Chanel No. 10" before each 
match, and several of his luxuriantly feminine robes. "Doesn't he look like a 
wedding cake?" Langdon says, looking up at a giant photo of the berobed one. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that there's no such thing as Chanel No. 10. Credibility has always 
been strained by pro wrestling. What began as traveling vaudeville has been a 
staple of television since the early days of the medium. Today, the idols are 
people like Hulk Hogan and Randy (Macho Man) Savage and other cartoon figures 
in the flesh. Langdon, who gives his age as "younger than God," misses the old 
days at the Olympic Auditorium, "when Dick Lane was wrestling and Johnny (Red 
Shoes) Dugan was the ref." 
</P>
<P>
 Those of us who were children then might recall the hypnotic hold of the 
black-and-white images of roller derby and pro wrestling, punctuated by Dick 
Lane's trademark shouts of "Whoa, Nellie!" Back then, I cheered on such good 
guys as Pedro Morales, Bobo Brazil, Haystack Calhoun and Mil Mascaras. On the 
side of darkness were the Destroyer, Killer Karl Kox and Freddy Blassie. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people trace America's loss of innocence to Nov. 22, 1963, but at least 
we knew that Evil had triumphed, be it in the form of a lone gunman or a grand 
conspiracy. I prefer to think that our moral compass went awry when Freddy 
Blassie, a soul beyond redemption, somehow became a good guy. Historians may 
try to prove me wrong, but as I recall it, Blassie's rehabilitation began with 
a bunch of frat boys who attended televised matches and exhorted Blassie with 
chants of "Bite, Freddy, bite! Bite, Freddy, bite!" 
</P>
<P>
 Never before had such a dastardly villain inspired such cheers. Dick Lane was 
taken aback, but then other fans started cheering for Blassie, too. The only 
thing to do was to make him a good guy -- a good guy who bit people, a good guy 
who cheated. It was a milestone in the sad corruption of American values. 
</P>
<P>
 But at Slammers, at least, it seems that the good guys still play by the rules 
-- unless, of course, they have to pay the bad guys back in kind. And, 
sometimes, the bad guys are very, very bad. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We get muscleheads in here that think they're going to be the next 
heavyweight champ, but they don't last five minutes in the ring," Langdon says. 
"They come out and say, 'How do you guys take the pain?' 
</P>
<P>
 "We say you've got to love it. . . . We have a great respect for the sport. 
We're known for wrestling the way it used to be on TV." 
</P>
<P>
 At Slammers, the bad guys include Movie Star Mike, formerly known as Malicious 
Mike. His day job is installing windows, but he changed his wrestling name 
after getting a bit part wrestling in the movie "Ed Wood." He likes to attack 
opponents with a metal folding chair. 
</P>
<P>
 Another bad guy is Dynamite D, who likes to flex in the ring and kiss his 
biceps. After a 16-year-old fan at ringside named Kevin Kleinrock heckled him 
with catcalls of "Diana!" and "Princess!" Dynamite D responded by covering one 
nostril and blowing his nose on the young man, much to the audience's 
amusement. "It's his favorite move," Kevin said later.  
</P>
<P>
 This Sunday ended with a title match between Movie Star Mike and Jeff 
Lindberg, the reigning SWF champion. Lindberg is a Pierce College student and 
the manager of a Mail Boxes, Etc. outlet.  
</P>
<P>
 Movie Star Mike was indeed malicious. He cheated, of course, and beat Lindberg 
until blood streamed down his forehead. Verne (The Head Slammer) Langdon came 
to Lindberg's rescue, wielding a metal folding chair to give the Movie Star the 
proverbial taste of his own medicine. After the ref found a church key in the 
Movie Star's hand, he was disqualified and Lindberg was declared the winner. 
For a moment, all seemed right in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The blood certainly looked real. The Head Slammer suggested that a taste would 
remove any doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 That, I decided, wouldn't be necessary.

A TRIBUTE TO A NATIVE SON -- AND ROCK ICON; PACOIMA: RECREATION CENTER IS 
RENAMED FOR RITCHIE VALENS, '50S MUSIC IDOL AND HERO TO MANY IN THIS LARGELY 
LATINO COMMUNITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For years, the Paxton Park & Recreation Center has perched precariously on the 
borderline between two competing gangs, playing stage to their sometimes 
violent rivalries, its cinder-block walls plastered with turf graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a peace has been delivered in an unlikely form: large metallic block 
letters spelling the name Ritchie Valens. Saturday, the center's official name 
was changed to honor the late Valens, the 1950s rock 'n' roll idol and native 
son to this largely Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles city park officials in September erected the new sign on Laurel 
Canyon Boulevard. Since then, gang tempers at the center have cooled and the 
graffiti has vanished. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at those walls! Just like that, the graffiti was gone -- it was dead, 
disappeared," said Francisco Flores, a local junior high school teacher who 
spearheaded the drive to rename the recreation center. "With Ritchie's name 
hanging up there, this place has become like a shrine. The kids won't touch it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even 35 years after his death, the name Ritchie Valens still means something 
to young people here," Flores said. "He was the James Dean of the Latino 
community, who once went to school right here. . . . For these young Chicanos, 
it's a badge of honor to protect our legends." 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, gang members -- many of whom circulated petitions that helped 
make the day possible -- were among the crowd who celebrated the center's 
dedication, along with about 30 relatives of the late musician, all on hand to 
revel in the spirit of Valens' achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 For Ernestine Reyes, 56, the ceremony is part of a newfound recognition of her 
nephew that she hopes will signal the celebration of other Latino icons. Six 
years ago, the Pacoima homemaker led the drive to have Valens' name installed 
on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. More recently, she has seen his name and image 
minted on a new postage stamp. 
</P>
<P>
 "There aren't enough Latinos up there with their names in lights for young 
people to emulate," she said. "Sure, we have rocker Carlos Santana and the 
actor James Edward Olmos, but we need more, many more, to show that we are a 
people of talent and courage." 
</P>
<P>
 The weekend crowd, many of them mothers and fathers pushing baby strollers, 
came to honor one of their own who made it. 
</P>
<P>
 Valens, whose brief 16-month rise to stardom was fueled by the hits "La 
Bamba," "Donna" and "Come On, Let's Go," died in an Iowa plane crash Feb. 3, 
1959 along with fellow teen-age heartthrob Buddy Holly and J. P. (The Big 
Bopper) Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
 In the center's gym, friends and family members sold Valens T-shirts and 
buttons. They displayed concert posters -- including one advertising his last 
performance in Clear Lake, Iowa, the day before his death. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a pair of roller skates he once wore and even the guitar his mother 
once bought him at a local Sears store, the one he took to shop class to sand 
down and repaint, and the same instrument that helped launch him to stardom. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Reyes, the piece of memorabilia that struck close to her heart was 
displayed on the stage -- the silk maroon shirt and black gabardine pants with 
the fake diamond studs -- the outfit Valens wore on his first appearance on the 
Dick Clark show. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't look at this suit without all the memories flooding back about 
Ritchie," said Reyes, who was three years older than Valens when he died. "He 
was such a talented young man, so full of confidence! Gosh, I miss him." 
</P>
<P>
 She recalled the day she and her husband drove the 16-year-old Valens to pick 
up the suit at the old Nudie's Western Wear in North Hollywood. "As soon as we 
got home, he tried it on for us," she said. "He was so nervous he smoked a 
cigarette, and he never smoked. This was the first suit he ever bought. Before 
that, my husband had lent him most of his clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just stood there with a big smile across his face, strumming his guitar," 
she said. "He looked beautiful! I told him, 'Ritchie, you should be in 
Hollywood with all that glitter,' and he just looked at me and said, 'Tia, 
we're gonna make it big. We're gonna be bigger than Elvis!' " 
</P>
<P>
 For many teen-agers at the dedication, Valens and his music still mean 
something. "The stuff I listen to today," said 17-year-old Rigoberto Paz, "most 
of it is based in some way on the music he played." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Gloria Balcorta, a 14-year-old niece of the late singer: "Our uncle was 
the first Latino of rock. He was a kid who didn't have anything, but he had a 
dream about being a singer and he went for it. He's still an inspiration to all 
of us." 
</P>
<P>
 At a nearby table, Gil Rocha, who first hired Valens, recalled his first 
impressions of the teen-ager who auditioned for a part in his band, the 
Silhouettes. "Actually, I was looking for a saxophone player, but I listened to 
him anyway," he said. "When he took out his little guitar, I almost laughed. 
But as soon as I heard him play, I knew he had talent." 
</P>
<P>
 Months later, Rocha said, hundreds of local teen-agers jammed the tiny 
drive-in theater that once stood on the same spot where the park and recreation 
center is today. They had come to see Valens' new movie, "Go, Johnny, Go." 
</P>
<P>
 When the film was finished, something strange happened, Rocha recalled: People 
started honking their horns. "It was the most amazing thing I'd ever seen," he 
said. "The horn blaring went on for minutes, shaking the earth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking back, I think it was just a bunch of poor Latino kids saying thanks 
to Ritchie for achieving his dream and giving them some hope as well."

HYPOCRISY VS. THE WHISTLE-BLOWER; JURY UPHOLDS A CLAIM THAT A PUBLIC-SPIRITED 
WORKER WAS PUNISHED FOR TELLING THE TRUTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eight years have passed since federal legislation was enacted that enlisted 
citizens in a campaign against corruption by companies doing business with the 
federal government. We applauded the legislation because it figured to increase 
the chances of uncovering fraud and wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 It's true that the motivations of whistle-blowers come in several flavors. 
Some are admirably public-spirited. Some are simply mean-spirited, and others 
operate out of pure self-interest. At this point, it sounds as if Tarzana 
resident Sohrab Haroonian, a former senior test engineer for a Burbank firm, 
falls into the first of those taste-test categories. 
</P>
<P>
 Haroonian claims that he was asked to write false reports on defective 
components. He says he blew the whistle because "I have a good friend whose 
father is like my own father to me, and he had a heart valve. . . . One day one 
of these parts could end up in his heart -- I would be responsible." 
</P>
<P>
 Haroonian says that he was demoted, and then fired, for his actions. His story 
was convincing enough for a Glendale Superior Court jury to order the company 
to pay him $200,000 in lost wages and $150,000 for emotional distress. 
Attorneys for the company say that they will appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 What is disturbing, however, is Haroonian's claim that he has become a pariah 
because of the whistle-blowing and because of the lawsuit. No one, he claims, 
will hire him because he didn't keep his mouth shut. 
</P>
<P>
 We don't know what will happen to this case on appeal. Higher courts may rule 
in favor of the company. But Haroonian's first round victory in Glendale 
Superior Court adds weight to his claims. 
</P>
<P>
 So often, we as citizens are called upon to report misdeeds. We tell children 
that they must defy loyalties and report peers who bring weapons to school. 
From everything from television shows such as "America's Most Wanted" to hot 
lines by which people can report graffiti vandalism, the public stance is that 
it is right and proper to come forward and tell what it is that we know. Those 
who seek to punish the honest whistle-blower expose a terrible hypocrisy and 
set an awful example.

VALLEY BRIEFING: THE WPA PROJECTS; PUBLIC ART THROUGHOUT THE SAN FERNANDO 
VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was the worst of times for money, but one of the best for art. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Great Depression, artists who were literally starving were kept 
alive and working by government programs that paid them to make murals, 
sculptures, mosaics and other works that could be seen and enjoyed by the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 These programs, like many of the New Deal era, were primarily aimed at putting 
food on the table, but left a staggering legacy: 18,000 sculptures, 4,000 
murals and more than 100,000 easel paintings, photographs and posters. 
</P>
<P>
 The works constitute an unprecedented public art movement in the United 
States. Although the works are commonly called WPA art, the Works Progress 
Administration was only one of several federal agencies that sponsored artists. 
</P>
<P>
 The Depression era programs were enormously popular with the public. One 
exhibit of paintings sponsored by the Public Works of Art Project at the Los 
Angeles Museum of Art attracted 33,000 visitors, breaking all attendance 
records for a California art exhibition. And communities that previously had no 
public art treasured the subsidized works -- sometimes by well known artists -- 
that adorned their post offices, schools, parks and government buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 But a number of the murals and sculptures were controversial because they were 
viewed as having leftist or risque content. Some were dismantled not long after 
they were installed. 
</P>
<P>
 Many others have disappeared in the decades since the Depression art programs 
ended, often from neglect. "After World War II, people wanted to forget the 
Depression," said art historian Orville Clarke Jr., who is writing a book about 
the public art movement in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one cared very much about these works, many of which are just incredible," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a mural depicting "San Fernando Indians" by well known painter 
Fletcher Martin has long since disappeared from the wall where it hung at North 
Hollywood High School. A Brief History 
</P>
<P>
 But at least five of the artworks in the San Fernando Valley have survived and 
can be viewed anyone wishing to seek them out. 
</P>
<P>
 Canoga Park High School: Two large, outdoor murals hang on the walls of the 
Assembly Hall, a Spanish-style building that was also a government project. The 
murals were created by Helen Lundeberg, whose numerous well-known public works 
also include a 240-foot-long wall mosaic in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 The high school murals, made of cement and crushed stone in a process called 
Petracrome, show progress in scientific discoveries from prehistoric to modern 
times. The work can be seen through the school gates at the corner of Topanga 
Park Boulevard and Vanowen Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale Community College: According to Clarke, not much is known about an 
unpretentious fountain in the campus quad near a bookstore and administration 
building. Created out of small tiles, this charming work about five feet tall 
has three tiers. The bottom square shows fish frolicking in the ocean, the 
middle, six-sided tier shows prehistoric villagers, and the eight-sided top 
depicts birds in flight. 
</P>
<P>
 The work, which Clarke said is by Archibald Garner, no longer functions as a 
fountain, but structually appearts to be in good shape. The college address is 
1500 Verdugo Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank Post Office: One of the "People of Burbank" murals by painter Barse 
Miller offers a reminder of the industry that made this community a boom town. 
High up on the southern lobby wall of the post office at 135 E. Olive Ave. is 
Miller's 1940 stylized depiction of an airplane factory scene. The other mural 
in the set shows a dance scene being filmed for a movie, an early reflection on 
the media industry that still thrives in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando Post Office: Well-known artist Gordon Newell worked with Sherry 
Peticolas to create several post office murals during this era. Their murals 
were wood reliefs, rather than paintings or mosaics. 
</P>
<P>
 This seven-panel work on the post office lobby at 308 S. Maclay Ave. is 
entitled "Transportation of the Mail" and depicts a truck, ship, horse, 
airplane, train and stagecoach. The work is in wonderful condition and is 
treasured by postal workers, who said they made sure it was well protected when 
the interior of the building was recently painted. 
</P>
<P>
 Canoga Park Post Office: Maynard Dixon, one of the most famous of all West 
Coast painters, was near the end of his career at the time of the 
Depression-era art programs, but in 1942 he contributed the spectacular 
"Palomino Ponies -- 1840" mural that can be seen in the lobby of the small post 
office at 21801 Sherman Way. 
</P>
<P>
 Against a pure blue sky, the mural depicts a horseman chasing a pack of 
sand-colored ponies across a bleak plain. On either side of the mural, which is 
in pristine condition, are strips of geometric patterns in a Southwestern 
design.

PLAYHOUSE SALE PUTTING ROOFS OVER HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of architects and home-builders raised $144,000 to help the homeless 
Saturday, auctioning off elaborate playhouses for children to a crowd of 600 at 
a dinner at the Hard Rock Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 The homes included "Once Upon a Time," an English country cottage with 
hand-carved beams and a hardwood, parquet floor.It went to the highest bidders 
of the night, Harry and Julie Eberlin of Corona del Mar, who paid $27,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was "Home Sweet Home," a California Craftsman complete with running 
water and a television wired for cable, which earned the grand prize and sold 
for $22,000. 
</P>
<P>
 And a down-to-the-details replica of the famed Mickey Mouse digs at 
Disneyland's Toontown which brought in $10,000, "was a real bargain," according 
to auction co-chair Don Jacobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's event was the third annual playhouse auction organized by HomeAid, 
a nonprofit group that has raised $4.5 million and built 19 shelters for the 
homeless in Orange County over the past five years. On Monday, the group will 
break ground on a shelter for battered women. 
</P>
<P>
 So far this year, Jacobs said, HomeAid has helped 1,500 people get off the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The playhouses are eight feet by 10 feet and about seven-and-a-half feet tall, 
with working locks on the doors and durable weather-proofing. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will probably last as long as any house," Jacobs said.

MAN, 50, SHOT TO DEATH IN PARKING LOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 50-year-old man was found shot to death in the parking lot of an adult 
bookstore early Saturday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers responded about 2:30 a.m. to a call that shots had been fired outside 
the Talk of the Valley bookstore in the 15400 block of Devonshire Street in 
Mission Hills, Los Angeles Police Sgt. Joe Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Michael Englander of Canoga Park was dead at the scene from a 
single gunshot wound to the upper body. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores said detectives are looking for four men in connection with the 
shooting, but he did not elaborate.

POLITICS '94: A BEHIND-THE-SCENES LOOK AT ORANGE COUNTY'S POLITICAL LIFE ; IN A 
POINTED MEETING, FERGUSON CLAIMS CHIEF OF O.C. GOP AIDS HIS FOE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mad as Heck: The local Republicans' big election victory celebration Tuesday 
at the Westin Hotel hadn't even begun when party leaders began 
fighting--literally--over the next big political battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before the party started, Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) 
angrily grabbed Orange County Republican Party Chairman Thomas Fuentes by the 
lapels and told him in unfriendly terms that he didn't appreciate Fuentes 
taking sides in the upcoming three-way contest to succeed state Sen. Marian 
Bergeson (R-Newport Beach). 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson, who has announced his candidacy for the special election early next 
year, is expected to face Assembly members Doris Allen (R-Cypress) and Ross 
Johnson (R-Placentia). 
</P>
<P>
 The feud between the two has been simmering for some time. So what finally 
caused the blowup? Ferguson claims Johnson was picked by Fuentes to give the 
Pledge of Allegiance at two GOP rallies featuring Gov. Pete Wilson--one last 
Sunday at the Orange County Fairgrounds and another on Monday in Ferguson's 
district. Tuesday, Ferguson's volunteers were told they couldn't place his 
campaign banners in the hotel ballroom for the victory celebration. The signs 
went up after Ferguson and Fuentes "talked." 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't hit a person lower than myself," Ferguson said sheepishly when 
asked about the incident. "I just explained to him that I didn't think it was 
proper for the chairman of the party to be encouraging and abetting an 
assemblyman . . . to run in my district. I didn't think that was very smart, 
since I am bigger than he is." 
</P>
<P>
 Fuentes could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Who was that masked man?: Days before the election, there were numerous 
reports of Bob Dornan sightings around the haunts of the Garden Grove 
Republican's Democratic opponent. One day he was spotted in the parking garage 
across the street from Mike Farber's headquarters; another day he was at a 
union hall where Farber's volunteers were running a telephone bank operation. 
</P>
<P>
 But even the Democrats were amused when he showed up Monday at the Democratic 
campaign headquarters of 69th Assembly District candidate Mike Metzler, whose 
staff included ex-Farber workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan complained about Farber, congratulated Metzler for running a "very fine 
campaign," and then posed for pictures with Democratic campaign workers, 
including one photo in front of an American flag with Al Chavez, Metzler's 
volunteer coordinator. "I was star-struck," Chavez said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Quotes of the Week: "At the end of 1984, there were two Democrats left, me and 
(former California Democratic Party Chairman) Dick O'Neill. Tom Umberg's back 
here now, so now I guess there's three of us."  
</P>
<P>
 --Former Orange County Democratic Chairman Howard Adler, after his party's 
humiliating election defeats, including that of Umberg, who gave up his central 
Orange County Assembly seat to run unsuccessfully for state attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the new Republican leadership will be more forceful and less 
arrogant, and that's possible if you keep a good heart."  
</P>
<P>
 --Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach), the morning after the election.

<P>
 (Down arrow) The voters in the 67th and 72nd Assembly districts, who won't be 
seeing much of their reelected Assembly members, Doris Allen and Ross Johnson. 
Even before the polls closed Tuesday, they let it be known they plan to run for 
Bergeson's state Senate seat. For Johnson, that means re-registering to vote in 
an area outside the Assembly district he now represents. 
</P>
<P>
 (Up arrow) Yorba Linda political consultant Robert Kiley, who led the 
successful Proposition 187 campaign. Until this year, he had never managed a 
major statewide campaign, primarily focusing on local measures and the City 
Council election of his wife, Yorba Linda Mayor Barbara Kiley. 
</P>
<P>
 (Down arrow) Santa Ana Mayor-elect Miguel A. Pulido Jr., who won the election 
but lost some animo. Shortly before the election, Pulido came out against 
Proposition 187, espousing the argument that it would deny public education to 
illegal immigrants and turn health officials into Immigration and 
Naturalization Service agents. Then, on election eve, he sent out a mailer 
claiming he opposed the measure "because it does not go far enough." 
</P>
<P>
 (Down arrow) Farber, who, despite a highly spirited and costly campaign 
against Dornan, garnered only 37% of the vote--less than the 41% received by 
stealth candidate Robert J. Banuelos in his race against Dornan in 1992. Exit

THE LIVING PLANET'S BEAT; NATURE-MINDED COFFEEHOUSE HOSTS SIERRA CLUB BOOKSTORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sunday nights are known as drum Sundays here at the Living Planet coffeehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Pulsing to the beat of a dozen drummers seated in a circle, mug-sipping 
patrons unconsciously tap their feet to the relentless rhythms. Outside, a 
crowd of teen-agers attracted by the music ride skateboards back and forth 
along downtown sidewalks. And in a far part of the room, a group of young women 
sporting long hair and tie-dyed skirts stand undulating with closed eyes as if 
moved by spirits all their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, every once in a while, someone ventures over toward the bookstore in the 
corner dedicated to preserving the Bolsa Chica wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 Living Planet -- described by its owners as an organic coffeehouse -- is host 
to myriad colorful events. There are yoga classes, Tarot sessions, poetry 
readings, live concerts, and the ever-popular "women's spirit night" during 
which women are encouraged to literally beat their own drums. Recently the 
establishment sponsored an outdoor poetry reading by Allen Ginsberg, the 
archetypal beatnik poet, and next year organizers hope to hold a "goddess 
weekend" for those so inclined. 
</P>
<P>
 The place is also the home of something to which nature-loving goddess 
worshipers might well relate. It is the Sierra Club Bookstore, the 
environmental group's only store in Los Angeles or Orange counties and the 
major source of income for the organization's Preserve Bolsa Chica Task Force. 
Its mission: to help save from development the approximately 1,700 acres of the 
famous wetlands near Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Williams, a spokesman for the Sierra Club's Angeles Chapter, which runs 
the bookshop, says marrying the store to the coffeehouse has worked out well. 
"There are always lots of people coming in there who are environmentally 
conscious and supportive of saving the planet from exploitation," he said. 
"There's a lot of commonality between what they're doing and what we're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Tony Moss, co-owner of the coffeehouse: "This is a way for our regular 
customers to know where their dollars go." 
</P>
<P>
 The partnership between the two entities began earlier this year after the 
Sierra Club hired Moss, who is also a dancer and singer, to do a benefit 
performance for the Bolsa Chica wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of the few remaining open spaces," the 31-year-old coffeehouse owner 
said of the wetlands, stretching along Pacific Coast Highway between Huntington 
Beach and Newport Beach. "We feel that it's important to preserve." 
</P>
<P>
 From there it was a short step to agreeing to make the coffeehouse the 
bookstore's permanent home. 
</P>
<P>
 Occupying a corner, the bookstore -- which has been operating since August -- 
sells mostly books, calendars and greeting cards, all consistent with the 
organization's environmental theme. Immediately adjacent to it, the 
coffeehouse's regular gift shop offers candles, incense, drums, pottery, 
backpacks, T-shirts and wind chimes. And beyond a small wooden bridge lies the 
coffeehouse itself, a large airy room providing patrons with an opportunity to 
relax amid art-decked walls, hanging plants, a koi pond built into the floor 
and a stage complete with another pond for turtles. 
</P>
<P>
 Moss estimated that the bookshop generates about $460 a month for the Sierra 
Club's efforts to preserve Bolsa Chica. "It's been very successful," Williams 
said of the venture. "It's become our major source of income." 
</P>
<P>
 All of the money, Williams said, goes toward supporting the task force's 
campaign to prevent development in or around the wetlands. The Koll Real Estate 
Group, which owns most of the land, has proposed building 4,286 homes there -- 
a project the Sierra Club opposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, Williams said, the money generated by the bookstore helps 
pay for flyers, postage, information packets for government officials and the 
publication of a newsletter explaining the task force's positions. 
</P>
<P>
 During the recent election, he said, some of the bookstore money helped pay 
for mailers announcing the Sierra Club's endorsements for seats on the 
Huntington Beach City Council and the Orange County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking forward to the income getting better and better," Williams 
said. "We're hoping to start organizing one big (fund-raising) activity at the 
coffeehouse each month." 
</P>
<P>
 During the recent drum Sunday, environmental consciousness seemed much at the 
fore -- and that mind set provided fertile soil for both venues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I come here to feel free from the pressures of life," said Malia Ribeiro, 16, 
a high school student from nearby Lakewood. "It's like an escape; the drumming 
makes me feel free and in touch, it symbolizes giving to the Earth." 
</P>
<P>
 Meegan Connolly, 24, an art student just "passing through" from Missoula, 
Mont., expressed similar sentiments. "I love this," she said of the jungle-like 
rhythm. "It gives you a beat inside yourself and makes you want to do 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 For many, "doing something" ultimately means contributing to what they 
perceive as an environmental cause by spending their money at a place like 
Living Planet and its bookstore.

CRASH INJURES WOMAN; WITNESSES SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police are seeking witnesses to a car crash late Thursday that left a woman 
seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Bloedel, 33, of Fullerton sustained multiple fractures and internal 
injuries when her late-model, silver Buick sedan was struck by a gray pickup 
truck about 11:30 p.m. Thursday at Harbor Boulevard and Orangethorpe Avenue, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested the driver of the pickup, 34-year-old Kelly Jenson of Anaheim, 
on suspicion of felony drunk driving. Jenson, who was not injured in the 
accident, is being held in the city's jail in lieu of posting $25,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Hal Stevens said police received numerous calls reporting the incident, 
but none of the witnesses were still at the scene when officers arrived. "We 
would like to talk to anyone who saw the accident so we can establish what 
happened," Stevens said.

ARTIST HOPES ELEPHANTINE AQUARIUM MAKES A BIG SPLASH; SCULPTURE: VALENCIA MAN 
LOOKS TO SELL A FIVE-FOOT-TALL, 300-GALLON ACRYLIC TANK HE CREATED. THE PRICE 
TAG -- $120,000. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If a Christmas gift from the mall just won't do this year, Valencia resident 
Tom Wise has created an eccentric alternative to fruitcake and sweaters. 
</P>
<P>
 How about a five-foot-tall, elephant-shaped aquarium? Ordering the 
acrylic-sculpted tank is as simple as picking up the phone and calling the 
toll-free number for the 1994 Neiman-Marcus Christmas book. 
</P>
<P>
 Paying for the tank, however, is another matter. The 300-gallon aquarium costs 
$120,000. Fish are not included. 
</P>
<P>
 "It should have fish that cost $2,000 to $3,000 apiece in it, and I just don't 
give those away," Wise said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wise, 49, who specializes in large sculptures, spent three years making the 
Indian elephant sculpture at his Valencia studio. He said because elephants 
seem to enjoy water, an aquarium resembling one is not so unusual. Besides, he 
said, it will probably be easier to sell than a large sea creature. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem with a blue whale is not everybody likes it," he said. "Everybody 
likes the good-luck elephant." 
</P>
<P>
 The elephant design is also more adaptable for aquarium functions because the 
filter pump and electrical hookup are concealed in one of its gold-covered 
feet, Wise said. The tank weighs about 300 pounds empty and about 10 times that 
when filled with water. 
</P>
<P>
 He finished the aquarium shortly after the Northridge earthquake and tried 
unsuccessfully to sell it to a couple of casinos. About a week later he 
approached Neiman-Marcus, which for decades has included a few bizarre items in 
its Christmas catalogue from the hundreds of inventions and creations submitted 
by people each year. 
</P>
<P>
 A committee of about a dozen Neiman-Marcus employees decided to include Wise's 
elephant because it is "something that makes people pause," said Liz Barrett, a 
spokeswoman for the Dallas-based retailer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It packs such an impact when you look at it," she said. "The fact that it's 
totally handcrafted injects people with awe." 
</P>
<P>
 The aqua-colored aquarium is about 6 1/2 feet long, 3 feet wide and 5 feet 
tall. The tusks, trunk and toes are covered with gold-leaf, and water fills 
everything but the tusks and trunk. 
</P>
<P>
 "If fish and debris got trapped in the nose you'd never get it out," Wise 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
 The elephant comes with a pedestal that hides the power cord and a hand-carved 
howdah that is placed on top of the animal. The tank plugs into a standard 
electrical outlet. 
</P>
<P>
 Wise has been interested in art since he was a child in Hollywood playing with 
modeling clay. He has spent the past 15 years sculpting everything from jewelry 
to gorillas. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he has worked mostly with bronze, Wise said he discovered acrylic 
sculptures at an art show about five years ago and was impressed by the 
material's toughness and crystal-like beauty. Experts told him creating large 
sculptures from acrylic would be impossible because conventional tools would be 
useless for carving the harder-than-bronze substance. 
</P>
<P>
 Wise solved the problem by designing his own power tools. He declined to 
provide many details about them, not wanting to invite competition into a small 
field, but said one tool has a rotating disc with an abrasive surface 130 times 
finer than any sandpaper. 
</P>
<P>
 He created the elephant from a 6-by-7-foot block of acrylic, stopping only to 
complete a few other projects he sold during those three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I'd work on it 20 hours a day, three or four days in a row," he 
said. "I just went nuts." 
</P>
<P>
 Wise was inside the elephant, polishing it, when the Northridge earthquake 
struck. He said at first he thought some friends had come by to visit and were 
shaking the aquarium as a prank. But when he started to climb out, he realized 
it was a major quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I said to myself, 'Why am I trying to get out?' " he said. "If the 
building comes down, I'll still be alive. I'll be trapped inside the elephant, 
but it won't break." 
</P>
<P>
 Several homeowners and at least one business have expressed interest in the 
elephant, said Barrett of Neiman-Marcus. She said Wise has created a mold of 
the elephant and could replicate the aquarium if the original is sold. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if we could supply one to every person that asks," she added.

 A bicyclist on a morning excursion Saturday found a body sprawled on the side

</P>
<P>
 The dead man, who has not been identified by police, was found naked near 
Pacific Coast Highway and Camino Capistrano at 6:15 a.m., said Orange County 
Sheriff's Sgt. Rex Hatch. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the strange part. He was lying on his back and his clothes were right 
next to him," Hatch said. "It's really kind of a mystery. The biggest mystery 
is why his clothes weren't on."

CRASH VICTIM IN CRITICAL CONDITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 16-year-old girl was in extremely critical condition late Saturday after 
being struck by a hit-and-run driver while leaving a school homecoming dance, 
Burbank police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl was flown to Harbor-UCLA Medical Center after the accident Friday 
night.Her companion, a 16-year-old boy, was treated for a broken arm at 
Thompson Memorial Medical Center in Burbank and released, Burbank Police Lt. 
Van Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police did not identify the two youths, but said the girl had just celebrated 
her birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple was hit by a car traveling down the wrong side of the street after 
leaving the Glendale High School formal dance at the Castaway Restaurant, 1250 
Harvard Road, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 A vehicle described as a black or dark blue-gray, 1983 to 1987 Chevrolet 
Camaro was seen "speeding from the parking lot," Miller said. "Then a witness 
heard some screeching of tires, presumably from the accident." 
</P>
<P>
 After striking the young couple, the driver fled the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the restaurant's director of catering, Rod Westmaas, the Castaway 
hosted three events Friday night: the homecoming dance with about 350 
teen-agers, a meeting of Armenian students from UCLA and a wedding party. 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe the driver was attending one of the events. 
</P>
<P>
 The Burbank Police Department is asking anyone with information about the 
accident to call (818) 953-8653.

MAN WOUNDED IN SHOOTING IN LITTLE SAIGON COFFEE SHOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One man was wounded and dozens of panicked customers fled when a gunman opened 
fire in a coffee shop Friday evening, witnesses and authorities said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting was the latest attack in a Vietnamese cafe in the Little Saigon 
area, where three people were killed and eight others wounded during a 
four-month period earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Police refused to release the name of the victim in Friday night's attack, but 
said he was in stable condition at a local hospital. Sgt. Bruce Prince of the 
gang investigations unit said police have not yet identified a suspect in the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 At 7:29 p.m., several Vietnamese juveniles entered Cafe Pensee in the 10500 
block of McFadden Avenue, according to police. One of the teen-agers pulled out 
a large-caliber revolver and started shooting, hitting a 20-year-old Anaheim 
man whom police said was an innocent bystander.  
</P>
<P>
 A business owner in the same strip mall as the coffee shop said he heard about 
four shots, then saw a man in jeans and a white T-shirt or sweater run out of 
the coffee shop heading west. Other witnesses told police they heard three or 
four shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "After that, everybody split," the business owner said.  
</P>
<P>
 A man who described himself as a regular customer at the cafe didn't let the 
shooting stop him from going there Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just bad luck," said the man, who declined to identify himself. 
"These gang members, they probably just walked in and saw somebody they hate 
and started shooting. It could happen at any coffee shop." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby cafes have seen similar attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 A teen-ager was killed at the Cafe Phuong Nga a few blocks north in July, and 
an April dispute at Cafe Truc Mai, also in Garden Grove, left three people 
wounded. Also in April, an off-duty security guard was shot dead at Pho Tien 
Canh in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 Six days before that, two men walked into the crowded Cafe Mozart, also in 
Westminster, and opened fire, killing a 20-year-old Garden Grove man and 
wounding three others.

OBITUARY; J. A. VOLPE; TRANSIT SECRETARY UNDER NIXON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Anthony Volpe, three-term governor of Massachusetts and U.S. secretary of 
transportation in the Richard Nixon Administration, has died. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
 Volpe died in a hospital Friday in Nahant, the Boston suburb where he had 
lived for 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The son of Italian immigrants and a self-made millionaire, Volpe was elected 
governor in 1960, bucking a Democratic tide that sent John F. Kennedy to the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
 After narrowly losing in 1962 to Endicott Peabody, Volpe was reelected 
governor in 1964 and in 1966 when the term changed from two to four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Volpe resigned the governorship to accept the job as transportation secretary 
for Nixon after Nixon rejected him as a running mate in favor of Spiro Agnew. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ball didn't bounce my way," Volpe said at the time. "I'm very frank in 
admitting I was somewhat disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
 A skillful engineer in business and politics, Volpe founded a successful 
construction firm during the Depression and worked his way as a Republican to 
the top of the political hill in a Democrat-dominated state. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1953, Gov. Christian A. Herter appointed him commissioner of public works 
for Massachusetts. President Dwight D. Eisenhower named Volpe interim federal 
highway administrator in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
 As a transportation expert, Volpe had a lasting impact on Southern California 
and the nation. He supervised construction of Eisenhower's interstate highway 
system in the 1950s and served during the Nixon era when the controversial 
Century Freeway was begun. 
</P>
<P>
 Volpe strongly advocated innovative safety devices such as reflector license 
plates and air bags for automobiles. He also championed mass rapid transit 
systems for urban areas, including air cushion vehicles designed to travel at 
300 m.p.h. between Los Angeles International Airport and the San Fernando 
Valley and between Los Angeles and Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of his most important efforts as Massachusetts governor were bolstering 
the near-bankrupt New Haven & Hartford Railroad and the deficit-burdened mass 
transit agency in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 When most Republicans in the state supported New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller 
in the 1968 presidential campaign, Volpe stuck with Nixon and was rewarded with 
the Cabinet appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 He served as transportation secretary until 1973, when Nixon named him 
ambassador to Italy. Volpe remained in that post for four years. 
</P>
<P>
 He served in World War II with the Seabees, the Navy's construction battalion, 
and emerged as a lieutenant commander. 
</P>
<P>
 He also was an officer of five banks and publisher of the Malden News and 
Medford Daily Mercury. 
</P>
<P>
 Volpe is survived by his wife, Giovaninna Benedetto, a daughter, Loretta Jean 
Rotondi, and a son, John Jr.

PROP. 187 TRYOUT FOLDED IN ENCINITAS IN 1980S; DESPITE ITS OWN BRUISING CIVIC 
BATTLE OVER ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION -- OR PERHAPS BECAUSE OF IT -- THE CITY KEPT A 
LOW PROFILE WHEN THE INITIATIVE PUT SIMILAR ISSUES AND A SIMILAR SCENARIO ON 
THE STATEWIDE STAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In politics, as in theater, there are dress rehearsals where the plot and the 
players are displayed before a small audience before moving to the larger 
arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Proposition 187, now center stage from Eureka to San Ysidro. 
</P>
<P>
 If California is Broadway for this political-social-cultural drama, then 
Encinitas was New Haven. 
</P>
<P>
 This prosperous seaside suburb of San Diego -- known for its flower fields and 
youth sports programs and safe neighborhoods -- became the focal point in the 
late 1980s for the rising phenomenon in California of civic anger directed at 
illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 There were other communities in San Diego and Orange counties that heard 
similar complaints from their residents at roughly the same time as Encinitas. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the television networks, the wire services and the New York Times 
wanted to do stories on the growing clash between affluent Southern California 
homeowners and impoverished immigrants, they came to Encinitas. The beachfront 
setting proved journalistically irresistible. 
</P>
<P>
 For five acrimony-filled years, Encinitas homeowners demanded that City Hall 
do something about the groups of young Latino men standing on street corners 
soliciting work as day laborers and camping on private and public property. 
</P>
<P>
 A civic ordinance was adopted to penalize employers for hiring illegal 
immigrants off street corners, but it was struck down by a federal judge in 
1990. Those in Encinitas who had complained the loudest about immigrants in 
their midst reluctantly admitted defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Given that history, you might figure Encinitas would have become a hotbed of 
Proposition 187 support -- that those same residents and politicians, having 
seen their efforts thwarted, would have been overjoyed that at long last 
something was going to be done to discourage illegal immigration and that the 
governor was playing a leading role. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
 As the debate flared statewide, Encinitas (population 57,000) was quiet. If 
anything, the city took an outward attitude of "been there, done that." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was surprising what a non-issue 187 was here," said Gregory Dennis, a 
free-lance journalist, environmental consultant and Encinitas resident. 
</P>
<P>
 Catholic and Lutheran ministers in Encinitas and an official from the local 
synagogue were part of an ecumenical movement against Proposition 187, but the 
City Council declined to take a stand. There were no campaign signs on city 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the city decisively supported the initiative at the polls, there were 
no forums and no large demonstrations. Most of the letters to the local 
newspaper dealt with a hotly debated local measure about whether to allow 
construction of a subdivision and golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 Ex-Councilwoman Marjorie Gaines, whose high-voltage fights with immigrant 
advocates were an early indication of the level the emotional rhetoric would 
reach in the statewide immigration debate, took a hands-off attitude toward 
Proposition 187. "I have chosen not to be political," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the nine candidates for City Council was willing to commit the city to 
another round of trying to rid the streets and canyons of immigrants, even 
though the legal and political winds now seem to be favoring the 
employer-sanction approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we got last time was a bunch of bad national publicity," said Councilman 
John Davis at a candidates forum. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The issue of newly arrived immigrants living in tents and cardboard lean-tos 
was waiting for the first City Council when the communities of Encinitas, 
Leucadia, Olivenhain and Cardiff-by-the-Sea incorporated as the city of 
Encinitas in 1986 to free themselves from the pro-growth attitude of the San 
Diego County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy gave the new city, 25 miles north of San Diego, a sense of 
being born into crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 At meetings that went long into the night, residents complained to the 
fledgling council of trash heaps, public urination and crime problems. Shop 
owners complained that their customers were being intimidated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody saw it coming but then the issue just exploded," said Dennis, who was 
managing editor of the North County Blade-Citizen during the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In retrospect, the scenario appears familiar: Defining illegal immigration as 
a problem. Declaring a state of emergency. Appealing to the federal government 
for help. Sending the feds a bill. Devising a proposed solution that brought 
passionate opposition from the editorial pages and cries of racism from 
immigrant advocates. Protests in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never realized we were blazing a trail for the rest of the state," City 
Manager Loren Wasserman said with a touch of sarcasm in his voice. 
</P>
<P>
 By the standards of Proposition 187, the Encinitas ordinance was mild. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance would have slapped penalties on those who employ illegal 
immigrants rather than on the immigrants, the kind of employer-sanction 
approach that even some opponents of Proposition 187 say is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also part of a compromise whereby the city opened a hiring hall for 
documented immigrants, the first such hall in San Diego County, to ensure that 
employers would treat their day laborers fairly. 
</P>
<P>
 Pam Slater, who was on the Encinitas council and now is a county supervisor, 
says that if the Encinitas ordinance had been allowed to stand and been copied 
by other communities, it might have averted the political upheaval that led to 
passage of Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought we were going in the right direction (with the ordinance and 
hiring hall), but the migrant advocates blocked us at every turn," Slater said. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "And they got Proposition 187 as a result." 
</P>
<P>
 A differing view comes from Claudia Smith, attorney for the California Rural 
League Assistance, which along with the American Civil Liberties Union sued to 
overturn the Encinitas ordinance and prevent the idea from spreading to other 
California communities. 
</P>
<P>
 To Smith, Encinitas residents were unwilling to accept the "shared humanity" 
of the immigrants. "To me, I thought it offended their aesthetic sensibilities 
to see these men standing out there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The years since the lawsuit have not softened Smith's view of Encinitas. She 
is still suing the city over its refusal to provide immigrant housing. She 
refuses to shop in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I refuse to patronize Encinitas," she said. "I hate Encinitas." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A city, of course, is more than just the sum of its public debates, and 
Encinitas has flourished despite the divisiveness of the immigration fight. 
</P>
<P>
 New subdivisions have the scrubbed, cheery look of the archetypal Southern 
California neighborhood in "E.T.," a paradise for kids on bikes. The median 
resale price of a home is $295,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic is still a hassle along the commercial intersection of Encinitas 
Boulevard and El Camino Real, but a good Cajun restaurant has opened along 
Pacific Coast Highway and the new athletic club, Frog's, received an award for 
architectural comeliness. 
</P>
<P>
 As for why Encinitas opted out of the Proposition 187 battle, it is anybody's 
guess. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis believes that the city has decided to give tolerance a chance and learn 
to live with the young men who still gather on street corners in the morning. 
"People came to understand that most of these guys are just looking for a job," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaines, who was defeated for reelection during the controversy, leans toward 
the idea that its five-year civic battle left Encinitas too exhausted over the 
topic to get emotionally involved in the fight again. 
</P>
<P>
 And she notes, with some irony, how the issue that cost her her political 
career has now moved to a bigger stage: 
</P>
<P>
 "It's strange, all the things we said then are what a lot of people are saying 
now."

ARCADIA BAGEL BAKERY ON A ROLL; BUSINESS: NEW FAST-FOOD JOINT OFFERS 
CALIFORNIA'S CONTEMPORARY ANSWER TO THE DOUGHNUT -- VIA DRIVE-THROUGH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD WINTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You drive up to the tinny voice box outside Arcadia's newest fast-food joint 
and blurt out your order. And hold the lox, you say. 
</P>
<P>
 The lox? 
</P>
<P>
 In a new twist on the quintessential California way of eating, Michael and 
Bridget Goldstein have opened what may be the country's first drive-through 
bagel bakery. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldstein's Bagel Bakery opened at 221 N. Santa Anita Ave. in September, the 
second Goldstein's outlet. The original, a 5-year-old store in Old Pasadena, 
sells 5,000 bagels daily and the new one is even busier, said Michael 
Goldstein, a 40-year-old former stockbroker who now wears shorts and a T-shirt 
to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife and I have two kids and we use the drive-through a lot because it's 
convenient," he said. "So we decided if we opened another bakery it would be a 
drive-through." 
</P>
<P>
 Based on initial business, the Arcadia bakery is expected to generate $3 
million in sales annually, twice as much as the Pasadena location, with 
one-third of the business generated by the drive-through. "Bagels have replaced 
the doughnut as the food to bring to the office," Goldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, bagel sales exceeded $500 million last year, according to the U.S. 
Department of Commerce and the research firm Information Resources. The 
Goldsteins have ridden the craze, acting as consultants for a new San Dimas 
bagel store and are talking of starting a separate fast-food chain. The Arcadia 
bakery until last year was a former dry cleaners. 
</P>
<P>
 The Goldsteins leased the site and invested $500,000 in new ovens and 
bagel-making equipment, knocking down an old building behind it for a parking 
lot, creating a patio and a drive-through lane. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't a business you can start with $20,000. I tell people who say they 
want to get in it," Goldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second time they started from a shell. In 1989 they leased the San 
Antonio Winery store at Colorado Boulevard and DeLacey Street in Old Pasadena 
and turned the shell into a bakery. In the years since, it's become a success 
as the area has become the Westwood of the '90s. "I like to think Old Pasadena 
grew as the bakery grew," Goldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 The winery went to court last year in a bid to end the bakery's lease, 
accusing it of breaching its lease terms on the now highly valuable site. After 
a jury was seated, the winery decided to settle, paying the bakery $70,000 in 
attorney's fees and providing a 40-year lease. "We put $250,000 into the site 
when Old Pasadena was zero and we weren't going to be pushed out," Goldstein 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he said, "It's a lot less stressful than being a stockbroker."

POLITICAL CORRECTNESS AT ANTELOPE VALLEY COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ignorance like that of Janice Philbin Hall in "Political Correctness: It Can 
Happen Here" (Valley Commentary, Oct. 30) is so common in my academic circles 
that I'm practically oblivious to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Having graduated at the top 5% of my class at UCLA (and currently pursuing a 
law degree), I find it rather easy to separate myself from the masses of 
supposedly enlightened people like her who think that our textbooks are just 
fine, that racism is a thing of the past and that officials who establish 
long-overdue sexual harassment policies are merely "leaping aboard the 
victimization bandwagon." 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, most history textbooks virtually ignore the brutal murder of 
Native Americans, the forced deportation and slavery of Africans, the 
victimization and subordination of women and the mass genocide of Armenians, 
Jews, homosexuals and many others during the first half of this century. 
</P>
<P>
 The world has begun to realize the Anglicized version of American life -- 
where conquerors were referred to as discoverers -- fails to capture the total 
human experience and relegates the difficult life and times of millions to a 
mere footnote. 
</P>
<P>
 I am sorry to hear of the "embarrassingly substandard" students in her English 
classes. While not everyone is destined for Phi Beta Kappa, even students who 
make "inane" comments have a right to an education. 
</P>
<P>
 As a teacher, she should put her elitist mentality behind her and make an 
effort to help those who really need it. 
</P>
<P>
 MATT BOGOSIAN 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas 
</P>
<P>
 * Janice Philbin Hall's Oct. 30 commentary article on political correctness at 
Antelope Valley College was right on. 
</P>
<P>
 As a former teacher in the Los Angeles school district, I can confirm that 
everything she said is 100% true. There is hardly any teaching going on, per 
se, as most in the educational establishment are so intent on making everyone 
"equal" so that no one comes out a winner. 
</P>
<P>
 What about the original reason for schools: plain, unadulterated teaching, to 
prepare the students and tomorrow's adults for the world that they will 
inhabit, to be able to understand a ballot, understand and appreciate 
literature and understand numbers? 
</P>
<P>
 Politically correct is politically crazy, and the sooner our ersatz education 
establishment comprehends and acts upon this, the better off we all will be.

MOSTLY, VALLEY VOTERS DID THEIR HOMEWORK; PROP. 187 SUPPORT TAINTS OTHERWISE 
LAUDABLE LIST OF WINNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The apparent reelection of Anthony Beilenson to represent the west San 
Fernando Valley in Congress suggests that these Valley voters acted like their 
congressman and made up their own minds. 
</P>
<P>
 In nine terms Beilenson has earned a reputation for determined, sometimes 
prickly, independence. He is one of a handful in Congress who spurns money from 
the political action committees of special interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet he seemed beatable in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a longtime Democratic incumbent, an unapologetic defender of the Clinton 
Administration. He was opposed by a well-financed Republican who shared his 
command of policy details, in a race nationally targeted by the Republican 
Party. The district's 39% GOP registration put it in the zone where Republicans 
usually smell victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson nevertheless emerged from Election Day on top by 3,201 votes. True, 
that is fewer than 2% of the votes cast, and the official outcome awaits the 
counting of an unknown number of absentee ballots from the 24th Congressional 
District. Republican Richard Sybert is not conceding. But his chances look 
slim. 
</P>
<P>
 To explain Beilenson's long survival, the experts talk about constituent 
service, his trips home for "town meetings" where he isn't afraid to disagree 
with his audience, his willingness to debate opponents, the respect for his 
independence of mind. 
</P>
<P>
 On issues, Beilenson seized the initiative, notably by taking an early hard 
line on illegal immigration. However, liberals who accused him of pandering to 
voters by advocating the repeal of the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment 
should note that he did not jump aboard the bandwagon for Proposition 187. He 
opposed it while Sybert supported it. Some people thought it would cost him the 
seat. Some went to bed Tuesday thinking it had. In fact it almost did, but not 
quite. 
</P>
<P>
 In other districts, party registrations made the returning of all Valley 
incumbents who sought reelection to Congress and the Legislature unremarkable. 
</P>
<P>
 In a race without an incumbent, the able Sheila James Kuehl won in the barely 
Democratic 41st Assembly District; she will be the Legislature's first open 
lesbian. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning to Washington from safe districts with Valley constituents were the 
capable Democrats Howard Berman of the East Valley and Henry A. Waxman, with a 
sliver of the southeast Valley, suddenly toiling in the minority party, plus 
Republican Carlos J. Moorhead, whose district includes Glendale and Burbank, 
and Howard P. (Buck) McKeon, representing the Santa Clarita and Antelope 
valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 Distinguishing Beilenson from the supposed rascals in Washington was not the 
only proof that Valley voters had done their homework. There was also the 
Valley's mauling of the tobacco industry's initiative. The sad fact that it 
fared relatively well in the poorer East Valley -- 10 percentage points higher 
than in the Northridge-Chatsworth area -- may have resulted from too little 
knowledge or too many smokers. In any event, the insulting initiative did no 
better than 37% anywhere in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Regrettably, the voters here supported Proposition 187, the immigration 
initiative. In fact, it fared three points better than it did statewide, 
getting 62% of the vote in the four L.A. City Council districts that lie 
entirely within the Valley. The approval ranged from 65% in the northwest 
Valley to 52% in the less-affluent and largely Latino northeast. 
</P>
<P>
 It is hardly surprising that the global backlash against population pressure 
by poor people is a powerful force here, where a deeply rooted middle class 
perceives itself to be threatened and views existing public policy as 
ineffectual. Proposition 187 is a symptom, not a cure, however -- and now come 
the lawsuits. Time will reveal the extent of its effects, intended and 
otherwise.

SUBWAY FOES CAN'T JUST 'MOVE ON' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In your original editorial on Valley transit you supported the subway route 
with the caveat that there be appropriate cautions taken to make sure the 
tunneling would not be a problem as it has been in Hollywood. I understand that 
your support was based on the need to have an alternative transportation 
infrastructure in the event of an earthquake, conditioned upon compassion for 
the local neighborhood on the safety aspects of construction and operation. 
</P>
<P>
 In your most recent editorial (Oct. 30) you now say that the subway, as 
approved by MTA, is the way to go and local homeowners who have concerns should 
just "move on." You have essentially decided to support a subway as proposed by 
its political champions. It would involve an open trench and other cost-cutting 
features that would go against 1990 state law as it pertains to the East 
Valley. This is because Mayor Richard Riordan, in his motion for subway 
approval to MTA, asked for cost-cutting measures such as these. Although his 
support for the subway is well-founded, his motion for cost-cutting measures 
was against state law and showed a disrespect to East Valley residents who were 
guaranteed a more costly but safe and sound transit system. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly any of the MTA members live in or represent our neighborhood. It is so 
tempting for them to approve a low-cost, dangerous subway quickly so it can 
compete successfully for scarce federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan, the doyen of L.A. politics in the 1990s, does not represent the East 
Valley. For the next seven months, the 5th District of the City Council (which 
includes part of the East Valley) will have no representative. Your newspaper 
should not let MTA conspire against state law and East Valley residents who are 
guaranteed an underground subway without neighborhood disturbance. Please 
understand that we do not want the MTA to shortchange us. 
</P>
<P>
 As a longtime resident, I cannot "move on" as you suggest. I have some 
responsibility to my neighborhood and to seeing that the East Valley is treated 
with the same respect as other regions of Los Angeles. At the very least, I 
have the duty to make sure the MTA obeys state law.

DOMESTIC ABUSE TEAM LONG OVERDUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When is the best time to start counseling for the victims of domestic 
violence? Right at the scene. But that has hardly been much of an option. The 
police officers are generally too consumed in subduing, arresting or at least 
calming the presumed perpetrator to devote much immediate time to the abused. 
It is at that moment that the victim is most deeply in need, and perhaps most 
easily reached with sound and sobering advice. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, Los Angeles police in Van Nuys now have such options. That LAPD 
division is the first to field a Domestic Violence Response Team, which sends 
volunteer counselors out with patrol units when they respond to domestic abuse 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Gail Pincus is one of the volunteers, and she provided invaluable help to a 
woman who was recently battered into semi-consciousness by her husband. Pincus 
accompanied the woman to a hospital, filled out the financial forms needed to 
pay her medical bills, provided counseling, and contacted the woman's 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was all alone and couldn't talk," Pincus told Times' reporter Jeff 
Schnaufer. Dealing with her immediate emotional and psychological needs "was 
not a police job," Pincus added. "They don't have the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Division Detective Mitch Robbins -- a big supporter of the volunteer 
unit -- says that his division has more domestic violence arrests than any 
other division in the Valley. As of last Sunday, the volunteers had responded 
to 69 calls, transporting some victims to safe locations and even issuing 
emergency protective orders that prevent an attacker from approaching a victim 
for five days. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the kind of program that is badly needed throughout the city. It frees 
the police to more quickly pursue other emergency calls, offers quick and 
substantial help to victims, and the program's costs to taxpayers are minimal 
because it involves volunteers. What could be better, other than ending the 
violence altogether?

VALLEY CRA PLAN PUTS LIMITS ON BUREAUCRACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bobbi Feidler's Nov. 6 article concerning the Community Redevelopment Agency, 
"Should the CRA Be Used to Help the Valley's Quake Recovery?", reveals that she 
has bad vibes about the CRA's motives in setting up six Earthquake Recovery 
Areas to help Los Angeles recover from the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Ms. Feidler says the availability of CRA help is "extremely questionable" for 
owners of single-family homes in the six recovery areas. She speculates that 
money will not be available until early 1996, or later. If the CRA does its job 
properly, both comments are incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
 Ms. Feidler also says that public services to the Valley will be reduced if 
the areas are established. This is not true. Our current property taxes will 
not increase or decrease as a result of the recovery areas. If the city reduces 
public services, it is because the city cannot budget itself correctly with the 
taxes it now receives. This is not a new problem, and has nothing to do with 
earthquake recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 What Ms. Feidler doesn't say is that the biggest problem with the CRA is the 
reputation of the agency itself as a conniving, power-mad bureaucracy whose 
main goal is to acquire private property and turn it over to a few favored 
developers at bargain-basement process. The drafting of its quake-recovery 
plans in districts other than the northwest Valley is an example of why such a 
reputation exists. 
</P>
<P>
 As now written, the proposed plans in every district except the northwest 
Valley allow the CRA to condemn property with no public input and to spend huge 
sums of money on infrastructure improvements that rightfully should be paid for 
by the city's public works department. The Northwest Valley Plan does not allow 
one cent of earthquake recovery area money to be spent on public property or 
public improvements. The money will be used only as intended, which is to help 
private property owners and businesses get back on their feet.  
</P>
<P>
 The northwest Valley is placing a cap on the amount of money the CRA can use 
for "administrative" purposes, and will have a permanent oversight committee 
composed of local residents and businesses to make sure the CRA lives up to its 
intended role in the earthquake recovery process. 
</P>
<P>
 Ms. Feidler has every reason to be suspicious of the CRA. After all, she is 
one of its commissioners and is privy to its inner workings. But instead of 
pulling back the offer of help, she should be on a crusade to make every 
earthquake recovery area plan in the city as restrictive as the one put 
together in the northwest Valley.

PARENTS' RESPONSIBILITY TO HELP CHILDREN LEARN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I agreed with almost everything Richard Kahlenberg wrote regarding parents' 
responsibility in educating their children ("It's Academic: School Success 
Starts at Home," Valley Commentary, Oct. 16). There were only two areas where I 
found myself in disagreement. 
</P>
<P>
 First was his feeling of anger toward our national education policy, implying 
that it tells parents, "Hey, it's your problem if kids don't learn anything in 
school," and secondly, his feeling that "until the schools undergo a true 
revolution, it is the parents' problem." 
</P>
<P>
 The reality is that it is not the parents' problem but the parents' 
responsibility. As parents, we need to be committed to helping our children 
reach their potential. The school's job is to teach the academic skills and 
reinforce the social skills necessary for survival in today's world. It is the 
parent's role to stress the value of that education by helping the child learn 
responsibility for completing assignments, mastering the material and 
respecting the rights of classmates to receive an undisrupted educational 
experience in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 More and more of the responsibility (and blame) for educating children has 
been willingly given to the schools by parents. The "revolution" that schools 
need is for parents once again to take charge of educating their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Academics are only a part of the learning experience. Developing good work 
habits and a respect for self-improvement will make the greatest difference in 
their adult lives. 
</P>
<P>
 So turn off the television and set up "structured time." Make the children 
accountable for completing their work carefully and preparing for tests. Help 
them learn how to manage their time. 
</P>
<P>
 It is only through their achievements that children develop a true sense of 
self-esteem and confidence.

PUBLIC INTEREST BYPASSED IN AHMANSON LAND DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Susan Genelin's analysis of the proposed Ahmanson development in upper Las 
Virgenes Valley on the Ventura side of the Los Angeles County line (Valley 
Commentary, Oct. 2) was one of the few lucid accounts we have yet had of this 
murky transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even it did not penetrate all the blue smoke and mirrors. Two more points 
should be clarified. 
</P>
<P>
 One concerns 2,600 Ahmanson acres the public has been allowed to think of as 
free parkland the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy will get in exchange for 
allowing Ahmanson's massive urbanization of its remaining land. 
</P>
<P>
 That land may not be free at all. If I understand the operative document, 
Ahmanson need only "dedicate" it, not donate it. That means the company may 
merely set it aside until the conservancy -- that is, we the public -- comes up 
with the money to buy it, at Ahmanson's price. 
</P>
<P>
 Pretty good for land unsuitable for development in the first place. Of course 
the company could donate the property, but signs of such voluntary altruism 
have so far been scarce. 
</P>
<P>
 In another dubious twist of the proposal, the 4,400-acre Runkle Ranch, north 
of the Simi Valley Freeway at Santa Susana Pass, is expected to become public 
parkland when the Ahmanson transaction goes through. Its merit as a park aside, 
it is mainly being touted as a vital part of a wildlife corridor from the Santa 
Susanas through the Simi Hills and the Santa Monicas to the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Splendid, except that a vast Ahmanson City would block that corridor as surely 
as Hoover Dam halts the Colorado River. 
</P>
<P>
 I fear the more that comes to light about the Ahmanson proposal, the more 
insane it seems. Who's looking out for the public interest here?

 * Regarding the Ventura County Board of Supervisors' vote to delay the 
private-for-public purchase of parkland ("Supervisors Favor 3-Year Extension 
For Ahmanson," Oct. 25), I have two questions: 
</P>
<P>
 Was it in the public interest to extend the purchase of the parkland? 
Certainly not. 
</P>
<P>
 Is the Board of Supervisors representing the best interest of the public, or 
the Ahmanson Land Co.?

VALLEY SWAM AGAINST THE GOP TIDE; THOUGH LOCAL VOTERS KEPT DEMOCRATS IN OFFICE, 
REPUBLICAN CONTROL OF CONGRESS COULD BRING SOME CHANGES IN DEFENSE JOBS, 
PARKLAND ACQUISITION, WATER ALLOCATION. 
</P>

<P>
 A political earthquake rocked Washington, D.C. on Tuesday night. There was no 
aftershock in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbents here kept their seats, by comfortable margins in most cases. Not 
one lost, either in Congress or the state Legislature. The open seats did not 
switch parties. Statewide, incumbent members of Congress won 94% of the seats 
they were running for, the normal percentage. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Valley went, so went California -- with a vengeance. Statewide, the 
governor won reelection with 55%. In the Valley, it was 59%. (In 1982, Tom 
Bradley's statewide losing margin to George Deukmejian in absolute numbers was 
almost exactly his losing margin in the Valley.) 
</P>
<P>
 When the Valley knows a politician and doesn't like him, it can hurt when he 
tries for higher office. Statewide, Kathleen Connell edged Tom McClintock for 
controller. In the Valley, where McClintock ran for Congress two years ago and 
where the voters know him, he lost by nearly three points. 
</P>
<P>
 In the U. S. Senate race, Dianne Feinstein appears to have narrowly beaten 
Mike Huffington by 2% of the vote. In the Valley, she doubled her lead to 4%. 
</P>
<P>
 This brings us to the hotly contested 24th Congressional District race. While 
Republicans were being swept into majorities in the House and Senate, Democrat 
Anthony C. Beilenson prevailed once again. In a smaller version of the U. S. 
Senate race, Beilenson beat Richard Sybert, who spent a considerable amount of 
his personal funds in the losing effort. Million-dollar House races are rare, 
and most of the million in this race was spent by the challenger. 
</P>
<P>
 Another candidate who swam against the Republican tide was retiring 
Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman, making a successful quest for a seat on the 
Superior Court. His opponent, John Moriarity, has been financially very active 
in the Republican Party for many years. Again, the candidate with the most 
money did not win. It was California's most expensive judicial race this 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 took 59% statewide. In the Valley it won with 62%. This 
victory included all geographic areas of the Valley, including the northeast 
Valley with its many Latino voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley voters were even more resolute in their opposition to new measures to 
finance rail transportation. Proposition 181 for new rail systems lost 
statewide 65% to 35%. In the Valley, the vote was 69% to 31%. Proposition 185 
to raise gasoline taxes to fund rail projects lost 81% to 19% statewide. In the 
Valley, it failed 84% to 16%. 
</P>
<P>
 Where did the election leave us? The Republicans in Congress now have the 
responsibility to govern, not just take potshots. Sens. Feinstein and Boxer and 
Reps. Beilenson, Berman and Waxman will be relegated to minority status. Rep. 
Carlos J. Moorhead probably will become chairman of the Energy and Commerce 
committee. Despite Howard P. (Buck) McKeon's low seniority, he's likely to pick 
up a subcommittee chairmanship, perhaps the surface transportation subcommittee 
of public works. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a Republican Congress, the next two years could witness a reduction in 
the exodus of the Valley's defense-related jobs. There could be less money to 
buy property in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. Moorhead 
and McKeon are now in positions to see that the Valley gets its fair share of 
federal programs under their committees' jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 California's water wars could heat up again with agriculture-oriented 
Republican legislators having the votes to favor the state's farmers over urban 
water users. 
</P>
<P>
 Some issues, however, will not change, such as the California congressional 
delegation's near unanimous opposition to offshore oil drilling. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The last time this type of massive shift occurred in Washington was 1946. In 
the Congress following that Republican landslide, important and enduring pieces 
of legislation passed on issues not terribly different from today's. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1947, Congress passed a landmark immigration control measure that reduced 
the number of aliens allowed legally into the country each year to 400,000. 
That law was a reaction to a flood of displaced people from Europe. The 
Taft-Hartley Act passed by the same Congress is still on the books and has 
limited the power of labor unions for 47 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Constitution was amended by that Congress to limit presidents to two 
terms. This, of course, was a reaction to Roosevelt's four trips to the White 
House. Congressional term limits are today an even larger issue. Six states 
voted on Tuesday to impose them on their representatives, bringing to 21 the 
total of states with term limitations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Congress of 48 years ago also had a Democrat in the White House. Harry 
Truman vetoed more than 200 pieces of legislation passed by the Republican 
Congress. Only 12 of his vetoes were overridden. He then went on to run against 
the "Do Nothing Congress" in 1948 and upset the favorite, Thomas Dewey. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps two thoughts sum up the Valley's vote. The first comes from the new 
Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich. Six years ago he said: "In every election 
in American history both parties have their cliches. The party that has the 
cliches that ring true wins." 
</P>
<P>
 The other thought comes from Shakespeare: "For nothing can seem foul to those 
that win." We'll have to wait and see who's holding their nose two years from 
now.

AFTER THE VOTE, VALLEY LOSES PLACE IN LINE; WITH GOP ASCENDANCY IN CONGRESS, 
PROSPECTS FADE FOR LOCAL REPRESENTATIVES TO MAKE THE MOST OF THEIR SENIORITY --

 When I was a boy, my dad said, "Son, they told me if I voted for Barry 
Goldwater, there'd be a war. Sure enough, I voted for Goldwater and there was a 
war." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last few weeks, I've been imploring the few friends who look to me 
for voting advice to put aside their frustrations with Washington and back the 
powerful Democrats who can bring home the bacon -- or pork, as the case may be 
-- to help rebuild the Valley, put more police on the street and provide good 
jobs for our friends and neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 If my dad were around today, he might say, "Son, they told me if I voted for 
Rich Sybert, we'd lose our political clout. Sure enough, I voted for Sybert and 
we lost our clout." 
</P>
<P>
 With a Democratic majority, we were just beginning to realize the benefits of 
having three Valley congressmen high on the seniority ladder. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Henry Waxman, who represents parts of Studio City, was chairman of the 
health and environment subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee and 
was considered by many the likely choice to be the next chairman of the full 
committee. With jurisdiction over business, transportation and environmental 
issues such as air quality, Waxman was in a key position to help the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson, who represents the West Valley and is the chief 
fund-raiser for the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy in Congress, was poised, 
due to his key relationships in the House, to work with the Clinton 
Administration to bring even more federal dollars to our area to protect open 
space and buy parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Howard Berman, who represents the East Valley, spearheaded the effort to 
make sure the Valley would be home to the design and manufacture of the 
electric car. Berman also has been browbeating Congress and the Administration 
for 1,000 more police officers for the Valley. The restoration of blighted 
Hansen Dam is finally under way after 14 years! 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with a Republican majority in Congress, next year's funding for Hansen 
Dam is in doubt -- as is much else. 
</P>
<P>
 The mantle of Valley leadership could pass to Rep. Carlos J. Moorhead 
(R-Glendale), who must have felt like a kid in a candy store when the GOP took 
the House. The 22-year House veteran is in line to get his pick of the 
chairmanships of two of the most powerful committees in the House: Judiciary or 
Energy and Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Judiciary is important from a local perspective. Civil rights, copyrights 
(many of the large studios are in his district), not to mention the death 
penalty, immigration and expansion of the "three-strikes" punishment are all 
within the committee's domain. 
</P>
<P>
 As good as Judiciary is, Energy and Commerce is the big enchilada. It deals 
with business, telecommunications, cable TV, air quality, AIDS, transportation 
-- with all the attention from the special interests, Moorhead will never be 
lonely. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is not a slam dunk for Moorhead. First, Rep. Newt Gingrich, in line to 
be House Speaker, has talked about restructuring the committee system -- 
although it's hard to imagine Congress without these two workhorse committees. 
It may be some time before we get an idea of what the new House will look like. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, Moorhead will almost certainly be challenged for the E and C post and 
might be challenged by a younger, more aggressive member for the chair of 
Judiciary as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorhead has beaten back challenges before -- he won a tough race to be 
ranking member of E and C. But this is a whole new ballgame, and many of the 
rules might not have fallen into place. Moorhead's future could well rest with 
the special interests that will no doubt be influential. 
</P>
<P>
 The other big question is Moorhead's ability to accept the challenge. He's 
been in Congress and in the minority a long time. Can he govern rather than 
simply obstruct? And what about his local orientation? True, portions of his 
district are in the Valley, but Burbank is a long way from Pacoima, in more 
ways than one. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley shouldn't lose all hope. Waxman, Beilenson and Berman still have 
their legislative and political skills. And we still have a Democrat in the 
White House who, when running for reelection, will need the support of 
Democratic members of Congress to fend off a primary challenge and move on to 
victory in November, 1996. (Yeah, I know how this sounds, but when someone told 
me two weeks ago we'd have a Speaker named Newt, I told them they shouldn't 
inhale.) 
</P>
<P>
 Our longtime representatives will be put to the test in the upcoming months if 
we in the Valley are to get a fair return on our tax dollar.

FATHER OF SLAIN SON PRESIDES AT KILLER'S WEDDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rev. Walter Everett spoke from the heart Saturday when he presided over 
the wedding of his son's killer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Love means knowing that you can say: 'I'm sorry,' and that the other person 
will forgive you," Everett told Michael Carlucci and his bride at the altar. " 
'I'm sorry' and 'I forgive you' are the key words in any relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 The men's relationship depended on the words. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlucci fatally shot Everett's 24-year-old son, Scott, in 1987 in a drunken 
scuffle at the apartment building where both lived. He said he never meant to 
kill him. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett, 60, didn't speak of his son at the wedding attended by about 85 
people in the Golden Hill United Methodist Church, only of love. 
</P>
<P>
 "Love is patient and kind," the pastor told the couple, reading from the 
Bible. "It does not rejoice at wrong, but rejoices in the right." 
</P>
<P>
 After his son was killed, Everett was angry when he heard Carlucci would be 
sentenced to only five years in prison for manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 That changed when he heard Carlucci apologize at his sentencing hearing. On 
the one-year anniversary of his son's death, Everett wrote Carlucci in state 
prison to offer forgiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 "That decision for me didn't come easily," Everett said before the wedding. "I 
began to see how the anger was destroying me." 
</P>
<P>
 Everett, who adopted Scott when he was 22 months old, said he wrote the letter 
as a way "to get through it." Afterward, he found "some inner peace." 
</P>
<P>
 When Carlucci read the letter, he broke down in tears. He wrote back, and a 
friendship developed. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlucci, 34, was released in 1991. Everett, pastor of United Methodist Church 
in Hartford, even testified on his behalf at a parole hearing. Everett's own 
marriage of 34 years, which was already troubled, ended after he forgave 
Carlucci. 
</P>
<P>
 As a wedding gift, Everett gave Carlucci and his bride, Sandie Foerster, a box 
of 16 crayons. The pastor said each color represents an emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Purple I see as a symbol of penitence," Everett told the couple. "Blue is a 
color symbolizing loyalty and trust." 
</P>
<P>
 Everett said before the ceremony that those feelings helped him carry on with 
his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "It began with an act of forgiveness," he said. "The healing process, I think, 
is an ongoing thing. Today is a definite milestone."

BISHOP'S MARRIAGE BOOK AROUSES INTEREST

<P>
 A British bishop whose new book on marriage includes explicit advice about 
arousing your partner and making love around the house says he is amused by the 
interest it has generated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our Flesh," the chapter on sex in the Rev. Michael Baughen's book, also 
describes orgasm as "an experience like no other" and recommends experiments 
with novel sexual positions. "After all, God meant us to enjoy sex. He made us 
the way we are and gave us the parts." 
</P>
<P>
 The 64-year-old Bishop of Chester and his wife, Myrtle, married for 38 years, 
wrote "Your Marriage" as a wide-ranging advice manual for couples.

THE PICTURE OF YULE JOY -- SOMETIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY SAILLANT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They arrive at malls and shops all over Ventura County this time of year, full 
of eager smiles and dressed to Dickensian perfection in red velveteen and green 
knickers. 
</P>
<P>
 But after parents and their spiffed-up children wait up to three hours to 
snare their bounty -- the family Christmas portrait -- some turn less than 
jolly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get a lot of grumpy parents," said Mona Morgia, manager of the Sears 
Portrait Studio at the Janss Mall in Thousand Oaks. "When they have to wait and 
their kids get cranky, they take it out on us." 
</P>
<P>
 Sears has been snapping up to 200 portraits a day, trying to keep up with a 
Christmas rush that changed from a trickle to a flood after Halloween, Morgia 
said. Everybody wants their pictures early so they can put them in Christmas 
cards, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The scenario is much the same at Kinderfoto in Oxnard's Esplanade Mall, said 
manager Judy Nicholson. A few people, however, get Christmas pictures done as 
early as July, Nicholson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're the really organized ones," she said. "But it really picks up in 
November." 
</P>
<P>
 Taking photographs of children under age 5 is always a challenge, 
photographers say, because they are unpredictable. But when preschoolers are 
asked to stay near their mothers for hours wearing hot, ruffly garments, 
coaxing a smile becomes much more difficult, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many parents cope patiently with the hassle, inevitably there are 
some who are less sympathetic, photographers say. Nicholson said she has seen 
parents leave when told pictures are taken on a first-come, first-served basis. 
</P>
<P>
 And others get angry after waiting an hour or more just to see their child 
spill a soft drink in their lap minutes before camera-time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a frustrating thing to watch your child dissolve into a crying mess 
while waiting for a photograph," Nicholson said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Saturday, a young family -- mother, father, preschool-aged son and 
baby daughter -- came to Kinderfoto to take a traditional family shot. The 
little boy had his hair neatly groomed and wore a thick white cable-knit 
sweater. 
</P>
<P>
 His little sister wore a lacy white dress with a tiny pink rose. But there was 
something wrong with this picture: Neither child would smile. 
</P>
<P>
 After several unsuccessful attempts, the mother grabbed her daughter's hand 
and huffed out of the studio. Her husband and their whining son trailed close 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't even talk to me!" the mother fumed at her unhappy son. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinderfoto photographer Vicky Carmona said it is hard to predict which child 
will smile happily for the camera and which will be uncooperative. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In general, toddlers are less predictable than young babies, Carmona said. And 
children 3 and older tend to follow instructions better, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just have to go with the flow," said Carmona, who has been photographing 
children for seven years. "Sometimes they smile when you just talk to them and 
sometimes you have to get more animated." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Janss Mall, Simi Valley mother Becky Miller expertly pulled her 
daughter Briana's hair into a velvet green barrette to match the 5-year-old 
girl's velvet-and-lace dress. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller also instructed her son, Frankie, 10, to stop eating multicolored 
candy.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want your teeth discolored," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 To which Frankie replied: "Well, I just won't smile, then." 
</P>
<P>
 The candy went uneaten. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller is a veteran of what kiddie-photographers call "Christmas craziness." 
Besides Briana and Frankie, she has a 9-year-old son, Brandon. And every year 
since the children were born, she has had their Christmas portrait taken, 
Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's become a tradition," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Photographers say parents think of portraits when the holidays draw near 
because they can slide them into cards going to out-of-state relatives and 
friends. And large portraits in frames make a nice gift, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents are lured to the studios by promotions offering picture packages for 
as little as $8.95. But the discounts are often limited to certain poses and 
parents frequently end up spending more for extra pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see all these pictures and you think, 'How can I give any of them back?' 
" said Araceli Soto, an Oxnard mother who brought her 6-month-old daughter, 
Marissa, to the Esplanade Mall for pictures. "That's how they get you." 
</P>
<P>
 Soto and her husband, Juan, arrived at Kinderfoto just before it opened one 
recent weekend, hoping to beat the crowd. But when they got to the studio, 
three other families were already in line. 
</P>
<P>
 After waiting an hour, the family was ushered into the studio. Little Marissa, 
decked out in a bright red velvet dress with Swiss lace, refused to smile. Both 
her parents started singing her favorite song, "Row, Row, Row Your Boat." 
</P>
<P>
 Still no smiles. Then, to top it off, the baby began hiccuping. 
</P>
<P>
 Photographer Carmona finally settled for an inquisitive look and shot five 
poses. The Sotos paid for the sitting and made arrangements to come back in two 
weeks for the finished pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 It was worth the wait to get a portrait recording Marissa's first Christmas, 
the couple said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're new parents," said Araceli as she and her husband fussed over their 
daughter. "Can't you tell?" Picture-Taking Tips 
</P>
<P>
 Professional photographers offer these tips for getting the best photographs 
of children: 
</P>
<P>
 1. If the child will wear a fancy dress or suit, put it on at the studio. This 
will reduce the chance of soiling the outfit. Also, children tend to get fussy 
in clothes they don't usually wear. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Make sure your child is fed, happy and well-rested before going to the 
studio. A tired child is likely to turn cranky in front of the camera. 
</P>
<P>
 3. To avoid a wait, go to the studio on Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday 
afternoons. The worst time to go is Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Stick with solid, bright colors. They contrast well with backgrounds.

HOSPITAL FEUD MAY LAND IN THE LAP OF SUPERVISORS; HEALTH CARE: BOARD WILL 
CONSIDER FINANCING FOR A NEW COUNTY WING. NEARBY COMMUNITY MEMORIAL AND SOME 
PRIVATE DOCTORS ARE UPSET. 
</P>

<P>
 The latest bout in a long-running feud between Ventura County's public 
hospital and a private hospital nearby will very likely be waged Tuesday, when 
county supervisors consider whether to issue $51 million in bond-like 
certificates to pay for a new wing at the county hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 County health officials are recommending that the Board of Supervisors approve 
financing for the 105,000-square-foot, five-story expansion at Ventura County 
Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The bonds would cost nearly $75 million over 15 years to repay, but most of 
the money would come from the state, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Community Memorial Hospital and some private physicians have criticized the 
project as a waste of taxpayers' money and an attempt by county hospital 
administrators to lure privately insured patients to the county-run facility. 
</P>
<P>
 They insist that the county is trying to compete with private doctors and 
hospitals for patients -- not just fulfilling its legal mandate as medical 
provider of last resort for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The proposed ambulatory care center is not necessary, considering what the 
county medical obligations are," said Donald L. Benton, spokesman for Community 
Memorial. "It can be supported only by the county expanding its medical center 
to take care of privately insured patients." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Community Memorial, situated just two blocks from the county hospital in 
central Ventura, has sued to block construction. A trial is still months away, 
Benton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The $51 million would pay for the new $33-million wing of the medical center 
on Loma Vista Road. More than 105,000 square feet of office space would house 
outpatient facilities, dietary services, a cafeteria and the hospital's 
UCLA-affiliated residency program. 
</P>
<P>
 Another $6 million would be spent on a nearby parking garage, and the 
remaining $12 million would go toward reserves, bond lawyers, construction-loan 
interest and other expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The money would be paid back over 15 years, with 70% coming from a state fund 
set up to finance expansions at hospitals that care primarily for indigent or 
low-income patients, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Auditor-Controller Thomas O. Mahon said the cost of Ventura County's 30% 
share, including interest, would be more than $24 million over the length of 
the bond. He said about two-thirds of that money would come from medical center 
accounts and the balance out of the county general fund, beginning in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the expansion say the new buildings are needed to replace a 
group of dilapidated clinics on the hospital grounds and several rented 
facilities nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 County Hospital Administrator Pierre Durand said the new building would save 
money in the long run by avoiding costly leases on other properties and 
increasing the amount of money the county gets from Medi-Cal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you take all those factors into consideration, we'll do very well," 
Durand said. "It is a very feasible thing to do, and to the financial benefit 
of the county over the life of the project." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Durand said the medical center holds a series of leases that will cost the 
hospital more than $15 million over the next 40 years unless those services are 
moved into the new wing. 
</P>
<P>
 County medical officials say some of the hospital's buildings date back to 
1921. They deny that the new wing would divert patients from private hospitals 
such as Community Memorial, because the number of poor people needing public 
health care here is on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
 "About a third of the county has no access to health care," said Samuel 
Edwards, medical director at the county hospital. "As all the other hospital 
occupancies have gone down, the number of people looking to us for service has 
gone up and up." 
</P>
<P>
 But administrators at Community Memorial Hospital do not see it that way. 
</P>
<P>
 They argue that Ventura County Medical Center is methodically recruiting 
insured patients -- such as county employees who receive discounts at the 
county hospital -- from private medical centers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Community Memorial filed suit against Ventura County Medical Center earlier 
this year, asking a judge to define the legal role of a county-run hospital. 
The ruling, Community Memorial officials hope, will keep the county hospital 
from encroaching on their private market. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we are correct in the lawsuit, they will not have adequate numbers of 
people to use it," Benton said of the new wing. "It will be a big, unused 
building." 
</P>
<P>
 Siegfried O. Storz, a Ventura cardiologist who has practiced at both the 
county hospital and Community Memorial, said there is no question the county is 
positioning itself for an increased patient caseload. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a feeling of competition," he said. "The county would deny that, but 
the fact that they're going to as much expense to do this (expansion) would 
contradict that." 
</P>
<P>
 Storz has argued against the expansion at public hearings, but he does not 
plan to show up Tuesday. "They had their minds made up already (last time)," 
Storz said. "I don't know whether going there now is going to make any 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
 The bond proposal very likely will receive majority support from the Board of 
Supervisors, most of whom have said they approve of the expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've supported that all along," Supervisor John K. Flynn said. "I know 
there's a big controversy. I just hope we can convince the doctors that this 
has to be done. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just a matter of building a new facility -- the old facilities are 
worn out," Flynn said. "If there weren't the number of patients, we wouldn't be 
doing it."

COLLEGE AID CHECKS ARE DELAYED; OXNARD: TRUSTEES RESIST HIRING MORE CLERKS TO 
CLEAR A BACKLOG HOLDING UP STUDENTS' FUNDS. TWO- THIRDS OF APPLICATIONS HAVEN'T 
BEEN PROCESSED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Hundreds of Oxnard College students are struggling through this fall semester 
without financial aid because there are not enough clerks at the office to 
process the glut of applications. 
</P>
<P>
 College Vice President Ronald Jackson said that applications for two-thirds of 
the more than 1,700 students seeking grants are still not processed.  
</P>
<P>
 Last week he asked trustees for emergency funds to hire additional help at the 
office, which this year has more than 1,100 financial aid applications pending. 
</P>
<P>
 But faced with a severe budget crisis, which has already forced the district 
to delay payments on teacher benefits and capital improvement projects, the 
board resisted. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Pete E. Tafoya, who represents the Oxnard area on the Ventura County 
Community College District governing board, urged his board colleagues to allow 
Jackson to do whatever is necessary to fix the problem -- even if that means 
using reserves to hire more employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking about a large percentage of students," Tafoya said. "If you 
can't get them in school, you can't educate them. So this is a major issue." 
</P>
<P>
 The trustees are set to discuss the matter again next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Roughly one quarter of the students have applied for financial aid this 
semester. Of those, Jackson said, fewer than 600 applications have been 
completed by the office. 
</P>
<P>
 A financial aid task force has been studying the staff shortages at all three 
campuses, Chancellor Thomas G. Lakin said. That committee is scheduled to 
report on its findings next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The financial aid clerks at Moorpark and Ventura colleges also are struggling 
with increased applications, but they have not fallen as far behind as those in 
Oxnard, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Ventura College, President Jesus Carreon opted not to fill a vacant library 
clerk position in favor of another financial aid staffer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this school year, the Oxnard College financial aid office cut down the 
hours spent helping students at the counter so workers could spend afternoons 
processing applications, said financial aid officer Patricia Gage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still behind, but we're making progress," Gage said last week. "We just 
have more and more people applying." 
</P>
<P>
 Another cause for delays, she said, is an increasing amount of government 
regulation required for each application packet. 
</P>
<P>
 "The office is run efficiently; that's not the problem," said Gage, who 
oversees three clerks. "We just don't have enough staff to handle the volume." 
</P>
<P>
 Bilingual education student Vanessa Calderon said she has been waiting weeks 
for financial aid. Last year there was a check awaiting her when she 
registered. "They haven't given any reason for the delay. But once, they told 
me they needed more people in the office," Calderon, 20, said. "Sometimes I 
have to borrow money from my friends or relatives." 
</P>
<P>
 David Dickerson said that every year it seems to get more difficult applying 
for and receiving state or federal grants. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have been having a lot of trouble with it," the 23-year-old art major 
said. "But my grant was only one day late. There's quite a few people that were 
a lot later, so I was pretty lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 A steady stream of students went through the financial aid office on a recent 
afternoon. Most of those said they were glad to be considered for any help at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been waiting since August, but they've been backed up," said Akea Smith, 
a 23-year-old physical fitness major. "It's been taking awhile, but 
everything's getting pieced together little by little." 
</P>
<P>
 Other students spent part of that afternoon getting their financial aid 
applications ready for the spring semester. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far, so good," said Patty Duran, a 20-year-old psychology major who just 
dropped off her paperwork for a spring 1995 grant package. "But I still have to 
take a test to make sure I qualify." 
</P>
<P>
 Gage said she would need as many as nine clerks to run the office more 
efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be happy to get one," she said.

STUDY ADVISES CLOSING POINT MUGU BASE; MILITARY: PENTAGON REPORT RECOMMENDS 
MOVING MOST OPERATIONS AND CUTTING JOBS BY ONE-FIFTH, BUT NAVY OFFICIALS 
DISPUTE FINDINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. WEISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Pentagon report kept hidden from the public for the past five months 
recommends shutting down most of the Point Mugu Navy base, eliminating about 
one-fifth of its jobs and transferring the rest to other installations, The 
Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 57-page report, the Defense Department's inspector general concludes 
that taxpayers could save $1.7 billion over the next 20 years if Point Mugu 
moves most of its missile-testing operations to its sister base at China Lake 
in the upper Mojave Desert. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the report's accuracy and influence are disputed by Navy officials, 
it comes at a time when the Pentagon is weighing which bases across the nation 
to offer as sacrifices in next year's round of base closures. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very upset about it," said Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), who has 
joined a special task force of government and business leaders formed to 
protect Ventura County's Navy bases. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly said he has seen only "bits and pieces" of an early draft, but 
worries what it could mean for the county's largest employer. 
</P>
<P>
 The final report, obtained by The Times, has never been officially released. 
And Gallegly and other members of the lobbying task force said they believe the 
report's conclusions cannot be used legally by other Pentagon officials in 
preparing a hit list of bases to close. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, congressional staff and the Washington, D.C., lobbyist hired by the 
local task force are researching the law to make sure the report is excluded 
from consideration. They say the decision-making process on what bases to close 
should not allow an activist role by the inspector general's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to be prepared to fight that," said Supervisor John K. Flynn, one of 
the leaders of the local BRAC '95 Task Force that has raised $200,000 so far 
for the lobbying campaign. "We are going into this battle to keep Mugu and 
everything else open." 
</P>
<P>
 The final report, issued to a small group of Pentagon officials on June 8 over 
the strong objections of the Navy, recommends moving most of Point Mugu's 
operations and almost 2,000 jobs to the China Lake Navy base, about 150 miles 
northeast of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The consolidation, the report said, would "eliminate redundant or duplicative 
functions" at Point Mugu and China Lake, which both test high-tech weaponry as 
members of the Naval Air Warfare Center, Weapons Division. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 employees would remain behind to operate Point Mugu's airfield. But 
the report recommends eliminating 1,049 jobs at Point Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another 1,083 workers would move to a nearby Navy facility at Port Hueneme, so 
they could continue to operate Point Mugu's missile test range, which spreads 
across 36,000 square miles of the Pacific Ocean. The report does not address 
the 3,000 people who work on base as employees of defense contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving costs would run about $518 million, so the inspector general's auditors 
do not figure any net savings for the first six years. 
</P>
<P>
 The inspector general's report has been sharply criticized by Navy officials, 
who said its conclusions and analysis are based on inaccurate data and 
incorrect assumptions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a memo to the inspector general Aug. 31, Assistant Navy Secretary Nora 
Slatkin also criticized the inspector general's office for unfairly singling 
out a Navy base for closure without considering all military installations as 
required by the nation's base closure and realignment law. 
</P>
<P>
 For that reason, she recommended that the inspector general's office delete 
its recommendations to merge Point Mugu into China Lake from the report. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Slatkin took issue with the feasibility of moving Point Mugu's 
sea test range operations to buildings soon to be vacated by the Naval Civil 
Engineering Laboratory at Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 Slatkin said the location at the mouth of the Port of Hueneme would interfere 
with transmitters, antennas and other equipment needed for safe operation of 
the test range. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Navy officials also told The Times that the Port Hueneme location is far 
too small for the Navy's sea range operation, which has three times as many 
personnel as the engineering lab. The lab is being moved to a new building in 
the center of the Port Hueneme Seabee base. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Robert J. Lieberman, the Defense Department's assistant inspector general for 
auditing, was the official overseeing the audit recommending Point Mugu's 
closure. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Lieberman at one point agreed with Navy critics that the 
report was prepared "completely out of context" of the Pentagon's current 
review of bases across the nation. By itself, he said, it should not be 
decisive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless you know what is being considered at other installations around the 
country, that report in itself is pretty meaningless," Lieberman said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lieberman also said he stands by the report's conclusions that the Point 
Mugu and China Lake bases have programs with too much overlap. 
</P>
<P>
 And, given the Navy's hostile reaction to his auditors and the report, he said 
his office has forwarded the recommendations to a higher level: those officials 
in the Defense Secretary's office who are now considering which bases across 
the country to consolidate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Navy wasn't going to use it, that was clear," Lieberman said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that the inspector general's staff has a legitimate role in the base 
closure process because it has been assigned the responsibility of verifying 
all data submitted by the Navy and other military branches. 
</P>
<P>
 In this fourth and final round of base closures, the Defense Department will 
consider combining bases from different branches of the service. Overall, the 
secretary of defense has mandated a 15% reduction of the nation's military 
bases. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So, it's possible that Point Mugu could be merged with Edwards Air Force Base 
or Vandenberg Air Force Base, or another military installation that tests 
missiles or other high-tech weaponry. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Point Mugu supporters have accused the inspector general's office of 
targeting Point Mugu at the behest of a competing Air Force base. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of that is true," Lieberman said. "We initiated it based on our 
professional judgment. There wasn't any outside meddling." 
</P>
<P>
 Lieberman said his auditors focused on Point Mugu after the Navy did its own 
reorganization in 1991, which changed the name from the Pacific Missile Test 
Center to the Naval Air Warfare Center, Weapons Division. 
</P>
<P>
 The inspector general report said much of that reshuffle was a "paper 
reorganization" that did not combine all of the duplicate weapons-testing 
programs at the two bases. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, the report contends that Navy officials used "a very lenient 
interpretation" of rules that allowed them to exclude Point Mugu and China Lake 
from being seriously considered for consolidation in 1993 because of "unique" 
military features. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy officials dispute these assertions. 
</P>
<P>
 But they say that Point Mugu has a unique function in the nation's military: 
It is the launching pad to the world's biggest sea test range, used daily by 
naval aircraft, ships and submarines in firing missiles and testing weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 China Lake is the Navy's largest base, stretching over 1,700 square miles of 
desert land -- nearly the size of Delaware. China Lake also has 17,000 square 
miles of airspace restricted to military aircraft and weapons testing. 
</P>
<P>
 All three branches of the military are now scrutinizing which bases should 
close. And the secretary of defense is scheduled to release a recommended hit 
list in March. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, a federally appointed base-closure commission will evaluate the 
list, hold public hearings and make its decision in July.

EDUCATION A CASUALTY OF HIGH COST OF CULTURE; THOUSAND OAKS: CIVIC ARTS PLAZA 
RENTAL IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN SCHOOL BUDGETS ALLOW, DESPITE DISCOUNT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 To the men and women who govern the Civic Arts Plaza, the vision seemed 
impossible, illogical, wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks' new auditorium would sit quiet and dark, plush seats empty, 
broad stage bare. Meanwhile, hundreds of local third-graders would crowd into a 
school cafeteria to watch a makeshift symphony concert, squirming on the hard 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
 No one on the Civic Arts Plaza Board of Governors liked that notion. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the end, they could do little to change it. 
</P>
<P>
 Required by the Thousand Oaks City Council to maintain a balanced budget, 
board members refused to waive rental fees or labor charges for school groups 
seeking to use the performing arts center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very, very adamant that we do not go into the hole for anyone," board 
member Virginia Davis said. "I won't back off that for anything." 
</P>
<P>
 That decision may put the Civic Arts Plaza out of reach for the local school 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Governors voted earlier this year to slash theater rental fees in 
half for performances that take place during the school day. But even with the 
half-price discount, the school district's bill will reach $3,200 for two 
hourlong concerts Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of the theater tab, the district must pay the musicians and charter 
school buses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a real dilemma now," said Barbara Ryan, director of elementary 
education for the Conejo Valley Unified School District. "Our budget cannot 
stand an extra $3,200 per event." 
</P>
<P>
 With just $40,000 a year set aside to provide arts education and field trips 
for kindergarten through sixth grade, the district simply will not be able to 
afford visits to Thousand Oaks' elegant new concert hall, Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find that desperately ironic," said Board of Governors member Larry Janss. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are under the mandate, given to us by our superiors on the council, that 
this facility shall not tax city coffers," Janss said. "But the City Council 
has to come to grips with the idea that we may be requiring the (performing 
arts) center to remain dark while kids sit on floors." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to find a way out, several board members said they will ask council 
members to consider subsidizing school district rentals of the 1,800-seat 
Probst Auditorium or the 400-seat Forum Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my philosophy that a city is here to serve its citizens, and the most 
precious of our citizens are the little kids," Janss said. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members, however, have long vowed that they will not dip into the city 
treasury to pay the new theaters' operating costs. They are counting on private 
fund-raising to cover the light bills, buy toilet paper, pay custodians -- and 
provide any subsidies needed to make the theater affordable for schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly we want to encourage the use of the facility by children -- that 
was always one of our stated purposes -- but we never said it would be free," 
Councilwoman Judy Lazar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Incoming Councilman Andy Fox, who will take his seat at the dais next month, 
agreed. "We can't get to the point where we are even thinking about dipping 
into the general fund or using tax dollars for subsidies," he said. "That 
cannot happen." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Renting Thousand Oaks' halls costs about $1 a seat -- comparable to nearby 
venues, theater director Tom Mitze said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonprofit community groups pay $1,800 a night for use of the large auditorium, 
or $400 for the smaller theater. Professional performers must fork over either 
10% of their box-office take or $1,800 -- whichever is more. 
</P>
<P>
 Those rates haven't stopped local artists as well as international superstars, 
who have rushed to book gigs in the Civic Arts Plaza. But when they receive 
their contracts, they find that hefty costs are hidden -- literally -- behind 
the scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the theaters' complex high-tech equipment, the city allows only 
trained professionals to work backstage. So in addition to renting the hall, 
performers must cover the cost of hiring stage crews. The wages quickly and 
inevitably add up. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district's symphony concerts, for example, are costly because the 
city must hire six people to set up the stage's acoustical shell, Mitze said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not something that can be done with volunteers," he explained. "We have 
to hire those people." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To defray the cost, several theater board members suggested that school 
district officials seek corporate grants. And they promised to scrutinize the 
budget in search of funds for a partial subsidy. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, however, the $755,000 annual budget is shot through with question 
marks. With the theaters up and running for just three weeks, board members 
still do not know how much it costs to run the facility. They have never 
reviewed a theater light bill or tallied a box-office telephone tab. 
</P>
<P>
 As board member Julian Macdonald said, "There are a lot of iffies." 
</P>
<P>
 One big if: how much board members will have to raise to subsidize the 
half-price school-day rate they agreed on months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitze said he has signed about two dozen contracts with groups that want to 
rent the theaters at the reduced rate. To bring the budget into balance, the 
board will have to come up with $10,000 to $15,000 this year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't identified how to raise these funds," board member Stephen 
Woodworth acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing the theaters' tight budget, school district officials said they 
hold no grudge because of the high rental rates. 
</P>
<P>
 They will go ahead, as planned, with this week's symphony concerts for 
third-graders in the Probst Auditorium. But they may have to scrap dreams of 
bringing other students to the Civic Arts Plaza for folk concerts, puppet shows 
and dance performances -- unless the city can come up with subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're under a lot of pressure, and we understand that," Supt. Jerry C. 
Gross said. "But it seems such a shame that we have a wonderful facility 
sitting here that we're not able to use." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the school district may not be able to afford the Civic Arts Plaza, 
other community groups have jumped to rent both theaters, apparently undaunted 
by the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Theater director Mitze has already booked shows through the summer of 1996 -- 
everything from a national-tour production of "Les Miserables" to a teen-age 
rendition of "Jesus Christ Superstar." 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, I was thinking, 'Will there be enough performances?' This year, 
I'm thinking, 'What are we going to do with all the performances?' " Mitze 
said. "We're swamped. It's our dream, but it's turning into our nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
 In assigning dates, Mitze and the theater board must balance a desire to 
present splashy, world-renowned stars against a commitment to welcome amateur 
community entertainers. A recent citywide survey found the highest interest in 
Broadway musicals, comedy and drama but also substantial support for community 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a number of years before we find the correct balance," Mitze said. 
"If we ever do."

CONTROVERSY ARISES OVER SCHOOL SKIT, PUNISHMENT; EDUCATION: OFFICIALS AND 
PARENTS ARE OUTRAGED AT NEWBURY PARK HIGH SENIORS' DEPICTION OF A HAZING, WITH 
GIRLS ON LEASHES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It started as a high school skit but turned into a hazing spectacle, with 
seniors smearing syrup and mustard over freshman girls and parading others -- 
some wearing dog collars and leashes -- in front of the entire student body. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident during a homecoming rally at Newbury Park High School in Thousand 
Oaks last month led to disciplinary action against 10 seniors, one of whom was 
suspended while others were stripped of their privileges as student leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, some students complain that their sentences were too harsh, touching off 
a debate over what is proper punishment, what is appropriate behavior, and when 
a humorous incident crosses the line and becomes hazing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt we didn't do anything too wrong," said senior Isabel Reyes, 17, who 
went before the Conejo Valley school board recently to appeal for leniency. 
"The freshmen all volunteered -- they knew exactly what was going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 But school officials and some parents said significant disciplinary action was 
warranted in the case because it depicted hazing and at times bordered on 
sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the things that occurred were totally and completely out of line," 
said Supt. Jerry C. Gross. "I thought it was an egregious circumstance." 
</P>
<P>
 The Oct. 21 incident occurred during a school rally in front of about 1,200 
students, teachers and administrators. It lasted less than 5 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of seniors -- nine girls and one boy -- had given school officials the 
script of a skit they said they planned to perform, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But once the skit started, the performers strayed from the script, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Announcing that they would mimic scenes from the movie "Dazed and Confused," a 
comedy depicting high school hazing and partying in the mid-1970s, the Newbury 
Park teen-agers ordered several freshmen girls who were part of the skit to lie 
on the floor, then squirted them with syrup, ketchup, mustard, honey and 
whipped cream. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior girls then led the freshmen on leashes in front of the gymnasium 
section where seniors sat, and instructed the freshmen to yell, "Seniors Rule!" 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, the senior boy participating in the skit made suggestive remarks 
about oral sex to a freshman girl. The students involved said the stunts were 
just a playful joke, and not meant to harm or humiliate anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just supposed to be a fun skit," Isabel said. "We didn't think they'd 
make a big deal out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Isabel's sister, Mari, who was one of the freshmen splattered with syrup, said 
the performers had discussed the scene in advance. "I didn't mind," the 
15-year-old said. "It's always fun to be part of the rally." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But school officials were outraged. 
</P>
<P>
 "It became a totally inappropriate activity," Assistant Supt. Richard W. 
Simpson said. "It did not look like those (freshmen) knew what was going to 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
 School officials meted out a series of punishments, including one suspension, 
several expulsions from the student government class, Saturday detention, and 
"senior contracts." 
</P>
<P>
 The contracts, which were made with individual students, stipulate that if the 
student commits another offense before June, he or she will loose all senior 
privileges, including the right to attend the prom and some graduation 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, despite student pleas for leniency, the board of the Conejo Valley 
Unified School District concluded that the disciplinary actions were 
appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 Newbury High Principal Chuck Eklund said the seniors were punished for 
misconduct, not hazing, because the incident did not meet the legal definition 
of that offense.  
</P>
<P>
 The state education code defines hazing as an initiation or amusement that 
results in physical or mental harm to any student. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although Eklund said some of the freshmen were not completely aware of what 
would occur, he said the students participated voluntarily and were not 
injured. "It was a depiction of hazing," he said. "I don't think it was their 
intent to haze." 
</P>
<P>
 But some parents, including an instructional aide who watched the skit, were 
appalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Depiction or not, they said, the skit showed students being demoralized before 
their peers, and that was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was repulsive to me," said Maryellen Glyer, an aide for the school's 
special education classes. "It was basically a hazing scene." 
</P>
<P>
 Glyer criticized school officials for not stepping in to stop the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no intervention, which I thought was an error," she said. "But to 
their defense, I think they were in shock." 
</P>
<P>
 Eklund said the scene happened too quickly to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
 One parent said she was astonished when her son later described what had 
occurred during the rally. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a violation of good taste," said Leona Thomason. "This is a terrible 
thing to do to people who are watching who may not agree that it is OK to lead 
a girl around like a dog." 
</P>
<P>
 But some Newbury Park High students who watched the brief scene said they were 
not offended. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the skit was stupid, but I don't think they should have been kicked 
out of (student government)," said sophomore Shannon Leon. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Elizabeth Bruch said school leader should have considered the 
students' reputations. Many are outgoing student leaders and athletes, not 
troublemakers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they would just tell them not to do it again, I don't think they would," 
15-year-old Elizabeth said. "They're good kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Gross, the district superintendent, said the punishment was justified. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think these are good kids," he said. "I think they just hadn't thought 
through carefully what occurred . . . (or) what the levity of it was. It again 
reinforced my belief that movies and TV are serving as inappropriate models all 
too often for kids." 
</P>
<P>
 But Newbury Park High teacher John Uelmen said the students' skit was tame in 
comparison to some movie and television scenes, and was not intended to degrade 
other students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they really meant anything by it," he said. "I think they just 
wanted to do a funny skit. Let's face it, there's a lot of sick stuff on film 
and TV that's a lot worse than that." 
</P>
<P>
 Uelmen said he suggested the students involved -- many of whom are in his 
12th-grade government class -- appeal their sentences to the school board. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were complaining and complaining and I said, 'There are things you can 
do,' " he said. "I often encourage students to question authority. That's the 
way our system works. We allow people to question and petition." 
</P>
<P>
 But Glyer said the lesson the seniors should have walked away with was one 
addressing dignity and proper behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think most reasonable people would have to conclude that (these students 
are) our future," she said. "And (they) thought this was OK, that it was funny. 
I think that's dangerous."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: VENTURA; COOKBOOK SALE, SIGNING A TASTY TREAT FOR BUYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There was more than the smell of brand-new books in the air Saturday at the 
Barnes & Noble bookstore in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The scents of garlic, olive oil and basil wafted through the aisles, luring 
customers to the north wing of the bookstore where two of west Ventura County's 
best-known chefs served some of their favorite creations. 
</P>
<P>
 In one corner, executive chef Robert Garcia from Capistrano's restaurant in 
Oxnard served bruschetta , an appetizer made of French bread topped with olive 
oil, garlic, basil and tomatoes. Nearby, executive chef Louis Ludwig of the 
Ventura Pierpont Inn dished up samples of hearty New England clam chowder. 
</P>
<P>
 For two hours, the chefs fed book-lovers to promote "Cookin' in Ventura," a 
collection of recipes compiled by Ventura resident Gail Hobbs. The cookbook 
features 54 recipes for appetizers, soups, entrees, dressings and desserts from 
30 Ojai, Oxnard and Ventura restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Garcia and Ludwig, whose recipes are included in the collection, 
signed books for customers who eagerly sampled the food the chefs had prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 "This tastes absolutely delicious," Ventura resident Lavonne Askay said as she 
savored marinated raw Norwegian salmon served on a slice of bread and covered 
with a dill sauce. "I never thought that I would like raw fish, but this sorts 
of melts in your mouth."  
</P>
<P>
 Like many of the patrons who tasted the food, Askay purchased a copy of the 
book so she could try the recipes at home. "I love cooking, and if all the 
recipes are like this one, it will be worth buying it." 
</P>
<P>
 The book, which costs $9.95, also includes recipes from restaurants such as 
Ventura's Rosarito Beach Cafe, Wheeler Hot Springs and Oxnard's Yasmeen's India 
Cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
 "The book was designed to educate people on what is available in our area," 
Hobbs said, "and also to promote the sense, the reality, that we have some 
wonderful restaurants." 
</P>
<P>
 Hobbs said she is donating 5% of the profits from sales of the book to Casa 
Pacifica, a Camarillo residential center for abused and neglected children.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: VENTURA; ANTI-PANHANDLING CAMPAIGN PLANNED

<TEXT>
<P>
 Holiday shoppers making their rounds in Ventura this season will see new signs 
in store windows: "Don't Give Spare Change. Help Make a Real Change." 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the city, the Chamber of Commerce, downtown merchants and the 
Ventura County Homeless and Housing Coalition, the placards are part of a 
citywide campaign to discourage panhandling. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeless advocates say panhandlers are best served by appropriate social 
service agencies -- not by good Samaritans who dig into their pockets to dole 
out change. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people who give, give out of fear, and there are others who give out 
of guilt," said Rick Pearson, the director of Project Understanding, an 
organization that provides services to the homeless. "We're trying to reach 
those people."  
</P>
<P>
 The signs will be accompanied by cards listing the various city agencies that 
provide services to low-income and homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
 The program will begin before the holiday shopping season starts, officials 
say. CONSTANCE SOMMER

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: VENTURA; 3 ARRESTED ON SUSPICION OF SHOOTING AT OFFICERS 
</P>

<P>
 Three suspected gang members were arrested early Saturday morning on suspicion 
of firing shots at Ventura police officers, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers were responding to a complaint about a group of youths standing 
on a corner in Cabrillo Village about 1:15 a.m. When the patrol car arrived, 
the youths ran from the area firing at the officers, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the officers took cover, the suspects jumped into a car and sped away, 
police said. Another patrol car located the fleeing suspects and stopped their 
car. The officers searched the car and found a handgun in the passenger side of 
the car, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrested on suspicion of assaulting a police officer with a deadly weapon were 
Edward Zizumbo, 21, and Ivan Flores, 19, both of Ventura. A 16-year-old Ventura 
boy was also arrested on the charge, police said. No motive was given for the 
assault. SCOTT HADLY

JAMES FLANIGAN: THE COMING GOP CONGRESS: WHAT WE CAN EXPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Will the Republicans' effect on the economy be as far reaching as their 
resounding election victory? It could well be. The particulars of their 
program, which they call a "Contract With America," and the philosophy their 
leaders will bring to Congress seem attuned to a historic turning point in 
American politics. 
</P>
<P>
 In their biggest challenge, the Republicans have a chance to alter an 
unhealthy pattern in entitlements -- Medicare and Social Security -- in which 
the young are penalized to benefit the old. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is also true that the American people are deeply worried about economic 
problems and fickle in political loyalties. What the voters really gave the 
Republicans last week is a two-year tryout, after which there will be a 
performance review. 
</P>
<P>
 So a dollars-and-cents look at the Republican agenda will tell us not only 
about business prospects and our own pocketbooks in the next two years, but 
about the longer-term issue of entitlements as well. 
</P>
<P>
 In the short term there will be tax cuts for middle-income families in the 
form of a $500-per-child tax credit or exemption, plus a reduced capital gains 
tax rate and some expansion of Individual Retirement Accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 The child tax credit will take $25 billion to $30 billion a year from the 
government's revenue and give a boost to the consumer economy. But that credit 
will have to be offset by spending cuts so as not to worsen the budget deficit 
and bring on the wrath of the international bond markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Those markets so far have cheered the GOP's ascendancy, seeing it as a party 
of budget cutters such as Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.), co-author of the 
Gramm-Rudman deficit control law. Gramm favors a more generous tax exemption 
for children, saying he would offset it with budget cuts from the Departments 
of Education and Housing and Urban Development. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm told, 'Oh, you're cutting spending for schools and housing,' " says 
Gramm. "No, I'm not. I'm just changing the spender, letting people keep their 
money and spend it themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Gramm's words sum up his party's current appeal: lower taxes, smaller 
government, decisions made at the local level. 
</P>
<P>
 The philosophy contrasts directly with that of the Clinton Administration. 
President Clinton had a child tax credit on his agenda when he took office in 
January, 1993 (and so will probably go along with one next year). But foregoing 
$30 billion in tax revenue would have interfered with Clinton's plans to spend 
on other programs. So he dropped the idea and has ended up with neither credit 
nor program. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, tax cuts are the easy part for the Republicans, who will also propose a 
balanced budget amendment and try to set it on the years-long path to 
ratification by two-thirds of the states. 
</P>
<P>
 That's where the crunch will come. Balancing the budget, along with the tax 
cuts, will lower government revenue by $53 billion a year, according to 
Republican economists on the Joint Economic Committee. There's no way to offset 
that amount with simple budget cuts in other programs -- or with higher taxes, 
which nobody wants. 
</P>
<P>
 So entitlements will have to be cut. Means tests for Medicare -- if not yet 
Social Security retirement benefits -- are inevitable, says former Sen. Warren 
B. Rudman of New Hampshire, a Republican who now leads the Concord Coalition, a 
private effort to end deficits. 
</P>
<P>
 The richer you are, the less government-paid care you would get under the 
envisioned reforms. The aim would be to rein in the explosive growth in 
Medicare expenditures, which are projected to go from $140 billion to $234 
billion in five years, a rate of more than 10% a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Rudman thinks it's ridiculous that bank tellers and bank presidents pay the 
same amount of tax for old-age medical insurance policies worth $7,000 a year 
each. He sees the fact that "70% of taxpayers pay more in Social Security taxes 
than they do in income taxes" as an indication that the system is burdening the 
young, whose wages are not rising, to pay for many older people who are well 
able to pay for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Generational wealth transfers and means testing are very big issues. Are the 
American people ready to deal with them? The answer is they are divided. One 
reason budget-cutting Republicans won last week is that people are deeply 
worried about the national debt, which has reached $16,000 for every American, 
an unprecedented level. 
</P>
<P>
 Broadly speaking, the people are afraid of what the debt is doing to America: 
Forcing the country to borrow more, imposing enormous interest payments and 
limiting opportunity for future generations. Their votes for Ross Perot in 1992 
and Republicans last week say they want the debt brought down. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet they want entitlements, too. It is still politically risky even to talk of 
limiting Medicare and Social Security. "And means testing is no sure-fire 
solution," notes economist Barry Bosworth of Brookings Institution. "People 
have ways of working the system. Many families even now arrange grandparents' 
assets so they qualify for state-financed nursing care," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the nation's politics often seem contradictory and confused. In fact, 
we're at a point of change. Last week, Republican candidates won many elections 
in the South, the region where, 60 years ago, President Franklin D. Roosevelt 
built solid Democratic majorities through government spending for dams and 
rural electrification. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the South is growing in industry and self reliance. And, like politically 
independent suburbs that have replaced traditionally Democratic cities in the 
North and West, Southern cities and states want local control rather than 
Washington's guiding hand. 
</P>
<P>
 And Republican thinkers such as Gramm, a former professor of economics, and 
incoming Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), a former professor of 
history, are working on ways to strengthen local control. 
</P>
<P>
 It won't be easy. The realities of an aging society, in which the old are 
living longer and needing more care and larger pensions, will not be solved by 
political rhetoric. Tough choices will have to be made by politicians and by 
voters.  
</P>
<P>
 If the Republicans can make such choices honestly and keep the public trust, 
this landslide won't be their last. But if they come up only with arguments and 
gridlock -- and unrealistic talk of a "national sales tax" to replace the 
income tax is not a good sign -- they'll be out in 1996. And a third party will 
emerge -- "a strong third party" -- says Rudman. The next two years are more of 
a turning point than even last week's winners may realize.

NOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A GEEK TO USE THE NET; BUT CAN THESE GUYS -- OR ANYONE 
ELSE -- MAKE A BUCK OFF MOSAIC, THE SOFTWARE THAT HELPS MAKE THE INTERNET

<P>
 Jim Clark is late for a meeting, and Marc Andreessen -- boy wonder, cyberspace 
star, author of a computer program that inspired Clark to sink $5 million of 
his own money into a new company bent on commercializing it -- is threatening 
to strip off his clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be there in a moment," the avuncular Clark keeps saying, a line that -- 
and he appears to know this -- only further infuriates the impatient 
23-year-old computer geek-cum-vice president. Hailed in recent months as 
something akin to the Moses of the Internet, Andreessen is still not quite 
ready to meet venture capitalists all by himself. 
</P>
<P>
 They make an odd couple: the well-dressed, 50-year-old founder of Silicon 
Graphics Inc. and the blond programmer from New Lisbon, Wis., who can be found 
pounding down Cokes and code at the local Denny's in the wee hours of the 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clark and Andreessen are among those at the forefront of a race to bring 
commerce to the Internet and the Internet to the masses -- and they have 
something of a head start. 
</P>
<P>
 You've heard of it. The Internet: global jumble of computer networks and 
repository of informational gems, cutting-edge communication tools and new ways 
to make money -- and all pretty much inaccessible to common mortals doomed to a 
life without the techno-whiz gene. 
</P>
<P>
 But that is changing fast, and mostly because of a program called Mosaic, 
written by Andreessen and a bunch of students at the University of Illinois at 
Urbana-Champaign. Many of them, it so happens, now work for Clark at Mosaic 
Communications, the 7-month-old firm he operates out of a suite of offices 
evenly divided between whiz-kid hackers and neatly suited business types.  
</P>
<P>
 Mosaic Netscape, the firm's first effort at improving on the popular program, 
has become the buzz of the Internet since its release last month. (Andreessen 
and his college comrades were forced to sacrifice their preferred nickname 
"Mozilla," for the greater good of commercial marketing. "We considered it," 
Clark says. "But we just didn't think it would fly.") 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the mass migration of programers from the university's National Center 
for Supercomputing Applications to the corporate world last spring has had more 
significant hangups as well: the young firm is expected to announce Monday that 
it is changing its name to Netscape Communications, the result of a tussle over 
intellectual property rights with the NCSA, which continues to work on 
improving its own version of the software. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Mosaic allows users to browse through the Internet's mass of information by 
clicking on pictures and highlighted text. It displays graphs and maps, plays 
audio and video (after a fashion) and lets Net surfers follow an idea through a 
trail of computers across the world, unencumbered by arcane tech-lingo. 
</P>
<P>
 Mosaic makes the Internet pretty. It also makes it easy for a normal person to 
use.  
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the computer language Mosaic is based on -- HTML, or 
hypertext markup language -- is so simple that contributing to the Internet has 
become almost as easy as navigating through it. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses, governments, non-profit organizations and random individuals are 
plastering the World Wide Web -- as the portion of the Internet's computers 
that speak HTML is known -- with digital data ranging from personal photos to 
Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Such "home pages," as they are 
called in Net-talk, are like graphic tables of contents that allow access to 
selected data at the click of a mouse.) And the number of computers storing 
such data around the world has multiplied to 10,000 from 100 at the beginning 
of last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Net sociologists predict Mosaic and its clones will soon democratize 
communication in a way the electronic revolution has always promised but never 
quite achieved. 
</P>
<P>
 And business executives -- this is where multimillionaire Clark and his 
unlikely deputies from Illinois come in -- herald the emergence of a new market 
and a new, inexpensive way to hawk their wares.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's like when the car first came out and you had to crank it, and later 
someone figured out to put a key ignition in," says George Brenner, vice 
president of information services at MCA/Universal, whose "Universal Cyberwalk" 
Web site went on-line last week. "You don't even have to know how to type." 
</P>
<P>
 Recent additions to the Web include the Caltrans page (for checking traffic 
maps), MGM's Stargate page (clips from the recently released film) and the 
White House (get a virtual tour, hear Socks meow). 
</P>
<P>
 Also: Megadeth, the Burlington Coat Factory Warehouse, Art Crimes (graffiti 
from the around the world), the complete writings of Nostradamus, Brett's Page 
("Welcome to the Winona (Ryder) archive") and Romania. 
</P>
<P>
 The striking workers at the San Francisco Chronicle post daily editions of the 
"San Francisco Free Press" on the Web, complete with photographs and a red, 
white and blue masthead. Chronicle management, meanwhile, publishes its own Web 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
 And on Election Day last week, a Web site set up by the secretary of state and 
Digital Equipment Corp. to post returns logged nearly half a million "clicks" 
through its pages, the heaviest traffic the Web has seen since NASA's computers 
offered live pictures of comet fragments hitting Jupiter earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mosaic blew the lid off," says Clark. "Marc and his team, by doing it, blew 
the lid off. And suddenly people began to use the Net as a means of 
disseminating information that is easy to browse. Mosaic is the first step into 
the future, and you don't need a broad-band data highway in the sky to get 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark, who underwent a conversion of sorts after tracking Andreessen down 
through (what else) his home page at the University of Illinois, hopes to make 
money off his realization that it is the Internet -- rather than as-yet 
nonexistent "interactive television" -- that will be delivering new 
information, education and entertainment services to Americans in the near 
term. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing to me that I was so brainwashed," says Clark, who initially had 
aimed to get into interactive television when he left Silicon Graphics last 
year. "Once I allowed myself to step out of that and think more clearly about 
where markets are today, I thought: 'This is it. This is where the real market 
is, so grab the initiative.' " 
</P>
<P>
 What he did, with help from the elite venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins 
Caufield & Byers, was grab Andreessen. In a springtime raid on 
Urbana-Champaign, the duo then recruited five of the seven other members of the 
core Mosaic team at the federally funded NCSA "They said, 'Do you want to come 
work for us for something like five times what you're making now, be free of 
the university bureaucracy and finish what you started?' " remembers John 
Mittelhauser, who like most of his colleagues, had hit the top of the 
university's undergraduate wage scale at $6.85 an hour. "We said, 'Yeah.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Facing an onrush of competitors -- dozens of firms are working on spiffier 
versions of Mosaic -- Clark's company has done what it can to capitalize on the 
cachet of having the original developers on board. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a tack that has led to more than a little resentment in some quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics have charged Mosaic Communications with arrogance for assuming the 
"Mosaic" name for itself and refusing to license the original code from NCSA. 
The firm says Netscape was written from scratch, but the sensitive discussions 
with the university that are prompting the firm to change its name continue. 
Among the pending issues: copyright infringement and trade secret violations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have an obligation to protect our intellectual property," says Marcia 
Rotunda, associate university counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also the tendency to confuse the browser program -- and the people 
who wrote it -- with the mass of text and images to which it gives access. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say that Mosaic is the killer application, but really it has the 
potential to be the killer app because of what's underneath it, the World Wide 
Web," says Chris Wilson, another member of the original Mosaic team who now 
works for Spry Inc. on that Seattle firm's version of the software. "Marc 
didn't do that. NCSA didn't even do that. I'll do my penance to Tim Berners-Lee 
and CERN." 
</P>
<P>
 Berners-Lee and a team of high-energy physicists at the European Laboratory 
for Particle Physics in Geneva, known as CERN from an earlier French name, 
essentially created the Web in 1989 as a way to communicate with other 
scientists around the world. But it was not until Mosaic came along that the 
network became easily accessible to large numbers of computer users. 
</P>
<P>
 NCSA's Mosaic was developed with government funds, and it is distributed free 
to non-commercial users. For-profit concerns have licensed nearly 10 million 
copies of Mosaic this year through the university's designated representative, 
Spyglass Inc.  
</P>
<P>
 Andreessen is quick to acknowledge that his firm is not the only one in the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Other commercial versions of the program, such as Spry's Air Mosaic, are 
already on the market. Competitors include Spyglass' Enhanced Mosaic, MCC's 
MacWeb, Pipeline and Netcom's Netcruiser. Both Microsoft and Apple Computer 
have announced plans to include a Web navigator program in future versions of 
their basic software. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark and Andreessen say they don't plan to make money on the "client" version 
of their software, the program that runs on a PC: It was released for free over 
the Internet last month as part of a gambit to gain market share quickly. But 
the "server" versions of the software, which commercial organizations use to 
construct their own Web offerings, sell for $1,500. And a version designed for 
secure electronic commerce, including credit card transactions -- which will go 
for $5,000 a pop -- is due out next month. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, First Data Corp. said it planned to use the secure version of the 
Mosaic Communications software to enable its bank customers -- including First 
Interstate Bancorp. to provide on-line credit card authorizations in real time. 
Microsoft and Visa International announced a similar effort last week. Such 
services would allow consumers to purchase products via the Net without 
exposing credit card information to prying electronic eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Mosaic Communications' success will depend on the evolution of the Internet as 
a business tool by which companies can communicate with their customers and 
sell a broad range of products and services. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of firms are working toward that goal, though for now the commercial 
activity on the Web amounts mostly to digital brochures: Web postings are a 
useful way of reaching potential customers who happen to be on the Internet. 
"Going on line" has also become a status symbol that some companies have 
leveraged into publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at Pizza Hut," says Jayne Levin, editor of the Internet Letter, 
referring to public fascination with the firm's experiment in taking pizza 
orders via the Web, announced earlier this year. "And their service only works 
in the Santa Clara (Calif.) area." 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T's futuristic phones can be examined on the Web. Numerous florists offer 
delivery services. Miller Genuine Draft has set up a "tap room." General 
Electric's plastic products are browse-able, and Fox Television offers program 
schedules and video clips. The cost is low: Commercial Web sites typically cost 
a few thousand dollars a month, though homemade home pages can be run off a 
personal computer and cost almost nothing to maintain. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the audience is small: Only about 2 million Internet fans now have the 
kind of connection to the network needed to work browser programs such as 
Mosaic. And depending on the speed of your modem (the device that links your 
computer to the Net by telephone), it can take an annoyingly long time for 
images to materialize. Lynx, a more widely used Internet search tool, displays 
only text. 
</P>
<P>
 An ambitious plan for conducting more substantial business on the Net -- 
including publishing, advertising and other functions that might generate 
revenue -- was scuttled recently by Westport, Conn.-based Mecklermedia, after 
attracting only one customer over several months. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, information and entertainment providers such as the San Jose Mercury 
News (which is working with Clark's company to develop a news service on the 
Web), MCA and Viacom hold out hope that the Internet will become a viable 
business platform. (Viacom, which owns Paramount Pictures, launched its Web 
site this month with a sneak preview of the soon-to-be released film "Star 
Trek: Generations.") 
</P>
<P>
 With the advent of secure communications, many expect the Internet to become a 
major vehicle for buying everything from flowers to fashion. Commercial on-line 
services such as America Online also aim to fill that role, but Clark and other 
Internet proponents believe potential cyber-sellers will want to cut out the 
middlemen and maintain direct contact with customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Mosaic Communications, of course, aims to play something of a middleman role 
itself, helping companies set up their services and possibly taking a small 
piece of the revenue they generate. Clark is closemouthed about precisely how 
all this will work, and there don't appear to be a whole lot of committed 
customers thus far. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, despite the hype about business on the Internet, Mosaic's lasting 
impact may yet be in opening doors to non-commercial forms of information and 
communications. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Sam Coleman, a scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, who 
maintains a list of all the California Web sites in his spare time: "The whole 
network, this whole network culture, has kind of grown up in an ad-hoc way," 
Coleman says. "This is true grass-roots stuff here." 
</P>
<P>
 Enter the "universal record locater" address for his page, and the state seal 
comes up, along with a blue highlighted list of Web sites around California. 
Click on "Earrings, by Lisa" and you are transported to Poway, where you can 
choose from pictures of translucent beads and turquoise stones. Another click 
sends you to a computer in Watsonville, where you can learn all about biplane 
tours. Surf and weather reports, restaurant guides, the Mt. Wilson Observatory 
and several high schools throughout the state are also on the list. 
</P>
<P>
 Amy Brown, 22, who put up her own home page last summer, says she had 1,700 
accesses one day last week, nearly double that of a florist who rents space on 
the same computer. Her page has links to her friends' computers in San 
Francisco and Athens, Ohio, plus other Web sites she thinks are particularly 
cool. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coral Gables, Fla., manicurist says it doesn't take any real technical 
skill to construct a home page. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a reflection of yourself; you get creative," says Brown, who has 
received several requests for dates despite her disclaimer that the picture on 
her home page doesn't look anything like her. "It's nice to peer into the life 
of somebody that you don't know who lives 8,000 miles away." 
</P>
<P>
 William Scott Proudfoot, a librarian at West Valley College in Saratoga, 
Calif., recently created a home page so he could share with the world the 
letters his great-grandfather, a Civil War veteran, sent to Proudfoot's 
great-grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought about giving them to the University of Iowa, but we wanted more 
general-public type people to see them," says Proudfoot. Since the beginning of 
the month, more than 1,600 people have looked at the site, which includes 
pictures of Newton and Hannah Scott and their obituaries. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, a browser can travel to the Library of Congress' Web site to view 
more Civil War photographs or to Brian Boyle's site in New Jersey, where he has 
compiled a list of other Civil War information available on the Web.  
</P>
<P>
 "Is this going to change the world? I don't know," says Andreessen, who has 
grown sensitive to the criticisms of hyperbole about himself and his program: 
"We're certainly helping to open things up to a lot of people. Are we changing 
the world? I don't know. Well, yeah. I guess we are." More on Computers

USED HARDWARE MAKES ITS MOVE; SECONDHAND COMPUTER MARKET HAS UPGRADED INTO BIG 
BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS KERBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a scrap yard built on the site of an old racquetball club here, the 
computers come to die. 
</P>
<P>
 Truckloads of aged PCs, printers and mainframe equipment pile up in the 
parking lot of Silicon Salvage Inc., waiting to be torn apart by crews wielding 
electric screwdrivers and power saws. Disk drives as big as toasters, cooling 
fans in black cases, green plastic circuit boards, all are piled up for resale 
or to be melted down for their gold and silver plating. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Silicon Salvage owner Chuck Hulse describes his operation as a 
junkyard, it's more of an electronic butcher shop; most of the machines arrive 
in good working order. But they are yesterday's models, slower PCs that can't 
run the latest software or refrigerator-sized mainframes that cost too much to 
maintain. 
</P>
<P>
 Recycling, reselling or rebuilding these hulks keeps scores of small Orange 
County companies busy, along with several large firms, such as upgrade 
specialist Kingston Technology Corp. in Fountain Valley and repair giant 
Cerplex Group in Anaheim. That's in addition to a cottage industry of 
consultants who help companies decide how much processing power they need. 
</P>
<P>
 As ever faster and more powerful computer programs are introduced, requiring 
more speed and memory, businesses that tear apart or resell displaced equipment 
are booming. Some electronics auctions feature PCs sold from excess inventories 
that have never been used. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lost track of how many roomfuls of computers I've hauled off," said Hulse, 
who keeps 14 employees and three trucks busy unbolting and unplugging PCs from 
offices across Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Buying in bulk from bigger organizations, such as Lockheed Corp., Southern 
California Gas Co. and UCLA, Hulse said he often gets the oldest PCs for as 
little as $10 apiece if he takes them away. 
</P>
<P>
 With the parts inside computers often selling for more than the machines are 
worth intact, Hulse said, the development of the salvage business was 
"inevitable." 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's gotten pretty conscious about what's in the computers," Hulse 
said. "It used to be where I'd be going through people's trash, but now I 
wouldn't find much." 
</P>
<P>
 Hulse's work occurs near the bottom of a computer food chain that begins when 
businesses and home users decide their machines can't handle newer versions of 
software programs or are not compatible with newly installed PCs on their 
office networks. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, says Newport Beach consultant Gary Koch, a business faces a 
bewildering array of options: whether to upgrade some or all of its older 
machines; whether to buy more powerful equipment, either new or used, and 
choosing how much to spend. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of it is just the learning curve people have with their software," Koch 
says. "It's not that their computers are too slow, it's that they're better at 
using them and suddenly (computer) speed is an issue."  
</P>
<P>
 The market for used computer equipment and upgraded or spare parts has grown 
along with the overall PC industry. Executives at several computer-exchange 
companies estimate that nearly $2 billion worth of used PCs, monitors, printers 
and other devices were sold in the U.S. secondhand market last year. About 
$11.5 billion was spent on the repair and upgrade of older PCs, workstations 
and mainframe computers last year, estimates Don Blumberg, an industry 
consultant in Fort Washington, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael S. Jordan, president of United Computer Exchange Corp. in Atlanta, 
said his company arranges 5,000 sales a month, many involving more than one 
machine. The buyers are small-business owners, parents looking for an 
inexpensive machine for young children and college students, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have an 8- or a 9-year-old, you don't want to spend $2,000 on a 
computer for them, you want to get something to introduce them and get used to 
the idea of a computer," Jordan said. "You'll be less worried about the hassle 
of, 'Will it work with what I've got?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The sellers, meanwhile, are often larger companies and universities. Home 
users tend to sell to friends or relatives, or stash old machines in the attic, 
Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gartner Group, a consulting firm in Stamford, Conn., estimates that 
companies will retire 50 million to 70 million PCs between 1992 and 1996. And 
Chris Goodhue, author of the company's estimate, said that even that range is 
at best an educated guess. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did some spreadsheets aimed at calculating PC retirement, but the problem 
we ran into was: How do you define retirement?" Goodhue said. "Is it just that 
a machine gets retired forever, or does it also have to be out the door of the 
firm?" 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Anson, for one, can't wait to boot a few machines out of his company's 
door. Information systems manager of the Irvine pharmaceutical maker Cocensys 
Inc., Anson says he has trouble getting the company's nine Apple computers to 
work with 104 other machines running on the IBM-compatible operating system. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want them out of the building, period. They're too hard to integrate," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Macintoshes, which cost $5,500 when new two years ago, have been 
depreciated to a third of that on the company's books, he said. But the 
machines would sell for only about $1,000 on the street today, and upgrading 
them to work with the other PCs would cost about $1,000 each. But even an 
upgrade wouldn't make them fully compatible. 
</P>
<P>
 Anson thinks the company's money would be better spent on newer machines. 
Cocensys originally bought the Macs to run chemical diagraming software, but 
such programs are now available for DOS. Anson hopes to auction the Macs to 
employees as soon as the company has enough money to buy replacements. 
</P>
<P>
 One easy option for companies ready for new machines is to shift older 
computers to less demanding applications. But that is often difficult, said 
Drew Erdman, a manager for computer procurement and installation at Taco Bell 
Corp., because machines must still communicate with each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell and many other large companies donate some used machines to schools, 
charities and other nonprofit groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet most older machines retain some commercial value, and are sold to brokers 
or employees or traded to the original equipment manufacturers, often for 
credit on newer machines. 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, the middlemen who add value to used machines range from small parts 
operators like Oscar de la Garza, whose four-employee business, Dela Computer 
Marketing in San Clemente, had revenue of about $800,000 last year, to Aurora 
Electronics Inc., an Irvine firm formed two years ago that did $130 million 
worth of business in fiscal 1994. Both sell parts and components, and work with 
repair and service companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to stay in the mid-range (computer) market, since the PC parts have 
gotten to be so cheap," De la Garza said. "You could say we're supplying almost 
the same parts that IBM can get you. . . . We try to have a faster turnaround, 
though." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Allison, Aurora's chief operating officer, said his company, though far 
bigger, was founded with a similar goal of helping users extend the life of 
their machines. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you go to tell a customer how they should cope with older computers," he 
said, "there's really no right answer, except there are a lot of ways they can 
do it. That's what makes the business work." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Klein, founder and chief executive of the Cerplex Group Inc. in Anaheim, 
said that the used computer market resembles the auto industry, with all shades 
of support services, parts and salvage companies. 
</P>
<P>
 From its founding in 1990, Cerplex has grown to about 1,500 worldwide 
employees -- 450 in Orange County -- and it estimates nearly $130 million in 
revenue this fiscal year, according to Klein. The company has benefited from 
growing demand for computer-repair services from companies that don't want to 
part with older systems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing a lot of the same things you'll see auto-parts companies doing," 
he said. "It's taking old hardware back from the field that's either broken or 
out of service, and tearing it apart for parts or reconditioning it as spares." 
</P>
<P>
 Computers are easier to upgrade than cars, of course. New monitors, more 
powerful disk drives and enhanced circuit boards are staples of the upgrade 
market. Privately held Kingston Technology, which specializes in such 
aftermarket PC components, expects revenues of $800 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Peggy Kelly, a Kingston spokeswoman, said that many of its customers are 
companies that no longer have employees who don't already own computers and can 
make use of hand-me-down PCs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be that, rather than spend the money on upgrading older machines, 
businesses could just pass them around to other departments," Kelly said. "Now, 
everybody has one (a PC) on their desk." 
</P>
<P>
 Accountants frown on throwing away computers that are less than three years 
old and not fully depreciated, said Ron Seide, Kingston's marketing director. 
</P>
<P>
 "The effective life of a system can be a long time, well past its depreciation 
-- maybe it's 10 years, or until its power supply burns out," Seide said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, some managers shy away from upgrading more than a few computers at 
once. While spending $200 to $300 for an upgraded microprocessor chip might 
look attractive, he said, it won't be the only expense. 
</P>
<P>
 "It might look good if you have a 286 machine and somebody says they can make 
it into a 386," said Bob Smith, a systems support analyst at Century 21 in 
Irvine. "But then you have to have more hard drive space, a bigger monitor, 
more memory. By the time you put all the pieces together, you haven't saved 
much, and you've got a more complicated machine."  
</P>
<P>
 A consultant's rule of thumb had been that a business person could spend about 
$2,000 on a new PC setup that included a printer and software. But even that 
figure is declining -- two years ago $2,000 would have bought a 386 desktop 
machine but today's notebook computers with 486 chips, which are more than four 
times as powerful, now sell for close to half that amount.

 Even PCs built around Intel's advanced Pentium microprocessor chip, which was 
introduced just last year, have started to turn up at the auctions run by 
broker J. R. Rodeffer every few weeks at the Santa Ana warehouse of his 
company, BBC. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodeffer said he often buys machines from businesses that were "taken in" by 
advertising claims and aggressive marketing by resellers, sticking them with 
equipment they don't need. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people overbuy their computers. Most people could use a decent 386 
or 486, but the industry hypes them on 'new and improved!' (machines)," 
Rodeffer said, referring to less-advanced Intel chip models. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodeffer said he also auctions unsold computers acquired directly from 
manufacturers that had surplus inventory, including AST Research Inc. in Irvine 
and PC market leader Compaq Computer Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have to concentrate on the hot new sizzle," Rodeffer said of the larger 
companies' priorities. In contrast, the used and discontinued models he 
auctions often sell for half of their original retail price. "They don't want 
to spend their salesmen's time on stuff that they can sell through quieter 
channels." 
</P>
<P>
 AST said it holds several auctions of machines it receives back from customers 
every year. In fact, the company planned to sell about 2,500 refurbished 
machines in Las Vegas this weekend as the Comdex industry trade show gets 
underway. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Cox, AST's director of marketing for consumer products, said the 
company doesn't see the used market as a threat to its sales because of the 
superior computing power of newer models. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodeffer said his company no longer buys machines based on Intel's 286 
processor, which was introduced about 10 years ago. Too slow to run today's 
programs and with an average selling price of under $200, these vintage PCs 
aren't worth the trouble, he said. The last batch of 286 machines he handled 
were sold to brokers in Russia last spring, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At a BBC auction earlier this month, 150 people looked over lots ranging from 
used notebook computers to six-outlet electrical extension chords and boxes of 
software. Dallas-based auctioneer Bart Seagers gave the event the feel of a 
farm foreclosure sale, but the crowd was a discerning mix of students, 
technicians and small-business owners. 
</P>
<P>
 A flashy, used Apple Powerbook 145B sold for $725, for example, about half of 
its retail price a year ago and $125 less than its published trading value on 
Atlanta's United Computer Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Remfert, a networking consultant based in Santa Ana, came to look at 
Apple equipment and by the end of the day had spent $300 on word processing 
software and computer circuit cards to help display video images. The 
equipment, if new, would have cost about $900 at a retail store, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The prices have been getting high lately" as more users catch on to the 
secondary computer market, Remfert said. But he cautioned that some people were 
buying equipment they didn't necessarily need. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just because you can get a low price on something doesn't mean you'll be able 
to use it," he said. "I think it's because everybody here has got the bidding 
bug."

INSIGHT; VIEW FROM WASHINGTON / JAMES RISEN; DON'T LOOK FOR MODERATION FROM THE 
NEW HOUSE LEADERSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, JAMES RISEN writes about the economy from The Times' Washington 
bureau. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Monday, Bill Archer was just another Republican bomb thrower, an obscure, 
24-year back bencher with radical ideas about tax and economic policy. And no 
one outside his Texas district ever paid much attention to what he had to say.  
</P>
<P>
 But on Wednesday, Bill Archer was poised to become chairman of the single most 
influential committee in the House of Representatives -- the tax-writing Ways 
and Means panel -- and suddenly Archer had become President Clinton's worst 
nightmare: a Republican bomb thrower with real power. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican revolution that swept the nation Tuesday has turned Washington 
on its head, humbling mighty Democratic powerbrokers while transforming 
long-suffering Republicans, many of whom have never had to worry about actually 
enacting their proposals, into the governing class. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty years in the wilderness had bred in frustrated House Republicans like 
Archer a willingness to pursue proposals far outside the mainstream. But now, 
if he and other long-ignored lawmakers actually try to fulfill their fondest 
legislative dreams, America is in for a Reagan-style lurch to the right that 
will leave Clinton and his economic policies in the dust. For the Clinton White 
House now, the only real hope is that the Republican leadership in the Senate, 
which is far more moderate, will act as a brake on the most extreme measures 
that emerge from the House. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't look for moderation from anyone in the House leadership, however. Most 
of the new Republican leaders, starting with future House Speaker Newt Gingrich 
of Georgia, are supply-side ideologues who see their electoral mandate as a 
second chance to finish the job Ronald Reagan started. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas Rep. Dick Armey, for example, who is likely to replace Rep. Dick 
Gephardt (D-Mo.) as House majority leader, is a full-throated advocate of 
Reaganomics. Armey, along with Gingrich, was an architect of the Republican 
"Contract With America" that calls for steep personal and business tax cuts and 
greater defense spending, coupled with a balanced-budget amendment to the 
Constitution. Armey, a former economics professor, vows to fire Robert 
Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office, and can be expected to 
stock the CBO and the professional staff of the influential Joint Tax Committee 
with conservative economists and analysts who won't laugh off supply-side 
theory the way Reischauer has. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Ohio Rep. John Kasich, who is likely to become chairman of the 
House Budget Committee, is a slash-and-burn conservative who crafted 
legislation -- nearly passed the House earlier this year -- calling for adding 
$90 billion more in budget cuts over five years to the Clinton deficit plan. 
The measure was defeated only after an intense effort by the White House, which 
warned that it would virtually shut down the domestic side of the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 And at the House Banking Committee, new Chairman Jim Leach of Iowa is likely 
to give the committee staff a hunting license to begin an intense investigation 
of the Whitewater scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it is at Ways and Means where dramatic policy shifts may first become 
visible. 
</P>
<P>
 Archer is assuming command from a pair of old-line Democrats, Rep. Sam Gibbons 
of Florida and Rep. Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, who were both closely allied 
with the Clinton Administration. Until he was forced to resign his chairmanship 
after being indicted in a corruption scandal, Rostenkowski was perhaps 
Clinton's closest supporter in the House; Gibbons, who took over as acting 
chairman this year, picked up where Rostenkowski left off, helping move a 
Clinton-style health care plan smoothly through his committee.  
</P>
<P>
 Forget about all that with Archer. In an interview, the congressman from 
Houston said he has trouble with income taxes -- any income taxes. He simply 
doesn't believe in them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would hope down the road that we could find an alternative to income taxes 
so we can eliminate them," Archer says. "I know it is not something we can do 
in this term, but we have to begin to think creatively." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Archer hasn't cared for any tax bill passed by Congress since the 
1981 tax cut that began the Reagan revolution. Now he is furiously working with 
his staff on new proposals for the next Congress. High on Archer's list is a 
broad-based consumption tax, which he would impose only in conjunction with a 
sharp reduction in capital gains and income taxes; Archer is also intrigued by 
Armey's proposal for a "flat tax" that would reduce income tax rates across the 
board while eliminating loopholes. 
</P>
<P>
 While many economists argue that a shift to consumption taxes would be highly 
regressive, placing a greater burden on the poor and middle class, Archer 
dismisses such concerns as the product of hidebound liberal thinking. His goal 
is to unblock obstacles to savings, investment and job creation -- then watch 
as supply-side theory goes into action with a vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to overcome this mind-set in which we argue about everything in 
terms of rich against poor," Archer says. "People will argue that a consumption 
tax is regressive, but if it allows you to eliminate obstacles to savings and 
investment, then you are looking at something that lifts all boats." 
</P>
<P>
 At Ways and Means, which has jurisdiction over most "entitlement" programs -- 
such as Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and Aid to Families With Dependent 
Children -- Archer will also have broad control over welfare reform and health 
care legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 So Clinton can forget about anything close to his Administration's 
initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking forward to real welfare reform," Archer says -- by which he means 
cuts. "We can pick up budget savings (for tax cuts) in the welfare area," he 
adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, Archer's sudden ascension has left Administration officials and 
congressional Democrats shuddering. 
</P>
<P>
 "Archer is not a nut. He's an extreme fiscal conservative -- and an angry, 
negative guy after all those years in the minority," observes one senior 
Administration official with extensive experience on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm worried about Archer," adds Rep. Robert Matsui (D-Sacramento), a key 
Democrat on the Ways and Means panel. "He's really an ideologue who has never 
had to cut a deal or learn how to compromise. It was always easier for him to 
walk away from deals with us than it was for him to join us when we had to take 
a step over a cliff to get a bill done. 
</P>
<P>
 "But that is going to be the challenge for all these guys," Matsui says. "Can 
they learn how to compromise, how to get things done and how to run Congress?"

FINDING THE WEEK THAT WORKS; FOR MANY EMPLOYERS THE FOUR-DAY SCHEDULE HASN'T 
PANNED OUT, BUT ALTERNATIVES ARE SUCCEEDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Margie Pohl, personnel manager at Tropitone Furniture Inc., says the 10-hour, 
four-day workweek was a bust at her factory. 
</P>
<P>
 After eight hours of welding and machining aluminum patio furniture, workers' 
productivity fell sharply, according to Pohl. "It was just grueling for our 
employees," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine company had to operate on Fridays to make up for the lost 
productivity and fill shipment orders. After a year of having to pay hefty 
overtime wages, the company abandoned the 10-hour workdays. "It just cost us 
too much," Pohl said. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-day workweek has been well received at some companies, but as more 
businesses in California and nationwide adopt shorter weeks, evidence is 
emerging that the four-day schedule is not producing the expected financial and 
environmental benefits for most companies. 
</P>
<P>
 This is especially true in California, where employers complain that state 
wage laws leave them little flexibility to run such schedules effectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Tropitone has not been alone in trying and later abandoning the four-day week. 
Companies that have stuck with the schedule suggest that it has had mixed 
results. And some -- seeing weaknesses in the 10-hour workday -- are instead 
opting for the 9/80 plan, under which employees get every other Friday off by 
working nine hours Monday through Thursday and eight hours on alternate 
Fridays. 
</P>
<P>
 "The four-day workweek has not worked out very well at all," said Willie 
Washington of the California Manufacturers Assn., which has 900 member 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 He attributed the problems largely to the state's restrictive wage 
regulations. At their core is a law that requires overtime pay whenever a 
workday exceeds eight hours; in most other states the overtime rule kicks in 
only after 40 hours are worked in a week. 
</P>
<P>
 The only way a California business can legally run a compressed workweek is by 
first getting the approval of two-thirds of its employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Employers and employees can initiate the vote for a shortened workweek, and 
either can rescind it. But for workers to do so, they must wait a year. 
Employers may remove it at any time, but to switch back they must again ask for 
a two-thirds approval. Companies say that limits their ability to operate fluid 
work schedules to meet seasonal needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturers on compressed schedules must also guarantee employees 40 hours 
of work each week, and they cannot schedule shifts longer than 10 hours. That 
means companies with continuous operations can't install, say, two shifts of 12 
hours each. 
</P>
<P>
 That is exactly what Indianapolis-based Inland Container Corp. wants to do at 
its paper mill in Ontario. Personnel manager Larry Gravette said Inland 
Container's mills in other states operate on 12-hour shifts. "It's just more of 
an economic disadvantage" for California, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd Aubry, director of the state Industrial Relations Department, said the 
state's wage provisions were intended to protect workers and have become more 
flexible in recent years. Noting employers' complaints about inflexibility, he 
said that "it's something that the Industrial Wage Commission will have to take 
a look at." 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson, who temporarily lifted the daily overtime rule after the 
Northridge earthquake in January, has said he plans to ask the Legislature to 
get rid of it permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, experts say, 25% or more of large companies offer a four-day work 
schedule to at least some employees. In California the figure is probably 
closer to 15%, said Matthew Bartosiak, a senior consultant at the Employers 
Group trade organization in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Since mid-1989, when labor officials began tracking compressed workweeks in 
manufacturing, 537 factories have reported making the switch, mostly to four 
10-hour days a week. But experts said many companies have since dropped the 
compressed schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Beaulieu, personnel manager at Tolo Inc., a Santa Ana maker of metal and 
plastic components that had been on a four-day workweek, said the company 
dropped the schedule a few weeks ago. He said management made the decision, but 
he would not give further details. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the recent nationwide surge in the number of employers going to 
compressed work schedules, 10- and 12-hour work shifts have always been the 
norm for workers such as police officers, firefighters and hospital employees.  
</P>
<P>
 Many city and county governments, because of declining tax revenues, close 
their offices on alternate Fridays to cut costs. Most offices in Orange County 
and some in Los Angeles County now operate under the 9/80 plan, though Orange 
County officials decided last week to discontinue the practice because it was 
not saving the county enough money. 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, the push for compressed schedules is part of a larger workplace 
trend that has seen most large employers offer staggered hours and flex time -- 
which do not require a vote by workers. Flex time gives employees a span of 
time in which to report to work. And staggering start times helps employers 
comply with state car-pooling requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 "Increasingly, workers are finding a desperate need for more personal time," 
said Barney Olmsted, co-director of New Ways to Work, a nonprofit resource 
group in San Francisco. Olmsted said more companies are considering the 9/80 
plan, which seems to be producing better results than the four-day workweek. 
</P>
<P>
 Fluor Inc., an Irvine-based engineering services firm, looked at the four-day, 
10-hour workweek, but Mark Krouse, Fluor's human resources manager, said the 
9/80 plan seemed to present less of a strain for workers. After a trial run of 
the 9/80 plan in the summer of 1990, Fluor workers overwhelmingly approved it 
and the new schedule was begun the following March. 
</P>
<P>
 About 90% of Fluor's 3,000 employees in Irvine now work the 9/80 schedule. 
Senior managers and others -- including Krouse -- work conventional five-day 
workweeks to handle customer concerns on the off Fridays. 
</P>
<P>
 Krouse said the 9/80 plan has helped lift Fluor's average vehicle ridership 
requirements from the South Coast Air Quality Management District to 1.34 
employees per car this year, from 1.23 in 1991. (The AQMD's goal is 1.5.) 
</P>
<P>
 The 9/80 schedule has helped Fluor recruit people such as David Neeve. "It was 
a great incentive to work here," said Neeve, 26, who uses his free Fridays to 
work toward an MBA. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide surveys have shown that most people prefer a compressed schedule, 
whether it's the 4/40, the 9/80 or some variation that gives them extra days 
off. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Kirk Wulff, a machine operator at Wesval Inc., an Anaheim company that 
makes controls for aircraft rudders. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly every Friday morning, Wulff, 30, tees off at a golf course in Brea with 
his neighbor. He's home by 10 a.m., takes care of work around his Anaheim house 
and can pick up his 6-year-old daughter from school. "When my wife gets home, 
we start our weekend," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wesval's owner, Kevin Huffer, raved about the four-day week as well. He said 
it has saved his company as much as $1.80 an hour per worker in overtime 
expenses. "It's worked out fantastically for us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But for some manufacturers, the 9/80 plan isn't really an option, because the 
extra hour each day doesn't boost production or save money. 
</P>
<P>
 And the four-day, 10-hour workweek has taken a punishing toll on some people, 
especially middle managers caught between production and senior management 
ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Rick Boyer, a warehouse manager at the Pacific Fitness factory in 
Cypress: "I'm here at 6 in the morning and I never get out of here. I work a 
hell of a lot of Fridays" to make sure the work is done. 
</P>
<P>
 Partly because of the excessive work, Boyer said, he has given his notice. 
"Personally, the four-day workweek really sucks for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Cooper, president of Pacific Fitness, which makes exercise equipment, 
said most of his employees seem to like working fewer days, but even Cooper 
could not offer a ringing endorsement.  
</P>
<P>
 His main complaint: At the end of a quarter or a fiscal year, when the company 
needs to ship "everything that doesn't walk," the company has to operate on 
Fridays, which is costly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't say it's doing more good than bad," Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tropitone, "we just couldn't do without Fridays," said Pohl, the personnel 
manager. "Our customers needed things. They wanted it shipped on Friday." 
</P>
<P>
 Worse yet, Pohl said, workers began to miss one of their regular workdays -- 
some apparently on purpose -- then come in Fridays, for which they were paid 
overtime. "It didn't take long for employees to figure that out," Pohl said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Tropitone's struggle with the four-day workweek was such that it 
wouldn't matter if state labor laws were loosened. "I don't think we would ever 
go back to it." New Ways to Work 
</P>
<P>
 Employers have been experimenting with alternatives to the conventional 9-to-5 
workday in response to environmental concerns, efficiency demands and the 
growing need among workers for flexibility. But some companies say the 
benefits, of compressed workweeks in particular, are falling short of 
expectations. Strategies being tested include: 
</P>
<P>
 * 4/40: 10 hours of work on four days, usually Monday through Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 9/80: 36 hours of work one week (nine-hour days Monday through Thursday, off 
Friday) and 44 hours the next week (nine-hour days Monday through Thursday, 
eight hours Friday). 
</P>
<P>
 * Flex time: Gives employees the option of changing their starting and ending 
times daily within a preset range (e.g., workers begin between 7 and 9 a.m. and 
leave between 3 and 5 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
 * Staggered working hours: Employers stagger starting and ending times, 
generally by 15 minutes to 2 hours, so not all workers arrive or leave at once.

EXPERTS EXPLAIN HOW TO AVOID BUYING A USED ELECTRONIC LEMON; COMPUTERS: STICK 
WITH NAME BRANDS AND EXPECT TO PAY MORE BEFORE CHRISTMAS AND DURING TAX AND 
BACK-TO-SCHOOL SEASONS, DALEY MARKET CORP. EXECUTIVES ADVISE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Unlike choosing a used car, few people know much about purchasing a previously 
owned personal computer. Where are the best deals to be found? How do you avoid 
buying an electronic lemon? To help explain the PC aftermarket are Pete Daley, 
president of Daley Marketing Corp. in Costa Mesa, and Sidney Hasin, a senior 
technical analyst for the company, which publishes a series of reports on the 
value of older and used PCs and mainframe equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: How can you extend the life of an old PC? 
</P>
<P>
 Sidney Hasin: You can add on extra memory or a new hard disk for a few hundred 
dollars on most PCs, which is probably the most popular upgrade. If you're 
writing a novel on an old machine, a bigger hard disk may be all the upgrade 
you need. If you're doing something with numbers or want to use a newer 
program, though, then you're looking at more equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do you know when you need a new computer? 
</P>
<P>
 Hasin: People bump into two kinds of limits. First is whether their machines 
can run the software they want it to, and second is the capacity for 
"throughput" of the computers. That means how fast the PC can crunch numbers or 
do other operations. If you find you're getting impatient, watching the wheels 
go around until you get an answer from your machine, then it's probably time to 
add on additional capacity or to buy something more current. I didn't say a new 
computer, though -- just something that's more current. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What are some guidelines for determining the value of older PCs? 
</P>
<P>
 Hasin: Depreciation sets in very quickly on computers. After a year they're 
only going to be worth about 45% to 50% of the retail price, depending on the 
manufacturer. Two years later, they'll drop by another 40%. So if you've spent 
$2,000 to begin with, it'll be worth $1,000 a year later, then $600 a year 
after that, then $300, then $200, then it's junk. That doesn't mean it's worn 
out, it means you won't be able to sell it for much. Or that you can buy it for 
a little. Disk drives and printers have a slower depreciation rate because they 
don't become outdated as quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How much of an expert do you have to be, as a consumer, to have confidence 
in a used machine? 
</P>
<P>
 Hasin: You don't need to worry as much as if you were talking about a used 
car. Cars wear out because they're mechanical. Computers are mostly electronic, 
though, so they last. If they've been serviced, and there's a record, then 
you're probably in good shape. The mean time to die (for PCs) -- that's my own 
expression -- is way beyond the limits of economic obsolescence. That's a fancy 
way of saying a computer isn't going to burn out . . . for about 10 years, at 
least. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How often should a machine have been serviced? Is it better to buy from a 
company with an in-house service department? 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Daley: Other than for PCs, computer equipment should be on a maintenance 
agreement with the manufacturer. . . . For mid-range and mainframe computers 
there should be a preventive maintenance scheduled every month. 
</P>
<P>
 The main requirement that an end user should have is that the machine has been 
under a maintenance contract. You probably want a machine that's been on an 
agreement with its original manufacturer. There are third-party maintenance 
companies that can save you 30% to 40% of what the manufacturer's agreement 
would cost. But the dilemma is that when you take that machine to a broker or 
to an end-user, whether or not it will be accepted back into the manufacturer's 
plan is another question. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Does the brand matter? 
</P>
<P>
 Daley: If you're buying a used PC, it should be a brand name. That's mainly 
because the parts that can be inside an other-than-brand-name are often cheap 
or modified. Anybody can stick a memory board onto a frame, but some of those 
inexpensive parts or components or memory tend not to not operate properly, or 
don't last. 
</P>
<P>
 Hasin: It's related to market share. Compaq machines (resell) extremely well. 
IBM also does fairly well, depending on the model. They've got a good image. 
The clones are unpredictable, though. The ASTs, the Dell machines, they begin 
to fall out of favor more quickly. Part of it's based on the stability of the 
company. IBM has had big problems, but nobody expects them to go away. You 
can't say that for every company. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: When is the best time to buy a used computer? 
</P>
<P>
 Hasin: Pre-Christmas, when there's a tremendous demand, may not be the best 
time to buy any kind of machine. Often the best time is in January, when the 
newer equipment is discounted more. That means the supply of used equipment is 
more plentiful as well. Then around tax season the demand begins to pick up and 
the prices go up a little. Then demand trails off until the end of summer, when 
back-to-school starts and everybody starts looking for deals again. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Where are the best places to buy or sell used equipment? 
</P>
<P>
 Hasin: Check with the large retail outlets. They sometimes take old machines 
in exchange, so they're a good source for what a computer's worth. They may 
also know what auction houses are looking for. 
</P>
<P>
 Swap meets are great if you know what you're looking for, and auctions are 
good, too. I've heard of people picking up some wonderful deals . . . but it's 
always caveat emptor (buyer beware). Comparative shopping is really the only 
way to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What sort of warranty should you expect? 
</P>
<P>
 Daley: A 30-day warranty is typical for used PCs. Other than that, it's 
typically an implied warranty that the equipment will be accepted for 
maintenance by the manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: If you don't know much about PCs, what should you look for in a used 
computer? Can you hire somebody to look for you? 
</P>
<P>
 Daley: If I were buying a used PC today, I wouldn't buy anything less than a 
486-based machine, (running at) 50 to 60 megahertz. You want to be able to run 
current software. Buying anything less than a 386 machine, running at 33 
(megahertz) isn't recommended, unless you can get a great deal on it. But I 
mean it shouldn't cost you more than $400 or $500. 
</P>
<P>
 There are consultants to hire that will determine your needs and recommend 
some configuration that fits. The other way to do it is that a lot of larger 
retailers have consultants on staff who will do that just as well. Buying a 
used PC isn't always the perfect solution. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Should you buy an entire system used, or is it better to look for bargains 
piece by piece? 
</P>
<P>
 Daley: There are people who will put a whole system together themselves from 
different parts, but again you've got to know what you're doing. You may have 
to change some of the software configurations so that different equipment runs 
together.

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: HOW NEW BANKRUPTCY LAWS AFFECT INDIVIDUALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to stem the rising tide of bankruptcy filings nationwide, 
Congress has overhauled the laws governing them for the first time in 16 years. 
The new law, dubbed the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994, was signed by President 
Clinton in late October and went into effect immediately.  
</P>
<P>
 While the bulk of the 50-page reform concerns corporate bankruptcy filings, a 
handful of important provisions affect individuals.  
</P>
<P>
 Here's a look at how the act altered previous law and what it means to you: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How does the new law change personal bankruptcy rules? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: It creates a new category of debts that can't be erased, or "discharged," 
through bankruptcy. It boosts federal exemptions, allowing some debtors to keep 
more of their assets. It protects prospective students from post-bankruptcy 
discrimination. It clarifies when you can use a bankruptcy filing to forestall 
a foreclosure. And it elevates the status of former spouses and children, 
giving them greater ability to collect back debts and allowing them greater 
latitude when taking a debtor to court. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What debts can't be discharged in bankruptcy? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Most debts owed to the federal government -- be it to tax authorities or 
student aid agencies -- are not dischargeable. The new law adds that if you 
borrowed on a credit card to pay income taxes, which are otherwise not 
dischargeable debts, you can't erase that credit card debt either.  
</P>
<P>
 Also added to the list: marital debts you agree to pay as part of a divorce 
and money owed your ex-spouse in property divisions, dues and assessments owed 
to a condominium or cooperative association and criminal fines owed by a 
Chapter 13 debtor. In addition, if you buy luxury items or take cash advances 
against a credit card within three months of a bankruptcy, these debts 
generally cannot be discharged, says Robin Leonard, author of "How to File for 
Bankruptcy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How does the law protect students? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: It prohibits lenders from denying a federally guaranteed student loan to a 
person who has filed for bankruptcy protection in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How much of my assets can I keep when I file bankruptcy? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: That depends on the type of bankruptcy you file and where you live. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law doubles so-called federal exemptions for Chapter 7 -- personal 
liquidation -- filings. These exemptions say debtors can keep up to $15,000 in 
home equity; up to $8,000 in accrued loan value in a life insurance policy; up 
to $8,000 in personal items, but none worth more than $400; jewelry worth as 
much as $1,000; a car worth as much as $2,400, and tools used in your trade 
worth as much as $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
 However, some state laws preempt federal bankruptcy exemptions. 
</P>
<P>
 California, for example, has separate bankruptcy exemptions that break into 
two tiers. One tier allows debtors to keep few personal assets but a 
substantial chunk of home equity. The other, which is more favorable to 
renters, allows you to use a home equity "credit" to shelter assets that would 
otherwise have to be sold to pay creditors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How does the law protect former spouses and children of bankruptcy 
petitioners? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: First, it says that pending court actions aimed at determining paternity, 
child support or alimony will continue even after one of the parties to the 
suit files bankruptcy. In the past, these legal actions would be indefinitely 
stalled until the bankruptcy was settled. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, it adds debts owed to former spouses to a list of debts that can't be 
erased in bankruptcy. And it gives payment of child support and alimony greater 
priority, allowing these debts to be paid even before Internal Revenue Service 
can collect past-due taxes. (In effect, creditors affected by a bankruptcy line 
up to get paid. Where you stand in line often determines whether your debt is 
satisfied. Children and ex-spouses are now standing near the front of the 
line.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How does the law affect foreclosure proceedings? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: A Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing can now stop a foreclosure process until the 
date of sale. However, once the home is sold in foreclosure, it can't be 
regained by a debtor who files for bankruptcy protection. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, courts had great discretion over when and whether a Chapter 13 
filing could stop a foreclosure. Some judges would actually reverse completed 
foreclosure sales, while others would rule that if a foreclosure sale had been 
scheduled, it was too late to stop it with a bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How does this law discourage personal bankruptcy filings? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: It doesn't, Leonard says. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the original intent, the final law actually makes it easier for some 
people to file. It does, however, encourage Chapter 13 -- "work-out" -- filings 
as opposed to the more serious liquidation filings under Chapter 7. And it 
provides some modest education provisions that aim to ensure that bankruptcy 
petitioners fully understand what they're doing and how it will affect them and 
their credit rating in the future, she notes. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the law recognizes bankruptcy petition preparers -- non-attorneys 
who often file thousands of bankruptcy petitions for financially troubled, 
low-income individuals -- and creates a new set of rules and penalties for 
preparers who abuse the process.

SEARS ROEBUCK TO TEST EMPLOYEE GAIN SHARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sears, Roebuck and Co., the nation's third biggest retailer, plans to test the 
waters of employee gain sharing, an experiment that will be closely watched by 
management experts as well as other major retailers. 
</P>
<P>
 Under gain sharing, employees present suggestions to a screening committee of 
their peers and managers. If a suggestion is adopted, the employee and the 
company share any profits that result, usually on a matching dollar basis. 
</P>
<P>
 A form of employee incentive common in manufacturing, gainsharing is rarely 
used among retailers, and the Sears' trial will be followed with keen interest. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman said Sears would make an announcement about its plans next year. 
The retailer employs 300,000 workers at 800 outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 Gain sharing originated in the early 1940s, an idea of steelworker and union 
leader Joe Scanlon, and it has proven particularly successful in manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies such as Martin Marietta Corp., Motorola Inc., Herman Miller Inc., 
Ameritech and Boston's Beth Israel Hospital have profited from successful 
so-called Scanlon Plans, according to a recent report in Harvard Business 
Review. 
</P>
<P>
 Gain sharing "is moving out from its traditional base in manufacturing - where 
it was relatively easy to install - to service industries such as hospitals, 
financial institutions and transportation companies," said Steven Markham, a 
management professor at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Fraser, a vice president of the National Retail Federation in Washington, 
D.C., said he did not know of any major retailers currently using gain sharing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of talk about it in 1991, but we ran into a recession, and it 
was difficult to have a payout, so people lost interest in it," he said. The 
timing now may be perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 But gain sharing in retail may have some problems, said Murray Forseter, 
editor of "Chain Store Age Executive," a trade magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Starting true gain sharing would be pretty hard because it deals with the 
smaller things. I'd be real interested to know myself how they would do it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's largest retailer, has a profit-sharing 
plan, "but it is not hooked up to productivity," a spokesman said.

PERCEPTIONS ASIDE, STATISTICS SHOW A DROP IN CRIME; LAW ENFORCEMENT: VIOLENT 
INCIDENTS SUCH AS MURDER, AGGRAVATED ASSAULT AND RAPE HAVE FALLEN DRASTICALLY 
THIS YEAR, POLICE FIGURES REVEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Belying the public's rising fear of crime, the number of violent crimes on the 
Westside has dropped substantially in the first 10 months of the year, 
reflecting a citywide trend. 
</P>
<P>
 From January to Oct. 21, the most recent figures available, the number of 
murders, rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults declined 12.9% throughout Los 
Angeles, according to Los Angeles Police Department statistics. Of the LAPD's 
18 divisions, only the Harbor Division reported an increase in violent crime, 
with a 6% jump -- following a 12.6% decline during the same period in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Violent crimes fell a total of 25.6% in the West Los Angeles Division, with 
incidents of robberies plummeting 36% within the division's boundaries. There 
was a 24% decrease in robberies in the Wilshire Division during the 10-month 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Hollywood Division, the number of homicides fell to 24 for the first 10 
months of the year from 38 during the same period in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific Division reported significantly fewer rapes, down from 90 last 
year to 57 this year -- a 37% decline. All violent crimes in the division 
dropped 10.5% from last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Citywide, robberies were down almost 20% and homicides dropped 24%, from 866 
to 661. 
</P>
<P>
 Although LAPD officials say they are pleased with the drop in crime, law 
enforcement officials and crime analysts agree that the reasons behind the 
decrease are varied. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crime is an immensely complex, multifaceted problem. I just have to speculate 
on why this has happened," said LAPD Deputy Chief Ron Frankle, commander of the 
four Westside divisions of the West Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD's emphasis on crime prevention through Neighborhood Watch and other 
volunteer programs is probably helping to lower the rate of violent crimes, 
Frankle said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people are getting impatient about crime, so they're looking out for 
each other more. They're checking up on each others' homes, cars and 
businesses," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Markulis, director of the Delinquency Control Institute at the USC Center 
for Administration of Justice, said the statistics are a positive sign, but it 
is too soon to call the drop a trend. 
</P>
<P>
 Markulis, a retired LAPD commander, gave high marks to the police, attributing 
the improved statistics to the department's emphasis on community-oriented 
policing. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a department, LAPD has always been very dedicated to getting the community 
involved, with Neighborhood Watch and beat-policing programs," Markulis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankle added that upgrading the department's computer system has helped 
police officials better track where crimes are occurring, allowing commanders 
to more efficiently deploy officers to crime-ridden zones rather than trying to 
patrol vast distances. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to work smarter, not just harder," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Part I offenses, which include violent crimes and repressible crimes such as 
burglary and auto theft, have been decreasing statewide, said Detective Bob 
Stresak, supervisor of the LAPD's crime analysis unit. The department has seen 
one of the biggest drops in recent years in most categories, with homicides 
going down by almost a quarter this year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess the base question is why and that is what we just don't know," 
Stresak said. 
</P>
<P>
 At one time, Stresak said, he would have tried to determine a single reason 
for the decline, but now he is less willing to pin it on any one variable. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps more people are obeying the law, he suggested, or maybe improvements 
in private security systems are making life more difficult for criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Another possibility is that career criminals are getting older and are 
committing fewer crimes than they did when they were between the high-crime 
ages of 13 and 26 years old, Stresak said. 
</P>
<P>
 The seasons also impact crime, Stresak noted. For example, crime at the beach 
drops in January or when it's cold; not surprisingly, criminal incidents go up 
in July. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge earthquake may have played a role in keeping crime down. If 
natural disasters don't keep criminals off the streets, they keep potential 
victims at home, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish managing crime was like managing an assembly line," Stresak said. 
"Instead, when we're managing the intangible concept of crime. It's much more 
difficult with many more variables." 
</P>
<P>
 But why, if crime is going down, is the public's fear factor increasing? 
</P>
<P>
 The problem may lay more in people's perception of crime, the officers said. 
</P>
<P>
 If a radio is stolen from a BMW in Cheviot Hills, the car owner is likely to 
perceive the theft as a serious problem. But if the same incident occurred in a 
geographical area that has more crime, a stolen radio does not generate the 
same level of fear, Stresak said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe L.A. is not the crime mecca people think it is. But their perception of 
crime still creates significant fear," said Frankle. 
</P>
<P>
 With that fear in mind, the LAPD needs to continue to look at many aspects of 
policing, and not merely remain content with the lower rates, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to see that our cases and emergency calls are quickly and properly 
handled," Frankle said. "And we need to look to improve the quality of life 
that is not necessarily attached to those statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think we're headed in the right direction, but when I see a downward trend 
for several years, then I'll be really happy." Downward Trend 
</P>
<P>
 Violent crime dropped significantly for the Jan. 1 to Oct. 21 period this year 
compared with 1993. The number of crimes in the Westside's four LAPD divisions, 
and the change from 1993:

TREND BREAKER; ASSEMBLY: SHEILA JAMES KUEHL CELEBRATES WHAT ONE SUPPORTER CALLS 
A 'GLIMMER OF HOPE' FOR LIBERALS ON A NIGHT OF CONSERVATIVE WINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON D. MARKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A pine tree strung with multicolored lights marked the home of Sheila James 
Kuehl in Santa Monica, an appropriate beacon for the rainbow coalition found 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers, staff workers and politicos -- gay, Republican, Latino, labor, 
lesbian and Democrat -- were sipping Chardonnay and Scotch and brandishing 
cigars there Tuesday night to celebrate what one called "the one glimmer of 
hope" for liberals on a night of conservative election victories nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehl, a feminist lawyer and former actress, had just won the election that 
will make her the first openly gay member of the state Legislature. She 
trounced Republican Michael T. Meehan for the 41st Assembly District seat by 14 
percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing a red blazer and a nonstop smile, she schmoozed the crowd of 
supporters and media like a practiced pol. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, however, this was the 53-year-old assemblywoman-elect's first run at 
office after three previous careers: first as a TV actress (she was the brainy 
Zelda Gilroy in the 1960s series "The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis"), then as a 
college administrator, attorney, law professor and co-founder of the California 
Women's Law Center. 
</P>
<P>
 In her new role, she vowed to continue her work on women's equity issues -- 
nearly all of California's spousal abuse laws already bear her stamp. But said 
she also wanted to work on education, the environment and parkland acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
 Her district covers much of the western Santa Monica Mountains, stretching 
from Encino to Westlake Village and from Santa Monica to Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehl, who earned her law degree at Harvard University at age 37, said her 
first aim was to get on the Assembly's Judiciary Committee, and work with 
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) to revive the domestic partnership law 
vetoed by Gov. Wilson this year, even though she believes it may be doomed to 
another Wilson veto. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her substantial credentials in law and public policy, her campaign 
mailers played up, with photographs, her role as Zelda -- a tactic she partly 
credited for her victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "People loved her!" said Kuehl, contending polls showed 76% of the district's 
voters had seen "Dobie Gillis" and liked her character -- a quick-witted 
fast-talker determined to snare the hapless hero. 
</P>
<P>
 "They saw her as someone smart and someone they liked. They had to reassess 
their negative feelings toward me as a gay person. It jammed their homophobic 
radar." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehl's election cheered the gay and lesbian community. Said real estate 
investor and lesbian activist Gwen Baba: "The Republicans can try to turn back 
the clock, but they can't tell us we can't run for office. Now we know we can 
run and we can win." 
</P>
<P>
 Paris Poirier, who worked phone banks for Kuehl, said that many voters' 
stereotyped images of lesbians worked in the candidate's favor. "People said 
they thought she was a roll-up-your-sleeves kinda gal," said Poirier. "It was 
like they figured, if she's lesbian she must be hard-working." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehl raised nearly $500,000 from almost 5,000 individuals, according to her 
campaign manager. She also collected endorsements from many law-enforcement 
leaders, including Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block, a Republican, and 
from a broad range of Southland politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the donors was Assistant U.S. Atty. Lee Michaelson, a lesbian who said 
she was almost barred from her current post because of her sexual orientation. 
Kuehl impressed her with one phone call. "Most candidates ask for money, but 
Sheila asked for my ideas, too," said Michaelson. 
</P>
<P>
 One idea: that Kuehl supplement her advocacy of women's issues with 
gender-related issues in health care, housing and employment. Michaelson said 
that lesbians have been turned away from battered-women shelters, and that 
same-sex couples had trouble with insurance companies after the Northridge 
earthquake because few firms allow gays to share a homeowners' policy. 
</P>
<P>
 John A. Perez, a Burbank-based trade-union organizer, said the importance of 
her victory would come in humanizing gay issues in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can no longer gay-bash in the Legislature," said Perez. "From now on, 
there will be a face to our community when they talk about our issues on the 
floor." 
</P>
<P>
 As the party wound down around midnight, Los Angeles City Councilwoman Jackie 
Goldberg rushed into the house to give Kuehl a hug. Asked how the new 
assemblywoman will advance the gay agenda, Goldberg countered: "The gay agenda 
is a figment of the radical right's imagination. The only thing gays do is 
remind people that we don't have rights under the law. There's no agenda other 
than equality, and that's the message that Sheila will take to Sacramento."

 For some dental professionals, it's little more than a marketing ploy. For a 
specialist in Philadelphia, it's a rip-off of his earlier work. But for 
75-year-old Frances Brower, it was an answer to her prayer to be rescued from 
the bad breath that has haunted her since early adolescence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Recently I said to the Lord, 'Dear God, this has been going on since I was 11 
years old," said Brower, who was moved to prayer by a 6-year-old 
granddaughter's complaint about Grandma's halitosis. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Dear God,' " she recalls saying, " 'can't we reason together? If you grant 
me this, I won't ask for anything else.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly afterward, Brower saw an ad for the California Breath Center, a Pico 
Boulevard dental office that claims to be the only clinic on the West Coast 
that specializes in the treatment of clinically bad breath. 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks later, she went back and registered a low reading on the clinic's 
Halimeter, a device that measures the presence of hydrogen sulfide and methyl 
mercaptan, the "rotten egg" gases that are often responsible for halitosis. 
</P>
<P>
 Other causes can be sinus infections, lung problems or stomach infirmities, 
but in most cases, specialists say, bad breath can be traced to the presence of 
anaerobic bacteria -- microorganisms that flourish in an oxygen-poor 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people have more of the microbes than others, said Dr. Harold Katz, who 
runs the California Breath Center with his brother, Richard, also a dentist, 
and their friend, Jerry Jacobs, a medical doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 Reasons for the condition can vary, but people with chronically dry mouths 
often have bad breath because the lack of oxygen-rich saliva makes for a 
friendly environment for anaerobic microbes, Katz said. As people age, they 
produce less saliva and the problem gets worse. 
</P>
<P>
 In chronic cases, mouthwash alone only masks the problem. The $450 treatment 
includes an exam, medical history, teeth-cleaning and tongue-scraping, followed 
by a home regimen of brushing and rinsing with a medicated toothpaste and 
mouthwash. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so pleased, and so was the doctor," said Brower, a retired legal 
secretary and former Santa Monica resident who said she was ashamed of her 
halitosis despite her late husband's tolerance for the condition. 
</P>
<P>
 She recently moved to Riverside, and she hasn't heard any more complaints from 
her granddaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Brower said, she now calls the girl "better than a best friend," 
because bad breath is something even your closest pal would hesitate to 
mention. And the sufferers themselves find it hard to discuss. 
</P>
<P>
 "People will talk about their sex life, they'll talk about how much money they 
make, but this is one of the types of problems people don't want to talk 
about," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Relying on advertising, referrals from other dentists and word of mouth, the 
clinic has treated hundreds of patients since opening in May, Katz said. Plans 
are under way to open offices in San Francisco, Newport Beach and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank God, we've been very successful," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz and his partners are not alone; treatment of chronic bad breath is a 
growing segment of the dental care industry nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Manny Shaw, who manufactures Halimeters at his Intrascan plant in Chatsworth, 
said he has sold hundreds of the devices this year, double his sales over the 
previous five years. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is not clear that halitosis specialists are providing much more than 
would be available from a regular dentist, according to academic sources. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certain of the services that are provided would be what we would call 
maintenance -- dental prophylaxis and periodontal treatment -- all of which can 
have an effect on the breath of the individual . . . (and) which is available 
through all general and periodontal offices," said Jack Conley, associate 
professor of Dental Medicine and Public Health at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how legitimate or profiteering it is. It could be very 
appropriate and very good or a real scam," said Glenn Clark, associate dean of 
research at the School of Dentistry at UCLA. "What I do know is that the whole 
area of malodor is of interest to the dental community. It's an area that looks 
promising." 
</P>
<P>
 Although earlier work was done in Israel and Canada, the first American 
dentist to offer specialized care for bad breath was Philadelphia periodontist 
Jon L. Richter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the research has been done by scientists who were really interested 
in what they might find in breath gases that might be useful for diagnosis of 
medical problems. It was sort of accidental that they encountered large amounts 
of volatile sulfur compounds," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The run-of-the-mill dentist has access to this information. Whether he has 
the training and experience in treating bad breath is another matter. The 
run-of-the-mill dentist has access to scalpels but they don't do brain 
surgery." 
</P>
<P>
 Relations are not warm between Richter and the California Breath Center, part 
of whose printed list of frequently-asked questions is echoed word-for-word 
from a brochure he distributes. One of the few differences is in the estimates 
of the size of the problem, with Richter speculating that there are 25 million 
chronic sufferers nationwide while the Katzes and Jacobs say there are 80 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 "That group has actually taken all our literature and basically reproduced it 
and is spreading it out on their own," Richter said. "I've got a lawyer working 
on it." 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Jacobs acknowledged that he saw Richter's brochure before drawing 
up his own. "I'm not a professional writer," he said. "I'm a physician." 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, he said, "There's no question that he was the first in the 
country to have a halitosis center. That doesn't mean anybody else is not 
allowed to open another. The brochure is just a small part of our marketing."

COVER STORY; GETTING IN THEIR LICKS; WEST HOLLYWOOD: HOUSE OF BLUES STRIKES A 
SOUR NOTE WITH SOME NEIGHBORS WHO SAY TRAFFIC, PARKING PROBLEMS AND NOISE HAVE 
INCREASED SINCE THE NIGHTCLUB OPENED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 ONE NIGHT LAST SPRING, SAMANTHA ALLEN realized that the newly opened House of 
Blues might not live up to its motto: "Help Ever, Hurt Never." At least not as 
far as her West Hollywood neighborhood was concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen, who lives a block or so south of the nightclub and restaurant, heard a 
couple fighting outside her apartment. She and some other residents ventured 
outside and discovered that a House of Blues patron had apparently beaten his 
girlfriend and then sped away in a car. 
</P>
<P>
 "My neighbor and I looked at each other and said, 'Oh, great. If this is the 
shape of things to come, we're in for a bumpy ride,' " said Allen. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, things have been pretty bumpy for almost everyone along the eastern 
end of the famed Sunset Strip, where House of Blues overcame months of intense 
community opposition to open in May. 
</P>
<P>
 The club is already a phenomenal success, at least in the fickle entertainment 
industry. Its founder, Los Angeles businessman Isaac Tigrett, envisioned the 
$9-million entertainment complex as a tribute to blues and the rural "juke 
joints" where the music flourished. Celebrities -- including Dan Aykroyd and 
Jim Belushi -- were among the early investors. Tens of thousands of tourists 
and locals have come to munch on jambalaya, listen to live music from artists 
such as Aerosmith and Sheryl Crow, and buy T-shirts and souvenirs in the 
complex's Take It Easy Baby gift shop. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, House of Blues will rack up an estimated $12 million in sales of 
meals, drinks and merchandise alone (the company declined to release 
information on concert revenue). 
</P>
<P>
 The club's good fortune has spread to the city's coffers. West Hollywood 
officials note that the club has helped boost hotel occupancy rates and is 
already the third- or fourth-largest generator of sales-tax revenue in the 
cash-strapped city. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the club has many of its neighbors wailing. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents have presented West Hollywood officials with a long list of problems 
they say House of Blues has caused, from traffic gridlock to rowdy patrons to 
increased crime. In response, the city listed the area around the club as one 
of eight hot spots requiring stepped-up police patrols. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Bill Mangan of the West Hollywood Sheriff's Department station said that 
deputies have mainly been helping out with traffic and crowd control. He also 
said that the club's presence has not significantly altered crime rates in the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one neighboring business -- Butterfield's Restaurant -- has claimed 
that parking problems caused by House of Blues have ruined business. The 
restaurant has been struggling to reach a legal settlement with the club. 
Hollywood Hills residents have discussed filing a class-action lawsuit against 
the club and the city of West Hollywood. Recently, a group of disabled 
activists targeted the club for alleged violations of handicapped-access laws. 
</P>
<P>
 House of Blues publicists did not respond to repeated requests to interview 
Tigrett, the founder, for this story. 
</P>
<P>
 But club General Manager Steve Strauss says House of Blues has already made 
progress on some issues and is working on others with city officials and 
residents. The club has contracted with local garages for extra parking and 
hired a private security detail to control crowds. But officials acknowledge 
that such steps have not silenced criticism of the club and the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think some people would have preferred we put a toxic dump (on the House of 
Blues site) instead," said West Hollywood City Councilman Steve Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 House of Blues is not the only nightclub to raise the hackles of local 
residents, whose houses and apartment buildings have always coexisted uneasily 
with Sunset Boulevard businesses. But it has aroused a level of antipathy 
unrivaled in recent memory, according to residents and city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 For some critics, House of Blues has become a metaphor for careless 
development along the Sunset Strip, for decades a symbol of Southern 
California's free-wheeling night life and rock-music scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate could be far-reaching. The city of West Hollywood is floating a 
proposal -- the Sunset Specific Plan -- that seeks to promote and guide further 
development of up to 1 million additional square feet of retail and office 
space on the 1.2-mile stretch of Sunset Boulevard between Havenhurst Drive and 
the Beverly Hills border. If passed, the plan would provide various incentives 
to new businesses on the Strip, including tax rebates and concessions on 
usually strict parking rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials hope the plan will help the 10-year-old city get the most from the 
Sunset Strip gold mine it inherited on incorporation in 1984. But some 
residents fear the plan will lead to disastrous overdevelopment -- and their 
experience with House of Blues gives them little cause for hope, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's destroying our neighborhood," West Hollywood activist Candida McCollam 
said of House of Blues. McCollam has organized a protest group against a city 
proposal to build a parking structure on Kings Road, which she contends is 
being considered mainly for the club's benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not anti-development," said McCollam, who criticized West Hollywood for 
approving House of Blues without a full environmental review two years ago. 
"But there has to be some kind of adherence to rational planning. Things have 
gotten so out of hand in West Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
 Tigrett, the founder of House of Blues clubs in New Orleans and Cambridge, 
Mass., as well as the West Hollywood site, has a history of controversial 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, he has been best-known for co-founding, with partner Peter Morton, 
the Hard Rock Cafe chain of restaurants. The popular eateries, which serve up 
diner fare alongside rock 'n' roll memorabilia, grew out of a London restaurant 
the two opened in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, following a bitter lawsuit that divided the Hard Rock empire into two 
parts, Tigrett sold his stake in the company for $32 million. He then joined 
his father, entrepreneur John Tigrett, and developer Sid Shlenker in an 
ambitious project to build a 20,000-seat, $65-million pyramid-shaped sports and 
concert arena for the Tigretts' hometown of Memphis, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as two years ago, city documents show, the younger Tigrett boasted 
to West Hollywood officials about the Memphis pyramid while seeking approval 
for House of Blues. What local officials might not have known, however, was 
that the construction and financing of the pyramid was considered a fiasco by 
Memphis leaders and many residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the pyramid's promised attractions -- including a Hard Rock outlet -- 
never materialized, and by the time the arena opened in late 1991, management 
companies run by Shlenker and the Tigretts were $16 million in debt and had 
filed for bankruptcy protection, according to the Memphis Commercial-Appeal. 
The mayors of Memphis and Shelby County angrily terminated their contracts with 
the troubled companies. 
</P>
<P>
 House of Blues looks destined for a happier fate. The 27,000-square-foot club 
has already become a familiar landmark, perched on a key piece of hillside real 
estate overlooking the Los Angeles Basin. 
</P>
<P>
 The first thing most passersby notice is the corrugated tin siding, which 
Tigrett imported from Mississippi to give the exterior the look of a 
weather-worn blues joint. 
</P>
<P>
 The interior is considerably more upscale. A visitor can browse through the 
gift shop, dine in the 385-seat restaurant or hear a band in the music hall. 
Folk paintings and plaster-cast sculptures of famous blues artists decorate the 
bar areas and ceilings; the hardwood floors are buffed to a brilliant sheen. 
</P>
<P>
 Most patrons will never see the piece de resistance , though: the swank 
Foundation Room on the third floor. This is a private club for sponsors of a 
blues-education project that teaches local schoolchildren about popular music. 
Its guests can sup in a stunning, cherry-paneled banquet hall and then repair, 
through a hidden door, to the Buddha Room, a ritzy parlor with Oriental rugs, 
plush velvet sofas and Eastern sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
 The traces of Indian mysticism throughout the club reveal Tigrett's own 
spiritual bent. Raised a Southern Baptist, he converted to Hinduism and has for 
years followed an Indian guru named Sai Baba. The swami gave the Hard Rock its 
motto ("Love All, Serve All"), which is echoed in the House of Blues' "Help 
Ever, Hurt Never." 
</P>
<P>
 But Sai Baba's blessings have apparently not spared the club an early run of 
bad luck. A broken water main one night last summer sent 40,000 gallons of 
water cascading into the three-story structure. In September, sheriff's 
deputies used pepper spray on rock star Tommy Lee during a 75-person brawl that 
spilled outside the club. Even before the club opened, two of its celebrity 
investors -- John Candy and River Phoenix -- had died. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors complain mainly of traffic gridlock, noise and parking problems, 
especially when a big-name act plays at the club. Stretch limousines block 
driveways. Drunken patrons have been known to relieve themselves on lawns and 
in driveways along Olive Drive. One night, deputies cited a driver who had 
parked a van along the red curb outside the club. Inside the van deputies found 
drug paraphernalia and a half-dozen young people, who said they had driven all 
the way from Idaho to visit House of Blues. 
</P>
<P>
 The club says it is working hard to solve the problems. Strauss, club general 
manager, said last week that he is moving toward satisfying the last of 128 
conditions for a permanent certificate of occupancy, replacing the temporary 
one that the club has operated under since it opened. He also said that he has 
agreed to a city request to enclose an outdoor deck that had drawn complaints 
about noise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't tell you how many dollars we've spent to ensure we take care of the 
city, the neighborhood and our guests," Strauss said. 
</P>
<P>
 But many residents remain skeptical. The temporary certificate in particular 
has been a sore point for community activists, who have argued that it allowed 
the club to flout codes regulating parking, maximum occupancy, disabled access 
and other issues. Some have even attacked the tin siding as "outhouse 
architecture." 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time the (House of Blues) plan was being considered, there should have 
been additional conditions imposed on the project," said West Hollywood City 
Manager Paul Brotzman. "The traffic access and parking situation initially were 
a real disaster. It's much better today (than three or four months ago) but 
still not fully resolved." 
</P>
<P>
 The club, if only because of its high profile, will probably remain 
controversial for some time. Many residents fear that in the coming years, the 
success of House of Blues may come at the community's expense. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettie Wagner, president of the Marmont Lane Assn., has lived in the Hollywood 
Hills since 1956. She says that development along the Strip, including House of 
Blues, is hurting the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, the world changes. I know that," she said. "But you hate to see an 
internationally known Strip become trashy. . . . Sunset Boulevard is starting 
to go downhill like Hollywood Boulevard did 20 years ago." 
</P>

<P>
 Michael Gartner vividly recalls when, in 1989, as president of NBC News, he 
sat down for a meeting with Alfred Geller, the agent renegotiating Connie 
Chung's contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "Geller plopped down and put his feet on the table," Gartner says. "He had a 
few buttons of his shirt open with his rather large stomach sticking out. He 
proceeded to tell me he wanted $3 million a year for Connie, her own prime-time 
show, she got to pick the producer and . . . he wanted a quick answer. I said, 
'OK, here's your answer. Goodby.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Well, Gartner may have felt virtuous, but the fact is that Chung walked across 
the street and got almost all of the above at CBS (and eventually a co-anchor 
slot on the "Evening News"). Geller is still her agent. As for Gartner, he's 
back in the newspaper business from where he came. 
</P>
<P>
 Geller is one of a handful of very powerful representatives for those working 
in the television news business. Some call themselves agents, some managers, 
some lawyers, but the idea is pretty much the same. Like their counterparts who 
represent actors and professional athletes, they give career advice, scout job 
opportunities and negotiate contracts, generally taking 6% to 10% of the 
client's salary as compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 The news agents are occasionally vilified as being nothing but money-grabbers 
in a world that should be purer than that, for upping salaries to such a degree 
that actual news gathering has suffered and for handling too many clients 
interested in the same jobs. "They should all be put in front of a firing squad 
on the conflict-of-interest issue," says a high-ranking network executive. 
</P>
<P>
 But other news professionals credit them with truly caring about the 
electronic news business, for bringing newspeople into the 20th Century of 
salaries and for serving as necessary buffers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall, they reduce conflict between management and talent," says Tom Capra, 
who once ran the "Today" show here and has worked in Los Angeles as an 
executive at KNBC-TV Channel 4 and KTTV-TV Channel 11. "It's easier to tell an 
agent than his client that the client needs to get rid of the mustache." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, news managers are finding that negotiating with agents right now 
is taking an inordinate amount of their time and money. And the leverage is all 
on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's taking more time than I like," says Andrew Lack, president of NBC News, 
who nevertheless has a grudging respect for most of the top agents. "We're in a 
competitive business in which talent negotiations have become a sort of mano a 
mano . They're not ashamed to ask for the moon and they wait you out until you 
give them the stars and the sun. I'm only saddened when I remember that 
journalism is supposed to be a calling." 
</P>
<P>
 Before you go saying Edward R. Murrow would be ashamed, however, remember that 
he was the highest-paid broadcaster of his time and even moved across lines to 
the entertainment division to produce the programs that brought him sweet 
dollars. Still, most point to Barbara Walters' $1-million move from NBC to ABC 
in 1976 as the first indication that the talent might put something ahead of 
loyalty. And when Dan Rather took over the "CBS Evening News" in 1981 with a 
five-year, $8-million contract that was Page 1 news, the field was wide open. 
</P>
<P>
 Now there are a multitude of multimillion-dollar newsies at the networks, 
including Peter Jennings, Tom Brokaw, Katie Couric, Bryant Gumbel, Ted Koppel 
and Diane Sawyer, who entertained extraordinary offers from competing networks 
before re-signing with ABC in February for $7 million a year. And there are 
more in local markets, including L.A.'s own Paul Moyer and Ann Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 It's understandable why the heavyweights might want representation, but what 
vexes some executives is that virtually every general assignment reporter and 
producer of any note or hope also now has an agent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no problem with giving that kind of money to the Brokaws or Gumbels, 
because they can prove some direct responsibility for viewership," says 
Gartner, who notes that he was the 30th-highest-paid person in his division 
when he was president. "But it was the Chris Wallaces of the world that got me. 
I mean, does anyone watch the 'Nightly News' because George Lewis might be 
doing a story that night?" 
</P>
<P>
 It's too late to ask. Things are certainly not going to turn around now, not 
as we head off into multimedia mania. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now there's a climate of rape and sodomy," Lack says, "simply because 
the marketplace is so expanding with local markets and syndication. What you 
have is a real demand for talent, and it just doesn't mean a whole lot if you 
don't get that job at NBC News." 
</P>
<P>
 Sure enough, with his contract as "Today" show host up this month, Gumbel has 
made it clear that though he hopes to stay at NBC, he would be remiss not to 
explore the ever-widening highway of opportunity. It's at such times that the 
agents home in and put a client in play or, less charitably, play one 
interested party off another. 
</P>
<P>
 And why not? "You don't blame a real-estate agent for the price of homes," 
says David Burke, who formerly ran CBS News and says he has no problems with 
agents. 
</P>
<P>
 So who are these blameless piranhas? 
</P>
<P>
 The gang of eight described here (in no particular order) are, by most 
accounts, the major players. They differ wildly in style, if not in what they 
do. Each has fans and detractors. Each at times has been accused of conflict of 
interest, mismanagement, bullheadedness and meddling in production matters. Yet 
each has managed to stay atop the increasingly lucrative game. Richard Leibner  
</P>
<P>
 The most famous of the lot, Leibner's NS Bienstock company represents more 
than 300 news clients around the country. Aside from Leibner, there are eight 
other agents, including his soft-spoken and well-liked wife, Carole Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
 Leibner himself has rarely been accused of being soft-spoken, though he can 
charm the pants off you. He is balding, in his mid-50s and described even by 
friends as aggressive and competitive, by some not-so-friends as duplicitous. 
Sitting in his cluttered mid-town office here, the agent exudes schmooze and 
enthusiasm and his longtime passion for the news business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ask any other agent to rank 10 news stories and they'll probably tell you the 
best and worst," he says. "I can rank two through nine." This man watches not 
only his clients but also virtually every quasi-news program from daybreak to 
sundown. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Bienstock's clients are Diane Sawyer, Dan Rather, Maria Shriver, Paula 
Zahn, Mike Wallace and a host of Los Angeles personalities, including Tritia 
Toyota, Harvey Levin, Tawny Little, Jane Velez Mitchell and John Beard. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the other agencies, Bienstock receives tapes from hopefuls, accepts 
clients where potential is seen and then puts together more extensive tapes as 
it pushes to move the talent upward. 
</P>
<P>
 Also like other agents, Leibner has lost some through the years, including 
Morley Safer and Ed Bradley. "One problem with Richard is he can't let go," 
another agent says. His relationship with Mary Alice Williams, whom he moved 
from CNN to NBC in 1989, is a case in point. 
</P>
<P>
 Their bruised -- and litigious -- ending in 1992 still rankles both of them. 
Williams says she left Leibner because he was representing her while also 
pushing Maria Shriver and Faith Daniels for the same jobs at NBC. He says that 
she knew coming in who his clients were and that she was misled by NBC News 
President Gartner about her future there. He says they buried the hatchet over 
a lunch; she says she's still seething. 
</P>
<P>
 "You better have a thick skin to represent people," Leibner says. He's still 
the top gun around, which is why no less than Creative Artists Agency, 
Hollywood's premier talent firm, early this year signed a deal with Bienstock 
to gain access to the information-reality world. Jim Griffin  
</P>
<P>
 Griffin could hardly be further in appearance or style from Leibner, but he 
also has the respect of most of those with whom he deals. 
</P>
<P>
 Dapper and discreet, he has become the top representative for news 
personalities within the William Morris Agency. Sitting in his 33rd-floor 
Manhattan office, Griffin remains polite but cautious about saying too much 
about what he does. 
</P>
<P>
 He has no shortage of ego, however, especially when told that agents have been 
accused of constantly flirting with conflict of interest. "I guarantee they 
don't say that about me," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that he hasn't had his share of bumps. He has been Deborah Norville's 
agent since bringing her from local news to the "Today" show as a news reader 
in 1989 and ultimately as the spurned permanent replacement for Jane Pauley. 
</P>
<P>
 His peers say he pushed his client too far too fast, and now they're 
questioning the wisdom of her most recent move -- from CBS, where she anchored 
a prime-time newsmagazine last summer, to the syndicated "Inside Edition." 
(Griffin says it was an "eleventh-hour decision," based largely on Norville's 
decision not to travel so much.) 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Griffin, 45, is considered a class act by most, particularly current 
clients, who include Geraldo Rivera, Robert MacNeil and Jim Lehrer, Regis 
Philbin, Joan Lunden and Lesley Stahl. In the cases of MacNeil and Lehrer and 
Rivera, he's been able to work out highly lucrative profit-participation 
packages in which the talent also owns the companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I like about Jim is he's always there," says CBS' Stahl, who says she 
needs that kind of a sounding board and guru. "Jim doesn't do the contract and 
disappear. I'll call him before I sound off on issues at work to get his advice 
on whether I should be tough or pliable." Ron Konecky  
</P>
<P>
 "A true gentleman" is often the description of Konecky, a full-time lawyer who 
handles the contracts for several high-priced talents: Barbara Walters, Ed 
Bradley, Morley Safer, Charlie Rose, Kathie Lee and Frank Gifford, "60 Minutes" 
executive producer Don Hewitt and ABC News President Roone Arledge. 
</P>
<P>
 The gray-haired Konecky, now in his early 60s, began as a lawyer for MCA and 
still handles a lot of theatrical and other entertainment business. But it is 
news that he seems particularly passionate about. And he defends the role of 
the news representative. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been very helpful for the industry, certainly in bringing news talent 
up to par," he says, talking quietly in his mid-town office. "There was a time 
when it was tawdry for anyone in news to ask for more money. I also strongly 
believe it's better for an employee not to represent himself. Let someone else 
be the bad guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Alice Williams, for one, believes that Konecky has been the good guy for 
her. She signed on with him after leaving Leibner. "Each time I get offered 
something," she says, "he tells me what he's going to ask for and I say, 'We'll 
never get it.' And he always does. I've made more by doing free-lance with him 
than when I was working at NBC." 
</P>
<P>
 Like the others, Konecky pleads innocent to any charges of possible conflict 
of interest, even though he represents half the "60 Minutes" staff and the two 
men who recently squared off against each other as executive producers of the 
"CBS Evening News" and ABC's "World News Tonight," Andrew Heyward and Rick 
Kaplan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never play one off the other," he says. "I deal with each individual 
separately, and in this business we assume people are acting in good faith." Ed 
Hookstratten  
</P>
<P>
 Known as "The Hook" to friend and foe alike, he is described by one network 
honcho as "a big but not a major player." That's only because his clientele is 
small in number. "I have a boutique as opposed to a factory," says Los 
Angeles-based Hookstratten, who spurns most publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, as one producer says, "Hook rules this town." Hookstratten -- a 
lawyer in his late 50s who also represents some non-news people, such as 
talk-show host Tom Snyder, Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully and Pat O'Brien of 
CBS Sports -- manages Tom Brokaw, Bryant Gumbel, Paul Moyer, Hal Fishman, Ann 
Martin, Jim Hill, Colleen Williams and Steve Rambo, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're negotiating with Hook, you're playing at a big poker table," says 
NBC News President Lack. "Does he occasionally bluff? Sure. But he takes care 
of his clients, and I like him enormously." 
</P>
<P>
 Those currently represented by him -- and they tend to stay put -- see the 
tough and tender sides. 
</P>
<P>
 "He can be a real (expletive) when he wants to," says Moyer, whom Hookstratten 
took from KABC-TV Channel 7 to KNBC-TV Channel 4 for a whopping $1.4 million a 
year in 1992. "And that's what I pay him for. Underneath he's a sweet man, and 
not that complicated. But he drives the networks crazy." Bob Barnett  
</P>
<P>
 Washington-based Barnett represents about 300 news people, including Katie 
Couric, Sam Donaldson, Bernard Shaw, Jeff Greenfield, Judy Woodruff and his 
wife, CBS correspondent Rita Braver. Shunning the title agent in favor of 
lawyer , he insists that only two things differentiate him from the others: "I 
charge an hourly fee, and I don't move local talent from one market to 
another." 
</P>
<P>
 Barnett, 48, a highly regarded figure in the capital, says most news agents do 
little more than take their clients' money and send out their tapes. He 
describes himself as a problem solver for clients throughout their contracts, 
something to which one client, Andrea Mitchell of NBC, attests. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really feel he has an interest in my well-being at the highest level," says 
Mitchell, explaining that Barnett was keenly involved with helping define a new 
beat for her (foreign affairs) when she was recently moved aside at the White 
House. "What I've observed is that agents do very well with big anchor talent 
but they don't have much time for the others." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many on the management side say that while they like Barnett and find 
him the most realistic when it comes to salaries, he does not offer the same 
amount of follow-up as his peers: "Believe me, there's very little maintenance 
with Barnett. He's not the one calling to say, 'Hey, I hear you're developing a 
new show. Are you interested in so-and-so?' " says one network news producer. 
"He's best with those who are perfectly happy where they are." 
</P>
<P>
 One such person is ABC correspondent Greenfield. "My relationship with ABC has 
been pacific, and it's not like I need things like a dressing room or that I'm 
angling for an anchor job," he says. "Bob's a good negotiator, and that's what 
I need." Alfred Geller 
</P>
<P>
 Probably the most controversial figure of the group, Geller is described by 
some as "two-faced," and "a pig," while others hail him as "a real champion of 
minorities" -- including standing by his client, Max Robinson, while the black 
anchorman was dying of complications of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Geller, 62, a native New Yorker and former Wall Street lawyer, got into the 
news management business about 30 years ago. He now represents 90 clients, the 
most high profile being the married couple of Connie Chung and Maury Povich.  
</P>
<P>
 Geller says he may be the "least liked" agent because "I don't play ball."  
</P>
<P>
 Al Roker, the NBC weatherman, who has used Geller for 18 years, says he likes 
that Geller's agency is smaller than others. "I've never not gotten him on the 
phone; he's someone who really cares," Roker says. "On the other hand, I 
understand Alfred may get some people upset, but I didn't hire him to win 
popularity contests." 
</P>
<P>
 Geller does extensive work with clients, especially local ones, in constantly 
monitoring their work. "He's always critiquing me and is very concerned about 
any problems I might be having," says Dana Tyler, a WCBS-TV anchorwoman in New 
York whom Geller discovered on the air in Oklahoma. "He's opened my eyes about 
myself, and I would not be here if not for him." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in the business of helping my clients touch other human beings," Geller 
says. "But first and foremost, they are performers." Art Kaminsky 
</P>
<P>
 Kaminsky, a former Yale classmate of Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton, 
came of age in the agent business by representing hockey stars -- a group of 
whom went on to become the 1980 Olympic Dream Team. 
</P>
<P>
 Still largely involved with sports figures, Kaminsky also has about 25 clients 
at the network news departments, including Forrest Sawyer, Christiane Amanpour 
and Robert Krulwich. 
</P>
<P>
 He managed to get Sawyer into a network job one month after taking him on in 
1985 -- "He was so clearly the best newsman not at a network at the time" -- 
and recently moved Krulwich from CBS to ABC. But although all the networks made 
serious runs at foreign correspondent Amanpour this year, she ultimately chose 
to stay at CNN. "Let's just say she left a lot of money on the table," Kaminsky 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaminsky, 47, has guided Jim Lampley's career from sports to news anchor -- 
and now back to sports again. "When Jim went to CBS Sports and KCBS (as a 
sportscaster)," he says, "I got as part of the deal that he could do a handful 
of things at CBS News, including occasionally hosting the morning show. It was 
his work on that show that made the KCBS people hire him as a news anchor." Ken 
Linder 
</P>
<P>
 The newest and hottest kid on the block for quasi-news personalities, this 
Hollywood-style "New Age-nt" is based in Century City and already has hundreds 
of clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Linder's business is sometimes referred to by others as the House of Blondes, 
or the House of Bimbos, since he represents largely beautiful folks, primarily 
female ones. "If you want a blonde, you go to Kenny," one network honcho says. 
</P>
<P>
 The man in charge, just 40, is certainly no bimbo. He's a Harvard and Cornell 
Law School graduate who worked under Jim Griffin for years at William Morris 
before striking out on his own. 
</P>
<P>
 "I choreograph careers" is how he describes his work. "I love to find people 
and help them grow." Some of those he's currently helping include Nancy Glass 
("Inside Edition"), Barry Nolan ("Hard Copy"), Giselle Fernandez (CBS) and Matt 
Lauer, the popular news reader on the "Today" show. 
</P>
<P>
 In selecting an agent, Lauer says, "You need to choose a voice for yourself, 
someone respected who gets his calls answered. Kenny has tremendous access. But 
agents don't get you jobs; your body of work gets you jobs. I also chose Kenny 
because he's in Los Angeles. I can make my own contacts here (in New York); 
it's good to have someone doing my bidding there." 
</P>
<P>
 Linder is sometimes accused of having too many clients in the same arena and 
taking on anyone who asks. "First, you have to have a certain number to make 
ends meet," he responds. "But we treat them all first-class, even by sending 
out all their tapes Federal Express. I don't think there's an agent who doesn't 
occasionally put up two people for the same job. But we're in the business for 
the right reasons. I could have made twice as much money on Wall Street." 
</P>
<P>
 Would the news business be any different if there were no agents? 
</P>
<P>
 When Ed Joyce asked that question and took them on as CBS News president in 
1983, the answer was chilling. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyce declared public war, calling Leibner in particular and agents in general 
"flesh peddlers." 
</P>
<P>
 "I did it not just because of the money (being demanded) but because they were 
trying to have a voice in journalistic decisions like choosing their (clients') 
assignments," says Joyce, now living in the Santa Ynez Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel agents have to share some responsibility in the closing of so many 
news bureaus, because if a news division is going to pay $8 million for one 
person's salary while working for a corporation that is constantly reducing 
budgets, something has to go." 
</P>
<P>
 What went, however, was Joyce. His criticism of the representative for Rather, 
CBS News' most valued asset, drove a wedge between him and the anchor that 
Joyce considers a factor in Rather helping to engineer his ouster two years 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 So the mega-agents are here to stay. Their "penetration," as Joyce calls it, 
is overwhelming, but still there are some talents who just say no. Ted Koppel, 
Harry Smith and Bob Schieffer are three who do their own bidding. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't want a middleman between me and my management," says Smith, who 
without an agent managed to be plucked from the Midwest to co-host "CBS This 
Morning." He acknowledges having had lunch with Richard Leibner but says, 
"There was too much adrenaline there for me." 
</P>
<P>
 CBS veteran Schieffer has also managed to cover Washington, host a Sunday news 
program and anchor a weekend broadcast with no agent in sight. Why not? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm too tight," he says with a laugh. "And I'm kind of private and never did 
like anyone else knowing how much I make. The agents just have to go around 
telling that information as they negotiate. Frankly, I find negotiating very 
interesting, and I've discovered I can say, 'If you don't tell, I won't tell. 
Matter of fact, maybe you can even give me a little more.' "*

THEATER; HOT OFF THE GRIDDLE; JERRY LEIBER AND MIKE STOLLER HAVE WRITTEN DOZENS 
OF ROCK 'N' ROLL CLASSICS THROUGH THE YEARS. NOW, WITH DIRECTOR JERRY ZAKS' 
HELP, THEIR HITS ARE PLAYING HOT 'N' HEAVY AT 'SMOKEY JOE'S CAFE.' (AND BOY ARE 
THEY GLAD.)

<TEXT>
<P>
 More than four decades after starting out in the business, and two decades 
after more or less retiring from the hit parade, songwriters Jerry Leiber and 
Mike Stoller still stand as the most successful non-performing writing 
partnership in the history of rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine that no one else but these two had ever written a rock song. There'd 
still be more than enough to go around to keep a pretty terrific oldies station 
in business: "Hound Dog," "Jailhouse Rock," "Treat Me Nice," "Loving You," 
"Kansas City," "Stand by Me," "On Broadway," "Yakety Yak," "Love Potion No. 9" 
and "Ruby Baby," just for starters. 
</P>
<P>
 To KRTH-FM devotees, the crucial parts of the canon may carry a certain 
sacrosanctity -- but not necessarily to the writers themselves, whose legacy 
was not arrived at without a faculty for self-criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 This is abundantly evident as Leiber, the lyricist of the duo, recounts a 
candid conversation of the previous week with veteran stage director Jerry Zaks 
("Guys & Dolls"). Zaks was down at the Doolittle Theatre, rehearsing "Smokey 
Joe's Cafe: The Songs of Leiber and Stoller," a book-less musical revue that 
opens Thursday on the Hollywood stage after a Chicago tryout earlier this year. 
(The Chicago version, called "Baby That's Rock 'n' Roll," was directed and 
choreographed by Otis Sallid; the L.A. version is choreographed by Joey 
McKneely.) 
</P>
<P>
 It seems the four-time Tony-winning director wanted to include the 1959 
Drifters hit "There Goes My Baby" in the show but couldn't seem to settle upon 
a way to stage the ballad. Leiber was blunt in his advice: "Why don't you throw 
it out of the show?" 
</P>
<P>
 "And, I mean, I wasn't kidding," he assures. "I told Zaks, 'I can't stand this 
song anyway. It's my least favorite song. It's stupid.' There goes my 
baaayyyybeee . . . " Leiber begins singing the chorus like a derisive 
schoolboy, in case it's not yet abundantly clear that, all humility aside, he 
as a matter of fact really and genuinely does not like this song . 
</P>
<P>
 "And he said, 'You want to know something? . . . It's my favorite song.' I 
said, 'It's your favorite song?' I was completely nonplussed; it stopped me 
cold in my tracks. I mean, what can I say: 'You must be stupid too?' Or, 'How 
can you like this stupid song? We wrote it on the back of somebody's ass, and 
it doesn't make any sense, and (the recording) is out of tune, and the reason 
you don't know how to stage it is because (the lyrics) didn't mean anything?' 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'I don't care about any of those things. This song is an anthem . To 
a certain teen-ager in a particular time, it was significant, and a lot of 
people in a 12- to 15-year age differential love it, because it has meaning to 
them. And I am going to find a significant way of staging it in the show.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Great!' " Leiber says, suddenly equal parts enthusiastic and 
begrudging. 
</P>
<P>
 The modesty does not extend, of course, to every song in the figuratively and 
literally rich catalogue. The writer-producer pair profess pride in the "Smokey 
Joe's Cafe" show not just as a vanity booster but a chance to revive some of 
their lesser-known numbers alongside the obvious Elvis and Coasters chestnuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the more obscure numbers in the show, Stoller says: "Maybe we missed when 
we made the records, but the songs are still there, and we've had an 
opportunity to have them presented in a better light. You know, not every 
record you make is as good as it could be, and some of these songs, we just 
didn't get 'em right on the first go-round, and so we're taking another shot." 
</P>
<P>
 The show is performed by nine singer-dancers with a seven-piece band: 40 or so 
songs, nonstop but for an intermission. Mindful of three earlier attempts 
within the last decade to create a musical around their existing body of work 
-- two that were staged in London alone and one in Seattle that was the loose 
springboard for "Smokey Joe's" -- the celebrated collaborators are glad there's 
no attempt at wrapping a text around their songs in this, the largest such 
L&S-based production to date. 
</P>
<P>
 There are plans afoot to take the show to a Broadway theater, the Virginia, 
this coming February. It's a long way to the Great White Way for what started 
out as a career writing semi-scandalous "race" music in the early '50s. It 
might be a fulfillment of a dream . . . or maybe just a half-fulfillment. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few years after we first started writing songs, we thought about theater," 
Stoller says. "Even though we were both very in tune with blues singers and 
black culture, we were exposed to a lot of other things -- among them, 
obviously, songs by George and Ira Gershwin, Cole Porter, Rodgers and Hart, 
Rodgers and Hammerstein, Frank Loesser. And we harbored a desire to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 What happened? 
</P>
<P>
 "Still do. We're both very excited about this show, because we've seen some of 
the run-throughs. But this is stuff we've written before. People know these 
songs. I suppose that's good for the show, but we'd like to do totally new 
work, where all the music and lyrics stem from a book of some sort, that tell a 
story and become a piece in its own." 
</P>
<P>
 W hen Leiber dismissed "There Goes My Baby" in front of No. 1 fan Zaks, it 
hardly marked the first time the producer-writers dissed one of their own 
perennials. 
</P>
<P>
 Or certain interpretations. Most famously, the two initially had no love at 
all for the record that pretty much made them -- Elvis Presley's "Hound Dog," 
which cemented the Pelvis' then-new love affair with America and spent 11 weeks 
at No. 1 in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
 When that Elvis single first hit -- following such early '50s successes for 
the partners as the Robins' "Riot in Cell Block No. 9" and "Framed" -- Stoller 
and his first wife (he's now married to jazz harpist Corky Hale) had just 
finished a three-month vacation in Europe, and their ship, the Andrea Doria, 
was headed back to New York when it smashed into another ship in the fog and 
sank. Fifty passengers perished on that voyage, but the Stollers made it onto a 
lifeboat, and their second choice of ocean liner was greeted at the dock by 
Leiber, armed with a dry silk suit (just in case Stoller was too soggy for a 
photo-op) and some surprising news. 
</P>
<P>
 Recalls Stoller: "He told me at the dock, 'We got a smash hit in "Hound Dog"!' 
And I said, 'No kidding? Big Mama Thornton's record finally clicked!' "

 "Hound Dog" had been written for Thornton as a slow, growling, man-bashing 
blues four years earlier; the title came about when the writers were trying to 
think of a suitable euphemism for a certain four-syllable epithet that was too 
racy even by R&B standards. 
</P>
<P>
 When Leiber first heard Presley's version, he says frankly, "I didn't like it. 
I thought it was too frenetic and nervous, and not what we had in mind. 
Certainly lyrically it was a woman's song, but after that, stylistically, it 
was a regional blues. And Elvis Presley's song was like skiffle mixed with 
bluegrass mixed with hillbilly. It was white Southern -- it wasn't black. 
</P>
<P>
 "And the lyric was all screwed up! It didn't make any sense; it just had some 
slogans. It took, what -- 30, 40 years -- and these slogans turned out to be 
monumental icons, whether they mean anything or not. And that's a lesson to 
learn about history. But I didn't think it was very good, and we thought it 
screwed up our original record, and then it sold something like 7 million 
copies, and we started . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting used to it," Stoller says with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 "And before we knew it," adds Leiber, "we liked it a little bit, and every 
time we went into the bank we liked it more." 
</P>
<P>
 Before then, for several years' worth of partnership, the two avowed 
blues-hounds had written almost exclusively for R&B singers. Was writing only 
for black artists initially some matter of purist policy? 
</P>
<P>
 "Uh, no, I think more than that we just never figured on writing for white 
artists," Stoller jokes. "I don't know why we felt that a white singer singing 
the blues was inauthentic, whereby we gave ourselves a pass as writers to write 
the blues and the leeway to be as authentic as we could be. I guess later on we 
started becoming less racist and decided we could write for white people too. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when we heard people say, 'Oh, "Kansas City," that's an old blues song,' 
we thought we had really achieved it, because it was a song that we had just 
written." 
</P>
<P>
 "Hound Dog" was written, to the best of their recollection, in eight to 12 
minutes. Then there was the famous afternoon when song publisher Gene Auerbach 
-- dismayed that they'd been indulging in New York night life instead of 
writing songs for a Presley movie as promised -- shoved a couch in front of the 
hotel room door and ordered them to work. In the space of a few hours, they 
knocked off "Jailhouse Rock," "Treat Me Nice," "I Want to Be Free" and "(You're 
So Square) Baby I Don't Care" and then hit the town. 
</P>
<P>
 Seemingly effortlessly prodigious as they could be, the two also latched onto 
another sort of songwriting formula that required a more painstaking attention 
to craft. After "Yakety Yak," the 1958 Coasters hit, they began writing 
similarly styled tunes for that vocal group, musical-comedy miniatures with 
narratives and pauses and punch lines. "Charlie Brown," they remember, took 
several weeks to write and rehearse, as they concentrated on getting the timing 
just so. 
</P>
<P>
 As Leiber and Stoller have sat in on rehearsals for "Smokey Joe's Cafe" (named 
after a 1955 Robins hit), many of the suggestions they've fed Zaks have had to 
do with the pauses and punch lines in these more comedic songs: "There's more 
work to, say, one of the little Coasters vignettes," Leiber says, "because it's 
more theatrical and has characters and dialogue in it, so it's like directing a 
tiny radio play." 
</P>
<P>
 Their decidedly unbluesy flair for the theatrical became more pronounced later 
on, reaching its dramatic apotheosis in Peggy Lee's 1969 reading of their 
European-flavored dirge "Is That All There Is?" ( not included in the peppy new 
show). 
</P>
<P>
 By the early '70s, they'd lost interest in rock. In recent years, Leiber and 
Stoller seem to have made almost a full-time career picking up awards -- from 
being among the earliest Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees, in 1987, to 
getting a star on Hollywood Boulevard just two weeks ago -- but haven't had 
much public output. 
</P>
<P>
 They wrote some oddball songs in the '80s, Stoller says. "But we were no 
longer writing for the mainstream of the market. And we no longer had a vehicle 
with a record company to produce and put records out. As Karl Marx says, if you 
lose the means of production, then you're in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I think we changed more than the times. I know guys who are out there now 
older than we are" -- both Leiber and Stoller are 61 -- "who are producing and 
writing records. We started before they did, but they're six, seven, eight 
years our senior. I think in a way part of it was that we started so early -- 
we were actually 17 -- that by the time we were 27, we were old men in the 
business, in a way." 
</P>
<P>
 "And we also, to some degree, got a little bit bored or fed up with the rock 
'n' roll idiom," Leiber adds. "Because for us, it was a very limited form with 
which to express some of the more adult ideas we had. You may be able to bang 
out a 'rock 'n' roll' arrangement on a song like 'Is That All There Is?' but 
it's not appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Stoller: "We always wrote to amuse ourselves. And we were fortunate that 
when we were young, the audience that was buying records -- who were in and 
around our own age -- was amused too. But the audience for most records is 
still in that same age bracket, but we have to write things that amuse us now. 
And some of 'em may be universal in terms of age, and others may not be as 
interesting or exciting to somebody of 22 as to somebody in their 50s or 60s or 
40s. 
</P>
<P>
 "To do it right, we have to find the area in which to produce these songs. And 
I would think theater's maybe not the only way, but probably the best way, to 
get off." 
</P>
<P>
 The two won't discuss just what sorts of original theatrical concepts they 
have in mind but seem determined to get something stage-bound off the ground. 
Which, should the collaboration resume whole-scale, would have Leiber and 
Stoller's professional partnership well outliving even most of the younger 
Brill Building collaborators they mentored in the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Leiber: "I know people that work in this business that write hits 
together, and they hate each other. Just like Gilbert and Sullivan hated each 
other." He pauses, possibly for grumpy effect. "I don't think I could work with 
somebody that I didn't like." 
</P>
<P>
 Stoller looks up, beaming, almost too pleased: "That's the nicest thing you've 
ever said to me!" 
</P>
<P>
 "And it'll be the nicest thing!" Leiber growls with a laugh. They suddenly 
engage in a congratulatory slapping of hands, then -- as if veteran comedy 
writers instead of songsmiths -- they start to go over how they could've made 
the exchange that just ensued funnier in its beats and rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoller: "I should've said, 'Why, Jerry , that's the nicest thing you've ever 
said to me!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Leiber: " I should've said, 'It's not Jerry, it's Melvin!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Once a team, etc.

MOVIES; HO. HO. HO. HO. IT'S SIR SANTA; OSCAR-WINNING DIRECTOR AND BRITISH 
CINEMA EMINENCE RICHARD ATTENBOROUGH THOUGHT HIS ACTING DAYS WERE OVER. BUT 
AFTER 'JURASSIC PARK' CAME AN OFFER TO PLAY ST. NICK. HEY, HE ALREADY HAD THE 
BEARD.

 Talk about the comeback kid. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1970s, Richard Attenborough, a veteran of some 60 films, retreated 
from his acting career to concentrate on full-time direct ing. It turned out to 
be a sound decision, and Attenborough scored some notable successes, including 
an Oscar for "Gandhi" (1982), which also won for best film. 
</P>
<P>
 It came as something of a surprise, therefore, when Attenborough stepped in 
front of the cameras again to play John Hammond, the crazily ambitious 
entrepreneur with a wild notion about a theme park filled with dinosaurs, in 
Steven Spielberg's "Jurassic Park." 
</P>
<P>
 The role looked like a one-shot deal. But Attenborough, now 71, is back as an 
actor once more, this time as a leading man. 
</P>
<P>
 He plays Kriss Kringle, a sweet-natured old fellow who might just be the real 
Santa Claus, in 20th Century Fox's remake of the beloved 1947 film "Miracle on 
34th Street," which opens Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 So his acting career seems to have been seriously reactivated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, you're very generous," says Attenborough, in his customary teasing, 
bantering tone. "What actually happened with 'Miracle' was that someone saw me 
in 'Jurassic Park' and said we want someone with a white beard -- how about 
him? I've got a round face, white hair, a white beard. I can wear half-moon 
glasses and waddle a little, cope with a cane, raise my hat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was quite sure in my own mind that after 'Jurassic Park,' I'd be calling it 
a day (as an actor). That was just a one-off which gave me the chance to work 
with Steven. The old adage about acting -- that it's 98% energy and 2% talent 
-- is true, you know. And the energy's a little harder to summon as you get 
(older)." 
</P>
<P>
 For all this Attenborough hugely enjoyed his stint as Kriss Kringle/Santa 
Claus in "Miracle," which was shot largely in producer John Hughes' Chicago 
studio facility, with some exterior shots in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an irresistible offer," Attenborough says of the chance to star in 
"Miracle." "He's a classic figure, and it was a ravishing performance by Edmund 
Gwenn in the original film. That brought along a little pressure in having to 
follow it. 
</P>
<P>
 "But making the film was too good to be true, really -- you're driving down 
Central Park West on the back of a sled with thousands and thousands of people, 
particularly kids, lining the street, cheering, blowing you kisses and shouting 
'Merry Christmas.' And this was in the middle of April. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all worked fine until we passed one apartment block. I was trying to keep 
up my concentration as Santa Claus, aware there were both long and close lenses 
on me -- and there, right in front of the apartment block, is Michael Douglas, 
and he's thumbing his nose at me," he says of the actor, who starred in his 
film "A Chorus Line." Attenborough, of course, cracked up, which necessitated 
re-shooting the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We have arranged to meet at a TV studio in North London where Attenborough has 
been taping publicity interviews for "Miracle." He emerges bright-eyed, smiling 
his trademark smile (gap-toothed, mouth wide open) and as usual exuding 
bonhomie: "Nice to see you again, old dear," he says. (Everyone to Attenborough 
is "darling," "angel," "dear" or "honey," quite irrespective of gender or even 
familiarity.)  
</P>
<P>
 Now we must conduct an interview in the back seat of his Rolls-Royce as it 
purrs slowly through evening rush-hour traffic, taking us to Richmond, a West 
London neighborhood where, as it happens, both of us live. 
</P>
<P>
 In the driver's seat is Attenborough's chauffeur; beside him is his 
collaborator Diana Hawkins, who has been associate producer on his recent 
movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Sinking into his leather seat, Attenborough quickly disclosed his early doubts 
about taking the part in "Miracle on 34th Street": "There was a question about 
whether a film like this, a semi-classic, ought to be remade at all. After John 
Hughes asked me if I would like to do it, I rang Steven (Spielberg) and said, 
'I'm apprehensive.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the years Steven and I had talked on occasion about the principle of 
remakes. I think we both agreed that this was an exception." 
</P>
<P>
 How come? 
</P>
<P>
 "Because the excitement and satisfaction and joy that emanates from its 
subject matter is worth preserving. Now in this instance, that means keeping it 
alive, not as a museum piece or a thing you dust off each year. Children of 5 
or 10 or 15 now look at the (original) film with a total lack of suspension of 
disbelief. It's black and white, the clothes don't look the same, the cars 
don't look the same. Whereas if you could maintain the magic and overall 
feeling of the subject matter, then to give longer life to it is perhaps 
justified." 
</P>
<P>
 Remaking "Miracle on 34th Street," he says, was not like reviving "Citizen 
Kane," "Les Enfants du Paradis" or "The Big Country" -- "doing remakes of 
classics like that wouldn't make sense." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Attenborough thinks, Hughes pulled off a tough task: "He's given 
an edge to Kringle. In Edmund Gwenn's character, there wasn't any threat or 
latent violence. It was much simpler -- you either believed him as Santa or you 
didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Attenborough is also pleased with a scene in which Kringle is briefly 
incarcerated in an asylum: "It gives it a darker edge, that bit of credibility. 
And in the courtroom scene, I hope there's a couple of minutes where you think: 
'The old boy's gone potty, he really is a goner.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Attenborough also had a personal agenda for lending his support to an 
entertainment such as "Miracle on 34th Street": 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my concern that movies that are granted any stature whatever nowadays 
tend to be imbued with cynicism, with brutalities. The pornography of violence 
and all that. Well, fine. I don't say for one second they shouldn't be made. 
</P>
<P>
 "But for an audience, particularly an upcoming (young) audience, to assume 
that's what movies are, that's the staple diet and if you go to movies that's 
what you're going to encounter, that's another thing. So the one thing you 
don't do is go en famille . You have to examine carefully what you take your 
family to. And the phrase 'family movie' has terrible connotations. You're 
yawning before you start. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I do think there's room for -- what else do you call it -- family 
entertainment. Films where you go in and won't be affronted or horrified, 
because there are other elements: fantasy, magic, love, jollity, kindliness, 
warmth, concern of one human being for another. Say what you will about 
'Miracle on 34th Street,' I can take my grandchildren to it. If I had a maiden 
aunt I could take her, or my ma and pa if they were alive. And you go en 
famille . I think there's room for that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I read a review which described the new Tarantino picture ("Pulp Fiction") 
and thought, 'Well, I'm sorry, I really don't want to have to go and face up to 
that.' " 
</P>
<P>
 It is hard to convey to Americans the sort of prominence and in fluence 
Richard Attenborough holds in British society. He was knighted by the queen in 
1976, and is still widely known as Sir Richard, but two years ago he was made a 
peer of the realm; his official title is now Lord Attenborough, and he is 
entitled to sit in Parliament in the House of Lords, the upper legislative 
chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been famous in Britain since his film debut in 1942, when he played a 
small but key role in Noel Coward's "In Which We Serve," a war drama in which, 
perhaps fortunately for him, he portrayed a coward; because of it he would be 
offered meaty character parts for years to come.  
</P>
<P>
 He became a big British star in 1947, the same year the original "Miracle on 
34th Street" was released. Attenborough starred as Pinky, the hateful, amoral, 
baby-faced young gangster in "Brighton Rock," adapted by Graham Greene and 
Terence Rattigan from Greene's novel. It's bizarre that an actor who could play 
a young character with such credible menace has transmuted into the lovable 
Kriss Kringle through the years. "Yes," Attenborough drawls, "it's a very long 
way from Pinky, isn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Through the years his roles tended to become more benign, though he did play a 
murderer to extraordinary effect in "10 Rillington Place" in 1971. Often, 
though, Attenborough was cast as a well-spoken, decent sort of English chap, 
often in military uniform. As his career blossomed, so did that of his brother 
David, the naturalist who presents wildlife shows on television. 
</P>
<P>
 Attenborough made his directing debut in 1969 with "Oh! What a Lovely War" and 
in the years since has had his successes -- among them "Gandhi" and last year's 
"Shadowlands." He is a strong storyteller who prefers nonfiction to fiction and 
has often tackled films about people who have changed the lives of others and 
asserted human dignity. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics have charged that his work -- such as "Cry Freedom," a 1987 
account of anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko, and his 1992 "Chaplin," which 
bombed at the box office -- can be overblown and overlong. Still his films, 
liberal in their leanings, stand for a certain old-fashioned decency; he is 
unapologetic about that. 
</P>
<P>
 Attenborough is gregarious, a man with outspoken views on many aspects of 
public policy. He is a pillar of the British film industry and in the 1980s led 
a deputation of filmmakers to 10 Downing St. to discuss industry problems with 
then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. When she inquired plaintively why she 
knew nothing of these problems, Attenborough famously replied: "Darling, you 
never asked." He is or was chairman, president or patron of 30 organizations, 
including UNICEF, the British Film Institute, the Royal Academy of Dramatic 
Arts and Britain's Channel 4 television. 
</P>
<P>
 Even at 71 he is the busiest and most energetic person most people in Britain 
could name. For two days before this conversation, he had been in Israel; the 
next day he was to embark on a three-week visit to Africa under the auspices of 
UNICEF, taking in six countries, including Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are his forthcoming projects. "We've got four, haven't we, 
darling?" he asks Hawkins, who nods in agreement. "We have to make our minds up 
about which one to start when we've finished doing the publicity for 'Miracle' 
just before Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 He likes a fantasy-comedy called "In Seventh Heaven," by first-time 
screenwriter Ken Pearce: "It's about these little people, sort of like 
leprechauns, who were sent to America 600 years ago because of a curse and now 
live in an apartment block between the ceilings and floors. It's as funny a 
script as I've read in my life. I read it in the hotel restaurant in Chicago 
while I was doing Kringle and had to stop. I was an embarrassment to all 
concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is an adventure tale, with two male characters in the Mexican 
desert toward the end of the 19th Century. Attenborough also has a story, "Gray 
Owl," now being scripted by William Nicholson ("Shadowlands"), about a real 
Canadian Indian who was, as he says, "the first environmentalist -- a villain, 
a sham, but passionate about the preservation of the environment. Dave 
(Attenborough) and I saw him back in 1934 or 1935, actually lecturing with 
lantern slides. He was known as Gray Owl, though his Indian name was -- what 
was it, darling? -- He Who Flies by Night." 
</P>
<P>
 Lastly, Attenborough has been trying for seven years to get a green light from 
a studio for a film about American revolutionary and writer Thomas Paine. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be another bloody 'Gandhi,' " he grumbles, noting that the Oscar winner 
took him two decades to get made. He tried to persuade studios that two films 
about Paine -- one about his life in America, the other about his career in 
France -- could be made for slightly more than the cost of one, by shooting 
them at the same time on the same sets. His plan was to have the two films open 
on consecutive days. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I've been told if the first one flops, you lose money on the second too," 
he says gloomily. "I suppose I see the sense in that. So now (playwright) 
Trevor Griffiths is rewriting like crazy and trying to come up with a picture 
of about 3 1/4 hours -- which is quite fashionable now. So Tom Paine's always 
ready, as I tell everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, his standing in Hollywood is high; "Shadowlands," his last film, cost 
about $18 million but has grossed about $65 million worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "That helps the Tom Paine project," Attenborough says. "Because 'Chaplin' was 
such a disaster in the States, I might have struggled to get money again if 
'Shadowlands' had been a disaster too." 
</P>
<P>
 With all the activity he has lined up for himself, it doesn't sound as though 
Attenborough will be continuing his revived acting career. "That's right," he 
says. "Now I've done 'Miracle,' I'm not going to act again. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is, you see," he adds, with the air of a man in a hurry, "I've 
just got so many subjects I want to direct."

PHOTOGRAPHY; HE JUST DID IT; GORDON PARKS DIDN'T MAKE IT THROUGH GRADE SCHOOL. 
BUT HE DID OVERCOME MORE THAN A FEW OTHER, BIGGER OBSTACLES TO BECOME A 
LEGENDARY PHOTOGRAPHER, FILMMAKER, POET AND COMPOSER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Kristine McKenna, Kristine McKenna is a frequent contributor to Calendar.

<P>
 Gordon Parks is what's known as a self-made man. He was born in a small 
Midwestern town in 1912, the youngest of 15 children, never finished high 
school and was on the road fending for himself by age 15. 
</P>
<P>
 With little or no help, he went on to write several books, including five 
volumes of poetry and a best-selling autobiography, "The Learning Tree." He 
also worked as a photographer for Vogue in the '40s and for Life magazine from 
1949 to 1969, directed several films, including the commercial blockbusters 
"Shaft" and "Shaft's Big Score" and composed symphonies and sonatas. 
</P>
<P>
 Gloria Vanderbilt wanted to marry him, he says. Eldridge Cleaver wanted him to 
come to work for the Black Panthers. He's received 28 honorary doctorates from 
colleges and universities across the country and has counted among his friends 
everyone from Vidal Sassoon and Marlon Brando to the late Malcolm X. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this is doubly impressive in light of the fact that Parks, who is 
black, made his way in the world when American racial relations were still in 
the Stone Age. Now 81, he's still going strong, and an exhibition of his newest 
photographs is on view at the G. Ray Hawkins Gallery through Nov. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Showcasing work from "Arias in Silence," a new book that pairs Parks' poetry 
with recently completed lush, computer-generated images inspired by British 
painter J.M.W. Turner, the exhibition finds Parks a long way from his 
beginnings as a social documentary photographer in the '40s, when he was 
shooting gritty images of poverty in America for the Farm Security 
Administration. A lyrical reflection on the ebb and flow of nature, "Arias in 
Silence" is the work of an artist confident of his own abilities, no longer 
bent on proving anything. It's an extremely graceful book. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks, visiting Los Angeles from his home in Manhattan, is pretty graceful 
himself. An impeccably dapper man, Parks is dressed to the nines and speaks in 
a low, husky whisper worthy of Barry White. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks really knows how to work the room, and it quickly becomes apparent that 
there's more than a little of him in his cinematic creation, ultra-cool 
defender of truth and justice John Shaft. A sly fox who learned long ago how to 
discreetly go about his business, how to get down with the brothers in the 
street and charm the rich society ladies, Parks pretty much talked his way into 
every job he's ever had. He confides this with undisguised pride in a 
conspiratorial whisper before launching into the story of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was born in Ft. Scott, Kansas, and my earliest memories are of being around 
my blind uncle there," he begins. "He was a philosopher, and I can remember him 
saying things like 'I'm blind, so I don't know the color of your skin -- for 
all I know, you have purple eyes and green hair,' " says Parks, a polished 
storyteller who has clearly spent a good deal of time rummaging around in his 
own past. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father was a dirt farmer and we ate off the land, but it wasn't much of a 
farm," he continues. "My mother always saw that we had enough to eat, though. 
Family life was good and my mother was a wonderful woman -- I never once saw my 
parents have a fight -- but there were things surrounding my life that weren't 
so nice. Kansas was supposedly a free state, but I couldn't take my girlfriend 
to the drugstore for a soda and went to a segregated grade school. I can 
remember the advisers at school telling black kids, 'Don't worry about 
graduating -- it doesn't matter, because you're gonna be porters and maids.' 
There were lynchings in Kansas too. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time I wasn't aware I was converting those ugly experiences into fuel, 
but in retrospect I can see that the racism I experienced as a child gave me my 
drive. My mother always said, 'Don't come home complaining about anything 
because of your blackness -- just get out there and do it.' That was her 
philosophy, and it served me well. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother was a devoutly religious woman who wouldn't allow jazz in the 
house, but even though I'd never heard it, I had a yen toward symphonic music 
from the time I was a child -- I heard the June bugs playing music in the 
cornfields," he says with a laugh. "When I was 12 I bought a valve trombone and 
joined the school orchestra. I had such a good ear I was able to bluff my way 
through the performances -- nobody knew I couldn't read music." 
</P>
<P>
 Parks' life changed dramatically in 1927 when his mother died of heart disease 
and he was sent to live in Minneapolis with his brother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
 "That man didn't like children and didn't want to take me on, and I sensed 
that the minute I walked into his house," Parks recalls. "He pushed me out the 
door when it was 5 below zero outside and threw everything I owned out the 
second-story window. It was frightening being 15 years old and having no place 
to stay, with $2 in my pocket -- I guess it was him that started me on the road 
early." 
</P>
<P>
 Drifting from Minneapolis to Chicago, Parks lived in a flophouse while working 
a series of odd jobs -- he was a busboy, a waiter, a pianist in a brothel. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was in Chicago I began waking up to art and started hanging out at the 
Chicago Art Institute," he says. "I was knocked out by the things I saw there 
-- Manet, Monet, I loved it all." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1933, Parks landed a job with the Civilian Conservation Corps, which 
stationed him in Ft. Dix, N.J., and he married his first wife, Sally Alvis. The 
first of their three children, Gordon Jr., was born the next year, and three 
years later, in 1937, Parks bought his first camera. Parks was working as a 
waiter for the Northern Pacific Railroad at the time, and his knowledge of 
photography was pretty much limited to the pictures he saw in magazines left on 
the train by wealthy passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 Entirely self-taught as a photographer, he had managed to secure piecemeal 
work with his camera when, in 1942, he put in a bid to work for Rod Stryker and 
the government-sponsored Farm Security Administration, which recruited a 
prestigious team of photographers to document rural poverty in America. The 
group included Walker Evans, Marion Post Wolcott and Dorothea Lange. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stryker accepted me reluctantly -- he'd been criticized for his team of 
glamour-boy photographers -- and now they were gonna have a black glamour boy," 
Parks says. "He took me on, though, and I shot all over America for the FSA. It 
was during those years that I learned the power the camera has." 
</P>
<P>
 Parks, who relocated to Washington to work with the FSA, was also writing 
during those years and published two books, "Flash Photography" in 1947 and 
"Camera Portraits: The Techniques and Principles of Documentary Portraiture" in 
1948. With three children to support by 1943, he had to moonlight to make ends 
meet and free-lanced for Glamour and Vogue. "My work became rather chic when I 
was working for Vogue," he ruefully acknowledges, "but it was a matter of 
survival when I worked for them." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1949 Parks joined the staff of Life magazine, and in 1950 he was assigned 
to its Paris bureau, where he spent two years. Returning to New York in 1952, 
he went on to cover more than 300 stories for Life on a variety of subjects, 
including several critically acclaimed photo essays on the Black Power movement 
of the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I traveled with the Black Panthers and knew the Black Muslims too -- all of 
them contributed in their way," Parks says of those controversial 
organizations. "Whether you like them or not, they presented a unified front, 
and that was important. 
</P>
<P>
 "I covered the Panthers for Life, but Life didn't trust me for one second. I 
was the only one who could do it, though, so I got the job. Why should Life 
trust me to tell the Panthers story like it really was? Why should the Muslims 
trust me? Everybody was paranoid then, and they had reason to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was with Marlon Brando the night Martin Luther King was shot," Parks says, 
reflecting further on the social upheavals of the '60s. "He absolutely flipped 
-- he called Panther headquarters and started ordering guns, saying he was 
gonna shoot his way to Washington. I said to him, 'Marlon, look out at those 
city lights. There are a lot of people out there who feel like you do. You're a 
public figure. You can't just start blasting away.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Being on the front lines of the Black Power movement put Parks in danger that 
reached crisis proportion in 1965 when he did a photo essay for Life on Malcolm 
X. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that point I got a serious death threat, so Life sent my family out of the 
country and put me under 24-hour armed guard at the Plaza Hotel in New York. I 
lived like that for several months until one day I snuck out, got into my XKE 
Jaguar, went up to Harlem to talk to the people who were threatening me and 
sorted things out myself." 
</P>
<P>
 "This country's made real progress in terms of racism, but the progress that 
hasn't been made is still jolting," he says. "When you see something like the 
Rodney King thing go down, you realize how much progress there is yet to be 
made. That episode didn't surprise me, though, because I've had experience with 
California cops -- I could tell you things you wouldn't believe," he adds with 
a laugh. "They're kind of a high-strung bunch." 
</P>
<P>
 While America was being rocked with change, Parks' personal life was in 
turmoil as well. After he and Alvis divorced in 1962, he married his second 
wife, Liz Campbell. They divorced 11 years later, and he married Genevieve 
Young, whom he would also later divorce. An unrepentant ladies' man, Parks 
maintains friendly relations with all three ex-wives and says that his closest 
friends are women. 
</P>
<P>
 "The New Yorker wants to do a piece on how I get along so well with my wives," 
he reports, prompting the question as to why the marriages ended if he got 
along so well with these women. "The marriages ended because I'm a bad boy," he 
says, laughing. "Doing the kind of work I do makes it tremendously difficult to 
have a stable personal life." 
</P>
<P>
 The year after Parks married his second wife, the first of his four 
autobiographies, "The Learning Tree," was published, and in 1969 it was made 
into a movie. With assistance from filmmaker John Cassavetes, whom he had 
photographed for Life magazine and who was a fan of the book, Parks was hired 
to script, direct and score the film. He was to spend the next five years 
slugging it out in Hollywood and completed several successful films before 
leaving the industry in disgust in 1975 when "Leadbelly," his film biography of 
blues great Huddie Ledbetter, was buried in a studio changing of the guard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frank Yablans hired me to make the film, and he was replaced by Barry Diller 
right when I finished it," Parks says. "Diller didn't want to put money into 
Yablans' films, so basically he tried to kill my film -- he released it to 
porno houses! I talked about this openly with the press, and Diller called me 
up very irate about that, but I called him a bunch of bad names and told him 
not to call me again. At that point I decided I'd had enough Hollywood crap and 
stopped making films." 
</P>
<P>
 This is a decision Parks is recon sidering. He recently completed "The Sun 
Stalker," a novel on the life of British painter Turner, and he would like to 
see it made into a film. Toward that end, he met with a Hollywood producer who 
began the meeting, Parks says, by telling him: "Bill Styron was in here last 
week with a screenplay, and I told Bill it's just not time for a picture about 
slavery." 
</P>
<P>
 "Because I was black he assumed I was there to talk about Nat Turner!" Parks 
says. "I said, 'No, this picture is about J. M. W. Turner' -- who he'd never 
heard of, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hardest thing I've had to learn to accept in life is racism. I grew up 
alongside a white kid named Waldo -- both his parents were drunks, so my mother 
took him in. The blacks didn't like her doing that and the whites didn't like 
it either, but Waldo loved it because he had a place to live and food to eat. 
The point I'm making is that there was a mix of so many races in my family that 
I've never been able to understand why some people object to that. 
</P>
<P>
 "My tolerance for people who might be against me is a lot greater now than it 
was when I was young -- there was a time when I really rebelled against it," he 
continues. "But I know the things I suffered when I was coming up are in me 
still. When I started writing my last autobiography I was trying to remember 
and go back for the book, and I began having excruciating dreams several nights 
a week -- dreams so bad they left me afraid to go back to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've held a lot of rage inside for a long time, and I guess that's how it's 
coming out, because I'm still having those dreams. The rage is mixed up with a 
lot of things -- the writing, the music, pictures -- and I have nightmares of 
landscapes of fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nonetheless, if Providence were to grant me another chance and said, 'We're 
gonna make you a rich white boy and send you to Yale,' I'd still choose the way 
I came. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because what I've done is use my emotions for poetry or a novel or film and 
never let my feelings destroy me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever I lecture to kids I always tell them, 'Hey, if people don't dislike 
you because you're black, they'll dislike you because you got blue eyes, so all 
you can do is just forget it. Just waltz around it and fox-trot on back' -- 
that was my father's saying, and I've found it to be good advice." 
</P>

POP MUSIC; THE DAY THE MUSIC GOT STOMPED; THE ROLLING STONES' CONCERT AT 
ALTAMONT WAS ENVISIONED AS A PERFECT CLOSE TO THE '60S. BUT BAD PLANNING, BAD 
DRUGS AND A VIOLENT DEATH MADE FOR A CONCERT NOBODY WANTS TO REMEMBER.

<P>
 It was supposed to be the West Coast's answer to Woodstock -- a free, 
unfettered music festival in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. Co-sponsored by 
the Rolling Stones and the Grateful Dead, the event was envisioned as a perfect 
way to sing goodby to the '60s.  
</P>
<P>
 But when the relocated concert took place at the Altamont Speedway east of the 
city on Dec. 6, 1969, it quickly sank into the annals of rock history as a 
colossal disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five years later, the legend of Woodstock is brighter than ever, and 
people flocked back to a repeat festival this August to try to relive some of 
the magic. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody's talking about Altamont '94. 
</P>
<P>
 Parking, sanitation and medical facilities were grossly inadequate when the 
speedway crowd swelled to 300,000. Most of those people were cold, 
uncomfortable and unable to see the stage. Bad acid made the day even more 
hellish for many. 
</P>
<P>
 And late in the evening, as the Rolling Stones finished playing "Under My 
Thumb," a young man named Meredith Hunter, 18, was stabbed and beaten to death 
in front of the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the principals involved in Altamont, including members of the two 
sponsoring bands, refuse now to even discuss the event. Others, however, are 
willing to look back -- and the memories remain unsettling. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the ultimate nightmare," recalls Chris Hillman, a founding member of 
the Byrds who played at Altamont with the Flying Burrito Brothers. "It was the 
other end of the scale of what happened at Woodstock and at Monterey Pop -- the 
dark side of the experience. There wasn't anything redeeming about it, and it 
should never have happened. I was scared to death the whole time I was there." 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Stills, who performed at both Altamont and Woodstock as a member of 
Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd rather have people forget we were at Altamont," he says now. "We played 
half a set and got out of there fast -- like scalded cats. I had my guitar in 
one hand and Neil Young's wife in the other because Neil had two guitars. We 
just ran to the helicopters, because it was obvious that something bad was 
going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Rolling Stones wanted to end their U.S. tour that year with a great day -- 
a free concert in the park. Working with the Grateful Dead, they assembled a 
concert bill that included the Burrito Brothers, the Jefferson Airplane, CSNY 
and Santana. 
</P>
<P>
 At a tour press conference, Mick Jagger announced that the show would be 
"creating a sort of microcosmic society which sets an example to the rest of 
America as to how one can behave in large gatherings." 
</P>
<P>
 But preparations for the show only began a month before it was supposed to 
happen. It became clear that Golden Gate Park would not be usable, and the week 
of the show, preparations were finally made to have the concert at the Sears 
Point Raceway near Novato, north of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Stage construction was almost completed when those plans fell through. Rather 
than call off the show, the Rolling Stones turned to well-known San Francisco 
lawyer Melvin Belli. Though he didn't have any experience with rock festivals, 
Belli agreed to help the Stones find a site.  
</P>
<P>
 "They came up to my office and asked if there was anything I could do," Belli 
remembers. "I got busy on the phone and called the mayor and the chief of 
police and everybody else around town. Finally, I got them the piece of 
property in the Altamont Pass. As we were pulling it together it seemed to be 
quite orderly. I thought it was going to be proper. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was negligent in not getting insurance for the property, because the 
landowner got sued by quite a few people. It was a wild experience. I don't 
remember if I charged the Stones anything or not, but I know I enjoyed working 
with them." 
</P>
<P>
 As the ill-fated show day dawned, the hastily transported stage, lights and 
sound system were still being reconstructed at the speedway. Some of the 
players had a sense of dread about the concert before even getting to the site. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a wet, gray morning, and I'll never forget thinking, 'This feels like 
a weird day,' " says Hillman. "The Flying Burrito Brothers had been asked to 
play because Gram Parsons was tagging along a lot with Mick and Keith 
(Richards) back then. We jumped at the chance to be a part of it. But it was a 
bad day from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got into a car accident on the way over. Then we had to park a mile away 
from the stage and carry our instruments through the crowd, which was scary. 
When we finally got backstage it was total chaos. No order at all. You'd always 
hear hectic talk backstage at any big show or festival, but this was nonstop 
horror stories." 
</P>
<P>
 Chaos had been a part of the Woodstock festival a few months before Altamont 
-- there had even been accidental deaths there. But the New York state festival 
was immediately celebrated as a triumph of good vibes. Yasgur's farm was a 
place where a crowd of strangers had come together as a community, and where 
craziness and confusion had been transmuted into Aquarian ideals of peace, love 
and harmony.  
</P>
<P>
 At Altamont, the confusion repeatedly erupted into violence. Through a still 
murkily understood arrangement, local chapters of the Hells Angels motorcycle 
club had been pressed into service as a security presence, and were promised a 
quantity of beer in exchange for guarding the stage area. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels were a familiar, non-threatening presence at Bay Area rock shows. 
But at Altamont, the bikers did not mix well with the loose, high-spirited 
crowd, and their attempts at establishing order in the midst of the tumult 
frequently took the form of violent beatings. "I'm not a peace freak," Sonny 
Barger of the Hells Angels told a KSAN radio reporter after the show. "Some of 
these flower children were loaded up on drugs . . . and they came running, and 
yelling, and jumping on people. When they jumped on an Angel, they got hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think anything of the Hells Angels doing security, because I didn't 
know that's what they were there for," says Marty Balin, who sang with 
Jefferson Airplane at the speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd always seen them at Avalon and Fillmore shows, and there was never any 
trouble. But when we were playing, I saw these guys hitting people with pool 
cues right in front of the stage. I thought somebody should be doing something, 
so I jumped down and tried to break things up. The Angels were a little 
surprised. One of them said, 'Marty, what are you doing down here? You're gonna 
get hurt.' 
</P>
<P>
 "The fighting stopped for a little while, and I started singing again. But 
then another fight broke out toward the back of the stage. I was trying to 
break that up when somebody hit me from behind and knocked me out. I don't 
remember too much after that except being glad to be on the helicopter getting 
out of there. There wasn't any other show I ever played that was as intense as 
that in such a negative way. It was just one real bad day." 
</P>
<P>
 In retrospect, Dallas Taylor, who played drums with Crosby, Stills, Nash & 
Young at Altamont, is surprised that more people weren't killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were expecting Woodstock West, but it was exactly the opposite of 
Woodstock," he says. "Woodstock had a positive feel to it, and people decided 
to help each other out. Altamont had the feeling of fear and impending doom. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the moment we got there it was scary, and we felt lucky to get out of 
there with our lives. It didn't surprise me at all that someone had been killed 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 The killing of Meredith Hunter can actually be seen in the film "Gimme 
Shelter," a documentary of the '69 Stones tour put together by filmmakers David 
and Albert Maysles. Gary Weis, perhaps best known for the short films he later 
contributed to "Saturday Night Live," was one of "Gimme Shelter's" many roving 
cameramen, though he didn't stick around the speedway long enough to see what 
happened when the Stones played.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was the most frightening workday I've ever had," Weis says. "I remember 
lying on the grass and shooting these people by the medical unit -- which was 
like a pup tent -- who were all on bad trips, just writhing on the ground. As 
nightfall came, the jostling started, and the bad vibes got worse. I heard the 
band on stage saying, 'Take it easy,' and that was it. I turned in my film and 
got out of there." 
</P>
<P>
 So did the Grateful Dead, who made it out to the site but decided not to play 
when it was clear that the concert had gotten out of hand. The Stones, who were 
used to overflow audiences and who had pulled off a huge, peaceful free concert 
in London's Hyde Park just prior to the U.S. tour, attempted to salvage the 
day. The band got through the dense crowd to the Altamont stage aided by a 
caravan of bikers.  
</P>
<P>
 Instead of settling down for the headlining act, the crowd became more 
violent. The Stones couldn't get through "Sympathy for the Devil" before 
violence again brought the music to a halt, and Jagger was forced to plead with 
the crowd to "cool out." They tried to continue, but events turned even uglier 
after "Under My Thumb." 
</P>
<P>
 In brief, grisly footage from "Gimme Shelter," Hunter is seen close to the 
front of the stage, and appears to be in an agitated state. He also seems to 
have a gun in his hand. A man who appears to be one of the Hells Angels wields 
a knife and pounces on Hunter. Hunter is then swarmed and beaten.  
</P>
<P>
 (Hells Angel member Alan David Passaro was eventually acquitted of murder 
charges. His attorneys successfully argued that although he stabbed Hunter 
twice, he did not inflict the fatal wound.) 
</P>
<P>
 As a founding member of the Oakland chapter of the Hells Angels, Barger was 
part of the Angels' presence at Altamont. Barger is still an influential voice 
in the club, and is sometimes referred to by law enforcement officials as its 
national president, though the Hells Angels say they have no such titles in 
their organization.  
</P>
<P>
 Barger declined to be interviewed for this story, but in "Gimme Shelter" he is 
heard calling in to a radio program after the show. "I didn't go there to 
police nothing," he says. "I ain't no cop. . . . Mick Jagger put it all on the 
Angels. He used us for dupes. We were suckers for that idiot. They told me that 
if I could sit on the edge of the stage so nobody would climb over me, I could 
drink beer until the show was over, and that's what I went there to do."  
</P>
<P>
 Memories of the Woodstock Nation have taken on an increasingly rosy glow over 
the past 25 years -- culminating in this year's hyped Woodstock '94. But 
memories of the Altamont fiasco have only soured, and, understandably, no one 
who was on stage at the speedway wants to give that venue another try. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anybody would be interested in Altamont II," says Balin. "Who 
would you play for -- stompers, skinheads and parolees?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Altamont made Woodstock look like even more of a miracle," says Taylor. "And 
Woodstock II was strange enough -- I don't want to go back to Altamont." 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked at the Woodstock revival and thought, 'Why?' " says Hillman. "But I 
also remember Gram Parsons and I laughing at the original Woodstock because we 
thought the whole peace and love hippie thing had died by '68. I don't think 
I'd be interested in Altamont II. The last festivals I've done have been 
country or bluegrass, where families are sitting quietly in their lawn chairs 
and it's real orderly. That's my speed now." 
</P>
<P>
 There is one optimistic voice of dissent, however. Counselor Belli says he's 
up for giving the speedway another shot.  
</P>
<P>
 "Hell yes, I'd do another one," he says. "Very definitely. This time I think 
we could straighten it up a little. And this time I'd sure as hell take out 
some insurance."

COVER STORY; 'STAR TREK' ONLY A SHOW? IS THIS GUY SERIOUS?; RICK BERMAN WAS 
HAND-PICKED BY GENE RODDENBERRY TO TAKE OVER THE 'STAR TREK' EMPIRE. NOW, AS HE 
GUIDES ANOTHER STARSHIP INTO THEATERS, BERMAN PROVIDES A REALITY CHECK ON THAT 
EVER-EXPANDING UNIVERSE.

 In a darkened editing room, sequestered behind the eternally guarded walls of 
Paramount Pictures, a film image flickers on a small screen. Six men gather 
around an editing table, their faces a whirligig of light and color projected 
by the moving image. 
</P>
<P>
 Their eyes are transfixed on fresh footage of a miniature Capt. James T. Kirk, 
struggling atop a desert mountain on the uninhabited planet of Varidian Three 
in the finale of "Star Trek: Generations," which opens Friday. The aging but 
spry Kirk, reprised by William Shatner, inches along a footbridge that clings 
with a tenuous grip to the mountainside. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the final bridge he must cross," producer Rick Berman tells the music 
composer and sound artists around him in the editing room. In moments, they 
will take Berman's "notes" and begin devising the effects that will turn the 
action into a bone-jarring sequence in six-channel sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite assurances that 1991's "Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country" was 
the final voyage for the original "Star Trek" gang from the 1960s TV series, 
Kirk and a couple others have been resurrected to pass the feature-film baton 
to the crew from the wildly successful TV spinoff, "Star Trek: The Next 
Generation." The new movie features the epic meeting of the 23rd-Century Kirk 
and his 24th-Century counterpart, Capt. Jean-Luc Picard, played by Patrick 
Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're going to have nothing but this metal bridge moaning and creaking and 
screeching," continues Berman, who executive produced the "Next Generation" 
series and makes his first foray into feature films with "Generations." "I 
don't know if you can see it on this, but these bolts and rivets are snapping 
and popping, and there're rocks falling. So you're going to have some fun with 
sounds here." 
</P>
<P>
 In the scene, Kirk is not only fighting valiantly for the fate of mankind, as 
has become his custom, he's also fighting for Paramount Communications Inc. 
Every effort is being made to assure that what's referred to around Paramount 
as "the franchise" lives on. Several weeks earlier, the studio agreed to spend 
$3 million to return to the mountaintop location north of Las Vegas to re-shoot 
a seven-minute end sequence. Test screenings revealed that people rated 
"Generations" favorably overall but were less than enthusiastic with the 
finale. And Paramount reportedly wanted more heroism from Kirk.  
</P>
<P>
 "You're going to have to sell this to make us really believe that he's 
slipping off the bridge," Berman says. As the bridge jerks violently several 
times, causing Kirk to lose his footing, Berman imitates the noises he wants to 
hear. "Uh! Uh! Uh! Whoa!" Kirk skids down the bridge on his back and reaches 
out for a chain at the last second to stop his momentum. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The picture is now locked!" Berman proclaims after the session ends. He 
shakes hands with his film editor, Peter Berger, who worked with Berman from 6 
a.m. to 10 p.m. the day before. The two heave a symbiotic sigh of relief. It's 
three days before Halloween, and the remaining pieces of their jigsaw puzzle 
are finally falling into place -- a jigsaw puzzle that required $30 million and 
nearly two years to complete. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I've come up for air," Berman says with a wide smile.  
</P>
<P>
 Berman's momentary lightness of being may be well deserved, but it will pass. 
</P>
<P>
 The 47-year-old bears the weight of a galaxy on his shoulders. He cannot 
escape the destiny he inherited three years ago when "Star Trek" creator Gene 
Roddenberry, an optimistic science-fiction visionary with a reverential 
following, died and handed over the reins of a billion-dollar enterprise -- 
replete with a universe of mythological characters and story lines spanning 
three decades -- to an ex-documentary producer from New York.  
</P>
<P>
 "Gene Roddenberry laid a mantle on me, of sorts, and I feel very lucky as a 
result," says Berman, who took over as the master of a franchise that now 
includes seven feature films, three hourlong TV series and a fourth one on the 
way. Berman refers to all of them as "the show." 
</P>
<P>
 "What Gene wanted me to do was basically carry the ball for him, and to try to 
maintain his vision," Berman says. "He saw that I had respect for his vision -- 
not because it's my vision. I don't believe the 24th Century is going to be 
like Gene Roddenberry believed it to be, that people will be free from poverty 
and greed. But if you're going to write and produce for 'Star Trek,' you've got 
to buy into that." 
</P>
<P>
 Although "Next Generation" ended in May, Berman still executive produces two 
TV spinoffs. "Star Trek: Deep Space Nine," set on a space station in the 24th 
Century, returned in September for its third syndicated season. And when the 
United Paramount Network launches on Jan. 16, it will depend on "Star Trek: 
Voyager," a new series about a starship lost in an uncharted region of space, 
to lock in the viewers necessary to establish a fifth network. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm like a quality-control guy," Berman says. "My job is to keep this show 
good, and to keep it believable, and to keep it entertaining, and to keep 
whatever messages are in it true to what Gene wanted. He wanted to paint a 
picture of hope in the world, and I would much rather paint a picture of hope 
than a picture of despair." 
</P>
<P>
 "Generations" marks the first time the "Star Trek" movies and TV series have 
been produced by the same person. Roddenberry was heavily involved with the 
first film, in 1979, but Paramount gave the sequels other producers and 
directors, including Shatner and Leonard Nimoy, who played Spock, the 
inscrutable Vulcan. Berman produced "Generations" in the same hands-on fashion 
he executive produces his TV series, and he shares story credit for the film. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since Roddenberry's death, hundreds of thousands of "Star Trek" loyalists 
have been sizing up Berman via the Internet and at conventions. And while 
Trekkers have taken their swipes at Berman, they have been generally supportive 
of what he has done. 
</P>
<P>
 But in producing "Generations," the heat grew uncomfortably for the TV 
producer. Incessant Internet musings by fans often led to headlines the next 
day -- including the fact that Berman reshot the well-publicized ending of his 
film and the fate of a key character. Whereas Roddenberry used to rally his 
fans with speaking engagements, Berman admits that he doesn't entirely 
understand the fierce devotion some have for "Star Trek." 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who talk on their computer networks all night long, or the people 
who go to conventions -- it's all a little overwhelming to me," Berman says. "I 
can't relate that much to people who take this a little bit more seriously than 
this should be taken. It is, after all, a show." 
</P>
<P>
 But ravenous Trekkers clearly are. "People are always hungry for details -- to 
the point where scripts disappear from the lot," says Kerry McCluggage, 
chairman of Paramount Television Group. "Almost everything you do is subject to 
all kinds of scrutiny and wild speculation." Indeed, the entire "Generations" 
script found its way onto the Internet months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Berman says: "We have 25 million viewers who watch 'Next Generation,' 20 
million who watch 'Deep Space Nine,' and hopefully just as many who will watch 
'Voyager.' I like to think that we're doing this show for the vast majority of 
fans who bring this 'Star Trek' family of characters into their home every 
week, and who embrace the ideas we try to portray on the show." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After the "Generations" sound session, Berman returns to his offices where the 
editors from "Deep Space Nine" are awaiting him to go over an episode. Sitting 
behind a monitor, Berman plays back the episode, stopping the action every 10 
or 15 seconds with orders for his editors to tighten a scene by cutting out a 
"Yes, sir" here or a reaction shot there.  
</P>
<P>
 "Stop -- what's that line? What does the script say?" Berman doesn't like how 
Maj. Kira, played by Nana Visitor, reacts to some information. "Hearing from 
Sisko on a Cardassian ship is like hearing from Ollie North in Moscow. She 
should be surprised." He tells his editors to ask Visitor to come in and 
re-record the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Berman may not be the science-fiction visionary that Roddenberry was, 
Roddenberry was never the executive producer that Berman has become. 
Roddenberry was a writer first who consistently rubbed people the wrong way as 
a producer. He drove his TV writers crazy because there was little dramatic 
conflict to be found in his idyllic vision of the future, and he routinely 
scrapped with studio executives who wanted to exploit his product. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Paramount owns the "Star Trek" franchise, the stubborn Roddenberry's 
power was more perceived than real, but he always had the ability to pull his 
name off a project or publicly cry out if he didn't approve of something, 
thereby whipping up the anger of fans. So Paramount executives treaded 
carefully. 
</P>
<P>
 Berman, on the other hand, was a fresh young vice president at Paramount in 
1987 when Roddenberry lobbied the studio to release him from his contract so he 
could produce "Next Generation."  
</P>
<P>
 He has since surrounded himself with writers and producers such as Michael 
Pillar, who helped him create and executive produce "Deep Space Nine," and Jeri 
Taylor, who joined Berman and Pillar in the same capacity on "Voyager." Berman 
gives full credit to them and his entire staff for weaving the complex web of 
"Star Trek," but the buck stops with him. Every costume design, casting choice, 
story and script must clear Berman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rick has a remarkable ability to have an awareness of everything that's going 
on," Pillar says. "I give him personal credit for saving the pilot of 'Deep 
Space Nine' in the editing room. (The raw film) was long, slow, confusing. He 
went in there with the editors and came out with what was reviewed universally 
as a terrific piece of television film." 
</P>
<P>
 B erman knows all too well that ultimately all of the projects he oversees 
creatively must serve the financial interests of Paramount, which mines "Star 
Trek" like a seemingly endless vein of gold. Industry experts estimate that 
over its seven-season run ending in May, "Next Generation" brought in $511 
million in revenue and $293 million in profit -- making it one of the most 
successful TV shows in history. "Deep Space Nine" and "Voyager" were sold to TV 
stations with different formulas, but they are commanding nearly the same rates 
from advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, six feature films have generated close to $500 million at box 
offices across North America, with roughly half that going to the studio. About 
23 million videocassettes have been sold domestically of the original "Star 
Trek" series, "Next Generation" and the feature films. The two TV series can 
each be seen in reruns in 75 countries. And there are 63 million books in 
print, more than 30 new titles published annually by Simon & Schuster, a 
division of Paramount's parent company, Viacom. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a cultural phenomenon that's really unprecedented," observes Barry 
London, vice chairman of Paramount's Motion Picture Group. 
</P>
<P>
 With comic books, toys, collectibles, CD-ROMs and plans for a virtual-reality 
mall attraction, there may be no way to calculate "Star Trek's" actual worth. 
According to Paramount Licensing Group, there are at least 250 product 
licensees worldwide; merchandise sales have passed the $1-billion mark. 
</P>
<P>
 In the face of such pressures, what weighs heaviest on Berman is his debt to 
the man who bestowed the good fortune upon him.  
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever there is an instance in a story or a in piece of casting or or in 
the general fabric of society in the 24th Century, I always feel Gene sitting 
on my shoulder," says Berman. "And if I feel that something goes against what 
he believed this show should be, I will fight for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet on Berman's office desk rests a plaster bust of Roddenberry, with a scarf 
around its eyes and ears. When asked why, Berman says with a sly smile: "There 
are things said in this room that I think he would hate to hear. Not many, just 
a few." 
</P>
<P>
 In October, 1992, the space shuttle Columbia rose from Kennedy Space Center in 
Florida, carrying the ashes of Roddenberry. Majel Barrett, Roddenberry's widow, 
had flown to Houston before the mission and handed a tin containing her 
husband's remains to commander James Wetherbee.  
</P>
<P>
 When Columbia returned, the ashes were presented to Barrett in a private 
ceremony in Washington. Roddenberry, a decorated combat pilot for the Army 
before he became a television writer, always dreamed of traveling in space. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he could have done it, he would have liked to have been Capt. Kirk," says 
Barrett, who met Roddenberry while playing a nurse on the original series. "The 
next best thing would be to be an astronaut." 
</P>
<P>
 When Roddenberry died of heart failure at 70, computer bulletin boards lit up 
for weeks, with megabytes of poetry, tributes and personal remembrances. 
</P>
<P>
 "One to beam up," wrote Steve Lesnik on CompuServe, hours after Roddenberry's 
death on Oct. 24, 1991. "I sit here now with the tears still in my eyes for a 
man I never met. . . . I find myself now missing him and hoping to do my best 
to make that future he began a reality." 
</P>
<P>
 The starship Enterprise, as first dreamed up by Roddenberry, was essentially a 
23rd-Century proscenium where Kirk, Spock and Dr. Bones McCoy played out 
morality tales in a future where the human spirit always prevailed. The NBC 
series aired for three seasons from 1966 to 1968, though it was canceled twice 
and brought back by viewer demand. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Star Trek' has become an integral part of the American mythology," Berman 
says. " 'Star Trek' is words like beam me up and transporters and dilithium 
crystals and warp speed and Starfleet and photon torpedoes and phasers , and 
all these things are known and understood by most people in America." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Berman had never watched a full episode of "Star Trek" when he 
signed on to produce "Next Generation." Berman grew up in New York, dreaming of 
becoming an actor. While he was a senior at the University of Wisconsin 
studying film and television, he was invited to audition for the Yale School of 
Drama, but he decided to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Choosing filmmaking instead, Berman returned to New York City and started 
working for a variety of documentary film companies, doing films for the United 
Nations, the National Science Foundation and United States Information Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Berman won an Emmy for producing "The Big Blue Marble," an educational 
children's program that aired from 1977 to 1982, mostly on PBS, and he received 
acclaim for a 1984 PBS special called "The Primal Mind," examining how Native 
Americans perceive reality differently than Europeans do. But by the early 
1980s, the documentary business was drying up, and with his wife and 2-year-old 
son, Berman headed to Los Angeles, where he eventually landed at Paramount in 
charge of current programming. Within a year, he was made a vice president with 
responsibility to develop TV movies. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's when he was introduced to Roddenberry. At the time, "Next 
Generation" was just another idea for a TV show. At the time, quality dramatic 
programming was not being made for syndication.  
</P>
<P>
 Two days after meeting him, Berman received a call from Roddenberry saying 
that he wanted to have lunch with him. "We found that we had, in odd ways, a 
tremendous amount in common," Berman says. "He had traveled all over the world. 
He was fascinated that I knew what the capital of Upper Volta was, and that I 
had been to parts of Africa and the Middle East (to make documentaries) that he 
had been to. So we had a lot of fun talking about faraway places with 
strange-sounding names." 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, Berman was invited to lunch by Roddenberry's attorney, who said, 
"Gene would like you to come and produce the show with him." Berman replied: 
"Well, I have a job. I'm a vice president." And the attorney said, "Do you want 
to be a vice president at a studio, or do you want to produce a television 
show?" 
</P>
<P>
 Berman walked to his car that night with Lucie Salhany, who was in charge of 
domestic television, and confessed his dilemma to her. "She looked at me and 
said, 'If the show fails, don't worry, I'll give you a job,' " he says. Salhany 
left Paramount not long after, but she returned last month to head up the 
studio's new TV network, which will be depending heavily on Berman come 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 In Berman, Roddenberry saw someone he could rely on. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gene created the show, and I think he wanted to distance himself from it very 
quickly," Berman says. "He wasn't interested in people who wanted to come in 
and fix 'Star Trek.' He said, ' "Star Trek" doesn't need fixing.' " 
</P>
<P>
 By the third season, Roddenberry's involvement was virtually nonexistent. He 
died in the middle of the fourth season, after having approved Berman and 
Pillar's plans for "Deep Space Nine." 
</P>
<P>
 Barrett says: "Gene brought Rick down from the white-collar world, in his blue 
suit and tie, and he taught him 'Star Trek.' There were all the people who were 
saying, 'Hey, nobody can do it like Roddenberry,' and that's not true. Rick 
understands the basic idea, the prime directive, and his main objective is 
toward a better, kinder, more gentle world." 
</P>
<P>
 But she does feel it incumbent upon her to warn Berman of the job demands. She 
has been locked in a legal battle with Paramount for years over merchandising 
rights for "Star Trek." "Rick has been the guy behind the badge, really, for a 
long time. Now he's got the weight of the empire hanging all over him that Gene 
had for so long. I hope he's strong enough to take it, because we put up with 
it for 25 years. And believe me, they will come at you with knives drawn. I 
have to say, it can be horrific." 
</P>
<P>
 'It's wonderful. It works beauti fully -- all of it." Shortly after his "Deep 
Space Nine" editing session, Berman is back in his office on the Paramount lot, 
updating Malcolm McDowell on the telephone. McDowell plays Dr. Soran, the 
villain in "Generations," who wants to extinguish stars to alter the course of 
a mysterious energy ribbon traveling through space. He will stop at nothing to 
re-enter the nexus, a sort of cosmic Shangri-La that lies within the ribbon, 
which he involuntarily left 80 years earlier.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've been working on it night and day since we got back. It was a bitch, but 
it's terrific. Congratulations to you . I'd like you and Patrick and Bill to 
come see it at the end of next week." 
</P>
<P>
 "Generations" has been a learning process for Berman, who began developing the 
story almost two years ago with two of his "Next Generation" writers, Ron Moore 
and Brannon Braga, who wrote the screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
 Last October, Berman called Nimoy to direct. Nimoy drew positive reviews and 
big box office for directing "Star Trek III" and "IV," and he executive 
produced and helped write the story for "VI." In each case, the phone call for 
his services came from powerful studio heavyweights -- Michael Eisner, Jeffrey 
Katzenberg, Frank Mancuso -- and he was involved in script development from day 
one. With "Generations," Nimoy was being called by a TV producer with a 
finished script in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Nimoy says he wasn't comfortable with the script and wanted a major rewrite, 
and with a release date looming a year away, there was simply no time. 
</P>
<P>
 Nimoy also turned down an offer to play Spock one last time in "Generations." 
Initially, the entire original crew was supposed to appear in a 15-minute 
prologue to the film. When DeForest Kelley also turned down an offer to come 
back as Bones, Berman had to take a different tack. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once we knew we weren't going to have Leonard and DeForest, it seemed silly 
to have all the rest," Berman says. "So we decided just to pick two. We thought 
it would be fun to take the biggest and the littlest. That's how we ended up 
choosing Chekov (Walter Koenig) and Scotty (James Doohan)" to complement Kirk. 
</P>
<P>
 Berman chose a frequent "Next Generation" director, David Carson, to helm 
"Generations." Berman persuaded Sherry Lansing, chairman of Paramount Motion 
Picture Group, to go with the untested feature director by showing her his work 
on the two-hour series premiere of "Deep Space Nine."  
</P>
<P>
 Carson has stepped up considerably with "Generations." The "Next Generation" 
episodes he directed went for around $1.7 million each -- extremely high for a 
TV series -- but "Generations" cost more than $30 million, features 200 optical 
effects and is, London says, one of the most heavily marketed movies in 
Paramount history. 
</P>
<P>
 Berman says he went back to re-shoot part of the ending to inject "a little 
more excitement, a little more action." When asked why those elements weren't 
there to begin with, Berman says: "It might have been a problem with the 
writing, or it might have been a problem with the directing or it was probably 
due to the fact that when we first wrote this movie it was much bigger than we 
could afford. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were some limitations made to the last sequence that were probably a 
mistake. We storyboarded this movie at five or six days longer than we had, and 
we had to compress the time. When you have less time to do something, you have 
to do it less well, especially when you're dealing with action."  
</P>
<P>
 An assessment of Berman's work ranges from glowing to bitter, depending upon 
whom you talk to. Alisha Black is vice admiral and chief of staff for Starships 
of the Third Fleet, a writing club for about 500 Trekkers, based in Santee, 
Calif. "There has been a lot of debate within the club about how Rick Berman is 
carrying on Gene Roddenberry's idea of the 'Star Trek' universe," Black says. 
"I see, and so do others in the club, the 'Star Trek' shows going to battle, 
rather than going to new places and exploring, discovering new alien life. A 
lot of people don't feel comfortable with it." 
</P>
<P>
 "So far, everybody is very, very pleased with what Rick is doing," counters 
Daniel Madsen, president of Star Trek: The Official Fan Club in Aurora, Colo. " 
'Star Trek' has probably become a little bit more militant than when Gene was 
in control solely. But it's healthy that 'Star Trek' evolves and changes while 
staying true to Gene's vision." 
</P>
<P>
 If ratings are any indication, Berman has done very well, indeed. "Next 
Generation" did not become the top-rated show in syndication until after 
Roddenberry's death. "Deep Space Nine," which was about 25% off "Next 
Generation's" ratings last season, has improved this season and has become the 
highest-rated dramatic show in first-run syndication. 
</P>
<P>
 Bjo Trimble, who publishes the science-fiction newsletter Space-Time 
Continuum, was instrumental in forming the letter-writing campaign that brought 
back "Star Trek" after NBC first canceled it. 
</P>
<P>
 She says, "Because Gene so wanted to see world peace in his time, he kind of 
lost track of the fact that conflict and resolution are the meat of a good 
story, and you can't always have it with the giant purple magilla attacking the 
ship." 
</P>
<P>
 With "Voyager," the "Star Trek" franchise returns to its roots in many ways. 
The "Star Trek" universe has become very crowded over the last 25 years, with 
Klingons, Romulans, Vulcans and the whole gang in the Alpha Quadrant. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the original intent of Mr. Roddenberry was to have a ship alone out there 
in the unknown," Pillar says. "We're out there alone in the unknown, with none 
of the familiar aliens to trouble us, and a whole bunch of new ones." 
</P>
<P>
 In "Voyager," a crew of Starfleet officers on a new breed of starship, with 
organic components and nerve endings throughout, are blasted into the other 
side of the galaxy while chasing a rebel ship of freedom fighters. They must 
team up, the indignant outlaws and the squeaky-clean Starfleet officers, to 
find their way home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We find ourselves today as a society with a lot of problems that cannot be 
easily and quickly solved," Pillar says. "I think we have the knowledge if we 
begin now, but we won't see solutions in our lifetime. If you look at the 
'Voyager' premise from that perspective, this is a journey they're taking, 
which may take them longer than their own lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
 The cast of characters includes a Native American, a pair of mismatched alien 
lovers, and a holographic doctor -- who will provide the traditional function 
of Spock, Data and Odo by allowing the crew to reflect on their human values. 
And in the ongoing evolution of the series, the ship will be led by a female 
captain, played by Kate Mulgrew, the veteran stage and TV actress probably best 
known as Mrs. Columbo in her short-lived NBC series "Kate Loves a Mystery."  
</P>
<P>
 Berman expects "Voyager" to be the last "Star Trek" series that he will 
executive produce, although he wants to continue producing movie sequels; he's 
already working on story ideas for the next one. Beyond that, he has no idea 
how long he will lord over the "Star Trek" universe.  
</P>
<P>
 "When we brought in 'Deep Space Nine,' we had two 'Star Trek' shows on at the 
same time," he says. "That could be perceived as getting a little piggy. Then 
when 'Next Generation' was getting ready to leave for the movies, we developed 
'Voyager.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know at what point America is going to cry, 'Enough!' I just know 
that we've got to keep pushing along and continue doing our best work and not 
worry too much about what's going to happen in five years." 
</P>
<P>
 It's evening. People have gone home and the Paramount lot is mostly dark. But 
Berman is hovering inside a post-production house, watching reel nine of 
"Generations" to approve the final sound mix. Tucked at his side are five "Deep 
Space Nine" and "Voyager" scripts that he will take home and read over the 
weekend, and he's upset that he may miss his son's fencing tournament Saturday 
to come in and oversee the mix of three more reels. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the moment, his eyes are transfixed on the huge theatrical screen 
looming in front of him. The reel is playing out the film's most impressive 
sequence, from a visual effects standpoint, featuring a spectacular crash of a 
starship into a planet. Berman leans over to a visitor at one point and says, 
"Most of the work is work. This I find exhilarating!" 
</P>
<P>
 The starship sheers off the tip of a mountain, then hits the ground and slides 
for an interminable mile, mowing down towering trees to create a wide swath 
through a lush forest. Afterward, the lights come up and a crew of technicians 
turn toward Berman expectantly. 
</P>
<P>
 "All right," he says thoughtfully, "I've got a whole bunch of notes."

THE GODZILLA TOUR OF JAPAN; A WRITER, A POLITICIAN, A DIPLOMAT AND AN ARTIST 
WRESTLE WITH THE FANTASY-VS.-REALITY QUESTIONS OF THEIR COUNTRY'S SHIFTING 
IDENTITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Margaret Scott, Margaret Scott is a writer based in Tokyo. Her last article 
for this magazine was Vanished Japan, about the postwar photos of Horace 
Bristol. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Wimps," Kenji Sato says slowly in English, as if he is savoring the sound of 
the word. "Japan has become a nation of wimps raised on Godzilla movies." We 
are sitting in a skyscraper sipping coffee in a faux French cafe called Petit 
Monde. The view is of the glass towers and huge, blinking video screens of 
Shinjuku, the once ramshackle section of Tokyo that is now its flashing, 
shining center of consumerism. The blocks of swanky department stores, the 
broad avenues of tall, sleek office buildings and hotels have also become the 
favorite film backdrop for Godzilla's rampages of the city. It is a perfect 
setting for Sato, one of Japan's most provocative young writers, to lay out his 
theory that Godzilla films are a primer on what he calls the fantasy of postwar 
Japan. He's written a bestseller on the subject, "Godzilla, Yamato and Our 
Democracy."  
</P>
<P>
 It was a bit over a year ago, not long after Japan's stunning political 
upheavals began, that I first met Sato, who is 28 now and has the look of an 
arty graduate student. "If you want to understand what's going on in Japan," he 
told me then, "Godzilla films are a good place to start." With Sato as my 
guide, we set off on what I came to think of as the Godzilla tour of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many Japanese, Sato grew up with Godzilla. Nearly a rite of national 
passage, there would always be the tale of the monster, born of the horrors of 
the nuclear age, wreaking havoc on his defenseless victim, Japan. The first one 
came out in 1954, and yet another one, the 21st, is due out next month. It is 
not a far-fetched conceit to see them as giving a story line to postwar Japan. 
Over the years, the skyline in the movies changed from squat and war-scarred to 
glimmering high-tech, and the plots loosely followed the vagaries of the Cold 
War. But the basic ingredients, including the 165-foot-high Godzilla, a mutant, 
overgrown reptile spewing flames of radiated heat, stayed the same.  
</P>
<P>
 After Sato went abroad and began to write, he started thinking of these movies 
less as a story line than as a mirror of something deeper -- Japan's postwar 
myth. It goes like this: Thanks to Uncle Sam, Japan was reborn as a 
peace-loving country. Accepting its role as victim in the larger world, Japan 
abhorred power and, as a result, politics. It was to be a place where consensus 
reigned and everyone could get rich. Most important, it was to be a sheltered 
place where people didn't have to concern themselves with the big, bad world 
beyond their shores.  
</P>
<P>
 Sato calls it the fantasy of postwar democracy, and the point of his Godzilla 
tour was to tell me that the fantasy is falling apart. "If Japan was still a 
two-bit country, no one would care if we wallowed in our fantasies. But we've 
become rich and strong and the rest of the world is asking us to get involved, 
do our part, and we don't have an answer," he said. "Japan's become like a 
Godzilla movie. Just look at Japanese politics. We all know the plot is 
outdated and ridiculous, but who will write a new one?"  
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese are indeed looking for a new plot. Their political system 
collapsed last year, bringing to an end 38 years of one-party rule by the 
Liberal Democratic Party and the orthodoxies of postwar Japan. To be in Japan 
during the past year has been to witness the flowering of a great debate over 
what's next for the country. Sato calls it a grand identity crisis, and he's 
right. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not as if the identity issue hasn't been addressed before. Intellectuals 
in Japan have agonized over whether the price of modernization has been the 
loss of Japan's soul, whether Japan is part of the West or part of Asia, and 
over what it means to be a pacifist nation. But the debate has had a 
make-believe quality, like a Godzilla movie, because it has been divorced from 
the world of politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Now with the crumbling of the political set-up, it seems an unmistakable sign 
that a chapter has closed, that the national narrative needs to be overhauled. 
Japan is rich now and is no longer frantically trying to catch up with the 
West. For the first time, the Japanese are asking questions about what's next 
from a position of strength. 
</P>
<P>
 Sato and three others -- a politician, a diplomat and an artist -- give voice 
to the central and often contradictory themes of the debate. Tadatoshi Akiba, 
the politician, insists that pacifism, so ingrained in how postwar Japanese see 
themselves, must be retained. Sato seeks identity by reinventing a tradition 
that he feels has been lost since the war. The diplomat, Kazuo Ogura, turns to 
Asia as an inspiration and wants Japan to stop imitating the West. And the 
artist, Yukinori Yanagi, believes that identity can only be defined by 
individuals, freed from preordained ways of thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 These four individuals, in their writing, art and ideas, are offering scripts 
that can and will be tested in the real world. Perhaps, as the country's 
obsessive self-analysis gives way to more democracy, more conflict and more 
art, the question of identity will take care of itself. For the issues these 
men are raising are, in essence, questions that will inevitably lead the 
Japanese to make real choices, not just about who they perceive themselves to 
be, but about how they live and where they are going. THE POLITICIAN 
</P>
<P>
 One morning, during one of my visits to his tiny office behind the Diet 
building, Tadatoshi Akiba pulls a book from his cluttered shelves. It's an 
album of the 1963 Hiroshima Peace Conference Opposing Atom and Hydrogen Bombs. 
"This is how I got involved in politics," he says, finding the picture of 
himself as a scrawny college student wearing a short-sleeved white shirt and 
glasses with thick black frames. He chuckles and leans back for a minute, 
staring at the photo. Behind him, a series of more recent snapshots has been 
pinned to a bulletin board: the politician standing with representatives of an 
A-bomb survivors group, with a graying Daniel Ellsberg of Pentagon Papers fame, 
with a European delegation promoting nuclear disarmament.  
</P>
<P>
 Akiba is a man of the left, a man of peace and a politician representing 
Hiroshima, the city of peace. But now he feels embattled. His party, the 
(Japan) Social Democratic Party, pacifism's protector, is backtracking. 
Socialists have gone from ritualized opposition to partners in a new ruling 
coalition, sparking an extraordinary battle over what it means to be a pacifist 
nation. Is pacifism, as Akiba insists, Japan's national mission and the 
cornerstone of its national identity? Or is it, as Sato claims, an illusion 
that has locked Japan's politics into dependence on the United States, trapping 
the Japanese in passivity? Or has pacifism become an elaborate excuse for 
isolationism, a shield for Japan the economic giant against messy military 
entanglements abroad?  
</P>
<P>
 For Akiba, the college peacenik who grew up to be a mathematics professor and 
then a politician, there is no choice but the pacifist path for Japan. To spend 
time with this broad-shouldered and handsome man of 52 is to hear a version of 
the national narrative that is embraced by millions of Japanese. In somber 
tones and in perfect English, from his days teaching at Tufts University, Akiba 
tells me that the core of Japanese identity was forged in the death and ruins 
left by the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. "We are a nation 
that has renounced war. If we abandon our peace constitution, we will defile 
the memories of the victims of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Without 
it, we will lose our way in Asia and the world," he says.  
</P>
<P>
 Akiba presents his pacifism as wisdom learned the hard way. Being Japanese 
means spreading this wisdom. "Along with Auschwitz, Hiroshima is one of the 
crucial events in the history of mankind that we must learn from," he says. 
"This lesson, that war is never the answer, is the spirit of Hiroshima." His 
mission is universalizing that spirit. It's the reason he returned to Japan in 
the early 1980s. It's what pushed him into politics, it's why he ran for a seat 
in Japan's Parliament in 1989 and why he has made Hiroshima his home. 
</P>
<P>
 One weekend, on one of his trips home during the recent Parliament session, I 
went too. Hiroshima is an odd mixture of a pilgrimage site and an almost dull, 
modern city whose past has been erased. Along its wide boulevards and 
greenbelts, little remains from before Aug. 6, 1945, when the Enola Gay dropped 
its load, the atomic bomb, at 8:15 in the morning.  
</P>
<P>
 But the memory of the bombing dominates the city in the form of Hiroshima 
Peace Memorial Park, a sprawling oasis of trees and monuments near ground zero. 
Across the small river at one end of the park, you can see the shell of what 
was the Hiroshima Prefecture Industrial Promotion Hall, now called the A-Bomb 
Dome, a permanent reminder of the destruction that left an estimated 150,000 
people dead from burns or radiation sickness. In the park's center stands the 
cenotaph with its famous inscription engraved on a black stone coffin: "Let all 
souls here rest in peace, for the error shall not be repeated." The cenotaph, 
Akiba tells me, captures the importance of Japan's mission. "But the subject is 
unclear," he says, "who will not repeat the error? Japanese or human beings? Or 
does it mean the U.S.? No, it means me, my country, and that we should take 
responsibility beyond revenge for ensuring peace."  
</P>
<P>
 He says much of his work involves helping the survivors of the bombing, known 
as hibakusha, receive medical care and spread their message of peace. His 
politics rest on the tension between casting the Japanese as victims of the 
atomic bomb and the claim that Hiroshima has become the universal symbol for 
world peace. In this, Akiba fits squarely in the postwar Socialist Party, whose 
politics of identity is based on pacifism. For decades, Akiba and his fellow 
Socialists were the permanent opposition to the status quo of the LDP, and 
their moralism was a sign of impotence.  
</P>
<P>
 The last year has changed all of this. The fall of the LDP has provoked a 
free-for-all of party realignments, and Japan's anti-war stance has become one 
of the major issues dictating the reshaping of Japanese politics and identity. 
New voices are asking whether Japan's pacifism has become selfish, rather than 
a beacon for the rest of the world. The issue arises in policy debates about 
when Japan's Self-Defense Forces can join United Nations peacekeeping 
operations and whether Japan should join the U.N. Security Council. Is Akiba's 
anti-war lesson the right one for the country now?  
</P>
<P>
 It used to be that only right-wing extremists or hard-to-stomach nationalist 
politicians attacked the postwar deal and pacifism. For years, the nationalist 
right, led by such figures as former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, talked 
about victor's "justice," an unfortunate overemphasis on war guilt and the need 
to revive the Japanese spirit and the sacredness of the emperor, which made it 
easy to see why Socialists, like Akiba, warned darkly of a return to 
militarism. But today, the challenge to pacificism is mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 Ichiro Ozawa is the prime mover of the reformist camp that orchestrated the 
revolt from within the LDP. Ozawa is not a right-wing nationalist, but he has 
written a bestseller in which he argues that Japan must become a normal nation. 
Normal, for Ozawa, means contributing to international security by sending 
troops to U.N. operations. Otherwise, he argues, rich Japan will be accused of 
selfishness and will wind up isolated. There are plenty of Japanese who agree, 
and the debate intensifies. 
</P>
<P>
 After the LDP crumbled, Akiba says, he thought Japan might begin promoting 
peace his way -- perhaps by helping the United Nations come up with new, 
nonviolent ways of dealing with conflict. But in one of the most remarkable 
turnarounds in Japan's topsy-turvy political world, Akiba's party switched 
sides in July and teamed up with its archrival, the LDP, to form the current 
government. The Socialist prime minister, Tomiichi Murayama, quickly found 
himself in the awkward position of being in charge of the same Self-Defense 
Forces that his party had long claimed were unconstitutional. And in August, he 
reconciled his position and his party, declaring not only that he considers the 
Self-Defense Forces constitutional but also that Japanese troops can join U.N. 
operations as long as no force is used.  
</P>
<P>
 In early September, an extraordinary scene unfolded outside the Socialist 
Party's Tokyo headquarters. A special convention of office-holders and party 
leaders was called to endorse the prime minister's policy reversals. As party 
notables arrived, they were greeted by jeers and chants from about 200 fellow 
Socialists huddled near the entrance carrying banners and placards. "Don't 
betray Socialists all over Japan," the group yelled, "don't stop being the 
conscience of the nation." Off to the side, a few Buddhist monks in saffron 
robes were slowly beating drums. Akiba, like the other party leaders, made his 
way through the hecklers, though he probably had more in common with the group 
on the outside. The assembled Socialists endorsed Murayama's new position and 
vowed to continue protecting the peace constitution. Akiba sat through it all, 
looking glum. The Hiroshima spirit had met the new politics of Japan. THE 
WRITER 
</P>
<P>
 Kenji Sato always arrives a bit late and wired to his Walkman. He's a big, 
chubby man, partial to listening to Lou Reed and wearing black trousers with 
bright, oddball T-shirts. One of his favorites, which he found in New York, 
shows a roaring Godzilla in red and black. He often brings me an essay on 
politics he's just published or news of the play about AIDS that he is writing. 
</P>
<P>
 Sato, a privileged child of the new Japan, lives in an affluent section of 
Tokyo. His father, Seizaburo Sato, is a famous political scientist who heads a 
think tank started by Nakasone, the nationalist politician and former LDP prime 
minister. His mother, Kinko Sato, is a lawyer, well-known as an authority on 
the constitution. He comes from a conservative school of thought whose members 
resent the modern world for robbing the Japanese of their identity. But Sato is 
very much part of that modern world and he faces a question: How will Japan's 
political changes affect its cultural life? 
</P>
<P>
 His theory of the fantasy of postwar democracy grew from his ambition to write 
fiction, he says. "I looked around and wondered, 'Why is there no compelling 
fiction or drama or movies?' I kept coming back to the postwar political setup 
and the stifling ideology it created." The root of the problem, he says, is 
that Japan never regained its national sovereignty after the war. The symbol of 
Japan's dependence on the United States, he says, is Article Nine of the 
postwar constitution, which states that "the Japanese people forever renounce 
war as a sovereign right of the nation." 
</P>
<P>
 "The generous victor announced there was no need for the government to 
exercise power, no need for an army and no need for war. Japanese history could 
start over, from scratch, in 1945. Of course it was wishful thinking, but the 
Japanese embraced it and they embraced the ideology that went with it," Sato 
says.  
</P>
<P>
 As he sees it, politicians from the Liberal Democratic Party masterfully 
turned the pacifist constitution to Japan's, and their own, advantage. The 
United States took care of security, and the LDP took care of making Japan 
rich. "We have a democracy, but it doesn't work very well. It's a system that 
suppresses conflict. Since power is bad, we don't have politics; we have rule 
by consensus, which really means by bureaucrats."  
</P>
<P>
 As Japan's political life stagnated, so did literature, the arts and popular 
culture, Sato says. Make-believe politics began begetting make-believe culture. 
It is a connection that expresses weakness, dependence, passivity -- in short, 
a nation of wimps.  
</P>
<P>
 Sato can be wickedly funny describing how Godzilla movies just get worse and 
worse; who can believe that Godzilla really threatens Tokyo when the 
skyscrapers of Shinjuku now tower over him? He's written an essay ripping apart 
the genre of romantic love stories in movies, books and television dramas as 
banal caricatures, stories of love paralysis between mama's boys and passive 
women. These stories usually end with someone else intervening to thrust the 
hapless couple together, and they live happily ever after -- as brother and 
sister.  
</P>
<P>
 It is tempting to see much of culture and style through Sato's eyes: as 
reflecting a willfully juvenile sensibility. There is the architectural 
mish-mash of Tokyo that gives the impression of Disneyland or a movie set; the 
sugary pop songs; the twittering, high-pitched voices of television stars who 
act like schoolgirls; the salary men in their blue suits reading comic books on 
the subways and so on. After a while, the kaleidoscopic images of modern Japan 
give one the feeling of adolescent restlessness in which fashion, films, 
writers are devoured for a time as the latest fad and then abandoned.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's as if we have our own soft, Japanese-style Soviet Realism," Sato tells 
me one evening. There are plenty of artists and writers who challenge 
conventions -- avant-garde painters on strike against society, butoh 
performances that are celebrations of mad erotica, ex-student radicals who make 
porn movies -- but for Sato, they are Japan's cultural samizdat , utterly 
marginal and easily ignored. As for the rest, it's Japanese-style Soviet 
Realism, which replaces praise for the proletariat with praise for the postwar 
ideology. For starters, he says, that means utopian pacifism and the myth that 
conflict has been done away with, not just in the political realm but in the 
cultural realm as well. "Without conflict, there can be no good drama. How do 
you write good drama when the postwar ideology says there is no more conflict? 
Of course there is conflict, but it doesn't get expressed," he says.  
</P>
<P>
 The tables around us in the trendy Italian restaurant are filled with young 
people dressed in the latest designer fashions. "Just look around. We're all 
cut off from tradition," he says. "We were told that Japanese history could 
start anew in 1945. That absolved people of a sense of responsibility for the 
war, but it also meant we are cut off from our traditions. Without a sense of 
tradition, art just becomes pop. In my own writing, I can't turn to old stories 
or use images or metaphors from the past. No one would understand them. 
Instead, there's Hollywood or pop music."  
</P>
<P>
 Sato echoes the common lament, a mourning for something lost and a deep 
ambivalence over being Westernized without being Western. This has long 
absorbed conservatives; it is what the well-known literary critic Jun Eto means 
when he says that the American occupation denied the Japanese their sense of 
cultural continuity. In postwar Japan, this fury over being robbed of tradition 
has often been expressed in an extreme right-wing nationalism or a 
quasi-religious quest to find the Japanese spirit. But Sato considers as absurd 
the search for the pure Japanese spirit in some mythical past before Korean 
influence, before Chinese influence and certainly before American influence. 
Reviving past traditions, such as the Shintoism that turned the state into a 
religious cult with the emperor at its head, holds no answer for him either. 
Instead, he says, "We have to create a new tradition." THE DIPLOMAT 
</P>
<P>
 With a casual flick of the wrist, Kazuo Ogura dismisses those like Sato who 
long for a new tradition to compensate for their sense of loss. Sitting in his 
roomy office in the Foreign Ministry, Ogura, a trim, elegant man of 56, says 
such preoccupations spring from a lack of confidence and a cultural fear of 
being weaker than the West. Those days are over. "Japan is rising and the rest 
of Asia is rising along with it," he tells me. "A new Asia has been born and 
it's already creating a new tradition." 
</P>
<P>
 Ogura is a man who is confident of his clout in shaping the debate over 
Japan's role in the world. He is reserved and decorous. But this senior 
bureaucrat, whose father was also a senior bureaucrat, shows no reticence in 
laying out his theme: Japan is part of Asia and, in this era of Asian 
prosperity, the Japanese should celebrate their role in the Asian renaissance 
that is emerging. 
</P>
<P>
 With its tasteful etchings of landscapes and book-lined shelves, his office 
has the feel of a professor's den, and Ogura, wearing loafers and a 
double-breasted jacket, looks like a professor. Ogura likes to present himself 
as the in-house gadfly, the maverick and the man of ideas. He says he's always 
been intrigued by the stumbling encounters between East and West, and some 
years ago he wrote a book called "Cultural Friction Between East and West," 
which includes an essay pondering why Gen. Douglas MacArthur came up with the 
famous dictum that Japan was a nation of 12-year-olds. "For many Americans, 
Japan was not a modern country, but like Sparta," he wrote of the common view 
after the war. "Another reason the Japanese were seen as childish is that 
subconsciously, Westerners think they are intellectually superior." 
</P>
<P>
 Many intellectuals continue to see Asians as inferior, Ogura says. But the 
Japanese are not childish or weak or passive; rather they are leading the way 
to what he calls a new Asia. The Japanese should embrace their Asian identity, 
Ogura says, and he wants to offer an updated answer to the old debate over 
whether Japan belongs to the West or the East. Last summer, he published an 
article calling for "the restoration of Asia" in a prominent intellectual 
journal. It was designed to attract attention, and it did. "I wasn't writing an 
agenda for foreign policy, I wanted to capture what's going on in Asia, what it 
means for us and how we see ourselves," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 With the tone of a manifesto, Ogura's article has much in common with a 
growing sub-genre of writings telling how Asia's arrival on the world stage 
promises a new epoch, a renaissance, which will spread its influence as far and 
as wide as the Western renaissance before it. "Just as the West absorbed from 
Asia and thereby developed a new set of universal values, Asia should now 
thoroughly absorb what the West has offered and develop a new set of universal 
values that it can transmit to the world," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Ogura says he is aiming his argument at several audiences. First, he wants 
Japan to adopt a more autonomous foreign policy, especially with its Asian 
neighbors, and stop being just the junior partner to the United States. Next, 
he appeals to American policy-makers and opinion-makers. "I want to put them on 
notice that a lot of people in Asia don't like what they hear coming from 
America: that Asia's prosperity is a threat to America," he says. Then, there's 
the rest of Asia. He's deliberately cast his ideas against the backdrop of the 
increasingly fashionable talk of there being an Asian Way, contrary to Western 
ways, of organizing society and politics. Yet, at the same time, he claims the 
new Asia he is describing has mixed it up so much with the West that a pristine 
Asian Way doesn't exist. For all the tensions in his argument, Ogura seems to 
have found his audience. 
</P>
<P>
 When his name came up at a diplomatic reception recently, one of his young 
Foreign Ministry colleagues feigned a wince. "He's giving us faceless 
bureaucrats a bad name," he said. The assembled group laughed. "But he's going 
places." Indeed he is. In August, Ogura became Japan's ambassador to Vietnam, 
where he will have a chance to show how putting Asia first works. After his 
time in Vietnam, he is expected to be the next deputy foreign minister in 
charge of economic affairs, which would make him Japan's chief negotiator in 
the U.S.-Japan trade talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he left for Hanoi, I asked Ogura what he meant by the restoration of 
Asia. "For a long time," he began, "Asia has been a concept created by 
Westerners." It has been a place to be plundered, a place of romance and the 
exotic, a place to be colonized and a place to civilize and convert. But no 
longer. Asians are creating their own positive identity, he says, and have 
developed values that they should transmit to the rest of the world.  
</P>
<P>
 What are these Asian values? Many of them are in flux and only just emerging, 
Ogura says, and, interestingly, spring from American influences. Others have to 
do with the importance of family, the relationship between the individual and 
the group. Still others will flow from what he calls the Asian system of 
capitalism -- in which government and business cooperate and exports are 
emphasized -- that is developing in the democratic industrialized countries of 
Asia. Then there is discipline and order and hard work. 
</P>
<P>
 I remark that some of what he is saying seems to fit right in with the slogans 
about Asian values most vigorously expounded by authoritarian governments. It 
reminds me of Singaporean officials, for instance, reciting like a mantra Asian 
values -- respect for family, elders and the common good as opposed to 
individualism, for example -- that are supposedly opposed to and better than 
Western values. 
</P>
<P>
 Ogura claims his argument is more complicated than that. It has more nuances. 
He says his main point is that Asian values have become entwined with Western 
ones. "Asianism used to be promoted by those who wanted to hold onto 
tradition," he says. "But now it is being expressed by those who are the most 
internationalized, the most Westernized."  
</P>
<P>
 Ogura believes that the Japanese have absorbed and made their own such 
concepts as democracy, rule of law and individual rights. The Asian 
renaissance, he says, is of an Asia that has already embraced Western ideas. 
Yet, he says with a gentle smile, Asians have begun to wonder what happened to 
the model -- America. "America's culture and political system has long been 
admired and cherished in Japan and all over Asia. But something has changed. 
There is now disquiet over what's going on in America. The American values they 
cherish seem to be disappearing and that has caused a lot of soul-searching. 
It's made us think, what are we? Where are we heading? What is our identity?" 
</P>
<P>
 The conflicts in Ogura's version of an Asian identity will be played out when 
the Japanese decide whether Japan will try to alter its dependence on the 
United States for security and whether Japan will push to create an Asian 
trading zone. But Ogura is confident of his country's new direction. "Just as 
Asia has been Americanized in the years since the end of the war," he says, 
"now it's time for America to be Asianized." THE ARTIST 
</P>
<P>
 Yukinori Yanagi has staked out his own territory: His art explores the symbols 
and myths and forgotten chapters of Japan's national story. In a museum north 
of Tokyo, his version of a red Japanese passport was laid out recently on a 
gallery floor like an enormous carpet. In Yanagi's rug, the petals of the gold 
chrysanthemum, the symbol of Imperial Japan stamped on every passport, are not 
clustered in the center, but strewn helter-skelter. Under each petal, he has 
woven the question "s/he loves me?" or "s/he loves me not?" in the languages of 
the Asian countries Japan invaded during the Pacific War.  
</P>
<P>
 On the white gallery walls surrounding the passport rug, Yanagi hung four oil 
paintings depicting battle scenes painted during the war by some of Japan's 
foremost artists. When the U.S. occupation forces arrived, they confiscated by 
the dozens propaganda paintings like these, and for most of the decades since, 
the canvases showing victorious naval battles and troop landings have been 
locked in a storeroom at the National Museum of Modern Art in Tokyo.  
</P>
<P>
 While we were there, young museum-goers, many clad in black-on-black attire, 
slipped off their shoes before stepping on Yanagi's altered symbol of 
nationality. His art is putting questions of nationality and identity literally 
underfoot and is rummaging through closets many would prefer remain closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every country has its own national story. Japan's is filled with 
contradictions and now they are exploding. That explosion is what interests me 
and why I create art," says the 35-year-old Yanagi as we watch people wander on 
and off his carpet. He has short-cropped black hair, almost a crew-cut, and 
long, delicate features. He is often called one of Japan's most accomplished 
political artists, but I think this description misses the point: Yanagi sees 
his art as a form of liberation, a means of release from the orthodoxies that 
have stressed Japanese uniqueness in culture, politics and history.  
</P>
<P>
 He is a champion of individualism; he doesn't believe there is such a thing as 
the Japanese spirit or the Japanese character that can be expressed either in 
art or in politics. He likens being Japanese these days to driving 90 miles per 
hour down a wet, slick road without a clue what's ahead. Politically, the old 
divides between socialist and conservative have fallen apart. Culturally, 
categories like East and West or the idea of an Asian tradition versus a 
Western one cease to make any sense. "Japanese have always been told what their 
identity means. It's been a form of control, a way to ensure conformity," he 
says. Like the writer, the diplomat and the politician, Yanagi says the 
definition of being Japanese has become muddled. But for him it is a creative 
muddle. 
</P>
<P>
 His art is the expression of a critical spirit and, most important, it is not 
being ignored. Yanagi's art is not samizdat ; he has found an audience, and a 
large one at that. His work does spark controversy: the Hiroshima City Museum 
of Contemporary Art bowed out of exhibiting his "Chrysanthemum Carpet" but 
quickly commissioned him to do another piece. "Even the forms of censorship are 
changing," he says. After curators at the Hiroshima museum said they were 
concerned that the propaganda paintings would offend sensitivities because the 
theme of the exhibit was the upcoming 50th anniversary of the bombing, Yanagi 
says he got the message. The day we visited the museum north of Tokyo, Yanagi 
asked me to look at the underside of the rug. There, he had printed over and 
over again the sections of the constitution that protect freedom of thought, 
religion, speech and expression. "Just in case somebody decided to roll up the 
rug," he told me. "I figured they'd get my joke."  
</P>
<P>
 Yanagi lives and works in what was once a rice farming hamlet that has been 
swallowed by Tokyo's sprawl. His studio, in an old wooden house that used to 
belong to a farmer, sits at the end of a gravel alley behind a sushi shop. It's 
large, well-lighted and cluttered. Most of the room is taken up by pieces of 
his work and tables covered with journals, catalogues and brochures. On one 
table, there's a brochure for a huge show of postwar Japanese art -- which 
includes his enormous version of the Rising Sun flag in neon -- that recently 
opened at the Guggenheim Museum in SoHo and will travel to the San Francisco 
Museum of Modern Art next year. On another, he has stacked flags made out of 
colored sand that form a large piece called "Asia-Pacific Ant Farm." Like his 
rug, the flags are those of Japan and the countries invaded during the war. 
When it is exhibited, the flags are connected by clear rubber tubes that red 
ants run through, burrowing their way through the sand of the flags. On one 
wall, Yanagi has set up a single flag with ants inside, slowly making tunnels 
through the sand. "Ants have the perfect society, but no human would want to 
live in it," he says as we watch their progress.  
</P>
<P>
 Yanagi grew up in a gritty provincial city on the southern island of Kyushu, 
the misfit son of an LDP local politician and his wife. Yanagi's father, toward 
the end of the war, lied about his age, joined the navy and trained to be a 
kamikaze pilot. But he never left on his suicide mission because Japan had run 
out of planes. Yanagi remembers a picture of his father in his brown khaki 
uniform and leather jacket, the pilot's white scarf around his neck. "I used to 
stare at it and wonder what it would be like to be a kamikaze who survived. My 
father's whole life has been trying to serve the nation, but he always seems to 
be behind the times. He didn't fly as a kamikaze and the LDP has lost power. He 
was brought up to believe the emperor was God, and he's a man who doesn't 
question the way things are," he says.  
</P>
<P>
 "Inside of me there are two sides. One side understands my father and even 
sympathizes with him for wanting to serve the nation. The other side of me 
thinks he has been told a lot of propaganda. The two sides are always 
criticizing each other. Maybe that's why I keep coming back to images of 
Japanese nationality in my work."  
</P>
<P>
 Yanagi fled Kyushu for Tokyo, and eventually came to America, where he studied 
art and immersed himself in Japanese history. "I was in a fog but the more I 
read, the more it became clear: Japanese identity has been created," he says. 
"Learning this was freedom to me. But because I am Japanese, these ideas of 
identity that I have been taught burden me, and I needed to find why this story 
of Japanese identity has been created." His conclusion: Ever since Japan has 
been exposed to Europe and America, Japanese have been told they suffer from a 
cultural problem -- attempting to catch up with the West while retaining their 
own identity. For Yanagi, this obsession with identity has mostly exercised 
Japan's rulers and thinkers and has led to an elaborate myth of Japaneseness. 
The more Japan set out to imitate the West, the more effort was spent insisting 
on a unique Japanese spirit as a way of salvaging national pride.  
</P>
<P>
 This notion of Japan's cultural problem has been the main theme of recent 
Japanese history, he says. It has led to wild swings from emulation of the West 
to outright rejection and claims that Japan's mission was to protect Asian 
values from a hostile Western world. "That's why the myth of the emperor as god 
was created, as something purely Japanese," he says.  
</P>
<P>
 He says much about Japan has changed, yet the idea that there needs to be a 
certain definable Japanese identity lingers. His art expresses his belief that 
there is no such thing as a Japanese national identity and that attempts to 
define one only lead to a stultifying national culture. "It's up to individual 
Japanese to decide what their identity means to them. This is what the Japanese 
are facing right now, and this is what I want to deal with in my work," he says 
as the late-afternoon sun begins to cast long shadows across the floor of his 
studio. 
</P>
<P>
 In mid-September, Yanagi went down to the Hiroshima art museum, a stunning 
building that sits on a hill overlooking the city, to oversee the installation 
of "Article Nine," a new piece made up of 24 neon signs, each one devoted to 
the Japanese characters that make up the war-renouncing clause of the 
constitution. There, in a large gallery with a high ceiling, he set about 
randomly scattering his pieces of neon and arranging for them to flash on and 
off in bright red.  
</P>
<P>
 "We all know Article Nine by heart," he says. "All Japanese born after the war 
have grown up with it. It is central to what we have been told is Japanese 
identity. I want people to take it apart, just like the neon signs, and then 
put it back together."

G-L-O-R-I-A; MAYBE IT'S THE PRESS CONFERENCES, OR THE CHANEL SUITS OR HER 
INSISTENCE THAT EVERYONE DESERVES THEIR DAY IN COURT, BUT GLORIA ALLRED IS THE 
LAWYER EVERYONE LOVES TO HATE

 "Did you see Gloria Allred on the news last night?" 
</P>
<P>
 The guy at the front of the line in the mail center was talking to the clerk. 
"I'm surprised it took her this long to surface," the clerk said, throwing a 
package on the scale. As usual, the topics of the day were under serious 
scrutiny. "You think they should fry O.J.?" Allred had just called for Dist. 
Atty. Gil Garcetti to seek the death penalty in the case against the 
world-renowned rental-car shill. "I think they should fry all lawyers," the guy 
said, if not paraphrasing Shakespeare then at least expressing one of the few 
common reference points among Americans. "And I know just where to start." 
</P>
<P>
 At any given time, there are highly visible people whose names generate an 
intense response that often tells you more about the person who is responding 
than about the person causing the response. In contemporary Los Angeles, 
perhaps no one has consistently generated more heat than feminist attorney 
Gloria Allred. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as some lawyers are prominently associated with cases involving the Mafia 
or political dissent, Allred is prominently associated with cases driven by 
every burning gender issue of the day: child abuse, sexual harassment, rape, 
date rape, spousal abuse, sexual discrimination, lesbian rights, gay rights. 
Sometimes these cases are already infamous: Allred represented two of the girls 
involved in the Spur Posse incident, and, for about five minutes, she 
represented the boy who claimed to have been abused by Michael Jackson. 
Sometimes her cases are groundbreaking: In 1979, she won a precedent-setting 
right-to-privacy case involving the use of polygraph tests by federal employers 
and she filed a civil suit against a man accused of rape, after which he was 
arrested and tried on criminal charges. She later won the suit and the story 
became the basis of the TV movie "Without Her Consent." In 1980, in the 
landmark Larson vs. Pitchess case, she sued to force the county to change its 
medieval policy of tying pregnant inmates to their beds while they gave birth. 
Several years ago, she won a change in policy at Saks Fifth Avenue stores when 
she sued them for charging women more for alterations than men. She is 
currently representing Holly Ramona, who made headlines earlier this year when 
her father successfully sued Holly's therapists for reinforcing false memories 
of incest in his daughter. Holly is now suing her father for molestation. 
Because Allred wages these battles in the court of public opinion as well as in 
the courthouse, she is the best-known feminist attorney in the nation and, 
according to Los Angeles magazine, one of "the 30 most powerful people in Los 
Angeles" (1990) and one of "the 50 most interesting people in L.A." (1994). In 
terms of power, this puts her in the company of such individuals as Armand 
Hammer, Henry Waxman, Michael Eisner, Michael Ovitz and David Geffen. In terms 
of being interesting, she ranks No. 17, after Ray Bradbury and before Richard 
Riordan. Just for the record, she includes these stats in her official bio. 
</P>
<P>
 Others on the lists probably mention their status in their bios as well, but 
Allred's resume affirms what many of us suspect: She is not publicity shy. She 
is a local television commentator and host of a local radio show; she appears 
often on national talk shows and at press conferences in her offices and around 
town. She says she has had fewer press conferences this year than in the past. 
I've counted eight, including one that announced a victory in a lawsuit against 
photographers who refused to publish a photograph of a graduate and his male 
"partner in life" in a high school reunion yearbook, a win against a man who 
molested his goddaughter and, more recently, the filing of a lawsuit against 
Mervyn's for discriminating against male parents who want to accompany their 
daughters into dressing rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's all?" people generally say when I reveal my tally. The perception is 
that there have been many more, that the only thing Allred does is hold press 
conferences, which is why there was a collective "oh, no, not again" reaction 
when she came forward in favor of the death penalty in the Simpson case. The 
response had everything to do with her and nothing to do with what she was 
saying, which was: "As long as the death penalty is sought against women 
accused of killing their husbands, it should be sought, when the situation 
warrants, against men charged with killing their wives."  
</P>
<P>
 Although reporters generally turn out in force at Allred's conferences, they 
are often wary. Rather than simply not show up, our information gatekeepers 
employ loaded language in coverage of Allred; an article in The Times, for 
instance, said she built "public spectacles" around her cases. In reality, most 
press conferences, from those sponsored by the White House to movie studios 
announcing box office grosses, are spectacles, reeking of contrivance and 
rarely driven by urgency. But when the press decides to prove that it can't be 
used, darn it, then their credo is, "We're not going to let Gloria Allred pull 
any fast ones!"  
</P>
<P>
 But what is Allred attempting to get away with, and why must the public be 
protected? The prevailing sentiment, that she is a "self-promoter," just 
doesn't explain the level of antipathy. Why is it that Gloria Allred -- not 
celebrities with public relations agencies on the payroll, not a former 
football player on trial for the murder of his ex-wife who dishes out dating 
advice in a supposed suicide note ("Marcus, you've got a great lady in 
Catherine, don't mess it up"), not people who stand at freeway exit ramps with 
signs that say "Buy my screenplay" -- is so often accused of debasing herself? 
</P>
<P>
 The "self-promoter" label has stuck to Allred for several reasons. First, once 
labels are applied, it is difficult to peel them off. Bill Clinton will 
probably go down in history as "the guy who wanted to please everyone," despite 
such things as the invasion of Haiti, which appears to have pleased no one. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, people distrust a person on a mission, either because they are 
reminded of their own lack of passion and feel guilty or because they recall 
other zealots through the ages and are scared. Joan of Arc may be a saint, a 
role model and a good part for Ingrid Bergman, but why can't we all lighten up 
with a round of drinks?  
</P>
<P>
 Third, Allred is female. Generally speaking, a self-promoting man is regarded 
as colorful at worst, at best, authoritative. Consider Robert Shapiro, no sacks 
yet but perhaps the best-uniformed member of O.J. Simpson's defensive squad. 
Here is a man who gives seminars for other lawyers on how to use the media. Yet 
the conventional wisdom is not that he is a "self-promoter" but that he is 
smart. The press loves being used by this guy. His fans would say that his use 
of the media is for his clients' benefit, but how does permitting People 
magazine to photograph Shapiro and his wife poolside aid O.J. Simpson? By 
winning over the pool-owning members of the jury?  
</P>
<P>
 Finally, it must be acknowledged that Allred is at the scene of many societal 
car accidents. People seem to find this tiresome. They've stopped 
rubber-necking; why can't she? But Allred is not there because she chases them; 
the contrary is true. People with grievances know that she handles a certain 
kind of case, and they seek her for representation. Not everyone who comes to 
her is seeking publicity, but certainly there are those who have no intention 
of avoiding it. Is there anyone among us who does not harbor the desire to 
stand before a bank of microphones and say, "OK, Mr. Brokaw, I've got time for 
one more question"? People seem to forget that Gloria Allred is a lawyer with a 
civil practice and therefore in the business of lawsuits. Her high visibility 
in an age when last year's massacre of lawyers in a San Francisco law firm 
resulted in yet more lawyer jokes makes her a lightning rod for animosity. If 
Allred is guilty of anything, it is that she seems to have no perspective, 
conjuring press conferences without discrimination. "Not true!" she proclaims. 
"There are plenty of cases I can't talk about that deserve publicity. If I'm 
having a press conference, it's in my client's interest, and it's an issue of 
public importance." It's not that her press conferences happen so frequently 
(they don't), it's that she seems unable to distinguish between the trivial and 
the profound. "Who am I to make that decision?" she says. "Should I stay silent 
when I see an injustice? If I went away, believe me, everyone would by saying, 
'Gloria, please, don't be quiet!" 
</P>
<P>
 While Allred may have a passion for riding the airwaves, underneath it all she 
is driven by a superannuated sense of fair play. For her, everything is equally 
urgent, worthy of a latter-day, "Stop the presses! Replate!" "So many of the 
issues I deal with," she says, "how could you not hold a press conference?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 IN ALLRED'S SPACIOUS, TASTEFUL, CHINTZ-AND-MAHOGANY Wilshire Boulevard law 
offices high atop other spacious, tasteful offices for other interesting and 
powerful people, the press is packed into the conference room. The room 
crackles with rumors. Everyone has heard that Allred is about to announce a 
suit against a "major male actor who is also a director" and that it is in the 
category of sexual harassment. The game is "Name That Bad-Boy Actor." "Sean 
Penn?" someone says. "Clint Eastwood?" offers someone else. A die-hard 
"Rawhide" fan, I defend Clint vigorously. 
</P>
<P>
 And then Allred enters, dressed in the trademark impeccable style of the upper 
echelons of the legal class. Today it's a Chanel suit, black and white, dark 
stockings and heels (she is 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches tall and in public rarely 
wears shoes that don't add height), accessorized with matching everything. She 
not only makes eye contact (camera operators included) and remembers names but 
also seems genuine and warm (unlike those public figures who know how to work 
the press but smile inappropriately, such as jury consultant Jo-Ellan Habner 
Demetrius). 
</P>
<P>
 Allred is followed to the head of the conference table by Diana Botsford, a 
former television executive. Soon the mystery is solved. The actor in question 
is Maximilian Schell. The jackals had been hoping for a younger kill. Botsford 
alleges that while she was working at the production company Kushner-Locke, 
Schell -- who was directing a film that the company was producing for, 
ironically enough, the Family Channel -- committed a number of sexual offenses. 
The result of her complaint: another press conference, this one held by Schell. 
The star of "Judgment at Nuremberg" has denied the accusations. The case is 
significant because the plaintiff is not suing an employer. Stay tuned for a 
showdown this month. 
</P>
<P>
 I suppose that at a time when the President of the United States, at least one 
senator, one Supreme Court nominee, the Navy, the CIA, the FBI and the Los 
Angeles Police Department have labored under charges of sexual harassment, real 
news would be the formation of a support group for those who have not been 
accused of some sort of sexual gaffe. Of course, to Botsford and Allred, what 
Schell committed was more than a gaffe. But why was their complaint filed with 
so much fanfare? 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way to get people to change their behavior," Allred says, "is to hit 
them where it hurts." Financially, in other words. And in Schell's case, via 
publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 But, says Nancy Fitzhugh, Schell's lawyer, "This case does a disservice to 
women. Schell was not an employee of Kushner-Locke. It's not a case of sexual 
harassment. I'm very disappointed that (Allred) has taken this on. It dilutes 
other major cases. There are cases where there are legitimate examples of 
sexual harassment, but this is not one of them. I don't want to see us use the 
legal system to change the behavior of men." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Allred's stated mission in life is exactly that. And like so many 
things in life, it all goes back to the crucible of high school. "Of the two of 
us," says best friend Fern Brown Caplan, a lawyer who grew up with Allred in 
Philadelphia, "I was the klutz. I'm short and chubby. She was the pretty one. 
Gloria always told boys, 'You gotta find a date for my friend Fern if you want 
to go out with me.' "  
</P>
<P>
 Allred, it seems, is still doing whatever it takes to make sure that everyone 
gets taken to the prom. In this case, Botsford was at the dance, but as Allred 
sees it, she was hobbled by her escorts. "If I don't tell women about their 
rights," Allred asks, "who will?" 
</P>
<P>
 It is the cry of the crusader down through the ages: I have no choice, I must. 
Across the shifting social plains, Allred gallops like an avenging goddess 
under a banner proclaiming, "Sue them, for they know not what they do."  
</P>
<P>
 Soon after the Schell press conference, Allred called another to announce the 
filing of a lawsuit against the family of a convicted child molester for 
failing to inform a female friend of his past. The failure, Allred claimed, 
resulted in the molestation of her son.  
</P>
<P>
 Because a celebrity is not involved, the suit has not attracted as much 
initial fanfare as the one filed against Schell. Yet it is far more important 
because it suggests that a society that fully protects consumers has failed to 
protect the truly helpless -- children. On a Montel Williams show devoted to 
this issue, Allred presented a stunning case in favor of a metaphorical scarlet 
letter for those who have taken advantage of children. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that a woman named Helen had been dating a guy named Bob Martin. One 
day, a friend of Helen was watching an HBO special about parolees. It featured 
none other than Bob Martin and talked about his criminal record of child abuse. 
The friend informed a shocked Helen; Bob had become close with her son and the 
pair spent a great deal of time together. Helen soon after arranged with the 
police to meet her and her son. After hours of questioning, Helen's fear had 
been confirmed: He had described 2 1/2 years' worth of molestation. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Martin is back in jail, and Helen and her son have been 
devastated. After Martin was sentenced, Helen started thinking. She knew 
Martin's family well; surely there was a law that required families of 
convicted child molesters to inform those who ought to know of their relative's 
record. Who would be able to handle such a case? A friend suggested Gloria 
Allred. Helen, a customer service representative at the phone company, thought, 
"She'll never take my call." So the friend called. "They want to talk to you," 
the friend said. Helen was stunned. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is my typical client," Allred says proudly. "A single working mom with an 
urgent problem." As it turned out, there is no specific statute as the one 
Helen imagined. Allred is suing some Martin family members for negligence and 
premises liability based on the theory that the defendants failed to protect 
Helen's son from known dangers on their property -- Bob Martin's propensity for 
child sexual abuse, which resulted in severe consequences for Helen's son.  
</P>
<P>
 "Why should the victim be the only one to bear the cost?" Allred says. "You 
can't say to everyone you date, 'Are you a child molester?' There wouldn't have 
been a victim in this case if my client had been warned." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly this is a very difficult issue. The idea of forcing families to 
inform on one of their own, particularly a person who has already been 
punished, would seem to violate America's obsession with privacy at its very 
core and is not what the founding fathers had in mind. But to Allred there is 
no gray area here. 
</P>
<P>
 "A child is the least able to bear the consequences of a failure to warn," 
Allred says. "We must impose a legal duty to warn."  
</P>
<P>
 Allred is at her best with a seemingly impossible case such as this. It 
presents an opportunity to use the civil court system to change the world, and 
sometimes this approach actually works.  
</P>
<P>
 "Allred is a very effective lawyer in the courtroom," says former Dist. Atty. 
Robert Philibosian, who was in office when Allred approached him with the 
then-unpopular deadbeat-dad issue. "It was her idea to publish the names of 
parents who had warrants outstanding for non-payment of child support. We had 
an opinion from the attorney general that it was legal to print the list. In 
fact," Philibosian says, "taxpayers are victimized when a single parent without 
child support goes on welfare. Publishing the list (in the now-defunct Herald 
Examiner and a paper in the San Gabriel Valley) was effective, and it was done 
at Ms. Allred's instigation." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At first, the party at the hollywood athletic club looks like a GQ cover 
reunion -- it's wall-to-wall Euromodels. But they're here to celebrate the 
first issue of LA's Eligible, a magazine that features beefcake with 
high-interest bank accounts. Allred was interviewed in the first issue and, she 
explains, she wanted to come to the party not because she's looking to meet 
someone (she isn't) but because she feels an obligation to help female 
entrepreneurs (the publisher is a woman). 
</P>
<P>
 As Allred circulates, it becomes apparent that her social life parallels her 
democratic view of those with probative civil grievances. She attends high- and 
low-profile events and is at home in each. Here, she is constantly stopped by 
members of both sexes who want either her autograph or a picture taken with her 
or both. Invariably, the audience-seeker says that he/she was inspired by 
Allred and would like to discuss a particular issue in the news. Allred 
enthusiastically signs, poses for photos and engages in discussion of topics of 
the day. Once again, Mom was right, I think; you can tell a lot about somebody 
the way they treat "the help." Allred is such a natural at the democracy of 
communication that one wonders why she hasn't yet run for political office. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are always asking me," she says. "But I don't want to. I like what I 
am doing now."  
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks later, I meet up with her at the Cinegrill in the Roosevelt Hotel. 
Her friend Cybill Shepherd is performing her lounge act, and Allred has invited 
me to come along. Allred and Shepherd are good friends, but she also wanted to 
attend Shepherd's show for a reason not unlike the reason she was at the LA's 
Eligible" party -- "Shepherd is a single, working mother and I feel I should 
support her."  
</P>
<P>
 At a party afterward, I bump into an old friend and introduce him to Allred. 
He says that he likes her radio show (now weekdays on KABC) and, in fact, as a 
result of one of her recent broadcasts, has just purchased a copy of "The 
Encyclopedia of Bizarre Sexual Practices." This was a show in response to a 
caller who had raised questions about the genesis of bestiality. I wonder if 
mention of that encyclopedia on Allred's show spurred more than one sale and 
joked that I might phone bookstores around town to investigate. "Oh, great," 
Allred says with a laugh. "Eighteen years of law practice, and it's down to 
bestiality." 
</P>
<P>
 It comes as a surprise that Allred has a sense of humor. Publicly, she rarely 
displays it. The humor exit ramp is generally bypassed by missionaries, for 
fear of not being taken seriously. Allred's single-mindedness is translated by 
some as not just being humorless but "strident" as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Some have called her worse than that. In 1981, then-State Sen. John Schmitz 
(R-Corona del Mar), in response to a chastity belt she presented him during a 
series of hearings he chaired on abortion, issued a press release in which he 
called her a "slick, butch lawyeress." She sued him for defamation, won in 
1986, and gave her $20,000 award to groups she believed had been maligned in 
the same press release, including the National Council of Jewish Women, the Gay 
and Lesbian Community Service Center and the California Abortion Rights Action 
League. 
</P>
<P>
 The Schmitz episode, ultimately, may have had a softening effect on Allred. 
"In the old days," says friend Meredith MacRae, "her manner was somewhat 
strident. But now she looks far more feminine and soft. Her hair is longer. I 
think she's everything a woman should be -- intelligent, fair, generous and 
beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of hair length, there are those who persist in interpreting Allred 
as "strident." But as her daughter, Lisa Bloom, an associate in Allred, Maroko 
& Goldberg, says, "Why wouldn't you want your lawyer to be strident?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 WHAT IS THE GENESIS OF ALLRED'S MISSION? SHE HERSELF isn't quite sure. She 
grew up as the only child in a poor Jewish household in Philadelphia. The 
family name was Bloom. "I would go to the movies by myself, and my father would 
wait for me in the park," Allred recalls. "We couldn't afford for both of us to 
go in."  
</P>
<P>
 That's because her father was a Fuller Brush man; her mother was a homemaker. 
Both had only an eighth-grade education. Stella Bloom loved to read and go out 
and dance, but Morris Bloom devoted his one day off each week to Gloria. Both 
parents lavished a great deal of attention on their daughter, and she bears all 
the marks of an only child who grew up in a loving, intact household: She is 
highly confident, has a great sense of entitlement, is entirely comfortable 
being the center of attention yet seeks co-conspirators, others to dance with. 
Although influenced by both parents, she says that it was a great-aunt -- a 
pediatric heart surgeon in Philadelphia -- who was a role model. "She was the 
only woman I knew who wasn't a homemaker," Allred recalls. "She didn't get 
married, didn't cook, didn't have kids, didn't apologize for it, liked life. 
That was very unusual then." 
</P>
<P>
 Allred attended the Philadelphia High School for Girls, a public school that 
required high grades for entry, which Allred regards as key in her development. 
"They called me Joan of Arc," she says, "because of my haircut." 
</P>
<P>
 "Girls ran everything at school," she says, "the paper, the student council. 
There was never a question that girls couldn't compete in the world. I remember 
the vice principal telling us in 1959 that we could have professions." 
</P>
<P>
 After high school, Allred attended the University of Pennsylvania, where she 
was an honors English major. She married Peyton Bray and had her first and only 
child while in college. After she graduated, her marriage was over, and she 
went to work as an assistant buyer at Gimbel's department store in 
Philadelphia. "I had my first lesson in discriminatory salaries then," she 
says. "There was another assistant buyer who was making more money than I was. 
They told me it was because he had a family. But that turned out not to be 
true. I decided I better leave." 
</P>
<P>
 She began substitute teaching and liked it so much that she became a full-time 
teacher and was assigned to Ben Franklin High, an all-black boys' school, where 
she taught for two years. In 1966, she moved to Los Angeles. "A (school 
district) recruiter had come to Philadelphia after the Watts rebellion," she 
says. "I figured if I was going to be poor, I might as well live in the land of 
sunshine." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, her ex-husband's family is in La Jolla, and she wanted her daughter to 
have a relationship with them. In Los Angeles, she was assigned to the east 
side of town and later Watts. "There were kids from homes similar to mine," she 
says. "The conditions in the schools were so bad that I felt the only way they 
could be changed was legally." 
</P>
<P>
 She left to attend Loyola University School of Law in Los Angeles. In 1968, 
she married William C. Allred, a manufacturer of aircraft parts who, because of 
his non-discriminatory hiring practices, was occasionally profiled in those 
"he's a feminist too" valentines that seem to fuel Sunday style sections. 
Nineteen years later, the couple was divorced, with much publicity, when 
William Allred was convicted of defrauding the federal government by selling 
counterfeit aircraft parts through his company.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1976, Allred founded her own practice. "After I graduated, I decided I 
wanted to start an all-women's practice," she says in her office, which is a 
stylish mix of the lawyerly and the feminine, a kind of combination 
library-dining room-work space. "But the women I wanted weren't available, so I 
went to Plan B." Plan B involved two Loyola classmates -- Nathan Goldberg and 
Michael Maroko -- who went into partnership with Allred.  
</P>
<P>
 Plan B, it seems, has worked out to everybody's satisfaction. The firm 
specializes in three areas: employment discrimination (which includes sexual 
harassment and wrongful termination), civil rights (which includes rape and 
child sexual abuse) and family law (divorce, custody cases, litigation 
involving gay parents and so on).  
</P>
<P>
 "Our firm is very topical," says Maroko. "We deal with a myriad of issues. For 
instance, we handled the Mermelstein case, in which a concentration camp 
survivor answered a notice published by the right-wing Institute for Historical 
Review offering $50,000 to anyone who could prove that 'Jews were gassed in gas 
chambers at Auschwitz.' When Mr. Mermelstein came forward, they refused to pay 
him. We sued and won. It was a pro bono case." 
</P>
<P>
 High-profile lawsuits are often filed on behalf of people with no money 
seeking moral vindication against other people who have no money. About 25% of 
the firm's cases are pro bono or earn only court-awarded fees -- which is not 
to say that Allred's firm does not make money. According to Maroko, they 
handled $3 million to $4 million in billings last year. "We are attracted to 
cases that have broad public impact," says Goldberg. "We get 400 to 600 calls 
per month from people who feel they were discriminated against at work. We have 
a person fielding calls from people without referral. We have more than 1,000 
prospective clients calling per month.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our practice is very exciting, there's always a tumult going on, but it's an 
organized tumult." 
</P>
<P>
 Later that evening, I met up with Allred at her radio show, where the tumult 
always continues. Her show is more well informed than the average phone-in yak 
fest, since its host is an actual lawyer, not just some guy with a microphone 
who announces that "politicians are crooks," then sits back and watches the 
switchboard flame out with calls. This medium is the perfect outlet for the 
pure democrat, a ballot for everyone's vote, regardless of whether you happen 
to be phoning from your Lexus on the freeway, your suburban bathtub or a pay 
phone in your cellblock.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps one of the most interesting discussions I have heard on any phone-in 
talk show happened during an evening devoted to modern folklore -- "The 
Sentencing of Ellie Nesler." Nesler, a Tuolumne County woman, killed the man 
who had just been convicted of molesting her son. Allred had been advertising 
this topic for weeks, and it began to take on the feel of a judicial tent 
meeting, providing the opportunity not only to express an opinion about one of 
the most volatile issues of our time but also to cleanse your soul of the 
innate desire to seek revenge -- not with a practicing member of the clergy but 
with a member of one of the professions that has assumed that role, a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hi, Stan, you're on with Gloria Allred," she said, taking another call. Stan 
made the startling announcement that he had taken the law into his own hands. 
He took advantage of a prison job in order to kill the inmate who had raped and 
killed his young daughter. Then Stan went to jail. But, alas, the reality of 
talk radio interrupted Stan's heartbreaking tale: It was time for a traffic 
report. "Stan, do you have regrets?" Allred asked. "Yes, I do," Stan replied. 
"I deeply regret what I did, but I'm glad that I did it." 
</P>
<P>
 She asked Stan if he would call back. "I want to hear the whole story," she 
said.  
</P>

 MANY THINGS DEMAND OUR ATTENTION THESE DAYS, AND few are worthy. As a book by 
the Pope and one by a friend of Nicole Brown battle for the top of the charts, 
it all starts to sound like white noise. Recently, I attended another press 
conference at Allred's office, this one announcing victory in a lawsuit against 
a man who had been convicted of molesting his goddaughter. The 13-year-old 
girl, Desiray Bartak, was with Allred at the head of the table. Actually, to 
Allred's great pride, it was Allred's daughter who helped litigate the case, 
although Lisa Bloom was unable to attend the press conference. 
</P>
<P>
 As she always does when a client speaks, Allred gazed raptly at "little 
Desiray" as she introduced her, making sure that all attention flowed not to 
her but to the person she represents. "I was molested by my godfather," the 
remarkably composed Desiray said. "I had to change schools. I went to countless 
therapists. I was humiliated by students, the principal and the school 
counselor. I had thoughts of killing myself. I was ashamed and thought I did 
something wrong."  
</P>
<P>
 Later, I asked Desiray how she had come to contact Allred. Allred had broken 
through the noise: "I saw her doing a commentary on KABC about deadbeat dads," 
she said. "I have one, and I decided to write her a letter about what happened 
to me. The man who molested me had already pled guilty, and I wanted to sue."  
</P>
<P>
 Allred responded to the letter, and since then, she and Desiray have appeared 
together on "20/20" and been interviewed in People magazine. "Talking to the 
press is part of the healing process for me," Desiray says, a true moderne. "My 
therapist, my attorney and my mom all agree." Some day, she says, she wants to 
be a lawyer.

THE REAL '80S; IF YOU THINK IT WAS JUST A DECADE OF GREED, YOU MISSED THE 
REVOLUTION 
</P>

business of the '80s for the Wall Street Journal and The Times.

<TEXT>
<P>
 One does not speak well of the 1980s in polite company. In right-thinking 
circles, the decade merits at best a grim shake of the head; we recall it 
without fondness as a period of orgiastic consumption presided over by a 
Claymation President bent on crushing the poor, engorging the rich and 
impoverishing future generations; a time of crooked financiers shuffling and 
reshuffling assets, of debt and deception and the selling of our birthright to 
the Japanese. Oddly, for all the sense of potlatch that goes with the era, we 
also think of the '80s as a deeply conservative time, a pathetic attempt to 
relive the '50s and return to an imaginary America that, despite the weight of 
our nostalgia for it, really never existed. Yet the strongest sense is one of 
sickening excess. The era's enduring images, for many of us, form a neat 
trinity: the windowless hulk of an empty factory, a shiny BMW driving past a 
bread line, and perhaps the funereal specter of financier Ivan Boesky -- his 
black suit, gaunt face and elongated teeth giving him the cast of a carrion 
eater. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, this is a cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, there was greed, there was Ronald Reagan, there were crooked financiers in 
funny suits and bad toupees. But the truth is, they weren't as important as, 
say, the rise of the microchip or the increasing porousness of national 
borders. In fact, this image of the '80s as a kind of moral inferno is a 
dangerous one, and not just because it's distorted and false. It's dangerous 
because it could blind us to what is really important about the decade, which 
is that it was a time of enormous, even radical change. 
</P>
<P>
 What the changes had in common, mostly, was personal freedom, which increased 
in the '80s not just in this country but almost everywhere. Personal freedom in 
America had been expanding for years, but for most of the postwar era, freedom 
and equality had gone together. As opportunities opened up to more and more 
Americans, regardless of their religion or ethnicity or gender, the middle 
class grew, and the gap between rich and poor narrowed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the '80s, though, freedom and equality were in opposition, and equality was 
largely the loser. Having schooling or wit became vastly more lucrative than 
not having these things. Women who became lawyers married men who became 
physicians, while waitresses married deliverymen, further widening the gap 
between rich and poor. Those trends aren't likely to reverse themselves any 
time soon, and, as it turns out, the usual suspects deserve little of the 
blame. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened in the '80s has vast implications for our society. World markets 
are only likely to get freer. The rewards to intellectual capital are only 
likely to grow. In a global economy that pays for brains and enterprise, what 
can we do for those with only strong backs or steadiness to offer? What are the 
limits of personal freedom in a heterogeneous society? Can we survive the 
diminished sense of obligation that accompanies the unfettered movement of 
capital, people and goods? 
</P>
<P>
 The changes of the 1980s are still playing out. They are shaping the '90s and 
beyond in America, regardless of who is in the White House or what happens on 
Wall Street. Now that the period's most cartoonish excesses have been swept 
away, there is good reason to look back at the decade for a peek at where we're 
headed and how we ought to handle things once we get there. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Much of what happened during the 1980s seems obvious. We saw the savings and 
loan industry immolate itself, the peace dividend disappearing in the flames of 
a burlesque Sun Belt Gotterdammerung. A jail-bound monomaniac named Michael 
Milken reinvented junk bonds. There was the corporate raiding, the widening gap 
between rich and poor, the actor in the White House whose schedule was often 
based on astrology. Men really did slick back their hair and wear yellow ties. 
On the global scene, communism collapsed, the Iron Curtain fell and democracy 
spread, not just in Eastern Europe but in Latin America and elsewhere. Free 
markets and greed -- the greedy are always with us -- killed the big bad oil 
cartel. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were a lot of other changes that crept over us slowly, changes whose 
importance was easier to miss. 
</P>
<P>
 In the '80s in America, personal computers became ubiquitous, ushering in the 
greatest revolution in information management since papyrus. With the adoption 
of a clever new "packet-switching" data-communications standard, the Internet 
was born, establishing the paradigm for an information network of such power 
and scope that, eventually, it will change the world in ways we can barely 
foresee. 
</P>
<P>
 The microchip revolution of the '80s has already helped to liberate ideas, 
capital and even work itself from the constraints of place. Today, companies 
needing documents keyed into computers can have the work done in the Caribbean 
or Ireland or Asia for a fraction of the cost, until finally that onerous task 
disappears altogether. Contract computer programming is a growing business in 
India, and Russian programmers are plying their skills from the Silicon Valley 
to Lyndhurst, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 The microchip revolution penetrated the home in the '80s as well. In 1980, 
"Nintendo" was unknown in America. Ten years later, according to David Sheff, 
author of "Game Over," a book about Nintendo, Super Mario was "more recognized 
by American children than Mickey Mouse." Video games became so common in 
American households that in the early 1990s, Sheff reports, "Nintendo netted as 
much as all the American movie studios combined and profited more than any of 
them, and more than the three television networks combined." More than Apple or 
IBM, it was Nintendo that brought computers to the American home and made the 
media interactive. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1980s, in an unprecedented democratization of personal finance, 
middle-class Americans stopped being depositors and instead became investors, 
with a shot at the superior returns and diversification (not to mention the 
risk) once open only to the wealthy. About 40 million of us now have money in 
mutual funds, perhaps 10 times as many as in 1979, and by now fund assets 
exceed $2 trillion, which means that mutual funds will soon have more money 
than America's banks. 
</P>
<P>
 In the '80s, perhaps 10 million immigrants, mostly Third World immigrants, 
colored our future, altered our labor markets and pushed salsa ahead of ketchup 
as the nation's condiment of choice. America is now a country in which Muslims 
just may outnumber Episcopalians. Imported goods -- another form of imported 
labor -- also became hugely more important, and imported capital, for better or 
worse, became our lifeblood. Never before had the oceans that separate us from 
the rest of the world seemed so small. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfettered markets played a big role in this. Worldwide, governments eased 
their grip on domestic industries and got out of businesses they couldn't 
possibly run. In this country, deregulated airlines carried more passengers 
more cheaply than ever before, and for all the attention paid to takeovers, the 
deal of the decade was the breakup of American Telephone & Telegraph, which 
opened the door to the telecommunications revolution occurring all around us. 
No single corporate transaction during the '80s comes close for far-reaching 
impact. (One example: Economist David R. Henderson has calculated that, 
"adjusted for inflation, the cost of a long-distance phone call fell by 47%" 
from 1980 to 1989.) 
</P>
<P>
 In the '80s, there was a revolution in our ability to manipulate our own 
biology, which was in keeping with the continuing revolution in individual 
rights and the expansion of personal freedom that predominated in this 
supposedly conservative decade. The first American test-tube baby was born in 
1981; now more than 300 clinics offer in-vitro fertilization, and today mothers 
can bear their own grandchildren. Despite a supposed backlash against feminism, 
American women sharply narrowed the earnings gap, in comparison to the '60s or 
'70s, and came to outnumber men in law school. Gays increasingly became 
parents; there are now openly gay congressmen, professional athletes and 
members of the clergy. 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, the social revolution that began in the 1960s continued right 
through the 1980s, oblivious to who was in the White House. The American family 
continued to splinter, single parents became more common than ever and 
"community" came to imply "subculture." There was the investment community, the 
lesbian community, the health-care community and the off-road-vehicle 
community; yet the more communities there were, the less community there seemed 
to be. The '80s weren't selfish so much as they were self-absorbed. It's no 
wonder we came to be haunted by the homeless, those refugees from a time when 
communities took care of people who couldn't, or wouldn't, take care of 
themselves. These spectral presences remind us that freedom, far from being 
free, can be so costly that it requires payment in a coin we haven't minted 
yet, no matter how much money we may make. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 It was in the economy that so many of the changes of the '80s most clearly 
manifested themselves, yet no aspect of American life was more misunderstood. 
Many people think that America's economy went into decline, that the only jobs 
available were as burger flippers and that American manufacturing withered. We 
sold our soul for imports. Government policy and greedy financiers were to 
blame. 
</P>
<P>
 What actually happened was much more complicated, but perhaps the most 
important thing to bear in mind is that it was no one's fault. Ignore all the 
finger-pointing. What happened was the result of historical and economic forces 
that no one could control. 
</P>
<P>
 To understand the inevitable transformation of the American economy that 
occurred during the '80s, we need to go back to 1979, when President Jimmy 
Carter ushered in the decade in the person of a tall, taciturn economist who 
smoked a cigar at his own Senate nomination hearings -- Paul A. Volcker. 
</P>
<P>
 The son of a legendary, upright city manager who saved Teaneck, N.J., from 
financial ruin, Volcker grew up with thrift in his marrow, and when Carter 
turned to Volcker to head the Federal Reserve Board, he chose a nominal 
Democrat single-mindedly dedicated to slaying the beast of inflation. Volcker 
persuaded his fellow Fed governors to make a seemingly technical decision to 
change how the Fed tries to control the world's supply of dollars, adopting 
(and modifying) the ideas of the influential free-market economist Milton 
Friedman on this score. The result, very soon, was extremely tight money and 
staggeringly high interest rates -- a prime rate of 21.5% in late 1980 -- which 
pushed the nation into the worst recession since the Great Depression. 
</P>
<P>
 America entered this recession, and embarked on the '80s, after years of slow 
productivity growth, its sclerotic large companies in many ways unprepared for 
modern challenges. Personal income had been stagnant since 1973, and throughout 
the 1970s, the rich got richer while the poor got poorer. 
</P>
<P>
 For a close-up of America's economic problems in those days, consider the tire 
industry. Once practically unchallenged in the domestic marketplace, America's 
tire makers were headed for a fall in the 1970s. The world had discovered that 
the radials pioneered by Michelin in France and Pirelli in Italy were far 
superior to the bias-ply tires that still prevailed here. Radials got better 
gas mileage, which made them increasingly de rigueur as original equipment 
after the 1973 oil shock, and they were more durable. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet America's tire industry seemed unable to adapt to the rapidly changing 
global environment. Most U.S. tire capacity, configured for producing 
bias-plies, was useless in the coming world of radials, and many U.S. 
operations were crammed into ancient and inefficient factories. Japanese cars, 
meanwhile, offering better quality and fuel efficiency, were pouring into the 
country. They came with Japanese tires. 
</P>
<P>
 A brutal shakeout was inevitable, and the recession of 1981 triggered it. In 
1979 about 127,000 Americans worked in tire manufacturing. In 1983 the figure 
was just 94,000. Last year it averaged 81,300. Yet these 81,300 tire workers 
managed to produce a record 260 million tires. In fact, 36% fewer workers made 
17% more tires. 
</P>
<P>
 They achieved not only quantity but also quality. The switch to radials meant 
tires that last two to four times as long, and that in most places obviate snow 
tires and chains (with help from the spread of front-wheel and four-wheel-drive 
vehicles). The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which grades 
tires on tread wear, temperature and traction, has found that while 100 was a 
typical tread-wear rating before radials, it's no longer uncommon to find tires 
rated above 500. Tires are scoring so high, says NHTSA engineer Nelson Gordy, 
that the agency is thinking of changing the rating system. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened? Prodded by international competition, the American tire 
industry was re-created in the '80s. Many venerable firms were sold to 
motivated European and Japanese buyers, who often paid top dollar to buy into 
the gigantic U.S. market and then backed up their purchases with large 
additional investments. Thus, Firestone Inc. was acquired for $2.6 billion in 
1988 by Bridgestone Corp. of Japan, which invested another $1.5 billion 
modernizing Firestone factories. Just a year after the acquisition, Bridgestone 
built a $350-million state-of-the-art truck-tire plant in rural Warren County, 
Tenn. Pirelli, which bought Armstrong for $197 million in 1988, invested more 
than that in upgrading Armstrong facilities. Continental bought General Tire. 
Michelin bought Uniroyal-Goodrich. 
</P>
<P>
 Today Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. is the last of the American tire giants 
(after escaping a British takeover attempt). But its main global competitors -- 
Bridgestone-Firestone, Michelin and others -- all have factories here. American 
tire-making long ago left Ohio -- where Akron is living on quite nicely without 
it -- but not for Taiwan or Guadalajara. Today the industry is centered in 
Oklahoma, Tennessee and North Carolina, at plants that are still almost 
entirely union. New Fords often come with Michelins, but new Toyotas often come 
with Goodyears. 
</P>
<P>
 In an era when many Americans imagine that U.S. manufacturing is on the wane, 
it may come as a surprise that this sort of thing wasn't unique to the tire 
industry. Although 1.6 million U.S. manufacturing jobs, 8% of the total, were 
lost from 1979 to 1990, American manufacturing is stronger than it has been in 
two decades. In fact, manufacturing accounted for more of the national output 
in 1989 than in 1979. Better yet, U.S. manufacturing is strongest in the most 
profitable areas: not TV sets and VCRs, but business equipment and technology. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last half of the 1980s, for instance, steel output shot up, and 
American producers began to beat back imports. How? The Bureau of Labor 
Statistics in a May, 1994, study points to the rise of efficient new 
mini-mills, the restructuring of big old facilities into smaller, nimbler 
plants and the spread of advanced steelmaking technology. Productivity -- 
output per hour worked -- accelerated to an average annual gain of 3.5% from 
1979 to 1991, after years of no gains at all. 
</P>
<P>
 For steelworkers, though, the new technology meant considerable suffering. It 
cut the average number of jobs in the industry by a stunning 6.1% annually from 
1979 to 1992, and it raised the skill level of the jobs that remained. Improved 
furnaces, continuous casting, new finishing facilities and computerized 
controls all required more training, the government survey found. Yet, if we 
were to have any steel industry at all, staying with obsolete equipment and 
ways of doing things was not an option. Thus, what went wrong during the '80s 
was not the disappearance of 355,000 steelmaking jobs since 1973; that was 
inevitable. Where we failed was in not doing more for those whose jobs 
disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 The economy did produce more jobs, a net increase of 19 million during the 
longest peacetime expansion since World War II. But the mark of this prosperity 
was its unevenness; the best-educated benefited most. Many of the new jobs paid 
poorly or lacked benefits such as health insurance. Women made strong gains, 
although they still were paid less than men, and many were forced into the 
workplace because their spouses earned less. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to overemphasize the role of the personal computer in why the '80s 
produced the winners and losers that they did. The IBM PC appeared in 1981. 
Apple and others were already making small computers, but the IBM imprimatur 
told corporate America that this was a business machine, not a toy. IBM made 
the unbelievably fateful decision to adopt an "open architecture," meaning that 
it would tell everyone how its personal computers worked so there would be 
plenty of add-on equpment, and thus IBM's type of computers became standard. 
</P>
<P>
 The effect was staggering. In 1979 there were fewer than 1 million personal 
computers being used in this country. The figure now probably exceeds 50 
million, and computers are an integral part of a telecommunications system that 
also includes 10 million fax machines and 15 million cellular telephones. 
Worldwide, computers are now outselling automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Princeton economist Alan B. Krueger, who has studied the effects of computers 
on wages, finds that people who use a computer at work earn 10% to 15% more 
than those who don't. (To rule out genetic factors, he even studied twins in 
cases where one sibling had computer skills and the other didn't.) More 
remarkably, Krueger figures that "the proliferation of computers can account 
for between one-third and one-half of the increase in the rate of return to 
education" from 1984 to 1989. In other words, computers played a big role in 
the income-inequality drama. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider once again the tire industry, this time the fate of a single plant in 
Akron. Starting in 1916, Goodyear made tires in this great brick factory, its 
12-story clock tower the keynote of the city's skyline just as Goodyear was the 
cornerstone of the city's economy. Generations of workers, some college 
educated but most not, brought home a healthy paycheck from the old place until 
it closed in 1978. Like so much of Akron's tire industry, it was obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike so many other old plants, though, this one didn't end up shuttered. 
Goodyear instead invested $125 million to transform it into the company's 
flagship technical center. Now, nearly 1,000 engineers, scientists and others 
with advanced training work there designing and evaluating new tires. Goodyear 
has been using computer-aided design since the 1960s, but thanks to spectacular 
advances in computing power during the '80s, specialists at the tech center can 
test "virtual" tires, even using data that emulates the suspension of a 
specific automobile. Sophisticated what-if analyses are suddenly possible, and 
custom-designed new tires can be produced in vastly less time. But don't expect 
to walk into a job there with nothing but a high school diploma. Nowadays, 
practically everyone who works at the World War I-vintage facility has computer 
skills. Bill Egan, Goodyear's chief engineer of product design, says the 
building today has more computers than staff. 
</P>
<P>
 So U.S. manufacturing didn't die during the '80s; it merely adapted, and 
necessarily so. What about all the other articles of belief about the American 
economy during the decade? Rapacious corporate raiders dismembered healthy 
companies and destroyed jobs and communities. 
</P>
<P>
 True, $1.3 trillion in corporate assets changed hands, and a lot of unpleasant 
people made a fortune in the process. But they did us all a favor by getting 
U.S. companies out of the conglomerate game, as managers recognized at last 
that in order to make money you actually need to know something about the 
business you're in. Accordingly, most of the takeovers were friendly. The 
threat of hostile takeover did help awaken complacent managements, and hostile 
takeovers helped redeploy assets more efficiently. But they didn't cost many 
jobs. A University of Chicago study of the hostile takeovers from 1984-86 found 
that only 2.5% of the workers at acquired companies were fired. That group was 
disproportionately white collar -- folks whose unemployment rate is generally 
low -- and total layoffs among those companies came to only 26,000. Junk bonds 
and fraud brought on the savings-and-loan crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 The savings and loans collapsed because Uncle Sam, in an attempt to save a 
dying industry, deregulated how thrifts could invest and what interest they 
could pay without removing the federal guarantee of deposits. The taxpayers 
thus took on all the risk. More than 75% of the junk-bond exposure was 
concentrated in only 10 thrift institutions. On the other hand, junk bonds 
funded trailblazing companies such as MCI Communications and Turner 
Broadcasting. And they provided capital for aggressive newcomers to shake up 
slothful corporations. If you think junk bonds are discredited relics, consider 
that the face value of junk bonds issued in 1993 was far greater than in any 
year during their supposed heyday. Social spending was cut to the bone during 
the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, social spending grew. Housing subsidies for the poor, for instance, 
steadily increased under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush. Welfare? It 
didn't keep pace with inflation but fell behind at a slower rate than in the 
'70s. Public education? Even allowing for inflation, spending per pupil rose 
29% in the '80s. What changed is what we expect from the schools and the kids 
we send them. Today's schools must cope with more languages, more single-parent 
households, more TV and more permissive child-rearing. What changed, in other 
words, was us. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At this point it's fair to ask, if the '80s are so widely misunderstood, why 
should this be so? Were not the machinations of Wall Street important? Was 
there no spirit of selfishness in the land? Didn't Reagan matter? The answer, 
of course, is yes on all counts. The Reagan Administration, in particular, left 
us with staggering deficits that would have been hard to imagine previously. 
Yet American governments in the '80s had little to do with the computer, 
communications, biotechnology, family and personal-rights revolutions that 
drove domestic change during the period. 
</P>
<P>
 The gap between rich and poor increased in most of the industrialized world 
during the '80s, although nowhere as much as in this country. The Reagan 
Administration did weaken trade unions and keep down the minimum wage. Federal 
tax policies also contributed. Yet by far the biggest factor in growing 
economic inequality was the ever-higher compensation paid for knowledge and the 
poor wages paid for physical labor, as opposed to the gains on stocks, bonds or 
real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 Why wages got more and more unequal isn't well understood; the most likely 
culprits include changing technology; an increasingly global economy in which 
goods, people and capital move more freely than ever, and changes in the work 
force. Even scholars such as Harvard's David M. Cutler, formerly with the 
President's Council of Economic Advisors, and Gary Burtless, at the 
Democratic-oriented Brookings Institution, acknowledge that this development 
would have arisen no matter who was President. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, for example, fruit and vegetable farming continued to expand 
during the '80s as America's appetite for fresh produce grew. Yet despite the 
increased demand for agricultural workers, inflation-adjusted wages fell 18% 
during the decade, according to Don Villarejo, executive director of the 
nonprofit California Institute for Rural Studies. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Farm Workers ascribes the wage fallback to the pro-management 
stance of the state Agricultural Labor Relations Board under former Gov. George 
Deukmejian. But an even bigger factor was the Mexican economic restructuring of 
the 1980s, which sent rural migrants pouring north into the fields of 
California. Villarejo and others say that the number of workers just increased 
too fast, driving down the price of labor. Philip L. Martin, an agricultural 
economist at UC Davis, says flatly, "The answer is illegal immigration adding 
to the supply of labor and changing the wage structure." 
</P>
<P>
 One primary reason that the '80s are the misunderstood decade is that the 
media and the intelligentsia are Democrats by affiliation and agnostic in their 
view of commerce. Capitalism -- the word itself seems a kind of expletive in 
our mouths -- makes us flinch. Its amoral nature, its emphasis on 
self-interest, its happy readiness to reward the unworthy, all make us 
squeamish. The corruption of men like Boesky and the outrageous pay of many 
corporate chieftains repel us. Among opinion makers, there is also a tendency 
toward guilt, perhaps as a result of a tenured niche funded by some merchant 
prince, or a consciousness that the life of the mind beats clawing out a living 
in a factory or office. Growth is regarded with intense suspicion, and thus the 
'80s, an era of growth, are suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of this thinking reflects a distinct remove from purposeful wealth 
production. Writers and other opinion-makers pay more attention to government, 
or more precisely, politics, magnifying its importance through a distorting 
lens. Michael Walzer has observed that many intellectuals on the left believe 
"that if you get the politics right, the economics will follow." He wisely 
added that "this is a big mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 It would be just as great a mistake to cling to the notion that the '80s were 
a time dominated by some greedy "others." In fact, during the '80s we learned 
to accept a world in which America is more integrated into a global whole, and 
in which markets must be allowed to function if we are to have any hope of 
prosperity. We also learned, by and large, to get comfortable with our progress 
toward ever-greater individual freedom, whether that implies marriage between 
two men or boundless opportunities for moneymaking, for those so inclined. 
</P>
<P>
 What was really so bad about the '80s was an excess of personal freedom. In 
the '90s, we'll have to recognize that the odd thing about freedom is how, at 
the extreme, it comes to resemble its opposite. Think of gridlock on the 
freeway: everybody free to drive but nobody able to move. The trick will be 
finding the courage to give up a little individual freedom so that all of us 
can be freer together -- of the consequences of neglected children, for 
example. That is a tall order; the campaign season that just ended showed how 
adept our political system has become at telling us what we want to hear. What 
we don't want to hear about, especially those of us who can afford it most, is 
sacrifice.

FILM CLIPS / NOIR CZAR: JOHN DAHL ON MAKING A KILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Richard Natale 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When John Dahl first moved to Los Angeles from his native Billings, "people 
here thought Montana was a part of Canada," he observes in a flat Western 
deadpan. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that it's become a chic getaway for Hollywood celebrities, Dahl likes to 
torture people with stories "about how rotten it is there." 
</P>
<P>
 His unique brand of soft-spoken irony and that wide-as-the-open-skies 
country-boy visage could explain why Hollywood hasn't been able to quite get a 
handle on Dahl's three wry films noir: "Kill Me Again" starring Val Kilmer and 
his wife, Joanne Whaley-Kilmer; "Red Rock West," with Nicolas Cage, and "The 
Last Seduction," starring Linda Fiorentino and Bill Pullman, which has averaged 
more than $9,000 per screen since opening two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Variety critic and film historian Todd McCarthy calls Dahl's work "deliciously 
nasty" -- at turns menacing and amusing. Such inherent stylistic contradictions 
have initially caught more than one film executive off guard. "Dahl just 
doesn't look the type," says "Seduction" producer Jonathan Shestack. "His 
demeanor is extremely placid, controlled. He's very pleasant. Then he makes 
movies about tormented, psychotic killers. And he does it very well." 
</P>
<P>
 Audiences, however, have been ready to accept his work at face value -- when 
given the chance. Despite Hollywood's best efforts to sequester his movies, 
Dahl is fast developing a healthy cult following for his films noir.  
</P>
<P>
 MGM/UA basically threw away "Kill Me Again," he says, only to have it emerge 
as a sleeper on video. Propaganda became nervous about "Red Rock." "They kept 
trying to figure out what was wrong with it," he says. Fearful of its 
box-office chances, the company sold it directly to HBO. The movie was 
subsequently released in theaters, confounding all expectations by grossing 
more than $2 million -- unheard of for a film that debuted on the small screen 
and was already available on the video racks.  
</P>
<P>
 The same straight-to-HBO fate befell "The Last Seduction," a piquant tale with 
a thoroughly irredeemable and compelling heroine, the kind of woman who can 
safely be categorized a "bitch" -- and even revels at the moniker. As with "Red 
Rock," Dahl's latest effort first showed its moxie overseas, a possible portent 
of good things to come at the U.S. theatrical box office. 
</P>
<P>
 At 38, Dahl has worked in the film business long enough that he's not 
confounded by his idiosyncratic career trajectory. 
</P>
<P>
 For a time, he subsisted directing music videos while writing screenplays. He 
got lucky on script No. 7, "Kill Me Again," which he persuaded Propaganda to 
let him direct. 
</P>
<P>
 But in blockbuster-obsessed Hollywood, film noir has long been an endangered 
species. The genre intermittently sputters to life, as with Lawrence Kasdan, 
who brought it into the present with "Body Heat." David Lynch laced his noir 
"Blue Velvet" with lots of purple. And, most recently, Quentin Tarantino's 
"Pulp Fiction" puts its own anarchic spin on the genre.  
</P>
<P>
 But mostly, says Dahl, film noir is at the mercy of writers and directors who 
usually get it all wrong, stressing style over substance -- lots of rainy 
streets and smoky rooms. "When the audience is too aware of the style, it's 
deadly," says Dahl. Citing a quintessential noir classic, "Double Indemnity," 
by his idol Billy Wilder, Dahl says "style is not what drives that film. It's 
the psychology of the characters." 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor, he says, is that tabloid television has robbed noir of its 
exoticism. How can crime fiction compete with "America's Most Wanted," which 
presents true-life Gothic horror stories?  
</P>
<P>
 Like Lynch's "Blue Velvet," Dahl's plots center "on a moral guy in an immoral 
world. What the main character suffers from is an injustice or a self-imposed 
affliction and he tries to set his life straight." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, perhaps afraid that he may be sounding too highfalutin, Dahl interjects, 
"the element I like the most is betrayal and mistrust, the B-movie quality of 
that sleazy world." 
</P>
<P>
 And like Tarantino, Dahl douses the melodramatic flames with splashes of 
irreverent humor. In Dahl's case, much of the comedy comes at the expense of 
the hero's naivete. "It's a juggling act, alternating dramatic and funny. An 
actor like Nick Cage can be both at the same time. And I like to go along with 
the absurdity." 
</P>
<P>
 Dahl's the first to admit that there may be more than a tinge of autobiography 
in his heroes, men who find themselves simultaneously attracted to and trapped 
by their environments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it's because I'm from the West and have no street smarts myself, but my 
main characters are always guys who are trying to be the best they can be. And 
that makes them vulnerable to criminals, who prey on them."  
</P>
<P>
 Depending on how casting falls into place, Dahl will next start one of two 
films. The first, for producer Dino De Laurentiis, is Dahl and his brother 
Rick's rewrite of "Unforgettable," about a man wrongly accused of murdering his 
wife. The other, "When She Was Good," is a loose remake of "Niagara," a '50s 
suspense film that starred Marilyn Monroe and Joseph Cotten. The script has 
been updated to include more " '90s issues" such as white-collar crime and 
spousal abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked if he's afraid of being limited by pigeonholing as a film noir 
director, Dahl shrugs, "There are worse genres to be stuck in. I'm just glad to 
have the opportunity to make another movie."*

FILM CLIPS / SAY WHAT?: EXCUSE HER DUST -- AND HER ACCENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Judy Brennan 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many actors get slammed for bad accents or, in the case of Kevin Costner in 
"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves," not bothering to try one at all. But Jennifer 
Jason Leigh has been rapped for mastering an accent all too well. 
</P>
<P>
 Leigh nailed Dorothy Parker's affected, clipped mid-Atlantic brogue so well in 
Fine Line's forthcoming "Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle" that audiences who 
saw an early cut of the film -- especially at its world premiere at the Cannes 
Film Festival -- simply couldn't understand her. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker's snippy upper-crust delivery was her signature. Leigh, known for her 
thorough research of every part she plays, grabbed every tape of Parker's voice 
she could get her hands on to master her character's intonation. And master it 
she did. 
</P>
<P>
 The result: Many of her lines had to be redubbed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is true we had to reloop some of the dialogue after we showed the film in 
Cannes," said Ira Deutchman, president of Fine Line Features, which is 
releasing the film later this month in New York and next month in Los Angeles. 
"We had to make it more understandable. Dorothy Parker had a habit of dropping 
off the end of her sentences. It was one affectation we had to correct." 
</P>
<P>
 Some who saw one redubbed version at a screening in New York say Leigh's mouth 
doesn't quite match the dialogue in parts. But director Alan Rudolph, who 
praised her performance, said those glitches have been resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really think people are making a molehill out of a flyspeck," Rudolph says. 
"Whether she's understandable or not is in the ear of the beholder. The 
problems with the sound had nothing to do with Jennifer's accent. She looped at 
most 40 lines, which took her about an hour, while the average film takes four 
or five days of looping. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem was that, in the beginning of the film, we had bad raw stock and 
there was a lot of static. That included all of the scenes in the Algonquin 
Hotel," he says. "We didn't know that until later. But an actor can't win with 
an accent. If Jennifer had just done a flat voice, guess what criticism we 
would hear?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rudolph had heard complaints that Leigh's Katharine Hepburn-esque accent as 
the brash reporter in "The Hudsucker Proxy" was grating, but hadn't seen that 
film. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is not the case in this film," he says. "Jennifer isn't just some 
actress coming in to play a role. She is Dorothy Parker." 
</P>
<P>
 Leigh, who is filming in Seattle, could not be reached for comment.*

CRAZY? MR. FISHBURNE BEGS TO DIFFER; LAURENCE FISHBURNE IS WRITING, DIRECTING, 
PRODUCING AND ACTING IN 'RIFF RAFF.' THE MOVIES CAN WAIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Laurence Fishburne knows people may wonder what he's up to. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have got to think I'm out of my mind to be going into a 99-seat house 
in the middle of L.A. to do a play," says the actor who received an Oscar 
nomination for his portrayal of Ike Turner in last year's "What's Love Got to 
Do With It." 
</P>
<P>
 "They must think I'm crazy. But you know what? That's OK. I love what I do." 
</P>
<P>
 With three movies coming out in 1995, Fishburne hardly needs -- or would seem 
to have time for -- a small theater gig. Yet he's directing, producing and 
acting in his own first play, "Riff Raff," opening Thursday at Hollywood's 
Theatre Geo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Riff Raff" is also the first project for Fishburne's new theater and film 
production company, Loa Productions. The actor is launching the venture in 
order to give himself more creative freedom and control. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started a production company for obvious reasons," says the charismatic 
Fishburne, seated in a dimly lit bar in the Hollywood Athletic Club. "I've 
always had a lot of ideas, and I just wanted a chance to implement them." 
</P>
<P>
 Fishburne, 33, also sees having an organizational structure as a way to grease 
the fast track toward hyphenate status. "I'm defining myself as an artist, 
saying this is where I'm coming from and this is what I want to do," says the 
writer-director-performer. "It's about being in this business long enough to 
realize that if I continue to be the hired gun, that's all I'll ever be. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some people that's fine, and I can understand it, because what I'm doing 
is a lot of hard work," Fishburne continues. "But I have always liked what I 
do, and I like to work hard at it. I know that in the long run it's going to 
pay off big time -- artistically, monetarily, spiritually and emotionally." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Fishburne also sees the production company as a hedge against career 
decline. "I don't want to be 45 years old and have been a hot actor when I was 
33 and have people going, 'Whatever happened to Fishburne?' " he says. "I'd 
rather be able to be a guy who has a property who can go to a studio or an 
independent and say, 'Hey, do you want to make this movie?' " 
</P>
<P>
 F ishburne knows well how the industry works. He began acting at the age of 
10, was cast in "Apocalypse Now" at 14, and has worked with many different 
directors. He has stepped in front of the cameras for his generation's most 
heralded African American talents, including Spike Lee and John Singleton, and 
is particularly remembered for his performance as a struggling father in 
Singleton's 1991 "Boyz N the Hood." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, it's partly the experience of working on predominantly African 
American projects -- such as those with Lee and Singleton -- that inspired 
Fishburne to create his own company. 
</P>
<P>
 In such a situation, there's a cultural shorthand that facilitates the work. 
"Working for somebody like Spike is like being at my grandmother's house," says 
Fishburne. "Working for John the first go-around was the same way, a 95% black 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the difference between eating at my grandmother's house and your 
grandmother's house," Fishburne continues. "You come to my grandmother's house, 
you know you're going to have certain things to eat on the table. You're going 
to be looking around like, 'Am I doing this right?' " 
</P>
<P>
 There is a sense of belonging. "It was nice for a change, not to be one of 
only five people of color on the set," Fishburne says of his first Singleton 
film. "There's stuff that doesn't have to be said. There're jokes that we get 
just because. But that doesn't mean we intentionally exclude anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately though, Fishburne thinks initiative is key. "Things (in the 
entertainment industry) are changing for each individual who goes about the 
business of creating change," he says. "You can sit and deteriorate or you can 
try to muster some movement and creativity." 
</P>
<P>
 And thanks to his own efforts, and those of others, there is progress. "I used 
to feel like the black guy," says Fishburne. "I've gotten over it. I don't 
worry about that anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet no matter how the film world treats him, Fishburne always feels at home in 
the theater. He has trod the boards in an array of Broadway, Off Broadway and 
regional productions over the years. He is closely associated with his work in 
August Wilson's plays, including his portrayal of the ex-con Sterling Johnson 
in "Two Trains Running," a Broadway role that earned Fishburne a 1992 Tony. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, it's a medium to which the actor is happy to return. "Theater is 
church for actors," Fishburne says. "This play ("Riff Raff") is (like) where I 
started -- in little black box theaters doing these little plays about little 
people who are inconsequential to the big picture." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet he didn't always get to play the roles he would have liked. "There's a 
bunch of plays that I never got to do because I was either too young or too old 
for the parts, like 'Slow Dance on the Killing Ground' and 'Dutchman,' " says 
Fishburne. "For 'American Buffalo,' I was the wrong color." 
</P>
<P>
 That, in part, is the impetus behind "Riff Raff." "I wrote one for myself," 
says Fishburne. "I'm starting (Loa Productions) with a play because it came out 
of me first. I've always known that I was going to write someday. I've been 
writing since I was 14 -- my own dialogue at least -- I just didn't realize 
that I was writing when I was." 
</P>
<P>
 Fishburne began writing "Riff Raff" when he was on location in Florida last 
summer, shooting "Just Cause" with Sean Connery. "I was writing in my journal 
and I started writing in two voices instead of one," he recalls. "I didn't know 
what to expect, since writing a play was something I'd never done." 
</P>
<P>
 The process, says Fishburne, was actually "much easier" than he would have 
anticipated. He began putting pen to paper last July 22 and had a longhand 
first draft completed by his birthday on July 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Set in the present in an abandoned apartment building on New York's Lower East 
Side, "Riff Raff" is a drama about three guys from Brooklyn who get trapped in 
the building together. 
</P>
<P>
 The tone isn't light. "I don't know if angry is the best word, but it's got a 
lot of emotional stuff in it," says Fishburne. "We find out who these guys are, 
why they're there and who they are to each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Fishburne's first thought was to have "Riff Raff" produced in New York, but 
the one place he had in mind wasn't interested. "I gave my script to George 
Wolfe at the Public Theater, and he said it wasn't what he was looking for 
right now," says the actor. 
</P>
<P>
 S o Fishburne decided to go ahead on his own. "I wasn't going to wait for 
somebody to give me the money to put my own play up," he says. "My play wants 
to go up tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 And given his means, that was no problem. "I've been fortunate enough to make 
enough money where I can afford to put it together myself," says Fishburne. "I 
figured I'd launch this myself because I don't trust anybody else to launch my 
stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 But, the actor is quick to note, the scale is modest. "I'm taking small bites 
here: a one-act play that's an hour and a half long, three actors and a 99-seat 
theater," he says. "Low overhead. Low everything. Nobody comes to L.A. to do 
theater, so I can do it small, find out what the problems are under a 
relatively low-pressure situation." 
</P>
<P>
 If there are obstacles, they may exist only in the minds of the audience. 
"Obviously people are going to have expectations of me as an actor and a writer 
and that's fine," says Fishburne. "I'm not competing with anybody. I'm just a 
guy who's got something in him who wants to say it. The reason to launch it in 
L.A. is because that's where I'm at now." 
</P>
<P>
 In the future, Fishburne sees himself writing more plays as well as developing 
film properties, both within Loa Productions and on the outside. Projects he 
currently has in the works include an option on David Henderson's biography of 
the late Jimi Hendrix, and Fishburne's own "Simple," a screenplay based on the 
work of Langston Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
 And he will continue to act in the theater. "August Wilson wrote all these old 
men," says Fishburne, "and I feel so much better now, because when I'm an old 
man, I'll have something to do as an actor."*

BACK IN THE U.S.S.R.; THE 21-YEAR-OLD KRONOS QUARTET CONTINUES ON ITS 
UNCONVENTIONAL TRACK. ITS 17TH ALBUM IS A LYRICAL JOURNEY TO THE FORMER SOVIET 
UNION. 
</P>

 A kind of multicultural convergence is under way in the name of music. Seated 
around the table in a Thai restaurant in Palms: a bearded composer from 
Uzbekistan and his interpreter, an Argentine composer by way of Boston, a 
record company representative in from New York and, at the center of this 
confab, a mild-mannered violinist and iconoclast from San Francisco whose 
ensemble has taken the music world by storm. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene might strike some as unusual, but all is well in the world according 
to the Kronos Quartet and its chief architect, first violinist and founder 
David Harrington. The specific agenda of this gathering is to talk about "Night 
Prayers," the quartet's 17th release on Elektra/Nonesuch and one of its 
strongest yet. This year's model consists of music mostly from what once was 
the Soviet Union, including works by Uzbekistani Dmitri Yanov-Yanovsky and 
Argentine Osvaldo Golijov, whose "K'Vakarat" features Russian cantor Misha 
Alexandrovich. They spoke over lunch and Thai iced coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 At the ripened age of 21, the Kronos Quartet has made its name synonymous with 
unconventional approaches to the conventional medium of string quartet music. 
Harrington, violinist John Sherba, violist Hank Dutt and cellist Joan 
Jeanrenaud have focused on 20th-Century works and, girded by an increasing 
financial stability and a feverish will to commission, built up a by-now 
massive library of new pieces written for the Kronos. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the search for the new has led them evermore into far corners 
of the world, beyond the traditional stamping ground of Western classical 
enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Said the increasingly itinerant Harrington: "What it takes in order to do the 
music that we play now frequently includes at least one translator and perhaps 
an ethnomusicologist. There are all kinds of things that are involved in being 
a musician in 1994 that I could not have even conceived of several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, it simply has to do with where your ear goes. As a musician, that's 
what you have. One experience somehow leads to another, and it's maybe only 
later that you find the connections. Sometimes, it's making recordings that 
allow you to explore those connections. I think that's something that this 
album is about." 
</P>
<P>
 The new album makes connections between the rough-hewn folkish strains of 
Tuvan "throat singers" to the Quartet No. 4 by respected composer Sofia 
Gubaidulina. Along the way, extra-string quartet guests include soprano Dawn 
Upshaw and recently celebrated Armenian duduk player Djivan Gasparian. 
</P>
<P>
 By sheer numbers and cachet, the Kronos Quartet can be called superstars of 
the classical world. "Pieces of Africa" (1992), with music by composers from 
African nations, is the group's best-selling album to date. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite any resemblance to pop music marketing in the Kronos camp, music is 
still the thing; don't expect them to "tour with the album" by focusing on 
material from the new release. This week, the group is coming to Southern 
California to present three different programs, including an evening devoted to 
the string quartets of Russian composer Alfred Schnittke at UCLA on Thursday. 
On Saturday, the group will give the world premiere of a new 10-movement 
quartet piece by John Adams at the Center for the Arts in Escondido. Staying in 
one place is against the Kronos ethos. 
</P>
<P>
 'N ight Prayers" might well be considered a logical exten sion of the "Pieces 
of Africa" concept -- call it "Pieces of the Former USSR." One clear 
distinction with the new collection of music, and a factor that will no doubt 
limit its commercial potential, is its generally somber, meditative surface. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, there are moments of incredible exhilaration on this album," 
Harrington allowed, "but no, it's not dance music. It's not the kind of music 
by which to kick back and have a beer. There is almost a sense of timelessness 
to much of the music on 'Night Prayers.' You can actually lose track of the 
beating of time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that it's a celebration of sound and of voices, the way voices can be 
united with strings, especially bowed strings." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the process of commissioning new works for Harrington involves 
creative collaborations and resourceful match-making. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found out that Djivan Gasparian actually lived in Los Angeles for a while," 
he said. "His sound is so exquisite, I just wanted to be in the same room with 
him as he played. We met a young composer from Armenia, Tigran Tahmizyan, who 
also lives in Los Angeles. The idea of bringing them together came up." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to working on commissions for ensembles mostly outside of his 
homeland, Yanov-Yanovsky scores experimental films in Uzbekistan. Despite 
influences and opportunities in the West, he feels compelled to remain in his 
native country. 
</P>
<P>
 There, he often communicates or collaborates with other artists and musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very important since all the republics are separated since the breakup 
of the Soviet Union," he said. "There is no information system. The information 
that does exist only goes through personal contacts." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Harrington: "That's one of the qualities that I've noticed in doing this 
album. Franghiz (Ali-Zadeh, a composer from Azerbaijan) knows (the album's 
Giya) Kancheli and Gubaidulina as well. If you look on the map, there are huge 
distances separating them, and yet the composers are very well aware of each 
other's music." 
</P>
<P>
 Yanov-Yanovsky explained that "before the breakup of the Soviet Union, the 
position of the composer was different. Many of them were forbidden public use. 
And since they were forbidden, that created additional interest. The public 
audience was interested in listening or getting inducted to the new music, like 
Gubaidulina or Schnittke. When the ban was lifted, the interest disappeared. 
This was not only in music. It was also in movies and the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is certain arts liberation now, but I don't know if it's good or not. 
Thinking about recent times, I can't think of a worthwhile novel or composition 
done. It seems that people don't know what or how to do it. Earlier, it was 
just very clear. There was a net, and an artist would choose whether to be on 
this side or the other side. When the net was lifted, it's difficult to choose, 
because you are not oriented for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Golijov is the only composer on the album not from the former Soviet 
Union, he has Russian ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes other music I don't understand, but Russian music I usually get the 
essence of," he said. "There must be something to that. If you were born in 
Kansas, then liking country music comes natural to you." 
</P>
<P>
 T he issue of nationalistic music is a touchy one. Harrington resists thinking 
of "Night Prayers" as a musical portrait. Yanov-Yanovsky said, fervently, that 
"people should just write music, not just Russian music, Uzbek music, Jewish 
music, whatever. I never targeted it before. I never wanted to put a name on 
it, to write Uzbek music." 
</P>
<P>
 To hear Harrington tell it, the Kronos Quartet was set into motion after he 
was exposed to George Crumb's anti-war opus "Black Angels" (which the quartet 
recorded in 1990). "When I heard that in August of 1973, I knew that I had 
heard my music. All of a sudden, I knew how I wanted to spend the rest of my 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 To the chagrin of some and the delight of many, the group departed from 
conventions immediately, in repertory and in stage attire, often favoring 
multicolored, multicultural garb over concert wear formalities. But Harrington 
denies that there was a grand scheme afoot: 
</P>
<P>
 "If you were to diagram or somehow write about the way we got to know each 
composer and each piece, it would be very natural and very organic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quite consciously, though, I thought it was important to move the center of 
quartet music out of Vienna. If you think about the origins of the string 
quartet, with Haydn, Mozart, Schubert, Brahms and then later Webern and Berg 
and Schoenberg, you could think that there's only one way of approaching this 
medium, or that it needs to come from only one place. It could seem like a very 
exclusive kind of music. 
</P>
<P>
 "That having been said, all of us in Kronos started out playing the earlier 
quartets. Webern was the first music that we ever played. So I feel very close 
to that music." 
</P>
<P>
 O n the one hand, the Kronos mandate for a steady flow of new works has 
immeasurably expanded the string quartet repertory. In Los Angeles last month, 
for instance, the Schoenberg String Quartet performed Louis Andriessen's 
classical be-bop piece "Facing Death," originally written for the Kronos. But 
there is also something self-enclosed about the Kronos world. Often, concert 
programs now consist entirely of works written for the group, to the exclusion 
of staples of the idiom, or even older works in the Kronos library. The 
emphasis seems to be on forward momentum, in a race against time and stasis. 
</P>
<P>
 In his travels, Harrington carries a treasured satchel of tapes and CDs of 
music by potentially commissionable composers. Talking later on the phone from 
his hotel in New York, before heading off to a European tour, Harrington 
described the significance of his satchel with typical explorer zeal: 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoy attracting tapes and CDs. I must, or else I'd get tired of carrying 
them around. It's life for me. Just to give you an idea of how it really works 
for me, one piece leads to another piece. You'll talk to a certain composer and 
somehow there will be an idea that will emanate from something else. I have 
meetings later today with two different composers, one from China -- a 
fantastic composer named Tan Dun. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's how our music happens. It's verbal, it's social. It's the texture of 
life."*

PRIVATE LIVES; A TRIP DOWN CELLULOID LANE; VIDEO COMPANIES ARE FINDING GOLD IN 
OLD MOVIES, MINING THEIR VAULTS TO SATISFY VIEWERS WHO WANT TO ACQUIRE 
TREASURED CLASSICS. BUT THE LIST OF WHAT'S NOT AVAILABLE IS A BIG PART OF THE 
STORY.

<P>
 Old is gold for video companies. Because movie buffs are collecting vintage 
flicks on tape in a big way, video companies are mining their vaults for 
celluloid nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
 MPI Home Video scored a big hit with this fall's release of the 1953 John 
Wayne Western "Hondo." Paramount Home Video has just released the 1934 Frank 
Capra comedy "Broadway Bill" and the 1950 remake "Riding High." 
</P>
<P>
 MCA/Universal Home Video recently brought out the 1946 Bing Crosby-Fred 
Astaire musical "Blue Skies," the 1937 Marlene Dietrich movie "Angel" and a 
collection of "Francis the Talking Mule" and Abbott & Costello comedies. 
Several companies are featuring lush gift sets of classics for the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 But plenty of classic films still are not available on video, including the 
1950 musical "Annie Get Your Gun," the 1965 "Othello," starring Laurence 
Olivier, and the 1943 Gary Cooper-Ingrid Bergman romance "For Whom the Bell 
Tolls." 
</P>
<P>
 The older films obviously were made before there was such a thing as home 
video, so there often are legalities to hurdle. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's something that people don't understand," says Corie Hazen, manager of 
marketing services for FoxVideo. "That's why a lot of the really strong movies 
aren't released -- for various reasons that could range from music clearance 
issues to other legal issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Those issues, says Hollace Brown, senior vice president, advertising and 
sales, for Paramount Home Video, "take quite frankly a while to research -- it 
is quite an arduous process." 
</P>
<P>
 Other times, there are holdups until a film can be restored to its original 
glory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been very careful in restoring all of our films, making sure all the 
footage is there, making sure it's the best quality," says Glenn Ross, senior 
vice president of marketing for Republic Entertainment Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 "If for some reason we can't get ahold of high-quality elements, we don't 
release it," Hazen says. "We try to add value features on all of the classic 
films and include behind-the-scenes footage and theatrical trailers and 
Movietone News whenever possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Says George Feltenstein, senior vice president and general manager of MGM/UA 
Home Video: "We put a great deal of care into how we transfer every thing. I'm 
proud of what we have been able to accomplish. . . . So many of the omissions 
that were gaping holes in our cinematic history a decade ago are just a couple 
of cracks now." 
</P>
<P>
 Companies look for star power when choosing movies for release: Actors who 
have lost their luster and films that did poorly at the box office are less 
likely to be chosen for video release. Some video companies shy away from 
black-and-white films. 
</P>
<P>
 "We research titles in terms of what's appealing on a timely basis," Hazen 
says. "If a director is having a resurgence in a certain year or there's an 
anniversary of a star or a director, we will consider one of those titles for 
release." 
</P>
<P>
 'W hat we are in the business of is publishing," explains Ben Feingold, 
president of Columbia/TriStar Home Video. Columbia's vintage films on tape 
include "It Happened One Night," "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington," "From Here to 
Eternity," "Lawrence of Arabia," "The Bridge on the River Kwai" and "The Guns 
of Navarone." 
</P>
<P>
 "These films have enduring value," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 MGM/UA Home Video was one of the first companies to tap into the vintage video 
market when it seriously began releasing old movies in 1987. Among its classic 
bestsellers are "The Wizard of Oz," "Gone With the Wind," "Singin' in the Rain" 
and "The Student Prince." 
</P>
<P>
 But with so many films now in release, the company has decreased the annual 
number of "new" old films from 100 to roughly 20 to 30. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've released so many titles already," Feltenstein explains. "Over 1,000 
titles are available from what I consider the 'classic' portion of the 
library." 
</P>
<P>
 Although plenty of movies are still available from the company's rich library 
of MGM and pre-1949 Warner Bros. films, he says, "it's just that there are many 
titles that would not be economically feasible for us to release. They are so 
obscure. There are just not enough people who would be interested." 
</P>
<P>
 MGM/UA "really kind of created the marketplace for classic films as a 
collectible medium," Feltenstein says. "One of the reasons we did it was out of 
necessity, because we've had such a cavalcade of different owners and 
managements that we haven't had a consistent flow of new rental product. The 
other (reason) is that we are the keepers of the world's greatest film library. 
We have an obligation to make those films available." 
</P>
<P>
 Republic Home Video was also an early pioneer. "Republic has a library of 
1,400 classic features," Ross says. "Beyond that, we have another approximately 
5,000 titles that Republic acquired." 
</P>
<P>
 Each month, he says, "we probably put out as many as six classic titles. Some 
of it is product that we have re-released in the marketplace because we've 
found extra footage or we have created a collector's edition or anniversary 
edition. We're looking for ways to add value and find a new audience." 
</P>
<P>
 Ross believes that the rise in the market is due to the fact that films are 
more affordable (they generally sell for less than $20) and are more readily 
available. "There were not a lot of stores that offered videocassettes for 
sale," he explains. "Now there are more places to buy them." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Paramount's Brown: "You've a big group of consumers out there who like 
the notion of buying movies and collecting them. They just don't do it for 
children. It has extended to people who have their emotional favorites." 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount can tap into its library of all Paramount silent movies and features 
made after 1948. (MCA/Universal owns all pre-1949 Paramount films.) 
</P>
<P>
 FoxVideo is a newcomer in the field of old movies. The company didn't pursue 
that market until it moved from New York to Los Angeles three years ago. 
Fox-Video's Studio Classics line releases a classic film the first Wednesday of 
each month. Titles released in recent years include "Anna and the King of 
Siam," "Laura," "Jane Eyre," "A Letter to Three Wives" and "I Was a Male War 
Bride." Fox's Hollywood's Golden Age lines feature collections of films 
featuring such studio stars as Tyrone Power, Alice Faye and Sonja Henie. 
</P>
<P>
 Video companies are well aware of consumer demands and requests for movies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Consumer mail and consumer requests are what drew our attention to the fact 
that we ought to be mining our catalogues," Hazen says. "The Studio Classics 
line was born out of that demand." 
</P>
<P>
 FoxVideo has also given fans a voice with its FoxVideo Movie Club, which was 
founded nearly three years ago. The 300,000 members of the free club are given 
the opportunity to cast their votes on what movies they want to see on video. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a way to give consumers a voice and a direct line to the studio," she 
says. "The voting is very successful." 
</P>
<P>
 Witness the impending release of "Anastasia," the 1956 drama that won Ingrid 
Bergman her second Oscar. "It is one of the most highly requested films in our 
history," Hazen says. "For a number of reasons we were unable to release it, 
but we are releasing it in 1995."* Missing in Action

IDEA MAN HOLDS THE KEYS TO THE KINGDOM; DISNEYLAND: THE NEW THEME PARK 
PRESIDENT HAS A RARE COMBINATION OF BUSINESS ACUMEN AND ARTISTIC INVENTIVENESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The longer Paul Pressler stared at the rendering for a stuffed toy of Simba, 
lion cub hero of Disney film "The Lion King," the more he realized that 
something wasn't quite right. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the eyes -- they lacked the empathetic spark Pressler wanted. So he had 
them changed. 
</P>
<P>
 And when the Disney executive began fiddling with the look of a new Disney 
Store, he went again for the heartstrings, designing showrooms to re-create 
great moments from "Snow White," "Fantasia" and the studio's other animated 
classics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our characters are so emotional. They exude emotion to our guests," said 
Pressler, the Disney Stores chief who was promoted last week to become 
president of Disneyland. "Our really unique selling proposition," he said, is 
about "selling emotion." 
</P>
<P>
 That understanding has built Pressler's reputation within Walt Disney Co. as a 
walking idea machine with an intuitive sense of what is special about the 
company's characters and stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the 38-year-old Pressler is being asked to take on one of the company's 
toughest challenges. As Disneyland enters its 40th year, the park has been 
searching for a high-profile manager to reinvigorate Walt Disney's creation and 
cope with lower attendance, friction over cost-cutting and deterioration of the 
surrounding urban neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, after tantalizing the local community with images of a $3-billion 
theme park and hotel expansion, Disney is now scrambling to downsize its 
dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a huge job," said former Anaheim Councilwoman Miriam Kaywood, but 
Pressler "has apparently proved himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Pressler starts as an unknown inside the close-knit world of Disneyland. His 
task is made all the more difficult by what are sure to be inevitable 
comparisons to the enormously popular Jack Lindquist, who started at Disneyland 
the year it opened and remains a fixture in Orange County political, sports and 
charity circles. 
</P>
<P>
 The former toy industry executive will not only lead Orange County's largest 
employer, which at its summer peak employs about 12,000 people, he must also 
wrestle with the political pressures of deciding the fate of Disney's resort 
proposal, which would add a new theme park and potentially thousands of new 
hotel rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 So who is the new king of the Magic Kingdom? The portrait that emerges from 
interviews with friends and colleagues is of a self-effacing, energetic Disney 
devotee known for a rare combination of business acumen and artistic 
inventiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressler is a "talented, creative business executive . . . (who) nurtures 
great ideas and knows how to see them through," Disney Chairman Michael Eisner 
said in appointing him to his new position. Pressler is capable in the roles 
that Eisner holds dearest: diplomat, number-cruncher and carnival barker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I have a unique talent for drawing the best out of people and 
inspiring them to bigger and better things," Pressler said. "Somehow I just see 
things, and I get sparked by new ideas and take off on new tangents. I never 
accept anything for the way it works." 
</P>
<P>
 Pressler also has the endorsement of predecessor Lindquist, who praises him as 
"an entrepreneur, an outstanding marketing guy. He'll make everybody forget 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Known for his easygoing manner, Pressler is happier at home with his wife and 
children and a stack of videotaped movies on a Friday night than working the 
social circuit, said friend and colleague Steve Burke, now chief operating 
officer of Euro Disney in France. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you had to rank his priorities, No. 1 would be his family, and No. 2 would 
be his business," Burke said. Nowhere on that list, he said, is reaching for 
the next job. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressler is "a guy who really keeps his ego in check," said veteran toy 
company executive Bruce Stein, now working on interactive entertainment 
possibilities with Hollywood mogul Peter Guber. 
</P>
<P>
 A Long Island native, Pressler attended the State University of New York at 
Oneonta, a small campus outside of Albany, as an economics major. "He was a 
fairly bright student," said one of his professors, Robert Carson, noting that 
Pressler graduated in the top 10% of his 1978 class. "An affable, friendly 
guy." 
</P>
<P>
 His first job out of college was working as an urban planner in New York City. 
After six months, Pressler said, he was ready to try something else. Choosing 
among the jobs offered by a search firm, he went to work for Remco Toys, a 
small toy maker in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressler loved his new job. "It was a terribly creative business," he recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 His big break in the toy industry came in 1982 when he interviewed for a 
position at Kenner-Parker Toys, then a subsidiary of General Mills. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was just incredible," said his boss, Carole MacGillvray Rappeport, who now 
operates a toy consulting company in Santa Barbara. "He not only had some toy 
experience, he was just so personable. He is one of these people you meet for 
the first time and you say, 'This guy is a total winner.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He was hired on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
 At Kenner-Parker, where he was vice president of marketing, Pressler was known 
for exploiting the licensing possibilities of the Care Bears, a hit teddy bear 
collection produced in conjunction with a line of greeting cards. He also 
became executive producer of the "The Care Bears Movie." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Pressler's unit was dissolved when the company decided that its 
efforts duplicated those of the major divisions: Kenner toys and Parker Bros. 
Pressler received several interesting offers, including ones from Mattel Inc. 
and Walt Disney Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Rappeport said she urged Pressler to take the Disney job, suspecting that "a 
whole new world would open up" for her star manager. 
</P>
<P>
 He did so, joining Disney in 1987 to oversee product licensing. "He had a rare 
combination of creative sense and business skills," said former supervisor 
Steve McBeth, head of the group creating computer games for Disney. 
</P>
<P>
 "He can pick up a (stuffed toy) and say how to make it better," McBeth said. 
"He picked up a Mickey plush and, by moving its hands across its face, he could 
make it cuter." 
</P>
<P>
 But Pressler really distinguished himself by crafting a deal between Disney 
and former suitor Mattel. He was the force behind an agreement linking the toy 
and entertainment giants to design and market a preschool line that could 
compete against such strong brands as Fisher Price and Playskool. 
</P>
<P>
 "I recognized we had a tremendous asset in our characters," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The joint effort was a big success, and today Mattel sponsors the It's a Small 
World attraction at the Anaheim theme park, which stocks the line of preschool 
toys at a gift shop at the ride's exit. 
</P>
<P>
 That successful deal caught the eye of Barton K. (Bo) Boyd, president of the 
consumer products division, who tapped Pressler to run the Disney Store chain, 
which today has 335 locations in eight countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is full of ideas," Boyd said. It was Pressler, he said, who realized how 
the company's famed Imagineers could be brought together with merchandising and 
construction employees to redesign the prototype Disney Store at the Del Amo 
shopping mall in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressler explains that he "wanted to make it more entertaining by utilizing 
more storytelling and segment the merchandise by age. We took the Disneyland 
concept of 'separate lands' and applied it creatively" to break the store into 
separate sections for adults, children, collectors and gift buyers, with each 
section centered on a different Disney movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Unveiled a couple of months ago, Pressler said, the redesign has already 
proved to be a winner and will be adopted in other units of the chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressler insisted that Disney-themed merchandise portray characters in 
memorable moments. At Pressler's urging, a clock maker put one of its 
timepieces inside the belly of a miniature crocodile, a scene from the Disney 
classic "Peter Pan." (The clock lights up when the croc's nose is touched.) 
</P>
<P>
 Pressler lives in upscale Pacific Palisades with his homemaker wife Mindy, 
8-year-old son, Sean, and 4-year-old daughter, Jordan. And he has become 
friends with television personality Bob Saget, who lives nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have very good neighbor karma," said Saget, whose 5-year-old daughter is 
Jordan Pressler's best pal. 
</P>
<P>
 They have become such good friends that the thought of Pressler having to move 
away to be closer to his new job is traumatic, Saget said. The Presslers are 
considering a move to Orange County but haven't made a decision yet. "There is 
going to be such drama around here," Saget said, if it happens. 
</P>
<P>
 The two families celebrate holidays together and share each other's triumphs 
and setbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Saget, star of ABC's "Full House," said that when his sister died five months 
ago of a rare disease his friend came to his aid. Besides offering consolation, 
Pressler arranged for Disney to support a charity fund-raiser after the death, 
and he personally bought several expensive items at a silent auction to raise 
funds for research on the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressler also finds time for other charity work, including being a board 
member of the Big Brothers of Greater Los Angeles. Being in the toy industry, 
he said, "I always felt passionately . . . that I wanted to give something back 
to kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Saget said Pressler cares for others but remains devoted to his job. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a full company man," Saget said. "Whatever haircut you have to have, he 
has it." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite never having visited Disneyland until he joined its parent company 
eight years ago, Pressler thinks "complementary skills" will see him through a 
transition into the presidency of the theme park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I manage by walking around," he said, and will be "pumping up people with 
great ideas." He is passionate about courtesy and helpfulness to customers -- 
qualities he drilled into the 6,000 workers of the Disney stores. 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledges that he doesn't know much about the mechanics of theme park 
operations but says he can lean on the rest of his management team until he 
learns himself. "If I had to do it alone, it would be very scary," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He won't be alone, and he already has plenty of supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "No question they need a strong marketing man down there," said Boyd, himself 
a Disney theme park veteran. "They have got an incredible talent for that 
position." 
</P>
<P>
 As for winning over Disneyland's managers and employees, Boyd said, "he will 
fit in in about 30 seconds."

OOZE CRUDELY REBUKES RUSSIAN DENIALS ON OIL SPILL; ENVIRONMENT: ARCTIC 
VILLAGERS WATCH OIL FROM LEAKING PIPELINE SEEP INTO WATERWAYS. OFFICIALS 
DOWNPLAY DISASTER. 
</P>

 Oil coats the hulls of fishing boats in the ice along the banks of the Pechora 
River. In bays and inlets near this Arctic Circle village of reindeer farmers 
and salmon fishermen, frozen oil droplets fleck the ice. 
</P>
<P>
 The black crude is a greasy rebuke to Russian officials, who insist that the 
majestic Pechora -- and the rich fishing grounds that stretch to the Arctic 
Ocean -- have not been polluted by this country's largest oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
 This autumn, the people of Ust-Usa watched helplessly as thousands of tons of 
oil began oozing into the vast watery network that flows from the desecrated 
oil fields of Usinsk into the Pechora, then 450 miles north through the tundra 
to the Barents Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Fishermen say the oil traveled at least 70 miles downstream before the Pechora 
began to freeze. The riverside meadows in Ust-Usa where cattle fatten each 
summer are befouled, they say, and the few fish that swam upstream this fall 
reeked of petroleum and were inedible. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the 2,500 villagers are bracing for spring, when the oil-drenched marshes, 
streams and rivers that feed the Pechora will melt. Unless the oil is excavated 
from frozen swamps before the thaw, the people of Ust-Usa expect a slimy deluge 
that could wipe out their way of life. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they (officials) say it's just a miniature, local catastrophe, they are 
only fooling themselves," said Viktor Obaidakhanin, an Ust-Usa police major. 
"We are all living on this one small planet." 
</P>
<P>
 And the damage continues. Earlier this month, journalists and 
environmentalists discovered more fresh oil hemorrhaging from three new 
ruptures in the decrepit Usinsk oil pipeline network. One huge leak, captured 
on videotape by the environmental group Greenpeace, gushed about 13,000 tons of 
oil, Russian scientists say. 
</P>
<P>
 In a practice once typical of Soviet oil fields, cleanup crews tried to get 
rid of the oil by setting it afire, sending up huge black clouds of toxin-laden 
smoke that hovered darkly on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 Yevgeny Grunis, industry minister of the autonomous Republic of Komi, where 
Usinsk is located, has denied that any new spills have occurred. Other 
officials said the oil had been spilled in August but only now set ablaze. 
</P>
<P>
 The videotape, however, shows a vast black lake of oil, not yet solidified nor 
covered by snow. At another site visited by journalists this month, tarry pools 
of oil had oozed over the fresh snow, and cleanup workers said the pipeline had 
leaked there two days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The story of the Usinsk oil spill is a familiar Third-World tale of 
environmental pillage and official indifference, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "They get the wealth from our earth, they sell it, and instead of improving 
the lot of the local population, they ruin our lives," Obaidakhanin said. 
"Those in power spit on the people." 
</P>
<P>
 The oil spill began in July, when 23 separate leaks sprang in a 30-mile 
pipeline owned by Komineft, a former state-owned oil giant based in the city of 
Usinsk. 
</P>
<P>
 Komi officials say 14,033 tons were spilled, while Western estimates range up 
to 270,000 tons. If Western sources are correct, the accident would be about 
eight times the size of the Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 "The debate about how much oil spilled is academic," Greenpeace biologist Paul 
Horsman said. "This is the largest of many spills that have occurred here, and 
there is going to be major environmental damage." 
</P>
<P>
 The spill was discovered Aug. 23, when members of the Usinsk Ecology Committee 
flying in a helicopter noticed a huge blotch of oil in a swamp north of the 
city, committee head Sergei V. Zhunyov said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials called a meeting of Komineft and the seven other companies -- 
three of them Western -- that use the 22-year-old pipeline, a decaying facility 
that all sides agree should have been scrapped at least four years ago. But the 
oilmen refused to shut the pipeline for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They gave many reasons for not wanting to shut it down," Zhunyov said. "If 
they had done it sooner, maybe this tragedy could have been avoided." 
</P>
<P>
 Komineft officials promised to have a new pipeline completed by December, and 
the city agreed to allow the old one to keep operating until Sept. 6, while a 
bypass was being readied. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Sept. 5, the pipeline sprang another massive leak. Thousands of tons 
gushed into the Palnik-Shor creek, blackened the Kolva River and moved into the 
Pechora. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, workers at Palnik-Shor were using an excavator to smash 
the ice, scoop congealed oil from the frigid water and pour the black gunk atop 
a heap of dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers said the oil recovered from areas near roads will be reprocessed 
whenever possible, but in remote areas it will be burned. Western 
environmentalists shudder at the prospect of giant clouds, laced with toxic 
hydrocarbons, blanketing the tundra. 
</P>
<P>
 As temperatures plunged to 15 degrees below zero Fahrenheit this month, the 
struggle to clean one 20-foot-square pit looked haphazard and excruciatingly 
slow. By official estimates, 66 acres have been contaminated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if they can remove even 50% before the spring melt, that will be very 
good," Zhunyov said. "They'll never be able to clean all of it. It will always 
wash into the rivers every time it rains." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenpeace, the Green Cross and other ecologists are calling for an immediate 
shutdown of the pipeline and an international effort to halt the spread of the 
catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
 Komi officials say they can handle the cleanup themselves -- and accuse 
Western companies of dramatizing the spill to sell expensive oil-spill cleanup 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 However, workers at Palnik-Shor were unsure they could finish the huge job 
before the thaw. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course we need international help," said Ivan V. Dorokhin, 43. "If we 
don't clean it up in time, the oil will be in Norway by spring." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the Kolva River is coated with more than a foot of frozen oil. Moose 
and bears fled the area long ago. But tundra swans, ducks and geese still nest 
in nearby marshes in springtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the gruff oil workers are praying that the migrating birds will not stop 
in Usinsk this year. Last week, they found the corpse of an oil-drenched Arctic 
fox. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorokhin and his comrades say the new capitalist oil companies care as little 
about the environment as their Soviet predecessors -- and far less about the 
oil workers. The laborers jumped, though, at the chance to earn $9.70 in cash a 
day from a cleanup company called Priroda, as Komineft has not paid their 
salaries in five months. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of money, the workers have been receiving coupons that are valid only 
at Usinsk stores that are supplied by Komineft. The coupons have been dubbed 
"Leonidovs" after former Komineft General Director Valentin Z. Leonidov. 
</P>
<P>
 The despised company scrip will buy food, soap, razor blades, cheap boots and 
other essentials. But Leonidovs cannot be used to pay a phone bill or buy a 
train ticket, and only one bread store in this city of 40,000 will accept them, 
said Natalia Nikolayevna, a 32-year-old shopper, who added: "If the kids get 
sick, I give them whatever medicine we still have left." 
</P>
<P>
 One oil worker complained that he had forgotten the taste of vodka. Another 
said he could not get Komineft to pay his back wages in cash in time for him to 
attend his mother's funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 Bitter about the turn their lives have taken since the fall of the Soviet 
Union, local residents say the Republic of Komi is under the political thumb of 
the oil company. They call the region "the Republic of Komineft." 
</P>
<P>
 Workers said that when Komineft was privatized, they wound up with just a 
handful of shares, while managers snagged thousands. Employees call it 
prikhvatizatsia -- a pun that combines privatization with the verb to seize.  
</P>
<P>
 "They only think of one thing -- how to line their pockets," said Vladimir P. 
Fedulov, 32, who operates the earthmoving machines. 
</P>
<P>
 He complained that Komineft pleads poverty when asked to build a new pipeline, 
pay its workers, buy spare parts or even supply lubricating oil for the 
equipment. But somehow the oil barons have the money to cruise Usinsk in shiny 
new Mercedes-Benzes. 
</P>
<P>
 "They think of us as slaves, not workers," Fedulov complained. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the spill, the oil company has demonstrated its political clout. 
</P>
<P>
 The former head of the Usinsk Ecology Committee, who told authorities and 
journalists he believed that Komineft had grossly understated the accident, 
promptly lost his job when the agency was "reorganized," said Valentina 
Semyashkina of the Committee to Save the Pechora. 
</P>
<P>
 The Usinsk Ecology Committee's Zhunyov, who survived the purge, confirmed that 
a "reorganization" had occurred but declined to discuss details. After a brief 
interview last week, he asked reporters to leave quickly, saying he was 
expecting a visit by security officials and did not want them to find a foreign 
journalist in his office. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian officials have dismissed worries that the spill will foul the Pechora 
or the Arctic Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Yevgeny Khailov, chairman of a commission that inspected the Usinsk accident, 
said "there is no oil" in the Pechora -- but even if there is, "it could have 
come from anywhere," the newspaper Argumenti i Facti reported. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Moscow press and Western media began crying cover-up, Komi officials 
suggested that American estimates of the oil spill had been deliberately 
inflated as part of what one TV broadcast called President "Bill Clinton's 
renewed doctrine of U.S. unconditional supremacy in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Komi officials have repeatedly suggested that Western oil companies 
exaggerated the size of the spill to drive down the price of Komineft stock, 
then bought up shares that had fallen to one-third of their earlier price. 
</P>
<P>
 The conspiracy theory appeared to have a wide following in Usinsk, where many 
suspect Western oil companies of making off with Russia's mineral wealth and 
leaving as little money as possible behind to rebuild the decaying Soviet-built 
oil infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ust-Usa residents said they would be happy to see Western oil companies 
pumping in their neighborhood, as long as the work was done cleanly. They say 
the oil industry has brought them nothing but harm. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they live 19 miles from vast natural gas reserves, villagers in 
Ust-Usa must heat their homes with wood they chop themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 For 20 years, authorities have failed to deliver on promises to run a gas 
pipeline to the village. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the longer oil development goes on, the slimmer nature's pickings. 
Locals depended on fish caught in the Pechora, berries and mushrooms picked in 
the Arctic wilderness. Now, villagers say the fish are disappearing, river 
water is no longer fit to drink, and the government turns a deaf ear to their 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 Valentina Svyatokho, an official on an Ust-Usa collective farm, recalled the 
magnificent catches of her childhood, when every villager had barrels 
overflowing with dried and salted fish. Last week, she said, a local could not 
even find enough fish to serve at his daughter's wedding. 
</P>
<P>
 "We miss our fish," she said with sorrow.

NEW LIFE CENTERS NAMED IN SUITS BY EX-PATIENTS; LITIGATION: LAGUNA-BASED 
CHRISTIAN THERAPY PROGRAM DENIES RESPONSIBILITY -- OR LIABILITY -- IN THE 
SEX-RELATED CASES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE MARQUIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 25-year-old woman says she was so confused and depressed two years ago 
that she couldn't function day to day. She'd cheated on her husband out of an 
inexplicable loneliness; she'd overdosed on codeine just to make the pain stop. 
</P>
<P>
 The television ad promoting Christian therapy offered her hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'Well, maybe they could help,' " she said. " 'I need to get back 
with God, to be the person I used to be.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, who lives out of state, said she telephoned New Life Treatment 
Centers and an intake worker urged her to come to Buena Park for inpatient 
treatment. Later, once she'd obtained health insurance coverage, she was told 
she qualified for a free plane ticket and a waiver of her 20% insurance 
deductible, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time, I thought, 'That's great!' ", the woman said. What she wanted 
"was spiritual guidance, some place to grow spiritually and get better." 
</P>
<P>
 What she got, she claims, was a devastating experience that derailed her 
marriage, dimmed her faith and dashed any hope she felt she had for a happy 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, the ex-patient sued New Life and a Buena Park hospital in which it 
operates, alleging a hospital-employed mental-health worker seduced her into an 
emotionally abusive sexual relationship. She is one of six former New Life 
patients in five years to formally accuse care providers they met in two New 
Life inpatient programs in Orange County with sexual misconduct or developing 
inappropriate, damaging relationships with patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Four lawsuits in Orange County Superior Court targeted the same mental health 
worker; another suit, now settled, alleged a male therapist had sex with a male 
patient who sought to rid himself of homosexual urges; and a criminal case this 
year ended in conviction of a therapist who impregnated a former patient. That 
patient also has sued the therapist, New Life and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of Laguna Beach-based New Life, which has advertised the Buena 
Park program on Christian radio as "Christians helping Christians" and "a safe 
place" for therapy, deny the organization bears any responsibility -- or 
liability -- in the cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Although New Life founder Stephen Arterburn admits three care providers 
developed "inappropriate relationships" with patients they met in New Life 
programs, he said the relationships did not take place during the patients' 
stays with New Life. The organization could neither have foreseen nor prevented 
what occurred outside the program, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arterburn maintains New Life offers a more secure environment than other 
psychiatric providers because of its spiritual orientation. "The idea that you 
would be safer in a Christian program is true," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The allegations, Arterburn said, come from "individuals with serious 
psychological and emotional problems" prone to distortion and driven by greed. 
Arterburn said New Life did all it could to protect patients by thoroughly 
checking the backgrounds of its care providers, giving patients every 
opportunity to register complaints, and barring workers accused of wrongdoing 
from its units and referral lists as soon as complaints arose. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't completely screen out human frailty," said New Life attorney John 
Loomis. 
</P>
<P>
 But from a Christian organization, plaintiffs said, they expected far more. 
</P>
<P>
 They were drawn to New Life precisely because they felt it promised something 
special: a safer, more comfortable environment in keeping with their spiritual 
values. As distressed people with an abiding faith in things Christian, several 
said, they were wide open to the most destructive sort of exploitation. New 
Life, their lawsuits allege, failed to protect them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was naive, thinking that most things labeled Christian are going to be 
down-to-earth, good, healthy things," said one disillusioned 22-year-old 
plaintiff, who like all other plaintiffs in this story spoke on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Therapy, by its very nature, is a secretive process: therein lies its promise, 
and therein its dangers. Experts say no institution, religious or secular, can 
guarantee safety to a patient in that intensely personal and private 
interaction, although careful training and monitoring can head off problems. 
</P>
<P>
 In nationwide anonymous surveys of more than 5,000 therapists, nearly 7% of 
males and 2% of females have admitted to sexual intimacy with patients -- rough 
estimates at best. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, the special vulnerability of therapy patients was recognized in 
a 1989 law, prohibiting therapists from having sex with them during treatment 
and for two years afterward. Patients often are attracted to their therapists, 
with whom they share their most intimate feelings, but it is up to therapists, 
under the law, not to take advantage of the attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 In New Life programs, advertised around the country on Christian radio and 
television, there was a promise -- implied or explicit -- of special 
protection, plaintiffs and their attorneys argue. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time I didn't trust the secular unknown," said a 29-year-old former 
Christian schoolteacher, impregnated last year by a therapist she met at the 
Buena Park program. "I was very simplistic in my thinking. . . . I only put my 
trust in Christian counselors." 
</P>
<P>
 Plaintiffs contend their faith was deliberately exploited by those seeking to 
seduce them. The 25-year-old out-of-state patient, in her suit, accuses New 
Life of fraudulent advertising. The religious message, she said, falsely led 
her to believe she would receive care in a "safe and secure environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, she said, "I don't trust anybody anymore. . . . I try to go to church now 
and trust the preacher, but I'm thinking, 'I can't even trust him. Who knows 
what he does' (after the service is over)?" 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't matter, several plaintiffs and attorneys said, that no sex occurred 
within the walls of the program. That is where the patients met the accused 
care providers who, according to several lawsuits, were improperly screened or 
supervised by New Life. And that is where the scheming and exploitation began, 
the former schoolteacher's suit alleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Arterburn said that New Life itself was "betrayed and victimized" by the three 
men accused of wrongdoing. Though New Life attorneys and its marketing director 
insist most of the allegations are unproven, Arterburn acknowledged in a letter 
to The Times that the three men developed "inappropriate relationships" with 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot stress enough how appalled and saddened we are by this," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 New Life attorney Loomis suggested the plaintiffs may bear some responsibility 
themselves, questioning their "possible roles" in "consenting to or encouraging 
the acts . . . for which they now say they'll gladly take money." 
</P>
<P>
 New Life took every precaution, Arterburn said, by providing intensive 
orientation, multiple layers of supervision and ongoing classes for workers, 
for example, and setting up a patient complaint line. The organization has a 
policy against touching patients. 
</P>
<P>
 The accusations, Arterburn said, are inimical to New Life's mission: to 
"empower . . . patients" who often are skittish about secular therapy, and help 
them overcome "victimization." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, New Life operates as The Minirth Meier New Life Treatment Clinics, 
having merged in January with nationwide Minirth-Meier Clinics, which is not 
named in the lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering that New Life has treated more than 11,000 patients at two Orange 
County programs since 1988, it has had few complaints, Arterburn said. 
Malpractice claims are so rare, he said, that New Life's insurance rates are 
lower than other psychiatric providers and drop annually. New Life officials, 
however, declined to provide any supporting documentation, saying the 
organization's insurance provider did not want rate comparisons made public. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Plaintiffs said they went to New Life assuming they had entered a safe harbor 
in their otherwise turbulent lives. Two patients said that coming to the 
realization that they were being hurt, not helped, was a long process. The two 
alleged they quietly engaged in sexual activity with their therapists for about 
a year before calling it off. 
</P>
<P>
 One, a young Riverside man then seeking to overcome homosexuality, said he did 
not come forward for months -- and even did testimonials for New Life -- 
because he had bonded with his therapist, John Lybarger, and feared he could 
not live without him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was completely blinded. . . . I was very needy and I was not connected with 
my feelings," he said. "He was the only one reaching out to me in a quite 
unconditional way." 
</P>
<P>
 The former Christian teacher said that before she became pregnant by therapist 
James Lisle, she believed his admonition that their relationship was a sacred 
covenant which it would be a sin to reveal, according to her testimony at 
Lisle's state disciplinary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Lybarger, who paid $115,000 in 1991 to settle the case against him, declined 
comment. Lisle, convicted in February of having sex with a former patient and 
sentenced to a year in jail, contends the relationship was consensual and 
occurred after treatment ended. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, experts say, patients commonly become unwitting conspirators in 
their own abuse, failing to come forward with complaints out of misplaced 
loyalty and love, or because they are ashamed. 
</P>
<P>
 Among therapists, outward signs of trouble can be subtle, said Andrea Celenza, 
a Massachusetts psychologist who treats errant therapists. Institutions need 
"alert and substantial" training programs to pick up on such signals as 
neediness or narcissism, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arterburn insisted Lisle and Lybarger gave no hints of being troubled. Both 
held marriage, family and child counselor's licenses and had clean disciplinary 
records with the state Board of Behavioral Science Examiners; both had 
malpractice insurance. Despite "lengthy and thorough" background checks by New 
Life, hospital credentialing committees and medical staff panels, no blemishes 
marred their records, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lisle had a past that the patient's lawyers contend New Life and Orange 
County Community Hospital in Buena Park should have known about. For 3 1/2 
years, Lisle said he was on staff for 3 1/2 years at the hospital, where New 
Life has a 50-bed program. 
</P>
<P>
 The 67-year-old therapist, who had been an independent contractor with New 
Life, candidly testified during his disciplinary hearing that he had been fired 
from his job as a welfare director in Ohio in the late 1950s because he 
impregnated a client he was counseling. And he said he was asked in 1969 to 
resign another position in California after his boss became aware he had a 
"love relationship" with a client, whom he later married. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking in a confident baritone at his September hearing, Lisle said he was 
hospitalized for nine months in an Ohio mental institution in 1958 after being 
"personally attacked" by demons. He said he was miraculously cured by a 
Christian psychiatrist, was "born again" and hasn't needed therapy since. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisle's sister, however, had told her brother's probation officer that he has 
suffered lifelong mental illness and had been diagnosed with paranoid 
schizophrenia. "Why doesn't anyone see how sick he is?" she asked, according to 
an April, 1994, probation report. 
</P>
<P>
 A state medical board investigator, also quoted in the report, said Lisle's 
affiliation with a Christian program was like "putting a fox in the hen house." 
</P>
<P>
 Arterburn and Craig Dummit, Orange County Community Hospital's attorney, said 
they first heardof Lisle's problems when he was arrested in October, 1993. He 
was immediately barred from the premises, they said, and later resigned from 
the hospital staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisle, Arterburn said, was "a master at hiding the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 Lisle only hinted at his past problems when he applied for a counselor's 
license in California in 1967, saying "there was an apprehension of an 
accusation of unfaithfulness" by his wife a decade before. But "the charge" was 
dropped, he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Syphax, acting executive officer of the state Board of Behavioral 
Science Examiners, said licensing authorities determined there was no criminal 
conviction involved and did not pursue the matter. An applicant would be much 
more rigorously screened today, Syphax said. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he cautioned, licensing means a counselor meets the minimum requirements; 
it is not a "Good Housekeeping seal of approval" assuring patient safety. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The other former New Life therapist accused in a lawsuit of sexual misconduct 
was a sexual addiction specialist, prominent in the therapeutic community and 
apparently well-respected by peers. In contrast to Lisle, Lybarger was not 
accused of a crime and had no record of past problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The first clinical coordinator of New Life's program at Western Medical 
Center-Anaheim, Lybarger came "highly recommended," Arterburn said. 
</P>
<P>
 The patient he allegedly victimized, then a 21-year-old husband and father of 
an infant, "was expressly solicited into the New Life treatment program for 
(treatment of) homosexuality," according to a letter from his lawyer in court 
files. But after completing a six-week stay in New Life in 1989, during 
follow-up outpatient care, Lybarger "proceeded to engage (him) in a totally 
unprofessional sexual relationship," according to the letter. 
</P>
<P>
 While the sexual relationship progressed behind closed doors, according to 
allegations filed in court, New Life "engaged" the young man to give 
testimonials about his treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 The patient was "commercially exploited" and his case history was improperly 
used in written materials, videotapes and public presentations to solicit new 
business, according to the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Arterburn said the young man was never told he could be "cured" of 
homosexuality. Rather, he said, the patient had "issues more pressing" than his 
sexuality, including a cocaine addiction. By all appearances, Arterburn said, 
he had been very happy with New Life and volunteered to do testimonials. 
</P>
<P>
 Arterburn said his first inkling of a problem came when the lawsuit was filed 
by the man and his wife in November, 1990 -- long after both the patient and 
Lybarger had left the New Life program. "I want to be very clear that nothing 
of a sexual nature occurred . . . while (the young man) was a patient in our 
program," Arterburn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Lybarger paid $115,000 to settle the case, New Life attorneys say 
they separately settled this year for less than $30,000, purely to avoid the 
costs of trial. Western Medical Center-Anaheim was named as a defendant but not 
served with a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Four other lawsuits against New Life programs and Orange County Community 
Hospital in Buena Park target a man who had no license to practice therapy at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, lawyers for the plaintiffs -- young women treated between 
January and September of 1993 -- contend mental health worker Gregory Rundhaug 
abused the therapeutic role with ruinous effects. 
</P>
<P>
 Rundhaug, three plaintiffs said, ran group therapy sessions and portrayed 
himself as a therapist. According to the lawsuits, he then tried to form sexual 
or other inappropriate relationships with the plaintiffs. New Life and the 
hospital, they allege, failed to properly supervise or stop him. 
</P>
<P>
 Rundhaug, a hospital employee who worked in New Life's 50-bed unit, seems to 
have disappeared, his attorney said. Rundhaug could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Arterburn said that Rundhaug did not work as a therapist. He was a "group 
facilitator" and led talks or gave lectures, not group therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 The mental health worker is accused in the lawsuits of forming so-called "dual 
relationships" -- liaisons with patients outside the context of therapy -- of 
using therapy as a guise for romantic overtures and, in one case, of having sex 
with a patient. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the women's suits contend Rundhaug used his experience with them as 
patients, their faith as Christians or their perception of him as a therapist 
to push them into dramatic -- and destructive -- changes in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit by the 25-year-old out-of-state woman, who came to the Buena Park 
program in part to work through emotions that led her to cheat on her husband, 
contends Rundhaug seduced her by leading her to believe sex was an "essential 
part of her therapy." 
</P>
<P>
 He "thought I was beautiful," the woman said. "That really made me feel good. 
Here he was, this therapist. He was respected. I thought, wow, he likes me out 
of everyone else. I felt like I kind of wanted to be with him. I couldn't wait 
to see him." 
</P>
<P>
 He is "one of these guys who knows what you want to hear. I wanted a closer 
relationship with God. . . . He told me about his relationship with God and 
quoted Scripture." 
</P>
<P>
 Rundhaug held "little (private) sessions" with her in the hospital, once 
kissing her in a locker room, she claims. After her second 10-day stay at the 
Buena Park program ended, she contends, he persuaded her to miss her plane home 
and have sex with him at his home. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, 1993, she said, after she had returned to her husband, Rundhaug 
sent her a plane ticket back to California. She stayed with him for about two 
weeks before deciding to try to salvage her marriage. "We're still married," 
she said, "but not really. We hardly talk. . . . It makes me feel very lonely 
and very guilty. . . . Even to this day, I think about suicide." 
</P>
<P>
 A 22-year-old woman, who came to New Life from Pennsylvania in January, 1993, 
after hearing an ad on Christian television, contends in her suit that Rundhaug 
took advantage of her "vulnerable mental state" by "inducing" her to live with 
him after her release. 
</P>
<P>
 During her stay at New Life, according to the woman's testimony in an October 
deposition, Rundhaug gave her Valentine's cards, met with her frequently in the 
courtyard and accompanied her on outings. "Logically, I think someone (from the 
hospital) should have known" he was behaving inappropriately, she testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Rundhaug sought her trust, she said in an interview, by telling her he was a 
therapist. Then, she contended, when she left her job and family back East to 
move in with him, he tried to start a romantic relationship. After she rebuffed 
him, she said, he kicked her out. 
</P>
<P>
 Rundhaug wasn't stopped, plaintiffs said, until three of them learned about 
each other's encounters with him, in part through mutual friends and the help 
of a New Life counselor. They said they made formal complaints around August, 
1993, to the program administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 Arterburn said that far from ignoring the problem, New Life helped the women 
make a videotape chronicling their complaints. Rundhaug, on vacation at the 
time, never returned to his job to answer the accusations and ultimately was 
fired, Dummit said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the videotape, Arterburn noted, none of the women say a sexual relationship 
occurred while they were under New Life's care. Until the complaints surfaced, 
New Life and hospital officials said, Rundhaug was considered an exemplary 
worker. He had a file "replete with letters from patients singing his praises" 
and a "near-perfect" three-month review, said hospital attorney Dummit, who 
also represents Rundhaug. 
</P>
<P>
 Dummit said Rundhaug may have violated hospital policy but did nothing illegal 
or unethical because the 1989 law and professional ethical codes do not apply 
to non-therapists. Regardless, he said, the hospital is not liable because the 
allegations relate to activities by Rundhaug off the premises and were "outside 
the scope of his employment." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The improprieties of three care providers, Arterburn said, should be seen in 
the larger context of an organization that over its six-year history has helped 
thousands of people "make dramatic changes for the better in their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Arterburn said he is "deeply disturbed" about a depiction of New Life drawn by 
people who are "attempting to get money from our company." A more accurate 
portrait, he said, would come from satisfied patients and employees who see 
their jobs as "a mission and a ministry." 
</P>
<P>
 But regulators and experts say a religious setting is no sure shelter from 
therapists or others who prey upon patients' vulnerabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Mixing religion and therapy can be "a powerful force for improving people's 
lives," said Syphax of the Board of Behavioral Science Examiners. But it can 
also can render patients "extra vulnerable" to exploitation, because the 
therapist is endowed, in the patient's mind, with extra credibility and power. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my work," Celenza said, "I have found it is not institutions that are safe 
or unsafe. It's the people" working inside. 
</P>
<P>
 * NEW LIFE THERAPY LAUDED: Combined psychiatric and spiritual therapy draws 
praise. A18 Therapy Warning Signs 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Consumer Affairs has developed a booklet titled 
"Professional Therapy Never Includes Sex" to help patients sexually victimized 
by psychotherapists. In some sexual-abuse cases, other inappropriate behavior 
comes first. While the therapist's behavior may be subtle or confusing, it 
usually feels uncomfortable to the client. Here are some warning signs: 
</P>
<P>
 * Telling sexual jokes or stories 
</P>
<P>
 * "Making eyes at" or giving seductive looks to the client 
</P>
<P>
 * Discussing the therapist's sex life or relationships 
</P>
<P>
 * Relying on a client for personal and emotional support 
</P>
<P>
 * Sitting too close or lying next to the client 
</P>
<P>
 * Inviting a client to lunch, dinner or other social activity 
</P>
<P>
 * Scheduling late appointments so no one else is around 
</P>
<P>
 * Giving or receiving significant gifts 
</P>
<P>
 * Providing or using alcohol or drugs during sessions 
</P>
<P>
 * Hiring a client to do work for the therapist 
</P>
<P>
 * Bartering goods or services to pay for therapy 
</P>
<P>
 * Any violation of the client's rights as a consumer 
</P>
<P>
 The booklet is available through the Medical Board of California at 1426 Howe 
Ave., Sacramento, Calif. 95825; or the California Board of Psychology at 1422

NEWS ANALYSIS; WILSON LIKELY TO FOLLOW 1ST TERM -- ONLY MORE SO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pete Wilson's second term as governor figures to be just like his first, only 
more so. 
</P>
<P>
 More welfare cuts. More criminal justice reform. More business tax breaks. 
More struggling to balance the budget. And perhaps more than just tinkering 
with the state's massive system of public education. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson often has said he left the U.S. Senate to run for governor in 1990 
because he thought he could make changes. Now, with a sweeping reelection 
victory behind him and his party poised to seize control of the state Assembly 
for the first time in a generation, the governor may have the chance to make 
good on some of the plans that eluded him during his first four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson made few explicit promises in the 1994 campaign, and he declined a 
request for an interview with The Times after the election to preview his 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 But a look back at the campaign and a review of the proposals Wilson has 
advanced since he took office in 1991 provide some solid hints of how a second 
Wilson term might look. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we intend is that there be a California of unparalleled opportunity and 
much greater personal responsibility," Wilson said the morning after the 
election, in which he defeated Democrat Kathleen Brown by a 55% to 40% margin. 
</P>
<P>
 To increase opportunity, Wilson wants to cut taxes on business and perhaps on 
individuals. He wants to make schools more accountable and give parents more 
power to choose among public schools for their children. And he wants to 
streamline the state's many job training programs to make them better serve 
those who need help entering, or re-entering, the labor force. 
</P>
<P>
 On the responsibility side of the ledger, Wilson will seek to expand the death 
penalty, further lengthen some criminal sentences and try to require all 
violent felons to serve 100% of their terms. He is all but certain to revive 
his proposal to remove poor families from the welfare rolls after two years, or 
perhaps less, if the head of household is able-bodied but not working. 
</P>
<P>
 And he will work to implement Proposition 187, the ballot initiative that 
denies most public services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Less clear is to what extent Wilson will respond to the groundswell across the 
country and in California for paring back the role of the state in people's 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, after all, has made his career in government, and during his first 
term he showed little inclination to slash it. He signed bills injecting more 
government, not less, into the affairs of individuals, including legislation 
requiring motorcyclists and young bicyclists to wear helmets, children to wear 
life vests while boating, and employers to ban smoking in their workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Wilson often boasted of eliminating more than 100 boards and 
commissions, most of the panelists were unpaid, met rarely and had the power 
only to advise. He resisted bipartisan efforts to eliminate entire departments 
or functions of state government -- such as the fire marshal -- that some 
lawmakers said were duplicative of local or federal programs. 
</P>
<P>
 And Wilson's interest in privatizing government has been limited to the 
highway department -- Caltrans -- where his Administration has favored the use 
of private engineers to design freeways. He has not joined those who offered 
more radical ideas such as farming out the job of the Department of Motor 
Vehicles to private entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican strategist Steven Merksamer said Wilson would do well to undertake 
a comprehensive examination of everything the state government does. 
Ironically, Democrat Brown made the same idea -- she called it a "performance 
review" -- a key part of her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 In a second Wilson term, Merksamer said, "the question has to be asked, for 
every state agency and department in existence today, is there a rational basis 
for its continued existence or support? That kind of review would be 
well-received by the public." 
</P>
<P>
 Others wonder whether Wilson has any interest in dismantling much of the 
government he will be running. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Wilson is a managerialist politician for the most part," said William 
Bradley, a Democratic political adviser and columnist who worked for Brown 
before parting company earlier this year. "He doesn't strike me as a radical. 
He as governor has done little to downsize government or re-create it. That's 
not to say that he might not have a mid-life conversion here." 
</P>
<P>
 After raising taxes by $7 billion in his first year in office, Wilson turned 
around and opposed major tax hikes in subsequent budgets. In 1993, he managed 
to roll back the tax burden a bit by enacting credits for businesses that buy 
manufacturing equipment. Now he says he wants to do more. 
</P>
<P>
 He may begin by trying again to win passage of tax cuts rejected by the 
Legislature this year, including a modest income tax reduction for low-income 
families and a $1,000 tax credit for each full-time job created by start-up 
businesses in California. 
</P>
<P>
 These proposals, which would return roughly $150 million to the taxpayers, are 
dwarfed by the governor's insistence that the state allow the expiration of a 
temporary income tax surcharge on individuals earning more than $100,000 a year 
and couples with incomes higher than $200,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The higher tax rates, adopted in 1991, are scheduled to lapse at the end of 
1995 -- at a cost to the state budget of nearly $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 If Wilson is serious about tax cuts such as these, he may have to entertain 
some of the ideas he was cool to in his first term. Even if reducing taxes 
stimulates the economy and provides more revenue to government -- as Wilson 
argues -- there is still likely to be a lag that worsens the short-term budget 
deficit unless he also cuts spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent statistics have shown that the economy is improving, and state tax 
receipts are climbing, too. But Wilson nevertheless will face a hole of roughly 
$2 billion when he delivers his next proposed budget on Jan. 10. His hope of 
closing that gap by extracting money from Washington for the cost of serving 
illegal immigrants is not necessarily any closer to fruition with the election 
of a Republican Congress bent on cutting federal spending. 
</P>
<P>
 One way Wilson could cut the state budget would be to revive his proposal to 
transform the welfare program. Although the governor's plan was rejected by 
voters in 1992, the Legislature later enacted parts of it and added ideas aimed 
at making it easier for recipients to move from the welfare rolls to a private 
payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 The state has cut basic welfare benefits 15% since 1991, but Wilson has said 
he would like to lower them further. Even more, he wants to sharply reduce 
benefits to anyone who has been on the program for six months or more, and 
perhaps eliminate the monthly stipends altogether after two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than his welfare proposals, though, Wilson has advocated few major cuts 
in government services. 
</P>
<P>
 He has asked the Legislature to eliminate several services that are part of 
the Medi-Cal program for the poor, including dental care for adults, podiatry, 
chiropractic care and acupuncture. But these services represent just a small 
part of the state's subsidized health care program, and Wilson has said nothing 
to indicate that he would want to eliminate such big-ticket items as 
prescription drugs or nursing home care or restrict eligibility for the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 In the other major areas of government spending -- prisons and schools -- 
Wilson wants to spend more, not less. 
</P>
<P>
 His prison budget is expected to soar with the implementation of the "three 
strikes" sentencing law. But another perhaps more expensive proposition has 
gotten much less attention: the idea of reducing or eliminating the credits for 
good behavior that have allowed prison inmates to cut their terms in half. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson won a partial victory on this front in 1994, reducing to just 15% the 
amount of time violent or serious felons can shave from their sentences. Next 
year, he said, he will try to wipe out the credits altogether for violent 
felons. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor also has taken something of a pledge not to cut the other 
big-ticket state government item: education. After being portrayed early on as 
anti-education, Wilson has said he would not reduce funding below the current 
level of about $4,200 per pupil. As enrollments grow, fulfilling that promise 
will cost the state several hundred million dollars per year. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson might want to use those budget increases to extract policy changes from 
the education Establishment, a task that may be easier now that the California 
Teachers Assn. has seen its Democratic partners lose power in the Assembly, 
where Speaker Willie Brown was a staunch ally. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson opposed the 1993 ballot measure that would have given parents 
taxpayer-paid vouchers to use in any public or private schools. But Maureen 
DiMarco, Wilson's secretary for education and child development, said the 
governor probably will push for expanding the number of chartered public 
schools, where teachers and parents create new programs free from almost all 
state regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor may also revive his interest in merit pay for teachers and his 
desire to give local districts more leeway to spend money now restricted to 
various special programs, known as categoricals. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said last week that he intends to pay "a great deal of attention" to 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is essential that our kids be in a position where in fact they are 
prepared for the job market and prepared to be the kind of citizens that they 
really ought to be," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The schools also will be the major battleground over the implementation of 
Proposition 187, which the governor has pledged to defend with vigor. Wilson's 
aggressive attack on the federal government over the issue was a turning point 
in his comeback from near political oblivion, and white voters supported him in 
droves Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say Wilson must now reach out to Latinos, who vote in small numbers today 
but are an increasingly large share of the state's population and may one day 
represent a larger portion of voters. Wilson won 35% of the Latino vote in 1990 
but 22% this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "He really has to make some peace with the Hispanic population," said Joel 
Kotkin, a fellow at the Center for the New West. "If the Republicans don't 
staunch the hemorrhage of the Latino electorate, they are going to pay for it 
in the long run."

PROPERTY OWNERS MAY BE FORCED TO RETROFIT; QUAKES: PLAN COULD AFFECT 100,000 
HOMES, APARTMENT BUILDINGS. IF MANDATORY, CITY WOULD INCLUDE FINANCIAL AID. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Aiming to lessen residential damage in future earthquakes, Los Angeles city 
building officials are proposing a massive and costly program that could 
require thousands of owners to strengthen their wood-frame houses and apartment 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Building officials are considering whether the retrofitting program -- 
potentially the most extensive ever undertaken in the city -- should be 
mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
 If a mandatory program is chosen, it would include financial assistance to 
ease the burden on property owners, who could be required to beef up 
foundations and walls at costs ranging from $1,000 to $18,000 per structure. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, which officials say could affect 100,000 or more structures, is 
expected to spark debate when submitted to the City Council for approval early 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Pre-1950 houses with horizontal wood siding and those with inadequate 
foundation bolting are particularly vulnerable to quakes, building officials 
said. Newer homes can also be at risk if stucco provides their only form of 
seismic bracing. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are debating the politically volatile question of how to get full 
compliance without making unacceptable financial demands on homeowners, 
particularly those in older neighborhoods. One option under consideration would 
require seismic upgrades only when a house changes hands. 
</P>
<P>
 An early staff proposal for mandatory retrofitting was sent back for revisions 
by top building officials who insisted on an accompanying package of financial 
aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think a lot of these homeowners have the money and we don't want to 
chase them out of their homes," said Karl C. Deppe, chief of the Los Angeles 
Department of Building and Safety's building bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal for retrofitting of dwellings is part of a comprehensive seismic 
safety program developed by the department after the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Building officials outlined the plan Saturday at a conference of the 
Structural Engineers Assn. of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials told about 500 engineers that the Northridge earthquake, far 
exceeding any other American disaster in property damage, was only a "near 
miss" for flexible-frame buildings outside the Valley and Westside, where its 
force was strongest. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Ranous, senior structural engineer with the California Office of 
Emergency Services, said the relatively low death toll showed that the building 
code is adequate to protect human life -- its primary purpose. But he said the 
estimated $17 billion that will be spent repairing damaged structures is not 
acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think now is the time we need to start looking at our building code in 
terms of property protection, not so much for the individual property owners, 
but for the taxpayers of California and the country as a whole," Ranous said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's wood-frame house proposal is designed to minimize public and 
private expense from future quakes. It "would reduce the number of 
uninhabitable homes and avoid the increased public assistance costs to repair 
damage and provide temporary housing after future earthquakes," according to 
the plan's report, prepared by a committee of building officials and seismic 
consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 Repair costs for wood-frame buildings damaged in the Northridge earthquake 
have been estimated at more than $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The building department is developing recommendations that would cover new 
construction and standards for retrofitting all types of structures, including 
wood-frame houses and apartments, steel-frame office buildings and concrete 
structures. These include building code changes to ensure that new structures 
are more earthquake-safe, and they call for mandatory seismic strengthening of 
hundreds of existing steel and concrete buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The current recommendations for wood-frame homes do not cover hillside 
dwellings, described by a review committee as posing "the greatest life safety 
risk of any damaged dwelling (type) investigated." A set of more exacting 
retrofit standards is being drawn up for hillside houses with multilevel 
foundations. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the strengthening of steel-frame and concrete buildings will prove 
the costliest earthquake programs, officials said the numbers of wood-frame 
buildings that need work would dwarf any retrofitting program in the city, 
including the repair of more than 8,000 unreinforced masonry buildings after 
the 1971 Sylmar earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said there are many thousands of homes with unbolted foundation 
plates, foundations of inferior quality materials and poorly braced cripple 
walls -- the short wall holding the floor off the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Although older houses are most vulnerable, inspectors found "serious damage 
was very common in houses of all ages where stucco was the only bracing 
material." 
</P>
<P>
 "Locating and inventorying buildings with these characteristics would be 
necessary to determine the true scale of a mandatory retrofit program," the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding all the houses that need retrofitting, much less mounting an 
inspection program, will be a daunting job, Deppe said. "That would start with 
our automated records and go from there," he said. "You really have to go out 
and look at every building." 
</P>
<P>
 In examining hundreds of damaged wood-frame structures, inspectors found that 
the stucco either cracked under stress or separated from the wood framing, 
negating its seismic-bearing strength. 
</P>
<P>
 Houses with crawl spaces commonly had failures of the short wall holding the 
first floor off the foundation or separation of the house from the foundation 
because of inadequate hold-down straps or bolts. 
</P>
<P>
 Even houses built on concrete slabs are vulnerable to foundation failures 
because of the practice of pouring the foundation first and the slab later. 
Apparently, sand spread under the slab often spills onto the foundation, 
preventing bonding of the joint, officials said. Also, the bolts that hold the 
house down often extend only into the slab, not into the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 To solve those problems in new construction, the committee is recommending 
tougher rules for bracing walls and bolting down foundation sills -- wooden 
plates where wall studs are attached -- and new procedures to improve the 
bonding of foundation and slab. 
</P>
<P>
 For existing houses with defects, the remedies include removing stucco and 
backing it with plywood, installing additional sill bolts or straps by drilling 
into the foundation, and reinforcing the bracing of the short walls between the 
foundation and floor. 
</P>
<P>
 In most cases, building officials said, the cost for the repairs would range 
from $2,000 to $4,000, but could go as high as $18,000 on large houses in which 
access to the work area is restricted. 
</P>
<P>
 Building officials believe that homeowners who make relatively inexpensive 
repairs could save themselves huge losses in a future earthquake striking 
closer to Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city is going to have to take a stand on hazard mitigation related to 
earthquakes," said Nicolino Delli Quadri, chief of the building department's 
training and emergency management division. "What are we going to do? We can't 
just ignore it." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to defuse potential opposition from homeowners who cannot afford such 
work, building officials are soliciting state and federal agencies and the 
private sector to come up with solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Deppe said he is working with bankers and insurance executives on Mayor 
Richard Riordan's blue ribbon panel on hazard reduction to develop a package of 
financial incentives that could lessen the burden. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the ideas being pursued are insurance rate breaks for retrofitted houses 
and allowances to add repair costs to the new loan when a house is sold. 
Federal and state tax deductions or credits also are being explored. 
</P>
<P>
 While the debate goes on, building department staff members worry that those 
who voluntarily upgrade their houses may not have the city guidance now to do 
it right. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are they going to retrofit to?" asked Delli Quadri. "We don't have a 
standard to hold them to." Seismic Strengthening (Southland Eedition, A30) 
</P>
<P>
 As part of their examination of ways to reduce losses in future earthquakes, 
Los Angeles city building officials are developing a program to require the 
seismic retrofitting of wood frame houses and apartment buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 * How many houses would be involved? 
</P>
<P>
 Building officials are not sure, but estimate the number could exceed 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * What houses would require retrofitting? 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, pre-1950 houses with crawl spaces, but also newer homes with stucco 
as the only method of wall bracing, and all hillside homes on multilevel 
foundations. 
</P>
<P>
 * What are the remedies? 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on the individual case, extra foundation bolting, additional bracing 
of walls and removal and replacement of stucco. 
</P>
<P>
 * How much would the work cost? 
</P>
<P>
 It could range from $1,000 to $18,000. Building officials estimate that most 
jobs would cost from $2,000 to $4,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * Would the program be voluntary or mandatory? 
</P>
<P>
 Undecided; officials are trying to find a way to assure compliance without 
creating too great a financial burden on property owners. 
</P>
<P>
 * When would the program go into effect? 
</P>
<P>
 No sooner than next year. The program has to be presented to the Los Angeles 
City Council for approval, and officials in the Department of Building and 
Safety are reluctant to push it without first devising a package of financial 
assistance to lighten the burden on property owners. One option under 
consideration would require the work only when a house is sold. 
</P>
<P>
 * What sort of assistance? 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are soliciting insurance rate breaks, bank loan allowances and 
federal and state tax deductions or credits.

HOUSE GOP CHARTS CALIFORNIA AGENDA; CONGRESS: GINGRICH SAYS FOCUS WILL BE ON 
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, MILITARY PROCUREMENT. WHITE HOUSE DEFENDS RECORD IN STATE, 
WHICH COULD HOLD KEY IN '96 ELECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Newly empowered House Republicans, mindful of the Golden State's pivotal 
influence on national politics and the economy, intend to pursue a California 
agenda stressing immigration reform and increased defense spending, according 
to incoming Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich said he began discussing his priorities with Gov. Pete Wilson several 
days before Tuesday's election, which imposed stiff new restrictions on access 
to health care and education for illegal immigrants in California, sent scores 
of GOP newcomers to statehouses across the nation and put Republicans in charge 
of the U.S. House and Senate for the first time in 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think on the whole issue of immigration, California's going to be very 
positive about what we'll be doing," Gingrich said in an interview with The 
Times upon his return to Washington this weekend. "And frankly, on defense 
procurement, it's going to be a significant boost to the California economy by 
the time we're done." 
</P>
<P>
 To some extent, the California plan represents a rhetorical repackaging of 
proposals contained in the "contract with America" signed by many GOP 
congressional candidates. But the Speaker-in-waiting's endorsement of tough 
federal measures to stop the flow of illegal immigrants into California -- and 
to quickly deport some of those already in the state -- appears to go beyond 
the terms of the party's national battle plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich's comments mark the opening salvo in what is certain to be a two-year 
battle between Republicans and Democrats to win the hearts and minds of 
Californians. As the nation's most populous state, California wields the 
greatest number of Electoral College votes in presidential elections. Its 
support will be critical to the political fate of President Clinton in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Informed of Gingrich's remarks, the White House fired back Saturday with 
warnings that Republicans should not assume the state is theirs for the taking. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're certainly not conceding anything on California," said Tom Epstein, the 
White House's point man on California issues. "We certainly think we've done a 
good job for California and will continue to do so." 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats clearly recognize the importance of the state in their strategy for 
holding the White House. Since taking office last year, Clinton has made 15 
trips to California. Another visit is scheduled for December. 
</P>
<P>
 In public remarks Saturday, Gingrich continued to strike a combative tone 
toward the Clinton White House, which is trying to downplay the significance of 
last week's Republican sweep. Rather than interpreting the GOP victories as a 
rejection of Clinton or congressional Democrats, the White House says the 
election demonstrated widespread restlessness among voters who do not believe 
that the changes promised by the President are coming fast enough. 
</P>
<P>
 In speeches and interviews, Gingrich has maintained that the election results 
represented an overwhelming electoral repudiation of the economic policies and 
social programs pursued by Clinton and his congressional allies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We owe (President Clinton) no fealty on public policy domestically. We owe 
him no automatic obedience on any domestic policy question," Gingrich said on 
CNN's "Evans and Novak" program. "But I told the President before he went to 
Asia that he has our prayers, and he has our support as the President of the 
United States while he's overseas." 
</P>
<P>
 Elaborating on the aggressive legislative agenda the Republicans want to 
pursue next year, Gingrich said he would favor a vote to repeal this year's 
congressional ban on the sale of certain assault weapons. As part of a GOP 
effort to reduce the number of congressional committees and staff members, he 
said he will seek to eliminate the House Post Office and Civil Service 
Committee and the panel that deals with the District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Gingrich called a proposal by fellow Republican Rep. Bill 
Archer of Texas to consider eliminating the federal income tax "a little bold," 
indicating it is unlikely to become part of the GOP's official action plan 
anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
 On issues critical to California, Gingrich said in his interview with The 
Times that he wants the House to pass tough new measures to stanch the flow of 
illegal immigrants -- mainly from the south -- and to step up military 
procurement of new weapons. California's border with Mexico is the primary 
crossing point for illegal immigrants, and the collapse of the state's 
aerospace industry has been a direct consequence of declining defense spending. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think sometimes people back East tend to forget how vital California is to 
our economic future and how much it is our launching pad into the Pacific Rim," 
Gingrich said. Asked whether his legislative strategy is motivated in part by 
California's political importance, he responded: "It's our largest state." 
</P>
<P>
 On immigration, Gingrich advocated bold changes almost certain to create the 
same kind of political furor nationally as Proposition 187 sparked in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 "I favor saying flatly that illegal immigration is a federal problem and that 
it requires a federal solution," Gingrich said. "We have to be responsible for 
being able to police our borders." 
</P>
<P>
 The incoming Speaker said he would seek House passage of measures to 
substantially close borders to illegal immigrants and empower law enforcement 
officials to deport violators without delay. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you know they're illegal, why are you arguing over whether or not to give 
them money? Why are they still here? If they're illegal, why aren't they gone?" 
Gingrich said. "Whatever law we have to pass to be able to protect American 
sovereignty and to be able to say we're not going to have illegal people in the 
United States, we should pass." 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich called for increasing the U.S. Border Patrol to roughly 10,000 
officers, up from 4,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's have as many border patrolmen as are needed so that the border is 
totally secure," Gingrich said. "And second, let's say if we discover that 
you're illegal, we need a system of being able to deport you that is very 
efficient and very fast and that works." 
</P>
<P>
 While Gingrich and Wilson appear to have a common goal of cracking down on 
illegal immigration, they could part company on the details. Throughout the 
campaign that ended in his reelection, Wilson said passage of Proposition 187 
was the only way to make federal officials reimburse California for the cost of 
providing services to illegal immigrants. On several occasions, he said the 
ballot measure would pressure Washington to compensate the state for more than 
$3 billion worth of services now financed by California taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich, however, suggested that Washington will do nothing of the sort. 
Instead, he stressed the need to deport illegal immigrants already living in 
California and prevent the entry of any new ones. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense spending component of the GOP's California agenda is likely to be 
warmly received by Wilson and other state leaders. Seven years of declining 
defense budgets have devastated California's once-vibrant aerospace industry, 
and tens of thousands of jobs have been lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich's promise to pump up weapon procurement comes at a time when the 
Clinton Administration has focused on weaning California off defense spending 
by providing funds to help convert military industries to peacetime purposes 
and smooth the transition of laid-off workers. The Administration has earmarked 
as much as $600 million a year for the effort nationally, with California 
getting roughly a third of the money. 
</P>
<P>
 House Republicans have talked about adding as much as $20 billion to the 
Pentagon's budget during the next five years. Rep. Floyd Spence (R-S.C.), the 
likely chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, has vowed "to reverse 
the past two years of neglect of our nation's military." 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Gingrich said the GOP "certainly" seeks to increase funding for 
anti-missile defenses. But he stopped short of endorsing the $20-billion boost 
advocated by some Republicans, noting that any increase must be acceptable to a 
Senate that traditionally has been more deficit-conscious than the House. 
</P>
<P>
 Money for stepped-up weapon purchases could be obtained by reducing the 
participation of U.S. troops in international humanitarian and peacekeeping 
missions and by adopting reforms that would require the Pentagon to simplify 
its purchase requirements, Gingrich said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm prepared to find some limited amount of money, but I don't see it as a 
massive increase in defense spending. I'm also prepared to shrink the Pentagon 
bureaucracy in favor of troops and weapons."

FOR GOLDMAN'S FATHER, GRIEF TURNS TO ANGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For Fred Goldman, the passage from grief to fury has been startlingly swift. 
</P>
<P>
 The father of Ronald Lyle Goldman has seen his murdered son's face plastered 
on trading cards. He has heard the young man's identity reduced to terms such 
as "waiter" or "friend." He has watched as a tragic double murder was 
transformed into a sensational spectacle dubbed "The O.J. Case." 
</P>
<P>
 And now, as Fred Goldman sees it, defense attorneys are misleading potential 
jurors, manipulating public opinion and inappropriately injecting race into the 
trial -- all in an effort to win sympathy for O.J. Simpson, the accused killer 
of his son. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lately," Goldman said, "I find myself screaming at the TV and screaming at 
the radio. It's very frustrating to see and hear some of what's going on and 
know that it's just basically wrong. It's simply, basically wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, Goldman said, he had been determined to stay silent about the 
trial as it unfolded. However, during a two-hour interview last week in the den 
of his Agoura Hills home, the 53-year-old businessman said he feels compelled 
to speak out about his experiences and impressions after being unwillingly 
dropped into a place where private sorrow and public sensation intersect. 
</P>
<P>
 In the five months since he received the shattering phone call from the 
coroner telling him his 25-year-old son was found dead alongside Nicole Brown 
Simpson, Goldman has undergone an emotional reconstruction, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For weeks after the murder, he rarely emerged from his house. His 22-year-old 
daughter, Kim, and his wife, Patti, spoke for the family. 
</P>
<P>
 At his son's funeral, Goldman tried to tell hundreds of mourners about Ron's 
life but was overcome. He sat surrounded by his family in the front row of the 
Westlake Village chapel, weeping. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the beginning our attempt was to take a low profile and let justice move 
without our getting in the way," Goldman said. "We fully believed that our 
son's death would be dealt with in a fair way, and ultimately justice would be 
done." 
</P>
<P>
 But as he walked into the courthouse during the preliminary hearing, he saw 
Ron's now-famous driver's license photo being hawked on trading cards and he 
saw placards proclaiming, "Free O.J.!" 
</P>
<P>
 Driving to work he heard pundits lightly refer to the proceedings as "the O.J. 
case" instead of "the Goldman-Nicole Brown Simpson murder case." And at home he 
watched television with astonishment as his son's life was reduced to mindless 
talk show chatter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Imagine having your son murdered, and then having your kids go to school and 
see his picture on a trading card," Goldman said. "It's an outrage that people 
see that as OK, and it amazes me that anyone can imagine for a moment trying to 
make money off the murder of two people. It's beyond my understanding." 
</P>
<P>
 As the criminal proceedings have progressed, Goldman said, he has become even 
more incensed by actions of the lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Most objectionable, he said, is the defense team's treatment of the race issue 
-- a provocative undercurrent in a case in which the suspect is black and the 
victims were white. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue first surfaced when The New Yorker and Newsweek magazines quoted 
unnamed defense sources as saying that during the trial they may claim that 
LAPD Detective Mark Fuhrman planted a bloody glove he found outside Simpson's 
Brentwood mansion because of his racial biases -- a charge that the detective 
and the Los Angeles Police Department have denied. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense has said that proof of Fuhrman's alleged biases was contained in 
an unsuccessful lawsuit he filed to win a disability pension from the city of 
Los Angeles in 1983. Simpson's lawyers have said they hope to use the case to 
undermine Fuhrman's credibility if he testifies. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last month, the defense accused prosecutors of questioning African 
American jury prospects differently from other potential panelists during the 
selection process. And they questioned whether prosecutors were using a 
disproportionate number of their challenges to seek removal of black panelists. 
Eight of the 12 jurors eventually seated are black. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman said the defense's tactics helped convert his anguish to full-boil 
anger. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll steal a line from the movie 'Network.' I'm mad as hell and I can't take 
it anymore," he said. "None of us should have to put up with what's going on. 
It's bad enough that we've lost Ron, but to see this murder trial turned into a 
circus is sad. And it doesn't do the memories of Ron and Nicole justice." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert L. Shapiro, one of Simpson's lead attorneys, said comments from the 
families of the victims have been painful for his client, who maintains that he 
is falsely accused of the murders of his ex-wife and Ronald Goldman. Both were 
slashed and stabbed to death June 12 in Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have the greatest empathy for the Goldman family and the Brown family and 
the tremendous losses they have suffered," Shapiro said. "In our attempt to 
pick the jury, we have explained our roles as lawyers in defending a man we 
believe is wrongfully accused." 
</P>
<P>
 Their obligations as defense attorneys include contesting evidence, 
challenging the credibility of witnesses and examining whether evidence was 
properly gathered, preserved and analyzed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro said he and his colleagues have not tried to do anything that would 
add to the suffering of the Brown or Goldman families. All the defense efforts, 
he said, are focused on trying to clear Simpson of the charges that could send 
him to prison for the rest of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "O.J. Simpson, like any defendant, has the presumption of innocence, not the 
assumption of guilt," Shapiro said. "Our job is to present to the jury the 
evidence or lack of evidence in a light that is most favorable to O.J. 
Simpson." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman said he understands Simpson's rights but is concerned that in the 
course of their vigorous defense, the attorneys have gone too far. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've called police officers liars, they've called people racists, they've 
inferred there were plots. All with no proof, done from my point of view 
clearly to manipulate jurors and public opinion," Goldman said. "And it's that 
which I find really disturbing and borderline immoral." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman's sharp criticism of the defense is not the first to come from the 
victims' families. 
</P>
<P>
 In a rare courthouse comment about the case in October, Nicole Simpson's 
sister Denise Brown spoke briefly to question why defense attorneys were 
contesting evidence if O.J. Simpson had nothing to hide. 
</P>
<P>
 "If O.J. is so innocent, why are (his defense lawyers) trying to suppress all 
the evidence?" she said to some of the journalists at the Criminal Courts 
Building. "It's just something on my mind, and I wanted to say it." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman said he immediately called Brown after her remarks were publicized. 
Although he has had little contact with the Brown family, he wanted to thank 
her for speaking out. 
</P>
<P>
 Dealing with distraught relatives of victims can be treacherous for defense 
lawyers, said Los Angeles attorney Gerald L. Chaleff, a prominent defense 
lawyer and former president of the Los Angeles County Bar Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always difficult because the defense tactics may be perfectly legitimate 
and ethical. They may be required," Chaleff said. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys have to explain their decisions without leaving the impression that 
they are attacking the victims, he said. "All you can do is explain what the 
profession requires." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman contends that the profession's requirements tend to vary according to 
the size of the client's bankroll. 
</P>
<P>
 Wealthy defendants can afford attorneys who are skilled at manipulating the 
system, Goldman said. The result, he added, is that the rich get a different, 
more friendly brand of justice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find that tremendously unfair and unfortunate because the vast majority of 
this country is not wealthy and famous," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "So you're left with only one conclusion, and that is that there are two 
levels of justice. One for the famous and wealthy, and one for everybody else." 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts said Goldman's assertions about the justice system are true, but 
not revolutionary. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's no different than saying that if you have more money you're more likely 
to have a better doctor," Chaleff said. "In this system what we have tried to 
do is raise the floor, so that everyone has an acceptable level of 
representation." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman, who has only praise for the prosecution and police, maintains that he 
has not passed judgment on Simpson. But he says he is concerned that the frenzy 
surrounding the case will stifle any chance of knowing exactly what happened to 
his son. 
</P>
<P>
 And if Simpson is guilty, Goldman said, he should be punished. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think from the early days we have felt a real need to have justice done, to 
have the guilty punished," he said. "And it has become very disconcerting to 
have to be concerned that because of all the publicity and the circus 
atmosphere, we have to worry that there is even a possibility that the likely 
murderer of my son and Nicole Brown Simpson could go free." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman said his focus now is to bring attention back to the most important 
aspect of the murder case -- the victims. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he and his family will push through the mesh of cameras and onlookers 
to attend every day of the trial once the proceedings are reopened after jury 
selection. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would hope that by our remaining visible, that it's a constant reminder to 
people that this is a trial about murder," Goldman said resolutely. "It isn't a 
trial about a celebrity accused, it isn't a trial about the lack of comfort the 
accused has, it's a trial about these two people who were brutally murdered and 
what should be done about it."

NEWS ANALYSIS; HUFFINGTON AND OTHERS SAY $30 MILLION WAS WELL SPENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN F. BUNTING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thirty million dollars will pay for 700 new Border Patrol agents. Or a 737 
jetliner. Or 1.2 million copies of the best-selling "Book of Virtues." Or two 
months of water usage for the entire city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 But all that money apparently could not buy a U.S. Senate seat in California. 
Not this year anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 After sinking more than a third of his estimated $70-million oil fortune into 
last week's nip-and-tuck Senate election, Mike Huffington retreated to his 
Santa Barbara ocean view estate with a 44% unfavorable rating and a political 
bruising. By the national media he was deemed variously a "cipher," a "Martian 
candidate," an "empty suit" and a "rich twit." Esquire magazine said: "Michael 
Huffington could've bought a bad Picasso." 
</P>
<P>
 To hear Huffington tell it, however, his millions were expended wisely as he 
came within 123,610 votes of toppling Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a popular Democrat 
who earlier this year enjoyed the highest approval rating of any elected 
official in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very worth it," Huffington said of the most expensive congressional 
race in history. 
</P>
<P>
 Many political experts agree. They say Huffington parlayed his vast financial 
resources into a highly effective -- albeit ugly -- campaign that featured an 
unprecedented blitz of negative advertising. By any standard, this was quite an 
accomplishment for a native Texan who began the campaign virtually unknown to 
the public, had few credentials in civic life, and only recently relocated to 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he could have done anything much differently," said Steven P. 
Erie, a specialist in California and urban politics at UC San Diego. "I hate to 
say it, but I think it was money well spent. He came as close as he possibly 
could." 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome remains so close that Feinstein has yet to claim victory and 
Huffington has not conceded defeat. But with 500,000 absentee ballots still 
uncounted, Feinstein's lead is nearly impossible for Huffington to overcome. 
Huffington won the absentee ballots already counted statewide by about 6%, 
according to The Times exit poll, and to win Huffington would need to carry the 
outstanding ballots by a margin of more than 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 In any close campaign, there is second-guessing over whether different 
decisions about strategy or tactics would have resulted in another outcome. But 
the lesson of the race may well be that wealthy candidates can buy a major 
election in a sprawling state like California, according to a wide range of 
interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 "If only Huffington had spent another $10 million he would have won," said Tom 
Epstein, the Clinton Administration's California liaison. 
</P>
<P>
 But according to one source, Huffington decided to stop writing checks with 
only one week left in the race as his highly paid team of Republican 
consultants presented options for further spending. The 46-year-old Republican 
congressman told his staff: "That's it. I've put my last nickel into the 
campaign," said a Huffington consultant who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington spent $28.3 million of his fortune and spent about $30 million 
overall in his bid to defeat Feinstein. The previous spending record for any 
congressional seat was $17 million in 1990 by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.). 
</P>
<P>
 The level of spending enabled Huffington to make it a close race, but also 
cost him some votes as Feinstein repeatedly attacked him for it. A Times exit 
survey of voters on Election Day found that 28% of Feinstein backers said they 
supported the San Francisco Democrat because Huffington was trying to buy the 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein, one of the most successful political fund-raisers in the country, 
spent about $12 million to win reelection. At a West Los Angeles rally Monday, 
she vowed to do everything in her power to pass campaign reform laws that put a 
ceiling on spending levels. Feinstein said that "if anything has taught me that 
campaigns are not right in this land, it has been this campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 The race was never supposed to be so expensive. Shortly after announcing his 
Senate bid last year, Huffington said he planned to spend about $5 million of 
his own money and raise an additional $10 million in contributions. As the 
campaign wore on, Huffington's predictions of his personal contributions grew 
to $10 million, then to $15 million and finally, it seemed, to whatever amount 
was necessary. He also ended up raising a relatively paltry $1.4 million from 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think any of us conceived that we'd be spending the kind of money we 
did," said Ken Khachigian, a Huffington campaign strategist. "I don't think 
Mike conceived it, either." 
</P>
<P>
 The primary motive Huffington cited in pursuing a Senate seat was to replace 
the government's role as welfare provider with private philanthropy. The issue 
was of such importance that he and his wife, author Arianna Stassinopoulos 
Huffington, discussed the possibility of abandoning the campaign and using 
their money to start a charitable foundation. On the campaign trail, Huffington 
spoke of his experience as a volunteer serving meals at a soup kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 If the couple had donated $30 million to a Los Angeles food bank, the money 
would have fed about 250,000 people for a year, said Carolyn Olney, associate 
director of the Southern California Interfaith Hunger Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just dreadful that that amount was spent on campaigning," Olney said. 
"Why not some kind of limit? I'm not so naive to think it should go to feeding 
the hungry, but it just seems a ridiculous amount of money for what turned out 
to be such a negative campaign. To me, it's crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 A Times analysis of federal election records has found no precedent for 
Huffington's spending spree. Because it cost him virtually nothing to raise 
money, Huffington was able to pour more than $20 million into television and 
radio advertising. No candidate in the history of congressional elections has 
come close to spending even half as much as Huffington on broadcast ads. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington spent $5.74 in broadcast advertising for each of the 3,484,887 
votes he attracted. This year, Senate challenger Oliver L. North generated more 
than $17 million for his campaign in the much smaller state of Virginia, but 
spent only $3.70 per vote on TV and radio ads because he was forced to plow 
$9.2 million into direct-mail fund raising. Similarly, Helms spent $4.62 per 
vote on broadcast ads in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 With so much money available, Huffington could afford a top-drawer collection 
of campaign consultants. Records show that through Oct. 19 he paid $220,000 to 
the Washington consulting firm of Larry McCarthy, a former George Bush media 
adviser. Senior consultant Bruce Nestande collected $155,000, former campaign 
manger Bob Shuman was paid $150,000, onetime Richard Nixon speech writer 
Khachigian received $80,000 in fees and former Ronald Reagan adviser Ed 
Rollins' company was paid $73,945. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington also enjoyed the rare luxury of combining his TV spots with radio 
and newspaper ads statewide. On at least three occasions, his campaign spent an 
extra $500,000 to supplement television attacks on Feinstein with radio and 
newspaper advertising, aides said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ads sought to destroy Feinstein's reputation by portraying her as a 
tax-and-spend liberal and career politician who catered to special interests, 
acted in ways that benefited her wealthy husband, and would do anything to get 
reelected. Huffington's first attack commercial highlighted the Feinstein vote 
for President Clinton's 1993 economic package, which the ad described as the 
biggest tax increase in history. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was brilliant negative campaigning," said Erie, the political 
scientist. "The television ads were effective and brilliantly conceived." 
</P>
<P>
 The success of the ads -- they were instrumental in helping Huffington wipe 
out the 30-point deficit from early polling surveys -- proved once again that 
negative campaigning produces the quickest results for a challenger running 
against an established incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can blanket the media the way (Huffington) did, it looks like you can 
persuade people of just about almost anything that's negative," said Barbara 
Sinclair, who teaches political science at UC Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 But several political experts suggested that Huffington might have invested a 
little too much money in negative advertising and too little in positive 
messages that gave voters reasons to elect him. Given his enormous financial 
resources, Huffington could have embarked on a wholly different sort of 
campaign -- one that allowed him, not his opponent, to define him, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington kicked off his TV advertising campaign in February with a 
commercial that opened with him recommending Republican William J. Bennett's 
"Book of Virtues." 
</P>
<P>
 But Huffington only occasionally aired similar ads that emphasized his 
personal values and beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all that money he spent, he's still an empty suit," said Bob Hattoy, a 
Democrat and California political activist who serves in the Clinton 
Administration. "They should have spent all that money filling the suit." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington advisers said they intended to flood the airwaves during the final 
week with uplifting commercials that showed Huffington playing with his 
children and talking to the camera about his strengths. But when the Feinstein 
campaign attacked Huffington for hiring an illegal immigrant nanny, his 
advisers decided they had to pull the positive ads only five days before 
Election Day. To neutralize the damage caused by the nanny issue, Huffington 
counterattacked with TV ads that accused Feinstein of lying about her hiring of 
an illegal immigrant housekeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 The positive ad, which some political experts said was very effective, ran the 
night before the election. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he loses, the difference has to be laid on nannygate," said George Gorton, 
campaign manager for Gov. Pete Wilson. "It sort of interrupted his flow. 
Otherwise, I think he would have won." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Huffington has expressed no regrets over spending $30 million on 
a losing effort that brought him much criticism and ridicule. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew a lot," Huffington said the morning after the election. "I am a very 
different person than I was 15 months ago. As a result, I think I could 
probably go through anything today and survive that experience. But it was a 
worthwhile experience for me personally."

DEMOCRATS VOW TO BLOCK GOP CONSERVATIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLENE CIMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Republicans might wield control of Capitol Hill for the next two years, but 
they shouldn't expect liberal Democrats to simply stand by as they steamroller 
their conservative agenda through Congress, several prominent Democratic 
lawmakers warned Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to have to fight back," said Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los 
Angeles), who chaired a key health subcommittee at the forefront of efforts to 
tighten regulation of tobacco products. In January, the panel will be turned 
over to a new Republican chairman. One top contender, Rep. Thomas J. Bliley Jr. 
of Virginia, has already promised to leave the tobacco industry alone. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, outnumbered Democrats acknowledged that confrontational 
tactics alone might prove counterproductive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Democrats have got to get beyond the politics of denial" they've engaged in 
since Election Day, said Rep. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) "Over the next two years, it's 
going to be very important to turn this around. The challenge for Democrats 
will be to get beyond the defensive and offer a constructive alternative." 
</P>
<P>
 Stunned by the political body blow delivered by voters last Tuesday, 
beleaguered Democrats have spent much of the past week trying to get back on 
their feet, assess what went wrong and determine how they will respond when the 
new Congress convenes next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Interviews with several lawmakers on Saturday suggested that many feel 
strongly they should commit themselves to trying to derail any Republican 
effort to boost military spending or legislate tax cuts at the expense of 
social programs, particularly Medicare and Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we have a lot of choice in what our roles are going to be," 
Waxman said. "It reminds me of what (the late Israeli Prime Minister) Golda 
Meir said when asked why Israel fights wars: The alternative was to be pushed 
into the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to the obstructionist warfare waged by the GOP against Democratic 
legislation in the past, Waxman added: "We're just going to have to play the 
same kind of role the Republicans played when they were in the minority." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the declaration by House Speaker-in-waiting Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) that 
he will cooperate, but not compromise, with Democrats, Waxman responded: "We 
feel the same way about him." 
</P>
<P>
 Several lawmakers noted that in the Senate, Democrats have the same procedural 
tools available to them that were used effectively in the past by the 
Republicans -- particularly the filibuster. 
</P>
<P>
 Like their Democratic counterparts before them, next year's GOP senators may 
be unable to muster the three-fifths majority needed to cut off debate during a 
filibuster. Moreover, President Clinton still has the power of the veto, which 
Republicans cannot override with anything less than a two-thirds majority. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect Newt Gingrich, a slash-and-burn guerrilla warrior, and (Texas GOP 
Sen.) Phil Gramm are going to try to confront President Clinton as often as 
possible, which will force him to veto legislation," Waxman said. "His vetoes 
will be sustained because the Republicans don't have a two-thirds vote. And the 
lines will be drawn more clearly for the next election." 
</P>
<P>
 Wyden said he has spent recent days listening to fellow Democrats rehash the 
election results with a sense of befuddlement, unable to comprehend the reasons 
behind the outcome. Their attitude is potentially self-destructive, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard a lot of people say in the last few days: 'The economy's got some 
bright spots, there's no horrendous war where our citizens are being killed, so 
why are the voters so unhappy?' " Wyden said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I take the view that the voters are rightfully angry. The system doesn't work 
for a lot of families, especially the working class. It's the job of the 
Democrats to come up with fresh, creative policies to respond to that 
understandable voter anger about a system that doesn't work for a lot of 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 An aide to Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.), one of the few Democratic incumbents 
to easily win reelection, described the senator as disappointed by the 
Republican takeover, but far from disheartened. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Democrats still have some influence, and they plan to use it as best they 
can," said the aide, who requested anonymity. "No one is going to roll over and 
play dead on Capitol Hill." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, he said he doubted that Sarbanes would assume the role of an 
obstructionist. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is too fond of the institution and its rules," the aide said. "I think 
he'll use the legislative process in its best sense."

COLUMN ONE; KIDNAPING KIDNAPED CHILDREN; DON AND JUDY FEENEY USE DISGUISES, 
DECEIT AND COMMANDO TACTICS TO RECOVER YOUNGSTERS TAKEN OVERSEAS BY A PARENT. 
THEY MAY BREAK THE LAW, THEY SAY, BUT TO THEM THE END JUSTIFIES THE MEANS.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Don Feeney had been out of prison only two weeks and all he wanted to do was 
spend time with his family and rebuild his business. If anyone had told him he 
would go right back off on another risky foreign mission, the kind of 
high-adrenaline project that had landed him in an Iceland hoosegow in the first 
place, the fast-talking, Brooklyn-born Feeney would've laughed in his face. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Connie Ghozzi walked through his door, neither Feeney nor his wife, 
Judy, could say no. 
</P>
<P>
 Ghozzi's 4-year-old son, Elias, had been kidnaped, spirited away to Tunisia by 
her ex-husband the day before a custody hearing. For a year, she had tried 
everything to recover her son, even paying nearly $100,000 to men who promised 
they could snatch Elias back. She turned to the Feeneys in desperation, 
traveling from her home in Oklahoma to see them last February. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could tell by looking at her that her heart had been ripped away," Judy 
Feeney said. So the Feeneys swung into action. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporate Training Unlimited, the company Don Feeney founded in 1985 with a 
team of former members of the anti-terrorist Delta Force, was designed to offer 
training and security services to executives working overseas. But retrieving 
kidnaped children has developed into a flashier, if controversial, sideline. 
The Feeneys say they have recovered 18 kidnaped children and adults -- 
including the September return of Arcadia resident Michelle Neserri's 
2-year-old son from Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Department, which reports 1,200 active custody cases involving an 
American child abroad, tries to assist parents through legal channels. It 
frowns on the type of abductions the Feeneys engineer. "There is concern if a 
child is abducted once and then is abducted again, that it can keep the chain 
of abductions going," said a State Department spokeswoman. "It doesn't really 
resolve anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Other concerns include the potential of physical danger to the children, and 
the myriad implications of breaking the laws of other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The Feeneys themselves want their clients to exhaust legal remedies first. But 
only 37 countries have signed an international accord on custody issues. In the 
Middle East, where the Feeneys stage most of their recoveries, only Israel is a 
party to the accord. 
</P>
<P>
 The upshot is that custody orders issued by U.S. courts can be as meaningless 
as "potty paper" overseas, said Judy Feeney. The couple, and a small number of 
other similar firms, consider themselves "the court of last resort." 
</P>
<P>
 To pull off their recoveries, CTU operatives have posed as movie makers, 
fought off angry mobs and snatched a child from a crowded school bus. It is an 
incongruous image: macho ex-Delta Force members applying the blunt skills of 
their trade to accomplish the most delicate of missions: extricating children 
from the embrace of a faraway parent. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in the middle of such a mission in 1993 that Don Feeney was arrested. 
CTU operatives flew to Reykjavik, Iceland, posing as location scouts for a film 
that would star Sylvester Stallone and Kim Basinger. In truth, CTU was working 
for James Grayson, a Florida resident who accused his ex-wife of snatching 
their daughter nine months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The CTU team befriended the ex-wife, Erna Eyjolfsdottir, convincing her that 
they would hire her as a production aide. Actually, two children were involved 
in the case. Eyjolfsdottir had fled with her two daughters just as a Florida 
judge was about to take them away from her and give custody to the fathers, the 
woman's two ex-husbands. 
</P>
<P>
 After going out partying with Eyjolfsdottir one night, the operatives took the 
children while she slept. Waking up to find her daughters gone, she was able to 
get customs officials to stop Don Feeney, Grayson and Grayson's daughter at the 
airport. Judy Feeney and another operative had boarded an earlier plane with 
the other girl but were intercepted in Luxembourg. The girl was returned to 
Iceland. 
</P>
<P>
 Feeney and Grayson were both sentenced to prison. Grayson was sentenced to 
three months. Feeney was sentenced to two years and served one year, including 
six months in isolation after he escaped and was recaptured. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mention the Feeneys and the tendency is to talk of the adventures, the close 
calls, the hair-raising escapes. But Judy Feeney complains that news stories 
have lavished too much attention on the derring-do and not enough on the tender 
objects of their mercy. The couple love children -- that's why they do what 
they do, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pictures of their own three children hang on a wall in her office located in a 
one-story building not far from Ft. Bragg, where the Army's top-secret Delta 
Force operation is based. 
</P>
<P>
 The sign above the door is for a security-guard firm. That's because, while 
Don, 41, was in prison, CTU languished and Judy Feeney, 38, focused her 
energies on the couple's other, more mundane business of supplying guards to 
local companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Feeneys are working to return CTU to profitability by focusing more on 
corporate security and crisis-management training, providing they get the time 
between retrieving children. 
</P>
<P>
 The expensive child-recovery operations that have gained the couple notoriety 
usually cost more than the client is able to pay, they said. Costs can vary 
widely, but expenses alone can run into the tens of thousands of dollars. On 
one of their early missions they went $36,000 into debt, said Judy Feeney. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course we like to get a payday," she said. "We finally made a mortgage 
payment on time. That's a good feeling. . . . But a lot of times I don't have 
the luxury of making good business decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 A reminder of why they take on the unprofitable child rescues sits on a 
sideboard in Judy's office -- a color photograph of Brittney Chowdhury, a 
5-year-old Oklahoma girl they recovered from Bangladesh, where she had been 
taken by her father in 1989, days before a scheduled divorce hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 For Judy Feeney it was a special case, the first in which she was a full 
participant, going undercover, hatching plots, exposing herself to the same 
dangers as her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found her living like an animal," she said of Brittney. "She couldn't even 
eat with utensils. Her hair had lice in it. . . . We've pulled some kids out of 
some pretty hellacious situations." 
</P>
<P>
 The first attempt to rescue Brittney failed. A CTU operative, using the firm's 
favorite ruse, contacted the father, Mohammed Chowdhury, claiming to be a movie 
location scout in need of an English-speaking guide. But Chowdhury became 
suspicious and broke off contact. 
</P>
<P>
 When they tried again months later, the Feeneys used Terry Chowdhury, 
Mohammed's estranged second wife, as bait. She had become friends with Keli 
Chowdhury, Brittney's mother, and was willing to do anything -- even fake a 
reconciliation with Mohammed -- to help. 
</P>
<P>
 For a week, Mohammed virtually lived with Terry at her hotel. The Feeneys and 
Terry communicated through written notes, which they left taped beneath a sink 
in the women's restroom. At first, Mohammed was suspicious of the Feeneys, the 
American couple he often saw around the hotel. But when he heard that Don 
Feeney was a New York investment consultant interested in opening a textile 
factory, he stunned the Feeneys by approaching him to discuss a job. The two 
couples ended up having dinner together. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry eventually learned of Brittney's whereabouts. To get Mohammed out of the 
way, the Feeneys sent him to Bangkok, Thailand, on a ruse. There a CTU 
operative roughed him up and told him never to go near either Terry or Keli 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Feeneys went to the home of Mohammed's family to get Brittney. 
An angry crowd surrounded them when it became clear what they were doing. While 
Keli sang nursery rhymes to soothe the child, Don drove back the mob with a 
telescoping police baton and had to forcefully restrain Mohammed's father, who 
tried to snatch the girl back. 
</P>
<P>
 A Bangladesh judge refused to grant Keli permanent custody unless Brittney's 
father was present. But the Feeneys managed to elude armed guards who had been 
stationed outside their hotel and left the country with the child. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If the Feeneys have an image problem, it is partly their own doing. Don, who 
grew up in a rough-and-tumble New York neighborhood, has the tough-guy moves 
and patter of a young James Cagney. He does not try to hide a hair-trigger 
temper. 
</P>
<P>
 He resigned from the Army in 1984 after 16 years of service rather than accept 
disciplinary action. He and other Delta Force members working undercover in 
Beirut were expected to live like Foreign Service personnel, but on a smaller 
Army per diem. A deal was worked out with hoteliers so that the Delta Force 
received cut rates and kickbacks. Feeney insists the arrangement was necessary 
for the successful fulfillment of the mission, but the Army says he and the 
other soldiers were guilty of financial irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy was never in the military, but she is an Army brat with a lifelong love 
of shooting. But, despite their image as weapon-slinging swashbucklers, Judy 
Feeney said they never carry guns on recovery missions, especially when 
children are involved. 
</P>
<P>
 The Neserri case was the first in which CTU worked in cooperation with 
government officials. After Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) took an interest in 
the case, the Los Angeles district attorney's office and then the FBI got 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
 They enlisted Scotland Yard to help after the Feeneys concocted a plan to lure 
Neserri's estranged Iraqi husband to London with the child. When he stepped off 
the plane at Heathrow Airport, he was immediately taken into custody and the 
child was taken away. 
</P>
<P>
 More typical was the operation to retrieve Connie Ghozzi's son last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 She had been warned to stay away from CTU. "All I ever heard was negative 
things about them," she said. The State Department, for example, contends that 
the Feeneys' extralegal activities not only can cause diplomatic problems, but 
can put the children in physical danger and also cause them psychological 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 People who knew of their exploits told her they were reckless and foolhardy. 
"I think some of the (Feeney recoveries) could very well put some of the 
children through trauma and danger," said Judy Shretter, legal director of the 
National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, like the State Department, prefers that parents pursue legal means 
of regaining custody of snatched children. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ghozzi's case, though, the State Department said they couldn't help. Under 
the Feeneys' guidance, she persuaded her Tunisian husband in a series of 
telephone conversations that she wanted a reconciliation. During the year of 
separation from her son, she had in fact already tried moving to Tunisia to be 
with him. But she realized she couldn't stay after a week in that country. The 
isolation -- from her culture, her language, her friends -- was too great. 
Also, she said, her husband's family treated her "like dirt," as if she were an 
outsider and Elias was their child. 
</P>
<P>
 She moved back to Tunisia early this year. At first, she said, she wasn't 
allowed to be alone with Elias and was locked in her room at night. Eventually, 
as she won her estranged husband's trust, she was allowed to take Elias on 
walks. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter the Feeneys, masquerading as Americans interested in importing Tunisian 
wine. They made the family's acquaintance, which enabled them to observe close 
up. In telephone calls, Judy would advise Ghozzi on what to say and how to 
behave and learn more about the family's routine. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the time, on one of her walks with Elias, to make good her escape. 
Ghozzi arrived at the point where she was to meet a Feeney operative, only to 
find no one there. She panicked. Remembering other would-be rescuers, she 
thought: "It's happened to me again. I've been duped again." 
</P>
<P>
 As Ghozzi fretted about what to do, a hulking Irishman suddenly appeared in 
her path, pretending to tie his shoe. Without looking up, he told her in his 
Irish lilt to turn left and get in a gray Peugeot nearby. The man was the CTU 
operative. He had been delayed briefly checking on the boat they needed. Soon, 
Ghozzi and her son were on the high seas, speeding to Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If Don Feeney has to break the laws of foreign nations to accomplish his 
missions, he does it without a twinge of guilt. His philosophy now is the same 
as when he worked for the government: He doesn't mind breaking rules if he 
feels he is justified. 
</P>
<P>
 He is an ex-Army sniper who survived the ill-fated government mission to 
rescue American hostages in Iran in 1980. "When I became a sniper for the Army, 
they put you through a psychological test," he said. The administrator of the 
test told him a sniper could not have a conscience. 
</P>
<P>
 Feeney disagreed. "You must have a conscience to be a sniper." A good soldier 
trusts his superiors, "but I'm not a blind sheep. If they told me Ronald Reagan 
had become a communist and must be killed, I'm not going to do it. It'll be a 
cold day in hell before I kill the President because you tell me to." 
</P>
<P>
 He passed the test. 
</P>
<P>
 Recalling his Beirut financial hijinks, Feeney said: "Was it wrong what we 
did? Yes, but it was justified." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, recovering snatched children might be sneered at by U.S. officials 
and might break the laws of the countries where the recoveries are staged, but 
the Feeneys keep on doing it. 
</P>
<P>
 They feel they are justified.

THE DEAL IS OFF FOR BURBANK, MALL DEVELOPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIVIEN LOU CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five years ago, Burbank leaders were thrilled with the great deal they had 
just closed that would finally bring a major shopping mall to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Within 25 years, nearly $229 million in sales, property and hotel taxes would 
be collected from operations of the Media City Center mall and surrounding 
properties, officials projected. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Burbank officials exulted, developer Alexander Haagen agreed to 
split net operating profits from the mall with the city, 50-50. With Haagen, 
operator of dozens of shopping centers in Southern California, managing Media 
City Center, another $52.7 million would roll into city coffers in those 25 
years, officials happily announced. 
</P>
<P>
 How things have changed. Officials now say the mall, which opened in 1991 and 
into which the city invested $120.7 million, won't produce a dime in profit for 
the foreseeable future. But they say they have made another great deal, 
salvaging $10 million -- which Haagen promises to pay in the future -- while 
forever surrendering the taxpayers' right to half the profits. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened? 
</P>
<P>
 Public records and interviews with former and present city officials show that 
the partnership between Haagen and the city, working through its Redevelopment 
Agency, was beleaguered from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost since the beginning, the Manhattan Beach developer has repeatedly made 
financial demands on the city, records show. And until last June, the city 
complied, hoping that one more concession would finally make the mall flourish. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, much of the money generated by the shopping center -- millions of 
dollars in tax revenues the city counted on five years ago to make good on its 
investment -- has been diverted to Haagen. 
</P>
<P>
 Those now in positions of power in Burbank, including Mayor Bill Wiggins, say 
they are generally satisfied with how the project has overcome the California 
recession and a sagging retail market. They point proudly to a revitalized 
downtown centered on the mall, which draws strong weekend crowds and has 
generated new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a phenomenal success to have taken 50% of our profits, which -- 
because the economy changed -- was tantamount to zippo, and to translate that 
into $10 million of guaranteed hard, cold cash is an absolute coup," said City 
Manager Bud Ovrom. 
</P>
<P>
 That upbeat view is not shared by those who first made the deal with Haagen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad Haagen didn't want City Hall, or the City Council would be meeting 
in a tent," said Al Dossin, a former Burbank mayor who helped select the 
developer in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's kind of a snide remark, don't you think?" said Haagen, 75, who has 40 
years of experience in real estate development. "I think our reputation has 
been impeccable. If you look at the results rather than the comments, the 
results of what we did are rather impressive." 
</P>
<P>
 Haagen said "sour grapes" are behind the negative comments. "The city was as 
much a participant as we were," he said. "We have been a productive entity for 
years. I went to Burbank because the city asked us to." 
</P>
<P>
 The city refused requests by The Times to examine records of negotiations 
until after the final deal becomes effective Nov. 26. But other sources show 
that key changes in the project and its revenues include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Haagen could not arrange for the construction of four office buildings and a 
300- to 350-room hotel near the mall, buildings the city considered crucial to 
the success of the project. While the city planned on receiving revenue from 
the projects, the original agreement allowed Haagen not to build without 
defaulting. 
</P>
<P>
 * Both Haagen and the city wanted an upscale anchor store. In hopes of luring 
Bullock's, Burbank in 1989 and 1990 borrowed $51.5 million to pay for the 
building and a new parking structure to be used exclusively by the store. 
Haagen, who loaned the money, required the city to pledge 80% of the property 
taxes from the entire mall, and all of the city's share of sales taxes from 
Bullock's and 34 of 149 mall stores, records show. Haagen has agreed to forgive 
any amount remaining on the loans after 2016. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Ovrom in 1989, a senior officer with the Alexander Haagen Co. 
warned that the city risked the chance of never attracting a top anchor store 
if it did not quickly agree to the terms of the Haagen loan. 
</P>
<P>
 * Under another agreement in April, 1993, the city gave Haagen all of its 
share of sales taxes generated over 10 years by Office Depot, Circuit City, and 
a restaurant, all located on land once reserved for office towers. 
</P>
<P>
 The city agreed to do so after claims from Haagen's company that the money was 
critical for the overall success of the project, public records show. 
</P>
<P>
 The amount of tax revenue to be transferred to Haagen from those businesses is 
projected to be $300,000 this year, according to Fred Bruning, senior vice 
president for Haagen. 
</P>
<P>
 * Last year, Haagen threatened to leave the mall project unfinished if the 
city interfered with his plans to raise new capital by taking his company 
public and offering shares for sale on the New York Stock Exchange, according 
to public records. The city eventually consented and Haagen has raised $374 
million by selling 10 million shares of the new firm, Alexander Haagen 
Properties, Inc., since last December. 
</P>
<P>
 Haagen owns 55,000 shares of the new firm and serves as chief executive 
officer, president and chairman of the board. 
</P>
<P>
 * Just six months later, Haagen had another demand. He asked the city to allow 
him to pledge the entire Media City Center as collateral for a $75-million line 
of credit Haagen said he needed. The city owns the land on which the mall was 
built, and Haagen has the right to stay for 99 years at rent of $1,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 It turned out to be the last straw, ending a partnership in a way few at City 
Hall could have imagined when it began. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, city officials had tried desperately to build a major shopping 
center in downtown Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Haagen came to Burbank with personal endorsements from Los Angeles County 
Supervisor Mike Antonovich and former Supervisor Kenneth Hahn. He had earned a 
solid reputation for daring to build large shopping centers in places most 
developers avoided, such as Watts and Baldwin Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Burbank officials in 1988, Haagen said his "high quality, 
innovative and exciting" project held great promise for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our belief in this concept and the future of Burbank is underwritten by our 
guarantees to the City for $100 million in revenues during the initial 20 years 
of project operations," according to the letter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Burbank Redevelopment Agency spent $55 million to purchase property, 
demolish existing buildings and relocate businesses, and another $14.2 million 
on aesthetic improvements to the surrounding area. 
</P>
<P>
 But the grand design was quickly compromised as plans for the office buildings 
and hotels dissolved. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Haagen said that he insisted all along that he could not 
build offices or hotels himself, but would work closely with a firm that could 
-- Homart Development Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Homart's inability to find any prospective tenants during the recession was 
"the disaster in this whole project," said Tom Clark, a Newport Beach attorney 
who served as the city's chief negotiator with Haagen from the beginning of the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 The consequent lack of tourists and white-collar workers needing a place to 
shop and dine led to low foot traffic throughout the mall and a vacancy rate as 
high as 30% to 40% among stores this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Another key element in the Media City Center's long-term viability was luring 
an upscale retailer. City officials were prepared in 1989 to borrow $18.5 
million from the developer to get the job done. 
</P>
<P>
 Haagen's chief financial officer, Seymour Kreshek, warned the city that 
Bullock's would move elsewhere unless millions of dollars more were invested, 
according to a letter in city files. 
</P>
<P>
 The Burbank Redevelopment Agency then agreed to borrow another $33 million 
from Haagen and repay it with property and sales taxes until 2016. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were so desperate to have a quality store, maybe we're lucky it didn't 
cost us more," said Mary Lou Howard, a former councilwoman. 
</P>
<P>
 "At one point in time, we were willing to give them fixtures, land, do 
everything," she said. "I don't think any of us dreamed having a center like 
this would cost so much. This isn't going to be paid off in any of our 
lifetimes." 
</P>
<P>
 When the proposed hotel and office towers were not built, city officials 
worried about how to make the overall project look complete, according to a 
1993 staff report. 
</P>
<P>
 Haagen offered to bring new retailers -- an Office Depot and Circuit City -- 
and a restaurant to the site until the market for hotels and offices improved. 
</P>
<P>
 But as part of the deal, Haagen wanted to keep the city's share of sales taxes 
from the new businesses -- money he said was needed to help bring the mall to 
full capacity and secure long-term financing, according to public documents. 
Last year the city agreed, diverting an estimated $300,000 annually in sales 
taxes to Haagen for use in mall operations. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't enough. Within months, Haagen asked the city for permission to go 
public with his firm, and in December offered investors around the world shares 
of his 36 Southern California properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Unsure of what the move meant, city officials consulted with Clark and other 
advisers, determined Haagen was merely refinancing his existing debt on the 
Media City Center, and gave the developer the go-ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the city wanted something from Haagen: a return of the sales tax 
from Office Depot and Circuit City. 
</P>
<P>
 In support of the request, Clark argued in a letter to Haagen that the council 
agreed to the diversion only because Haagen said it was critical to the success 
of the mall as a whole, and "not so the developer would realize a windfall." 
</P>
<P>
 In the same letter, Clark noted that the Burbank Redevelopment Agency has 
"already pledged virtually all of its available revenues from the center to 
Haagen." 
</P>
<P>
 The concession was not what Haagen had in mind. In a letter to then-Mayor 
George Battey, the developer wrote: "The staff's 'demands,' in my opinion, are 
truly unreasonable, unwarranted and excessive." 
</P>
<P>
 In the same letter, Haagen threatened to sell his interest in the Media City 
Center in 1994, when he contended he no longer needed the city's consent to do 
so. The city backed down. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hope was if we hang in there, we would at some point in the future" share 
in proceeds, Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Clark nor city officials anticipated what would come next: Haagen's 
desire to use the Media City Center as collateral to raise still more funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I really realized what the final package was until he brought 
it to us," Clark acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, such as Dossin and Howard, believe city officials and consultants were 
simply outsmarted by Haagen. 
</P>
<P>
 Current city officials dispute that point, saying the mall's opening in 1991 
was ill-timed, but represents a much-improved use of the land. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask mall tenants how business is doing and the answers are as varied as the 
merchants themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Most agree that the Northridge earthquake and subsequent closure of major 
shopping centers in the San Fernando Valley helped bring more people to the 
Media City Center. Prior to January, some said, business was "dead." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's incredibly slow, but we're still ahead 150% of last year in sales," said 
Manager Shawn DeCloedt of Expressly Portraits. "It may take getting more 
established. It just seems this mall needs a couple of more years." 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Circuit City and Office Depot are expected to do a healthy $20 
million and $10 million in sales this year, respectively, according to broker 
Steven Soboroff, who represents both chain stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Haagen's prospectus for the stock offering listed the mall's loss 
at $3.9 million for 1992 and $5.5 million for 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Haagen has had troubles with other municipal partners. He angered officials 
with the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency earlier this year by trying 
to end a partnership that helped open the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza. Both 
sides recently settled the dispute by agreeing to go their separate ways in 
1996, with a minimum payment of $1.35 million from Haagen to the city of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Burbank City Council has approved the $10-million buyout offer from 
Haagen, effective Nov. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of the buyout agreement, Haagen must pay the city $10 million 
total in separate payments during 1995 and 1996. In exchange, he obtains the 
right to develop two remaining parcels that were reserved for a hotel and 
office tower. The city loses its half interest in any profits, public documents 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the city wanted, I did," Haagen said. "If you look under the rocks, 
there was nothing but good intentions. We created things no one else has 
produced. Certainly, we didn't produce a bad shopping center." Media City 
Center Revenue Diversions 
</P>
<P>
 The Burbank Redevelopment Agency and Alexander Haagen Properties Inc., the 
partners who built the Media City Center shopping mall, have agreed to split 
up. In a deal that will become final Nov. 26, the city will surrender to Haagen 
its right to half the profits from mall operations in return for $10 million. 
But in a series of earlier agreements, the city has already diverted to Haagen 
millions of dollars in tax revenues generated by the mall.

GUNMAN KILLS 2 YOUTHS, SPARES GIRL WHO BEGS FOR HER LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 14-year-old girl who begged for her life was spared by a gunman who shot 
three of her friends, killing two of them and critically wounding the third in 
a sudden attack heard by residents of a quiet cul-de-sac, the youth and 
authorities said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The young girl frequently broke into tears as she recounted the brazen 
shooting of three men as they congregated around a car on North Highland Street 
on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought they were going to shoot me," the teen-ager said in Spanish. "I 
said to them, 'You know me, I'm your friend. I'm a woman.' I said, 'Please 
don't kill me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The girl's younger sister, who fled as the attack occurred, also escaped 
injury, both girls said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said they heard at least a dozen gunshots followed by the teen-ager 
pleading with the gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard a woman screaming, 'No! No! Not me!' " said a man who asked not to be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Police confirmed that the 14-year-old girl was in the car in the 2000 block of 
North Highland when 19-year-old Julio Damian Cerroblanco and Jorge Orozco, 21, 
were shot to death about 9:30 p.m. by a gunman with whom they had been arguing. 
A third victim, Jorge Avalos, 19, was in critical condition at UC Irvine 
Medical Center in Orange on Saturday. The victims, who suffered multiple 
gunshot wounds to their heads, were residents of Orange, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl was sitting inside the car at the end of the cul-de-sac with two of 
the victims while her sister and the other victim were outside, police said. 
The victims had been arguing with the suspects through a third party who was 
acting as a messenger, Police Lt. Timm Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said that after the final message was delivered, two men and a 
17-year-old boy charged out of an apartment. One of them repeatedly fired at 
the victims with a 9-millimeter handgun. Police identified the adult suspects 
as 22-year-old Maximino Garcia and his brother, Juan Jose Garcia, 20. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard many, many shots. I don't know how many," the 14-year-old girl said 
Saturday. "I said, 'Please don't hit my sister.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a lot of fear (today)," she added. "I'm scared. My head and ears hurt. 
I can still hear the shots." 
</P>
<P>
 "The boys killed my friend," the younger sister said. "Then, I ran." 
</P>
<P>
 Browne said the argument "just kind of escalated rather quickly. The suspects 
were in the apartment, the victims were outside and the argument was being 
carried on by a messenger." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the suspects and victims knew one another, but declined to discuss 
details of the argument. Neighbors said tensions between the two groups had 
been simmering for some time, and that threats had been made. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims' blood was still on the grass Saturday as friends set up a small 
memorial of flowers and candles where they were shot. Neighbors were huddled in 
groups, still talking about the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 The shootings are the eighth and ninth homicides in Orange this year, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects remained at large Saturday and may be headed for Mexico, police 
said. They were seen fleeing in a 1973 black or dark brown Mercury Cougar with 
California license plates 2YVA800. Anyone with information about the shooting 
or the suspects' whereabouts is asked to call Orange Police Detective Cathie 
Ralph at (714) 744-7575 or (714) 744-7494.

HUGE CUTS SOUGHT FOR POINT MUGU BASE; MILITARY: PENTAGON INSPECTOR GENERAL'S 
REPORT CALLS FOR RELOCATING MOST OF THE NAVAL OPERATIONS. VENTURA COUNTY 
LEADERS WARN OF IMPACT ON THE AREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. WEISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Pentagon report kept hidden from the public for five months recommends 
shutting down most of the Point Mugu Navy base, eliminating 1,049 military jobs 
and transferring about 3,000 to other institutions, The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 57-page report, the Defense Department's inspector general concludes 
that taxpayers could save $1.7 billion over 20 years if the Ventura County base 
moves most of its missile-testing operations to its sister base at China Lake 
in the upper Mojave Desert. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the report's accuracy and influence are disputed by Navy officials, 
it comes at a time when the Pentagon is weighing which bases to offer as 
sacrifices in next year's round of nationwide base closures. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very upset about it," said Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), who has 
joined a special task force of government and business leaders formed to 
protect Ventura County's Navy bases. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly said he has seen only "bits and pieces" of an early draft, but 
worries what it could mean for the county's largest employer. 
</P>
<P>
 The final report, obtained by The Times, has not been officially released. 
Gallegly and other members of the task force said they believe the report's 
conclusions cannot be used legally by other Pentagon officials in preparing a 
list of bases to close. 
</P>
<P>
 Issued to a small group of Pentagon officials June 8 over the strong 
objections of the Navy, the report recommends moving most of Point Mugu's 
operations and almost 2,000 jobs to the China Lake Navy base, about 150 miles 
northeast of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The consolidation, the report said, would "eliminate redundant or duplicative 
functions" at Point Mugu and China Lake, which both test high-tech weaponry as 
members of the Naval Air Warfare Center, Weapons Division. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 employees would remain to operate Point Mugu's airfield. But the 
report recommends eliminating 1,049 jobs at Point Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 1,083 workers would move to a nearby Navy facility at Port Hueneme so 
they could continue to operate Point Mugu's missile test range that spreads 
across 36,000 square miles of the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 The report does not address the 3,000 people who work on base as employees of 
defense contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving costs would run about $518 million, so the inspector general's auditors 
do not figure any net savings for the first six years. 
</P>
<P>
 The inspector general's report has been sharply criticized by Navy officials, 
who said its conclusions and analysis are based on inaccurate data and 
incorrect assumptions. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the report contends that Navy officials used "a very lenient 
interpretation" of rules that allowed them to exclude Point Mugu and China Lake 
from being seriously considered for consolidation in 1993 because of "unique" 
military features. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a memo to the inspector general, Assistant Navy Secretary Nora Slatkin 
wrote: "All technical centers, including Point Mugu, were evaluated in the 
course of the 1993 process on the basis of (proper) criteria. No activities 
were 'excluded' from this evaluation because of their unique geographic or 
mission-related characteristics." 
</P>
<P>
 Slatkin also criticized the inspector general's office for unfairly singling 
out a Navy base for closure without considering all military installations as 
required by the base closure and realignment law. 
</P>
<P>
 For that reason, she recommended that the inspector general's office delete 
from the report its recommendations to merge Point Mugu into China Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert J. Lieberman, the Defense Department's assistant inspector general for 
auditing, was the official overseeing the audit recommending Point Mugu's 
closure. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he stands by the report's conclusions that the two bases have programs 
with too much overlap. 
</P>
<P>
 And given the Navy's hostile reaction to the auditors and the report, he said 
his office has forwarded the recommendations to a higher level: those officials 
in the Defense secretary's office who are considering which bases nationwide to 
consolidate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Navy wasn't going to use it, that was clear," Lieberman said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that the inspector general's staff has a legitimate role in the base 
closure process because it has been assigned the responsibility of verifying 
all data submitted by the Navy and other military branches. 
</P>
<P>
 In this fourth and final round of base closures, the Defense Department will 
consider combining bases from different branches of the service. Overall, the 
secretary of defense has mandated a 15% reduction of the nation's military 
bases. 
</P>
<P>
 So it is possible that Point Mugu could be merged with Edwards Air Force Base 
or Vandenberg Air Force Base, or another military installation that tests 
missiles or other high-tech weaponry. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Point Mugu supporters have accused the inspector general's office of 
targeting Point Mugu at the behest of a competing Air Force base.

 "None of that is true," Lieberman said. "We initiated it based on our 
professional judgment. There wasn't any outside meddling." 
</P>
<P>
 Navy officials say Point Mugu has a unique function in the nation's military: 
It is the launching pad to the world's biggest sea test range, used daily by 
naval aircraft, ships and submarines in firing missiles and testing weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 China Lake is the Navy's largest base, stretching over 1,700 square miles of 
desert land -- nearly the size of Delaware. China Lake also has 17,000 square 
miles of airspace restricted to military aircraft and weapons testing. 
</P>
<P>
 All three branches of the military are scrutinizing which bases should close. 
Secretary of Defense William J. Perry is scheduled to release a recommended 
list in March. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, a federally appointed base closure commission will evaluate the 
list, hold public hearings and make its decision in July.

CALIFORNIA ALBUM; PROP. 187 PREVIEW FOLDED IN ENCINITAS IN 1980S; DESPITE ITS 
OWN BRUISING CIVIC BATTLE OVER ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS -- OR PERHAPS BECAUSE OF IT 
-- THE CITY KEPT A LOW PROFILE WHEN THE INITIATIVE PUT SIMILAR ISSUES ON 
STATEWIDE STAGE.

<P>
 In politics, as in theater, there are dress rehearsals where the plot and the 
players are displayed before a small audience before moving to the larger 
arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Proposition 187, now center stage from Eureka to San Ysidro. 
</P>
<P>
 If California is Broadway for this political-social-cultural drama, then 
Encinitas was New Haven. 
</P>
<P>
 This prosperous seaside suburb of San Diego -- known for its flower fields and 
youth sports programs and safe neighborhoods -- became the focal point in the 
late 1980s for the rising phenomenon in California of civic anger directed at 
illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 There were other communities in San Diego and Orange counties that heard 
similar complaints from their residents at roughly the same time as Encinitas. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the television networks, the wire services and the New York Times 
wanted to do stories on the growing clash between affluent Southern California 
homeowners and impoverished immigrants, they came to Encinitas. The beachfront 
setting proved journalistically irresistible. 
</P>
<P>
 For five acrimony-filled years, Encinitas homeowners demanded that City Hall 
do something about the groups of young Latino men standing on street corners 
soliciting work as day laborers and camping on private and public property. 
</P>
<P>
 A civic ordinance was adopted to penalize employers for hiring illegal 
immigrants off street corners, but it was struck down by a federal judge in 
1990. Those in Encinitas who had complained the loudest about immigrants in 
their midst reluctantly admitted defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Given that history, you might figure Encinitas would have become a hotbed of 
Proposition 187 support -- that those same residents and politicians, having 
seen their efforts thwarted, would have been overjoyed that at long last 
something was going to be done to discourage illegal immigration and that the 
governor was playing a leading role. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
 As the debate flared statewide, Encinitas (population 57,000) was quiet. If 
anything, the city took an outward attitude of "been there, done that." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was surprising what a non-issue 187 was here," said Gregory Dennis, a 
free-lance journalist, environmental consultant and Encinitas resident. 
</P>
<P>
 Catholic and Lutheran ministers in Encinitas and an official from the local 
synagogue were part of an ecumenical movement against Proposition 187, but the 
City Council declined to take a stand. There were no campaign signs on city 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the city decisively supported the initiative at the polls, there were 
no forums and no large demonstrations. Most of the letters to the local 
newspaper dealt with a hotly debated local measure about whether to allow 
construction of a subdivision and golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 Ex-Councilwoman Marjorie Gaines, whose high-voltage fights with immigrant 
advocates were an early indication of the level the emotional rhetoric would 
reach in the statewide immigration debate, took a hands-off attitude toward 
Proposition 187. "I have chosen not to be political," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the nine candidates for City Council was willing to commit the city to 
another round of trying to rid the streets and canyons of immigrants, even 
though the legal and political winds now seem to be favoring the 
employer-sanction approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we got last time was a bunch of bad national publicity," said Councilman 
John Davis at a candidates forum. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of newly arrived immigrants living in tents and cardboard lean-tos 
was waiting for the first City Council when the communities of Encinitas, 
Leucadia, Olivenhain and Cardiff-by-the-Sea incorporated as the city of 
Encinitas in 1986 to free themselves from the pro-growth attitude of the San 
Diego County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy gave the new city, 25 miles north of San Diego, a sense of 
being born into crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 At meetings that went long into the night, residents complained to the 
fledgling council of trash heaps, public urination and crime problems. Shop 
owners complained that their customers were being intimidated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody saw it coming but then the issue just exploded," said Dennis, who was 
managing editor of the North County Blade-Citizen during the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 In retrospect, the scenario appears familiar: Defining illegal immigration as 
a problem. Declaring a state of emergency. Appealing to the federal government 
for help. Sending the feds a bill. Devising a proposed solution that brought 
passionate opposition from the editorial pages and cries of racism from 
immigrant advocates. Protests in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never realized we were blazing a trail for the rest of the state," City 
Manager Loren Wasserman said with a touch of sarcasm in his voice. 
</P>
<P>
 By the standards of Proposition 187, the Encinitas ordinance was mild. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance would have slapped penalties on those who employ illegal 
immigrants rather than on the immigrants, the kind of employer-sanction 
approach that even some opponents of Proposition 187 say is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also part of a compromise whereby the city opened a hiring hall for 
documented immigrants, the first such hall in San Diego County, to ensure that 
employers would treat their day laborers fairly. 
</P>
<P>
 Pam Slater, who was on the Encinitas council and now is a county supervisor, 
says that if the Encinitas ordinance had been allowed to stand and been copied 
by other communities, it might have averted the political upheaval that led to 
passage of Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought we were going in the right direction (with the ordinance and 
hiring hall), but the migrant advocates blocked us at every turn," Slater said. 
"And they got Proposition 187 as a result." 
</P>
<P>
 A differing view comes from Claudia Smith, attorney for the California Rural 
League Assistance, which along with the American Civil Liberties Union sued to 
overturn the Encinitas ordinance and prevent the idea from spreading to other 
California communities. 
</P>
<P>
 To Smith, Encinitas residents were unwilling to accept the "shared humanity" 
of the immigrants. "To me, I thought it offended their aesthetic sensibilities 
to see these men standing out there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The years since the lawsuit have not softened Smith's view of Encinitas. She 
is still suing the city over its refusal to provide immigrant housing. She 
refuses to shop in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I refuse to patronize Encinitas," she said. "I hate Encinitas." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A city, of course, is more than just the sum of its public debates, and 
Encinitas has flourished despite the divisiveness of the immigration fight. 
</P>
<P>
 New subdivisions have the scrubbed, cheery look of the archetypal Southern 
California neighborhood in "E.T.," a paradise for kids on bikes. The median 
resale price of a home is $295,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic is still a hassle along the commercial intersection of Encinitas 
Boulevard and El Camino Real, but a good Cajun restaurant has opened along 
Pacific Coast Highway and the new athletic club, Frog's, received an award for 
architectural comeliness. 
</P>
<P>
 As for why Encinitas opted out of the Proposition 187 battle, it is anybody's 
guess. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis believes that the city has decided to give tolerance a chance and learn 
to live with the young men who still gather on street corners in the morning. 
"People came to understand that most of these guys are just looking for a job," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaines, who was defeated for reelection during the controversy, leans toward 
the idea that its five-year civic battle left Encinitas too exhausted over the 
topic to get emotionally involved in the fight again. 
</P>
<P>
 And she notes, with some irony, how the issue that cost her her political 
career has now moved to a bigger stage: 
</P>
<P>
 "It's strange, all the things we said then are what a lot of people are saying 
now."

TENTATIVE ACCORD REACHED IN S.F. NEWSPAPER STRIKE; LABOR: UNION WORKERS MAY 
RETURN TO THE JOB AS EARLY AS MONDAY. CONTRACT CALLS FOR ANNUAL RAISE OF 3%. 
</P>

<P>
 Picket lines were disbanded Saturday after a tentative agreement was reached 
for striking workers of San Francisco's two daily newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal would end a strike that began Nov. 1, when 2,600 reporters, 
salespeople, printers and delivery drivers walked off the job after more than a 
year of fruitless negotiations over salaries and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 One person died and several people were injured during the strike against the 
San Francisco Examiner and San Francisco Chronicle, the first walkout since a 
52-day strike 26 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers will vote on the contract today. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chronicle and Examiner might be produced with union workers as early as 
Monday, according to the San Francisco Free Press, a newspaper put out by 
striking reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers would get an average annual raise of 3% under the contract, which 
would expire in 1998, according to the Free Press. They had asked for a 3.5% 
raise; management had offered a 2.46% raise. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, all the workers will return to work without any threat of discipline 
except those convicted of a felony or those who "committed acts with the intent 
of causing bodily harm or serious property damage." 
</P>
<P>
 Other details of the contract were not released. 
</P>
<P>
 The tentative agreement was reached late Friday and announced early Saturday 
by the office of Mayor Frank Jordan, who stepped into the dispute eight days 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been a long and tiring process," Jordan said. "All San Franciscans, 
myself included, look forward to seeing the Chronicle and Examiner back on 
doorsteps and in the news racks." 
</P>
<P>
 The two papers, published under a joint operating agreement, are overseen by 
the San Francisco Newspaper Agency. The Conference of Newspaper Unions is the 
umbrella group for eight unions representing the workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Picket lines came down about 4:35 a.m., moments after the agreement was 
announced. The unions also withdrew their advertising and circulation boycotts. 
</P>
<P>
 The few pickets on duty cheered the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm ecstatic," said John Heise, a Teamster driver. "I have a family, three 
kids, a wife. She's been driving me crazy for days." 
</P>
<P>
 One striking trucker died a week ago when he was electrocuted, apparently 
trying to cut power to one of the newspapers' distribution plants. 
</P>
<P>
 The machinists union, the one striking group not represented by the 
conference, reached a tentative settlement late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The strike was needless and tragic, but I am glad it's over," Examiner Editor 
and Publisher William R. Hearst III said.

'I WAS IN THE WRONG PLACE AT THE WRONG TIME WITH THE WRONG MESSAGE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For two years, Kathleen Brown lived a candidate's life. She went without 
sleep. She gave up her family's privacy. She asked complete strangers for 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 She did all these things, made all these sacrifices, in the hopes of becoming 
governor. Instead, the state treasurer said with a sad smile, "I got hammered. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong message," Brown 
said the other day as she reflected on her failed bid to unseat Gov. Pete 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in her Hollywood Hills home, her feet tucked under her on a couch near 
a warm fire, Brown talked at length about what she described as a frustrating 
but exhilarating campaign -- one that taught her hard lessons, but also 
inspired her to believe more than ever in the future of California. 
</P>
<P>
 Disappointment often filled her voice, and at times Brown fought to control 
her emotions as she tried to explain how campaign advertisements, public 
appearances and her detailed, 62-page economic plan all failed to give the 
electorate a clear understanding of her or her program. In that regard, she 
said, "I don't think I was as effective as I might have been." 
</P>
<P>
 Although she at times spoke critically -- of Wilson, of the news media and of 
herself -- she said she was determined to be "a builder, not a blamer, to the 
end." Brown showered her campaign staff with praise. Her defeat, she said, was 
a product of the times. 
</P>
<P>
 "What frustrated me the most was my inability to successfully break through on 
the issues that I really cared about and thought were important -- like 
education and the economy and the (budget)," she said. "The people were too hot 
and bothered about these other emotional issues . . . illegal immigration and 
crime, where I embraced a philosophical position that went against the public 
emotion of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kept thinking, 'Well, the people want a better California and they want 
their schools to be better and they want their colleges to be affordable and 
accessible and they want someone who's going to clean up government and make it 
work. And that's something that we can rally around,' " she said. "But what I 
saw was how much easier and more facile a task it was to divide people, to find 
an enemy, to find a bogyman." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown talked with pride about her opposition to Proposition 187, the ballot 
measure to deny services to illegal immigrants that was approved by 59% of the 
electorate. Toward the end of her campaign, Brown mentioned the initiative in 
every speech, warning voters that it would only fuel racial tensions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hammered one more nail in my coffin, every single day that I spoke about 
it," Brown said with a wry laugh. But "it was a moral voice. It was a fight for 
California, for the new California that we're going to be living with no matter 
who's governor." 
</P>
<P>
 During the campaign's last weeks, as the debate raged over Proposition 187, 
Brown said, she was struck by memories of 1964, when her father, then-Gov. 
Edmund G. (Pat) Brown Sr., campaigned against Proposition 14, a constitutional 
amendment that voided state fair housing laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gave people the right to basically discriminate on who they sold their 
property to based upon race. It was clearly unconstitutional. . . . But it 
touched all of the hearthstone issues. It was about your home and your 
neighborhood and it went to some of these fundamental issues that swirl around 
the issue of race," said Brown. Californians overwhelmingly approved the 
measure, which was invalidated by the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes her father's speeches on Proposition 14, like a few of her own on 
Proposition 187, were met with "thunderous boos. I remember the hatred, the 
anger and the cheers -- the depth of raw emotion." 
</P>
<P>
 But then as now, Brown said, she does not fault the people who harbored those 
emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're voters who are struggling through their day. . . . They're frustrated 
and mad as hell and don't know what to do about it," she said. "But I do hold 
to account political leaders whose job it is to be not only an instrument of 
the public will, but also to be leaders in articulating the right way and the 
wrong way to solve these fundamental problems -- to channel that anger." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who watched Brown during the last days, when her campaign was so low on 
money that it could not afford to advertise on TV, marveled at her unflagging 
buoyancy. 
</P>
<P>
 "How did I keep doing it?" she asked, repeating a visitor's question. "I kept 
getting better, you know? I kept getting better! And the response of the 
people. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Her voice cracked and her eyes gleamed with tears. After a pause, Brown said: 
"I had an assignment, a task, a mission. If you're a general, you don't whine 
and you don't complain. You point the people in the direction they need to go 
to get to where you need to be. You take what you've got and you make the best 
you can out of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that is what I got from my mother and my father and the life that 
I've had. It was: Remember who you represent. Remember who you represent when 
you walk out the door. And I think that's what leaders are supposed to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown laments some mistakes, foremost among them a comment she made to a 
reporter that mischaracterized the death penalty position of Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein, Sen. Barbara Boxer and Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, among others. 
The comment, she said, came in exasperation when the reporter persisted in 
talking only about the death penalty and crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't regret anything else so much as I do that, because it hurt people 
that I respected and I never, ever, ever intended to do that," she said. "I 
didn't even remember saying it, you know? And then when it was published it was 
like, 'What?' And the use of that (in the ads of Feinstein's opponent, Rep. 
Mike Huffington) just pained me. I wanted to gobble up those words and put them 
back in my mouth." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown saved her harshest criticism for the news media, which she said seemed 
frequently to be more interested in tactics than in issues. She lamented that 
30-second advertisements had become the "grammar" of modern politics, and said 
she believed that too often, journalists allowed themselves to be driven by the 
advertising, instead of striving to set the agenda themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "The free press I think has abrogated their responsibility to be independent, 
to bring insight and to bring some courage to the pursuit of the issues that 
affect the common good," she said, noting that she wished reporters had pressed 
Wilson on how he would implement Proposition 187 and on what, specifically, he 
would do during his second term. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the coverage, she said, "was about how clever he was, how he defined 
the issues. Whether they were the issues that were going to make California a 
better place or not -- that was not something worthy of the press inquiry." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown also blasted the editorial positions of the San Francisco Chronicle, San 
Francisco Examiner, San Diego Union and Los Angeles Times for what she called 
the "ethical dishonesty" that led them to endorse Wilson while at the same time 
denouncing Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "To endorse, if not the author, the political godfather and major champion of 
an initiative that each denounced in the strongest terms stunned me," she said. 
"They didn't have to endorse me -- I certainly respect if people thought I was 
qualified or thought I wasn't. But there was a level of ethical dishonesty . . 
. that I found quite troubling." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's newest granddaughter, Vanessa, began crying in the next room. Her 
husband, Van Gordon Sauter, strolled out of his study and started mumbling 
about the importance of lunch. Brown glanced around her living room, where she 
has spent so little time lately, and for a moment looked completely content. 
</P>
<P>
 Her immediate plans include a two-week vacation in a "faraway land where no 
one knows me." Upon her return, she will finish out her term as treasurer -- 
"I've still got some more bonds to sell before I get into my wagon and head 
into the sunset," she said. After that, "I get to figure it out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a believer in getting into the arena. Get into the arena and fight. 
Don't just sit on the sidelines," she said, confirming that she plans to 
continue to work to serve the public interest, though she is not sure that 
means a job in conventional politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if she has any wisdom to impart, she said: "My advice, and it's the 
advice I gave myself, is if you ever run for public office, regard it as . . . 
an adventure and have the best time you can. Conduct yourself in a way that you 
won't have any regrets when you look back."

PALESTINIAN POLICE ARREST 115 MILITANTS IN CRACKDOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Palestinian police rounded up 115 activists, searched mosques and traded fire 
with gunmen Saturday in Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser 
Arafat's toughest campaign yet against Muslim militants. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palestinian Authority, headed by Arafat, also decided Saturday to forbid 
political rallies by opponents of the Israel-PLO accord and to put some Muslim 
leaders on its "wanted" list, a high-ranking Palestinian official said on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 The crackdown, long demanded by Israel, came a day after a suicide bomber from 
the militant Islamic Jihad blew himself up at an Israeli army checkpoint. Three 
Israeli reserve officers were killed, and 11 people were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel exerted fresh pressure on Arafat to rein in the militants, reminding 
him that security in the autonomous areas of Gaza and the West Bank town of 
Jericho was key to expanding Palestinian self-rule to the rest of the West 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened yesterday cannot be accepted," the Palestinian leader told his 
Cabinet on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat has been reluctant to confront Islamic militants, fearing a civil war 
that might topple his fragile government. But he is also worried that continued 
attacks on Israelis will wreck peace negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 The sweep began about 1 a.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police searched homes, hide-outs and several mosques, the senior PLO official 
said. The 115 people arrested were said to be mostly middle-ranking activists. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Sheik Radwan district of Gaza City, Islamic Jihad gunmen shot at 
police, who returned fire. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no reports of injuries, and the gunmen escaped. 
</P>
<P>
 Islamic Jihad's leaders were in hiding Saturday, the PLO official said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All Islamic Jihad leaders are considered on the 'wanted' list of the 
Palestinian Authority," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The strongest indicator that Arafat means business this time was his decision 
to outlaw political rallies by Islamic Jihad and its larger sister 
organization, Hamas. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Arafat had allowed political activity, hoping that it would 
encourage the two groups to seek a share of the power instead of challenging 
his government. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Friday, Islamic Jihad staged a rally of 3,000 supporters that coincided 
with the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Israeli leaders, acknowledging Arafat's difficult position, struck 
a conciliatory chord Saturday, suggesting that his security forces could not 
have prevented Friday's attack. 
</P>
<P>
 However, they demanded that he now do everything possible to find the 
ringleaders and win the upper hand over the militants.

 Hailing a "ferocious love of freedom," President Clinton today toured two of 
the Philippines' most hallowed World War II shrines to honor the fallen and try 
to strengthen the passionate but often-strained U.S.-Philippine alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first commemoration of Pacific fighting 50 years ago, Clinton scanned a 
sea of 18,000 Allied grave markers at the Manila American Cemetery and declared 
"time has diminished none of our pride in them. Their presence here reminds us 
of the meaning of courage and determination." 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing protects us in our freedom like the vigilance of memory," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's 20-hour Philippine stop was intended to signal the U.S. willingness 
to build a new relationship with its one-time colony, three years after the 
Philippine Senate voted to eject U.S. troops from the big Subic and Clark 
military bases. Leaving behind last week's stunning electoral defeat, Clinton 
is en route to a two-day Asian Pacific trade summit in Jakarta, Indonesia, 
where he will urge leaders of 16 other nations to work to overcome trade 
barriers. 
</P>
<P>
 Covering 152 acres, the Manila American Cemetery is the largest U.S. military 
grave site outside the United States. The gently rolling grounds are dotted 
with rows of identical marble crosses, encircling a central memorial made up of 
two marble-faced hemispheres on which are inscribed the names of 36,279 troops 
killed in the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Clinton strolled solemnly around Corregidor, the rocky island 
crouching at the mouth of Manila Bay that remains one of history's foremost 
symbols of resistance to overwhelming odds. A garrison of 12,000 U.S. and 
Philippine troops held out under sustained bombardment for one month in 1942 
before the Japanese completed their takeover of the island with a beach 
assault. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining Clinton at the cemetery was President Fidel V. Ramos, who vowed that 
"the Filipino people have not forgotten, and we will never forget their 
ultimate gift." 
</P>
<P>
 With Ramos and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton at his side, Clinton walked 
around Corregidor examining the scorched and bullet-pocked shell of the former 
army barracks and cinema. In a plaid, open-collared shirt and sunglasses, 
Clinton talked with Philippine veterans, but made no formal remarks. Before 
returning to Manila by helicopter he toured the maze of tunnels under the 
island where the desperate forces set up a headquarters, munitions dump and 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The Philippine campaign cost about 20,000 American lives and 320,000 Japanese. 
One million Filipinos out of a total population of 18 million died in the 
struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, some historians and Filipinos argued that the campaign may have been 
unnecessary, since the region proved to be unneeded for attacking Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 But others counter that the war would never have ended without the U.S. forces 
first taking on the huge Japanese garrison on the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton was formally received in the Philippines by Ramos at an earlier 
ceremony at Malacanang Palace, the state residence where former American 
governors and former President Ferdinand E. Marcos lived. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's arrival on Saturday, however, was marred by protests. Several 
hundred supporters of the leftist federation Sanlakas marched toward Clinton's 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 They yelled "Clinton out!" and called Ramos a "puppet" until they were 
dispersed by tear gas and water cannons. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Clinton also laid a wreath at the memorial to Jose Rizal, the gentle 
poet and physician who was accused by the Spanish of fomenting insurrection and 
executed in 1896, two years before the Spanish-American War put the islands in 
American control. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton had been invited to a commemoration last month of Gen. Douglas 
MacArthur's return to the island of Leyte, which marked a turning point in the 
war. In one sign of the delicacy of U.S.-Philippine relations, many Filipinos 
were angered when Clinton begged off, arguing that the event was too close to 
the American elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Later today, Clinton was to hold a one-hour diplomatic talk with Ramos that 
was expected to center on Ramos' desire for stronger economic ties between the 
two countries. 
</P>
<P>
 On the eve of talks with Clinton, Ramos said Saturday that there is a 
"possibility" the Philippines would consent to having the United States set up 
nearby the kind of floating military depot the Pentagon says it badly needs for 
regional crises. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramos stressed that the idea, which has already been rejected by at least one 
Asian government -- Thailand -- would need to go through a several-step 
consideration by Philippine and U.S. officials. But in an interview at 
Malacanang Palace, he also indicated that he did not want to reject the idea 
out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've not seen any formal proposal . . . but looking at this at a working 
level is a possibility," Ramos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials would like to have a floating depot where they could store 
enough equipment and supplies to sustain one heavy brigade for 15 days, for 
military or disaster relief operations in the Mideast or the Korean peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 As proposed to Thai officials, the plan would include up to 850,000 square 
feet of storage for equipment that would include M-1A1 Abrams tanks and M-2A2 
Bradley fighting vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 The gear would be stored on half a dozen huge ships or barges outside the 
territorial limits. Some maintenance would be required, but the plan envisions 
no need for accompanying troops. 
</P>
<P>
 In turning down the proposal, a Thai spokesman said that "establishing any 
armed depot in the Gulf of Thailand could lead to misunderstanding among other 
countries of the region." He was presumably referring to China, which with its 
great size and growing power is a source of anxiety to many governments in the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 Indonesia and Malaysia are also reported to have rejected the plan. Indonesian 
Foreign Minister Ali Abdullah Alatas has been quoted as saying that the balance 
of a U.S. presence in Asia is needed, but not in the form of military bases.

E. TIMOR PROTESTERS INVADE U.S. EMBASSY IN JAKARTA 
</P>

 Twenty-nine students scaled an eight-foot fence to invade the U.S. Embassy 
grounds Saturday in protest over Indonesian abuses in East Timor, while in 
Dili, the Timorese capital, thousands of demonstrators took to the streets 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 At the U.S. Embassy, the protesters sat cross-legged facing Indonesian riot 
police on the other side of the fence. The protesters refused to budge, despite 
a government promise that they would not be arrested if they left voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene, marking the third anniversary of a massacre in East Timor by 
Indonesian soldiers, embarrassed President Suharto on the eve of the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, which starts Tuesday and will be 
attended by President Clinton and 16 other leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, due to fly in late today, will be confronted by the spectacle of the 
students squatting in the embassy parking area. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher, in town for meetings before the summit, 
said the issue of East Timor would be raised during bilateral talks with 
Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
 The protesters said they specifically sought the release of former guerrilla 
leader Jose (Xanana) Gusmao. He is serving a 20-year jail term for his role in 
heading an armed rebellion for East Timor's independence. 
</P>
<P>
 Embassy spokeswoman Pamela Smith said the protesters would not be forced to 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident angered Indonesia's government, which had hoped the economic 
forum would allow the country to shake off its poor human rights image. It is 
accused of abuse and brutality, especially concerning the 1976 annexation of 
East Timor, a former Portuguese colony. 
</P>
<P>
 The protest "was obviously designed to embarrass us," said Foreign Minister 
Ali Abdullah Alatas. 
</P>
<P>
 It was three years ago Saturday that soldiers killed scores of unarmed 
civilians at Santa Cruz cemetery in Dili. A government inquiry said 50 people 
were killed, though independent sources put the figure at more than 200. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents in Dili, contacted by telephone from Jakarta, said hundreds of young 
people protesting rule from Jakarta marched in the central marketplace today 
and a second, bigger demonstration took place over the killing Saturday of a 
Timorese by an Indonesian trader. 
</P>
<P>
 One resident, who asked not to be identified, said: "Many roads in the city 
are blocked by people. There are thousands of demonstrators."

<P>
 After a secret trial without defense lawyers, a prominent Chinese journalist 
was sentenced to six years in prison under a security law that has cast a chill 
over China's media, human rights groups said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gao Yu, 50, was convicted this week of "leaking state secrets," the human 
rights groups said.She is believed to have been arrested for writing about 
Chinese politics for a Hong Kong magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gao's detention and trial violate all international standards of due process 
of law," said William A. Orme, executive director of the Committee to Protect 
Journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Gao, the former deputy editor-in-chief of the defunct Economic Weekly 
newspaper, is one of more than 20 journalists detained in the past four years 
on charges ranging from leaking state secrets to "counterrevolutionary sabotage 
and incitement."

U.S. WILL HONOR BOSNIA ARMS EMBARGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher, attempting to soothe American allies on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, promised Saturday that Washington will not break a U.N. 
embargo by supplying weapons to Muslim forces. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. decision to withdraw from the international naval blockade enforcing 
the embargo has upset countries that have troops serving with the U.N. 
Protection Force in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher -- in Jakarta, Indonesia, for the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation forum -- said the United States has no intention of supplying 
weapons to Muslim-led Bosnian government forces. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton ordered U.S. warships in the Adriatic to stop intercepting 
vessels suspected of smuggling arms for the Muslims beginning midnight 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't say it will have no effect, but I would not say it will have a 
significant effect because the arms embargo will be enforced by others," 
Christopher said. 
</P>
<P>
 He stressed that the United States will continue to apply the embargo to 
Bosnian Serbs, and that the U.S. Air Force will remain active in the task force 
enforcing a "no fly" zone over Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 European nations and other countries, which unlike the United States have 
peacekeeping troops on the ground in Bosnia, fear that any modification of the 
U.N. embargo will expose their soldiers to Bosnian Serb retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 The embargo was imposed in 1991 in an attempt to contain conflict as the 
Yugoslav federation disintegrated. 
</P>
<P>
 Muslim forces, outgunned by their Bosnian Serb foes throughout 31 months of 
fighting, improved their battlefield performance in recent weeks thanks to a 
flow of contraband light arms. 
</P>
<P>
 But those first gains of the war looked in serious danger this weekend in 
northwest Bosnia, where Bosnian Serb troops have clawed back territory that was 
lost around the Bihac pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. spokesman Koos Sol said the military situation was "highly tense and 
unstable with the (Bosnian Serbs) tightening the loop around Bihac."

1 MILLION CONVERGE ON ROME TO PROTEST CUTBACKS; ITALY: IN THE CITY'S LARGEST 
DEMONSTRATION SINCE WWII, MARCHERS OPPOSE PLAN TO SLASH PENSIONS, SOCIAL 
SERVICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Factory worker Eduardo Fumagalli rode all night on a train to help deliver a 
message that rolled like thunder -- 1 million voices strong -- over a swollen, 
partisan Rome on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are here to explain that something is wrong. A rich man's government is 
stealing from the poor," said Fumagalli, a 48-year-old woodworker from the 
northern city of Lecco. 
</P>
<P>
 In what organizers called the largest street demonstration in Rome since World 
War II, labor unions delivered a stinging rebuttal to plans by billionaire 
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi to slash pensions and social services. 
</P>
<P>
 It was worker against government, left against right, in the latest round of 
labor counterattack against belt-tightening by Berlusconi's young, conservative 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers flocked to Rome for spirited, peaceful protests that overflowed three 
of the Eternal City's most historic public spaces in simultaneous 
demonstrations -- the Piazza del Popolo, the Circus Maximus and the giant 
piazza before the basilica of St. John Lateran. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new budget restricts pensions, health care and funds for the development 
of the south. All the cuts are against those Italians who have the least," 
complained Fausto Pastori, a 45-year-old valve maker from Legnano, near Milan. 
</P>
<P>
 In Circus Maximus, the amphitheater where chariots raced in Roman times, 
skyscraper cranes dangled giant loudspeakers broadcasting labor's outrage 
across a vast, colorful and good-natured crowd gathered under the flags of 
unions and left-wing political parties. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will not have it!" screamed a giant banner on the podium where speakers 
railed against Berlusconi's proposed 1995 budget cuts of $33 billion, which 
would reduce the government deficit by one-third. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi says he will demand parliamentary approval of the budget in a vote 
of confidence Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't change the numbers, not with one strike or with 10 strikes. The 
numbers are there. I found them; I didn't produce them," Berlusconi told 
reporters during a nationwide general strike last month that set the stage for 
Saturday's protest. 
</P>
<P>
 On a cloudless autumn day with just enough breeze to set flags and banners 
snapping, police agreed with organizers that the three Rome demonstrations drew 
more than 1 million people. 
</P>
<P>
 The atmosphere was festive, but it masked a swelling sense of alarm among 
Italian workers watching the dismantlement of one of Europe's most 
comprehensive social safety nets. There have been strikes all autumn -- with 
more to come. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started work at 14 with the promise that I could retire after 35 years with 
a decent pension. The promise is broken and they say I should buy a private 
pension. Even if I had the money, where would I get one -- from one of 
Berlusconi's insurance companies?" asked Mario Lafela, 44, a metalworker from 
Milan who brought his wife and teen-age daughters to demonstrate with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabinet spokesman Giuliano Ferrara told Italian television that the disputed 
budget is "in the interest of future generations" and said Saturday's 
demonstration had turned into a generalized anti-government protest. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi, a political rookie, sprang to power last spring from the ashes of 
a political Establishment destroyed by a corruption scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempting to balance the books -- government debt equals a staggering 123% of 
last year's gross national product -- Berlusconi has attacked social programs 
that were sacred cows for nearly half a century. 
</P>
<P>
 The new budget proposes spending cuts in education, defense, scientific 
research and health care, but the biggest cutbacks target a generous pension 
system often scored for its corruption.

ATHLETES SEEN INVOLVED IN MORE CAMPUS SEX CRIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new study suggesting that varsity athletes are more likely than other 
college men to commit sexual assaults on campus raises serious concerns, an 
NCAA spokeswoman says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we all recognize that there is some evidence that there's a problem 
involving male student athletes and sexual assault," Kathryn Reith said from 
NCAA headquarters in Overland Park, Kan."It's an indication we need to take it 
seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Crosset, a University of Massachusetts sports management professor, and 
Jeffrey Benedict, a Northeastern University graduate student, studied 107 cases 
of rape, attempted rape and fondling at 30 schools in the National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. Division I. 
</P>
<P>
 Judicial affairs office records from 10 of the schools showed male student 
athletes were more likely to be perpetrators in on-campus sexual assaults than 
non-athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 Figures from 1990 to 1993 showed student athletes made up 3.3% of all male 
students but 19% of those who carried out assaults. 
</P>
<P>
 Campus police records from the other 20 schools showed no significant 
difference. Those figures, from the 1992-93 academic year, showed male student 
athletes made up 3.7% of male students and 5.3% of the perpetrators. 
</P>
<P>
 The schools were not identified. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers said they couldn't explain the difference between the two sets 
of statistics, but when they were looked at together, "athletes appear to be 
disproportionately involved in sexual assaults on college campuses." They said 
more study is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's enough evidence out there to say: 'OK, we've got a problem. 
How do we fix it?"' Crosset said. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Sabo, a sports sociology professor at D'Youville College in Buffalo, N.Y., 
said the study is the most rigorous of its kind so far. 
</P>
<P>
 But he emphasized that a small percentage of student athletes commit sexual 
assaults.

SHUTTLE ATLANTIS CREW RETRIEVES SATELLITE MEASURING OZONE LAYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Racing high over the South Seas, the space shuttle Atlantis' astronauts on 
Saturday captured a German satellite carrying vital measurements of Earth's 
shrinking ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
 Appropriately, the satellite was retrieved just north of Antarctica and its 
infamous ozone hole, south of New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Super! Super!" German scientists shouted in the satellite-control room at 
Kennedy Space Center as astronaut Ellen Ochoa grabbed the spacecraft with 
Atlantis' robot arm. They celebrated with coffee and gummy bears. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not what you usually do when something important happens. You usually 
have a glass of champagne. We will do this on Monday," when Atlantis returns to 
Earth with the satellite, German physicist Klaus Grossmann said. 
</P>
<P>
 The astronauts had released the $35-million satellite eight days earlier so it 
could observe ozone and other atmospheric gases without interference from 
Atlantis. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuttle commander Donald McMonagle flew over and around the 7,500-pound, 
triangular satellite, then hovered directly below at an altitude of 186 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like a diamond in the sky," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 McMonagle closed in on the satellite from below, testing a new approach to be 
used during Atlantis' next flight -- the first of seven to 10 dockings with 
Russia's Mir space station. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuttles typically approach orbiting spacecraft from the front. By approaching 
from below, McMonagle used Earth's gravity as a natural brake and thereby 
minimized the need for jet firings. NASA wants to avoid jet firings when 
Atlantis links with Mir in June to protect the station's delicate solar panels 
from exhaust. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a superb rendezvous," Mission Control told the crew. "You've given 
us some important data and a lot of confidence. Well done." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the high point for the six astronauts. They kept a rather low profile 
last week, watching over atmospheric monitors flying on the shuttle, testing 
experimental heat pipes and checking on 10 pregnant rats. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very exciting, especially the view of the satellite," Ochoa said 
before anchoring the satellite in the cargo bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Grossmann and other scientists are eager to get the satellite back. Hardly any 
measurements were beamed to the ground; virtually everything was stored on 
tapes on board. 
</P>
<P>
 Infrared telescopes on the satellite collected 15 million images of the 
atmosphere, measuring up to 14 atmospheric gases per second. Researchers want 
to know how these gases interact. 
</P>
<P>
 The thin, invisible layer of ozone in the stratosphere protects humans, 
animals and plants from dangerous ultraviolet radiation. It's especially thin 
over the Antarctic, where a hole the size of North America forms every 
September because of man-made chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 An ultraviolet instrument on the satellite measured gases responsible for 
ozone destruction. Six instruments aboard Atlantis also surveyed the ozone 
layer as well as solar energy; the seventh broke early in the 11-day mission.

NEW LIFE'S SPIRITUAL THERAPY DRAWS PRAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE MARQUIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When New Life Treatment Centers was founded in 1988, it filled what its 
advocates call an important niche in the therapeutic community: a place for 
Christians to seek both psychological and spiritual solace. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, "thousands of people . . . have come here from all over the 
country and made dramatic changes for the better in their lives," said New Life 
founder Stephen Arterburn. 
</P>
<P>
 Arterburn and New Life supporters say six lawsuits alleging that three care 
providers engaged in sexual or other misconduct in two Orange County programs 
in no way represent patients' general experience in New Life programs. 
</P>
<P>
 As evidence, Arterburn cited a patient survey in which 82% of respondents said 
they would refer others to the programs. One reason for the program's quality 
and safety, he said, is that New Life has "the highest (staff-to-patient) ratio 
that I know of." 
</P>
<P>
 Arterburn and several New Life advocates describe the organization as much 
more than a business; they consider it a "mission" or a "ministry." 
</P>
<P>
 However one describes New Life, it has done brisk business, especially in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past six years, the for-profit organization has fielded about 220,000 
inquiries and treated more than 20,000 patients at some 20 centers around the 
country. About 11,000 of those have been treated at its two inpatient programs 
in Orange County -- a 50-bed program at Orange County Community Hospital in 
Buena Park and a 80-bed program at Western Medical Center-Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization does extensive advertising around the country tailored to the 
Christian community, budgeting $2 million for publicity in 1990, according to 
news stories at the time about the growth of Christian-based therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1990 article in Modern Healthcare, a business magazine, Arterburn said 
that combining psychiatric and spiritual approaches to therapy is a way to 
attract a lucrative and as yet untapped market. 
</P>
<P>
 New Life acts as what Arterburn calls a "contract management company," 
collecting from the hospitals a portion of what patients and their insurance 
companies pay. In exchange, New Life manages the psychiatric units and provides 
non-nursing care. 
</P>
<P>
 Arterburn said New Life does not make financial arrangements with patients. 
Rather, the hospitals where its programs are based do that and may offer breaks 
to strapped patients, such as free plane tickets or waivers on insurance 
deductibles. New Life intake workers, Arterburn said, often act as advocates 
for needy patients. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Orange County programs, assuming an inpatient stay of about 10 days, 
Arterburn said adult patients and their insurance companies would pay an 
average of $6,188, of which New Life would collect $2,288 -- "well within 
reason" compared to other psychiatric providers, Arterburn said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the success of New Life, supporters said, cannot be measured solely in 
economic terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Several mental health professionals who have worked at New Life or sent 
patients there say the organization provides a vital, high-quality resource to 
patients who often are uncomfortable with secular therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've worked with patients in every psychiatric hospital" in a 30-mile radius, 
said marriage, family and child counselor (MFCC) Kevin Downing of Diamond Bar. 
"I feel their program is head and shoulders above what was previously 
existing." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange psychologist Patricia Cerny said New Life's work is "really 
outstanding" because it addresses "every aspect of the human condition -- the 
mental, the physical and the spiritual. They take an (approach) that really 
addresses the whole person. They're very compassionate, straightforward and 
strong." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the allegations in the lawsuits against New Life programs and its care 
providers, supporters expressed everything from skepticism and surprise to 
sadness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very grieved over these types of allegations because of what its effect 
is on the program," said Pamela Rice, an MFCC intern, who has worked at New 
Life centers. "I know it is a wonderful program."

MICROSOFT'S GATES REVEALED AS LEONARDO'S MYSTERY BUYER; AUCTION: PURCHASE OF 
CODEX HAMMER CREATES A NEW ROLE FOR COMPUTER INDUSTRY GIANT. THE MANUSCRIPT 
WILL BE DISPLAYED IN ITALY PRIOR TO A WORLD TOUR, AN AIDE SAID. 
</P>

<P>
 Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates was identified Saturday as the anonymous 
buyer of an illustrated manuscript by Leonardo da Vinci that sold at auction 
for a record $30.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates' purchase on Friday of the scientific manuscript by the Italian 
Renaissance master has created a new role for the computer industry giant, 
several art experts said. Formerly known to the museum world as a champion of 
digitized images -- and something of a threat to the integrity of original 
artworks -- he is now cast as the American savior of a rare, 72-page document, 
laboriously written and illustrated by an artist's hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates, 39, who was listed this year by Forbes magazine as the nation's richest 
man, with assets of $9.2 billion, could not be reached for comment, but 
Microsoft spokeswoman Mich Matthews said Saturday that Gates plans to display 
the manuscript in Italy for one year and then send it on a worldwide tour of 
museums. 
</P>
<P>
 If those plans develop, Gates also will likely emerge as a public-spirited 
supporter of a unique, hand-made treasure that predates computer technology by 
four centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonardo's vast scientific treatise, known as the Codex Hammer, was sold at 
Christie's New York auction house on behalf of the UCLA/Armand Hammer Museum of 
Art and Cultural Center. The museum was founded in 1990 by Hammer, the late 
chairman of Occidental Petroleum Corp., and the university took over its 
management in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Museum officials consigned the valuable document to auction to establish a 
reserve fund as a hedge against potential legal expenses incurred by Hammer's 
estate. Christie's had estimated the value of the Leonardo at over $10 million. 
Hammer purchased it in 1980 at a London auction for the then-record price of 
$5.62 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately following the Friday morning sale, Christie's identified the buyer 
only as an anonymous private collector. The Seattle Post-Intelligencer later 
disclosed that the new owner is Gates, whose computer software empire is based 
in the Seattle suburb of Redmond. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the UCLA/Hammer Museum greeted Gates' purchase as an 
auspicious development. "That's good news," museum director Henry T. Hopkins 
said. "And it makes perfect sense. There's a certain logic to a scientific whiz 
being interested in a scientific manuscript." 
</P>
<P>
 Hopkins also praised Gates' reported plans to make the document available to 
the public. "He may find pleasure in having it out and about. I would hope so," 
Hopkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Museum trustee Eli Broad also welcomed the news. "It's a good thing," Broad 
said. "I'm delighted that the manuscript will stay in the United States, and 
that it will not go to Seoul or even to Italy, or get hidden away in a vault in 
Switzerland." 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to the sale, Christie's had taken the manuscript on tour to Milan, 
Zurich, Seoul and Tokyo, leading to speculation that the buyer would be from a 
foreign country. The under-bidder at the auction was Milan's Cariplo 
Foundation, which is backed by one of Italy's largest banks. 
</P>
<P>
 The news created something of a sensation in Gates' hometown. "This bodes well 
for Seattle," Mary Gardner Neill, director of the Seattle Art Museum said in a 
telephone interview. "I haven't talked to Bill Gates, but we hope that the 
manuscript will go on public view. I will do everything I can to see that it is 
displayed at our museum at the earliest possible date." 
</P>
<P>
 Gates became known in the art world as an adversarial figure in the mid-1980s 
when his representatives began to approach museums in an effort to buy 
reproduction rights to artworks for an immense digital image bank. The use of 
the images had not been determined, leading museum professionals to worry that 
selling reproduction rights to Gates would lead to a plethora of undignified 
art images on coffee mugs, T-shirts and shower curtains. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Gates only sought to buy non-exclusive reproduction rights, museum 
officials also feared that his enterprise would diminish the income that art 
museums receive from selling one-time reproduction rights to works in their 
collections. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue became such a hot topic of discussion that the Assn. of Art Museum 
Directors staged its annual meeting in Seattle last June and featured Gates as 
keynote speaker. In his speech, Gates told the directors that technology is a 
fact of life with which they would have to deal. But he also attempted to allay 
fears that digital reproductions will replace museum audiences with mouse 
potatoes who only look at art on computer screens. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of these concerns dissipated as museums have entered the computer age by 
developing interactive programs for education and outreach. In the meantime, 
Microsoft has published "Art Gallery," a CD-ROM featuring more than 2,000 
images from the collection of London's National Gallery. Another Gates' 
company, Continuum Productions Corp. in Bellevue, Wash., has purchased 
non-exclusive reproduction rights to artworks in the collections of the Seattle 
Art Museum, the Russian Art Museum in St. Petersburg and the Barnes Foundation 
in Merion Station, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates also has become an art world player by developing an interactive 
computer program for the Seattle Art Museum. According to Neill, the museum is 
partly responsible for his purchase of the Leonardo manuscript. Chiyo Ishikawa, 
the museum's associate curator of European painting, notified Gates about the 
auction of the Hammer Codex and suggested that he buy it, Gardner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not previously known as a champion of original artworks, Gates has designed a 
system for projecting large digitalized images of paintings on high-definition 
TV screens built into the walls of his new home, creating a changing array of 
masterpieces. 
</P>
<P>
 Although art experts generally consider the Leonardo to be more significant as 
a scientific document than an artwork, the manuscript is the first important 
piece by a major artist that Gates is known to have purchased.

70% OF VOTERS FELT INFORMED, POLL FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Despite the charges, countercharges and remarkably angry tenor of this year's 
congressional campaigns, nearly three out of four voters say they feel they 
learned enough about the candidates to make informed choices, according to a 
new post-election survey of voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey, conducted as voters left the polls on Tuesday and released 
Saturday by the Times Mirror Center for the People & the Press, found that 70% 
of respondents said they were satisfied with the amount of political 
information they received during the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 In California's U.S. Senate race, 72% of those who voted for the apparent 
victor, incumbent Democrat Dianne Feinstein, said they had learned enough about 
the candidates and the issues. Similarly, 76% of those who voted for her 
challenger, Rep. Mike Huffington (R-Santa Barbara), said they were satisfied 
with the amount of information they received. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of last week's congressional races have been characterized as contests in 
which voters frustrated with what they see as a gridlocked government cast 
ballots against incumbent lawmakers or majority Democrats, even if they knew 
little about the challengers. 
</P>
<P>
 But survey director Andrew Kohut said respondents who characterized their 
votes as anti-incumbent in nature were no more likely to report dissatisfaction 
with the amount of available information than were those who were more familiar 
with the candidates they supported. 
</P>
<P>
 "The conclusion we draw is that in this extremely negative campaign, the 
voters feel illuminated," Kohut said. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the most vitriolic campaigns, the Virginia U.S. Senate race that 
focused on alleged marital infidelity by incumbent Democrat Charles S. Robb and 
Iran-Contra perjury by Republican challenger Oliver L. North, 83% of those who 
voted for either Robb or North said they had sufficient information to cast 
their votes on an informed basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who voted for third-party or independent candidates, however, 
there was slightly less satisfaction with available information. In the 
Virginia race, for example, 77% of those who voted for independent J. Marshall 
Coleman said they had learned enough about the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, Republicans seemed marginally more satisfied with the amount of 
information they received than Democrats, while those who identified themselves 
as supporters of 1992 independent presidential candidate Ross Perot were the 
least satisfied. Among Perot supporters, only 65% said they had learned enough 
about the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey found that 62% of those who had not completed high school said they 
had learned enough. The satisfaction level increased with additional education, 
reaching 74% among college graduates. Similarly, the number rose along with 
income levels. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll found that voters in the West were less likely to say they had 
learned enough than those in other regions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Mirror Center survey was conducted among voters as they left polling 
places on Tuesday. It questioned 5,260 voters across the country, with a margin 
of error of plus or minus one percentage point for national findings. The 
margin of error in statewide samples was one percentage point. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Mirror Co., parent of the center, is the owner of the Los Angeles 
Times and other newspaper, broadcasting and publishing enterprises.

RESEARCHERS LINK ANXIETY, SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Men who complain of high anxiety are up to six times more likely than calmer 
men to suffer sudden cardiac death, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
 Anxiety is proving to be one of the strongest risk factors for sudden cardiac 
death, even more so than smoking, said Dr. Ichiro Kawachi, assistant professor 
of health and social behavior at the Harvard School of Public Health. 
</P>
<P>
 Sudden cardiac death is an electrical phenomenon that throws off the rhythm of 
the heart. It is different from a heart attack, which occurs when a clot inside 
the artery causes a blockage of blood flow. 
</P>
<P>
 Although scientists do not fully understand how it happens, intense 
psychological stress may trigger episodes of irregular heart rhythms that lead 
to sudden death, said Kawachi, the lead researcher on two studies done by 
separate teams of Boston scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 One was a 32-year study of 2,280 men, published in the November issue of 
Circulation, a journal of the Dallas-based American Heart Assn. The project was 
established by the Veterans Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants were asked five questions about their anxiety level, including: 
"Do strange people or places make you afraid?" and "Do you often become 
suddenly scared for no good reason?" 
</P>
<P>
 Their answers helped researchers construct an anxiety scale ranging from zero 
to five. During 32 years of follow-up, 131 cases of fatal coronary heart 
disease, including 26 sudden cardiac deaths, occurred among the participants. 
</P>
<P>
 The risk of sudden cardiac death was 4 1/2 times higher in the study's anxious 
participants than it was in men who reported no symptoms of anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
 In the journal's May issue, Kawachi and another team of researchers reported 
the results of a two-year study of about 40,000 male health professionals. They 
were asked eight questions about their anxiety, such as, "Do you find yourself 
worrying about getting some incurable illness?" and "Do you worry when 
relatives are late coming home?" 
</P>
<P>
 The risk of sudden cardiac death was six times higher among the most anxious 
than it was among those who had no symptoms of "phobic" anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, the risk of sudden cardiac death among smokers was only twice 
as high as it was among nonsmokers, Kawachi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Gary Weingarden, a Dallas-area cardiologist not involved in either study, 
said Friday that stress could be a contributing factor in heart failure. But he 
did not believe a person would drop dead simply because of high anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
 He said possible underlying causes could be coronary artery disease, or a 
weakened or abnormal heart muscle. 
</P>
<P>
 Because only men were included in both studies, Kawachi and his colleagues now 
are looking at anxiety levels among more than 200,000 women in another 
Harvard-based study.

REVIEW OF USAIR SHOWED SAFETY, TRAINING PROBLEMS; TRANSPORTATION: MORE THAN 40 
DEFICIENCIES IN FLIGHT OPERATIONS, TRAINING PROGRAMS ARE FOUND. AIRLINE'S CHIEF 
SAYS RECENT ACCIDENTS AREN'T CONNECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press

<P>
 USAir has allowed jets to leave gates without enough fuel at least nine times 
and once used a jet for 13 days despite a dangerous crack on its wing flap, 
according to a newspaper report. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite recent assurances from USAir and federal officials, a two-month review 
of the nation's sixth-largest airline showed numerous safety and training 
problems, the New York Times reported today. 
</P>
<P>
 In one example, the pilots of a Washington-to-Boston flight did not check to 
see if the plane had enough fuel. When they were forced to land at La Guardia 
Airport in New York, they lied and radioed the control tower that they had to 
land due to engine trouble. After they landed, the captain acknowledged there 
had been no engine trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight other USAir flights have left the gate without the federally required 
amount of fuel since the airline eliminated two pre-flight refueling checks 16 
months ago, records showed. One of the planes returned to the airport and 
another reached its destination. It was unclear what happened on the other 
flights. 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper's report was based on interviews of airline employees and safety 
officials, and thousands of pages of court files and safety reports, many 
obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation followed the Sept. 8 crash of a USAir Boeing 737 near 
Pittsburgh International Airport that killed all 132 aboard. In July, a USAir 
jet crashed in Charlotte, N.C., in a thunderstorm, killing 37 of 57 people 
aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 USAir executives told the newspaper that the accidents are not connected and 
there is no reason to draw negative conclusions about safety. They also denied 
that financial troubles had had any effect on safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it comes to safety, we are well within the mean range, and better than 
some," Seth E. Schofield, USAir's chairman and chief executive, told the 
newspaper. "The reality is that if I thought the airline was unsafe, I would 
ground every plane." 
</P>
<P>
 The report also found: 
</P>
<P>
 * USAir violated federal regulations by permitting a plane to fly for 13 days 
without repairs to a dented and cracked wing flap. In another case, a plane was 
allowed to fly for a day without an operating stall-warning system. After 
telling the captain it could not be fixed immediately, a mechanic falsified a 
report to state it was fixed so the flight would not be canceled. The mechanic 
was suspended for 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 * A team of inspectors with the Federal Aviation Administration last year 
found more than 40 deficiencies in USAir's flight operations and training 
programs for its more than 5,000 pilots. 
</P>
<P>
 * USAir loses more than $2 million a day and is more than $2 billion in debt, 
causing some employees to feel pressure to keep planes flying.

GINGRICH SCOFFS AT INQUIRY INTO COURSE FUNDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich, in line to become the next Speaker of the 
House, dismissed as a "nonsense issue" allegations that his political action 
committee improperly developed and financed a college course he taught last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich confirmed Saturday that the House Ethics Committee is examining 
questions about whether the course was educational or constituted political 
activity aimed at helping GOP candidates. The panel is to hold a hearing on the 
issue Nov. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most bizarre thing I've been involved in in my career," Gingrich 
said on CNN's "Evans & Novak." But he said his political action committee, 
GOPAC, did offer "ideas" on the initial financing of the course. 
</P>
<P>
 "In order to make the course available on television and . . . on video takes 
a fairly large amount of financing," Gingrich said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, GOPAC provided some initial ideas on who might be interested in 
financing the course; that's all they did." 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich first offered the course at Kennesaw College, a publicly funded 
school in his Georgia congressional district. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the state Board of Regents acted to "drive me out" by ruling that 
elected officials were ineligible to teach at state-funded institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Donors who contributed funds for the course were able to take tax deductions 
because the money went to the college's educational foundation, which is 
forbidden to engage in partisan political activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich has said previously that the aim of the course was to offer 
intellectual underpinnings for a conservative drive to demolish Great Society 
social welfare programs and that "liberal" ideas opposed to that course were 
not welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 He asserted that while no nonprofit foundation can contribute to GOPAC or any 
other political action committee, "there's nothing at all illegal or 
inappropriate about any political organization" helping such a foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The original allegations were filed with the ethics committee by Democrat Ben 
Jones, whom Gingrich defeated in last Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is that every lawyer we've talked to says it is a nonsense issue," 
Gingrich said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich led the Republican drive that led to the resignation in 1989 of 
then-House Speaker Jim Wright on ethics charges, and he asserted that has 
inspired politically motivated attacks against him ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich's 10-week course, entitled "Renewing American Civilization," was made 
available to Republican groups and a few other college campuses by satellite 
relay. Gingrich now teaches it at Reinhardt College, a private school in 
Waleska, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
 In his complaint, Jones said the Gingrich political action committee raised 
more than $300,000 to finance and distribute the course, which he said violates 
House rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-six corporations and individual citizens gave more than $300,000 to pay 
for the project, with large donors given a chance to help develop the content 
of the course. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones asserted that most of the contributors were simply trying to find a way 
to further help Gingrich financially. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact they found a way to make their contribution tax-deductible only 
sweetened the pot," he said.

<P>
 Republicans picked up another seat in Oregon's five-member congressional 
delegation after absentee ballots were tallied, while another House race 
remained too close to call. 
</P>
<P>
 The absentee votes pushed state Sen. Jim Bunn past Democratic state Sen. 
Catherine Webber by 6,809 votes. The total was 117,106 votes for Bunn to 
110,297 for Webber. 
</P>
<P>
 That pulled Republicans even with Democrats in the delegation, with the 1st 
District race still undecided.

 Save The Clippers, Inc., a decidedly non-profit organization, received a 
generous donation from the Phoenix Suns Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Barkley, pacing himself for a long-promised run at an NBA 
championship, remained on the Suns' injured list with a strained stomach 
muscle. This took a chunk out of the Clippers' vigorously hyped "Superstar 
Ticket Package," but 18,018 customers refused to press for refunds and showed 
up at The Pond anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining Barkley on the Phoenix bench were Kevin Johnson and Danny Ainge, the 
first- and second-team point guards, out with niggling injuries of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Down one Dream Team I starter, one Dream Team II starter and one of the more 
irrepressible sixth men in the league, the Suns sent what amounted to the 'B' 
squad out against the Clips -- and led from wire to wire, yawning most of the 
way to a 108-101 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is Clipper basketball as Orange County will know it during the 1994-95 
season: 
</P>
<P>
 Sell-out in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
 Blowout on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Automatic for the people. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers entered this season bucking at the notion that they just might 
have the stuff to chase the 1972-73 Philadelphia 76ers' all-time record of 
futility -- nine victories and 73 defeats over the course of an 82-game 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Ellis swore it would never happen. 
</P>
<P>
 The other Clippers guaranteed double figures in the victory column, no doubt 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry DeHere, Pooh Richardson, Loy Vaught, Elmore Spencer, Tony Massenburg -- 
why, there must be 10, 11 victories in this lineup. Maybe 12. Dallas, 
Minnesota, Sacramento, Washington, Milwaukee and Philadelphia are still in the 
league, aren't they? 
</P>
<P>
 Four games in, however, and the Clippers are, as they say, on pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Four up, four down. 
</P>
<P>
 Four down, 69 to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the first three, the Clippers were losing by an average of 18.4 points 
per night, so Saturday's seven-point deficit might be seen among the more 
optimistic pockets of Clipper fandom -- tiny pockets, but pockets nonetheless 
-- as a step forward. 
</P>
<P>
 But final scores can be superficial, especially in just-get-it-in NBA affairs 
of this ilk. The Clippers went nearly four minutes without scoring, managed 
their second field goal with 4:18 left in the first quarter, shot 55% from the 
free-throw line and were outrebounded, 52-40, by a team with Joe Kleine and 6-9 
Wayman Tisdale alternating at center. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix Coach Paul Westphal took as much pity as he could, giving a starting 
assignment and 32 minutes to Elliot Perry, 24 minutes to Wesley Person, 18 to 
Trevor Ruffin -- even waved Danny Schayes and Antonio Lang onto the court for 
some late cardiovascular work. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Westphal was asked what he thought of the Clips. 
</P>
<P>
 What could he say? 
</P>
<P>
 Westphal said he thought "Bill Fitch's doing a nice job. There are no 
superstars, (but) they are playing hard and together." 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Manning, who found a way out last season and was making his first 
official return to Southern California as an ex-Clip, described the trip back 
as strange. "It was weird being back here and not seeing any familiar faces, 
but that's business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 No Ron Harper. 
</P>
<P>
 No Mark Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 No Stanley Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, weird is one word for it. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the new, unfamiliar faces, Manning allowed that they "go out and play 
hard and are feisty." 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Lamond Murray, one of the Feisty Dozen, is still getting acclimated to 
Life With Terry DeHere Instead Of Jason Kidd. "Yes," he conceded, "it was tough 
tonight . . . There were not any easy baskets out there." 
</P>
<P>
 No, not for Murray's side. Pooh Richardson, another new face, had 16 points 
and nine assists, decent enough numbers, relatively speaking. But Pooh, a 
five-year league veteran, who has seen dark day in Indiana and darker still in 
Minnesota, was downcast. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to try to find positives," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Fitch, the Clippers' coach, tried mightily, though. The defense, he 
observed, played better than it had against Atlanta, a 108-91 Thursday night 
defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we hadn't played as good on defense as we did in the first quarter, we 
wouldn't have been in the game at all," Fitch said. 
</P>
<P>
 He mentioned reserve center Matt Fish, whose tenacious play and hustle has 
made him something of an Orange County cult hero -- a medium-sized Fish in a 
big Pond. 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, he loved The Pond. "Let me just say," Fitch said, "this is a 
great place to play. The fan support was wonderful and they are really 
enthusiastic. They are as good as any in the league." 
</P>
<P>
 So Fitch and the Clippers have that, at least six times a season. It's 
something.PHOENIX SU

IN THE BATTLE OF L.A., RESULT IS EVERYTHING; PRO FOOTBALL: RAMS AND RAIDERS 
BOTH DESPERATE FOR A VICTORY TODAY AT ANAHEIM STADIUM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 They don't figure to meet in Super Bowl XXIX, and who knows what their home 
addresses will be a year from now, so this might be the last local hurrah for 
the Rams and Raiders today in Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The battle for L.A., while bringing together a capacity crowd and a tripled 
security force, has failed to move the participants. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, it's no special deal," said Raider Coach Art Shell. "They just happen 
to be in the same area we are in and we both need the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, said Ram tight end Troy Drayton. "Being 5-5 after this game means 
more to me than any battle of L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the combatants do not appear interested in hometown bragging rights, 
this will not be just another football game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need this bad," Shell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner today moves to 5-5 with talk of the playoffs dominating postgame 
interviews, while the loser is buried at 4-6. 
</P>
<P>
 "The team that wins this game may go on to do some bigger and better things," 
said Ram safety Anthony Newman. "The loser is going to have to do some serious 
soul searching." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders are coming off a 13-3 loss to Kansas City and a week of grousing 
about quarterback Jeff Hostetler's penchant for throwing only to wide receiver 
Tim Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams are still giddy from defeating the Denver Broncos, 27-21, and seem 
intent on posting their first two-game winning streak since October of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "More or less, for them they are disappointed where they are because of the 
high expectations they had before the season began," said Wayne Sevier, Ram 
special teams coach. "We are in a situation where there are some people who 
didn't think we'd be 4-5 at this point. And yet I think we're better than that. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like teams with completely different psyches coming from different ends 
of the spectrum. I think it's a very interesting matchup, a matchup that would 
have a lot more interest if it wasn't for Dallas and San Francisco playing up 
the road." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders defeated the Rams in an exhibition game, 29-20, but that was when 
all was right with the Raiders, who were supposedly Super Bowl-bound. When the 
games began to count, Hostetler faltered and the opposition's counterpart 
flourished. The Raiders had no running game to take the heat off Hostetler and 
could not protect him along the offensive line, while the Raider defense failed 
to muster a pass rush. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler and Shell exchanged on-camera unpleasantries a few weeks ago and 
dominated Sunday night highlight shows, but all appeared forgotten after two 
consecutive victories until last week's offensive debacle in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tim Brown's their offense," said Ram cornerback Darryl Henley. "You can see 
that on film. I'm sure they're thinking this week they have to get the ball to 
different people, but when the game's on the line, they're going to go to Tim 
Brown." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders' reliance on Brown and running back Harvey Williams in recent 
weeks has left speedy wide receivers Rocket Ismail, Alexander Wright and James 
Jett speechless. The trio, who accounted for 86 catches and 1,586 yards a year 
ago, declined to talk with reporters this week about their 28 catches and 431 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "For whatever reason, we're just not getting it done in the passing game the 
way it should be," Shell said. "But there are some things we're working on to 
try and make that better. Hopefully this week, we'll be able to snap out of it 
and get more people involved." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, meanwhile, have their own second-guessing going on. Drayton and 
cornerback Todd Lyght suggested last week that there were other qualified 
offensive players on the payroll besides running back Jerome Bettis. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis leads the league with 233 carries, and has averaged 3.5 yards a carry 
in gaining 814 yards. He will continue to get the ball, but quarterback Chris 
Chandler, who will start again in place of Chris Miller, is also expected to go 
looking for Drayton and wide receiver Flipper Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders will be without starting cornerback Albert Lewis and starting 
strong safety Derrick Hoskins, and will once again play without starting tackle 
Gerald Perry. All are injured. The Rams, who already have a reshuffled 
offensive line, will be without injured starting guard Leo Goeas and will use 
running back David Lang in place of an injured Johnny Bailey on third-down 
plays. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm excited about the fact this is a big game," said Ram tackle Jackie 
Slater, who has played in six of the seven games in this series. "Our team is 
young and they have a lot of guys on their team who have played in big-game 
settings against teams with a lot of other veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope this experience wets the whistle of our young guys. Nothing better 
could happen for the Rams than to beat a well-coached, highly talented team in 
a big-game setting. That would be very, very good for us." Ram-Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Tyrone Montgomery, the Raider starting tailback for the first six games, was 
not activated for today's game. His place as Harvey Williams' backup has been 
taken by rookie Calvin Jones. . . . Raider defensive lineman Willie Broughton, 
who has not played this season because of injury, was waived. Safety Cary 
Brabham was elevated from the practice squad.

MIKE DOWNEY: HEY, THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A DEFENSIVE GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before Saturday's kickoff, Jimmy Gunn, Al Cowlings (hmmm, I know that name 
from somewhere), Tody Smith and Willard Scott (not the weatherman) were 
introduced on the Coliseum sideline and waved to the crowd. They were members 
of USC's "Wild Bunch" defensive line of 1969.  
</P>
<P>
 Their bunch was only mildly wilder than the one that made pussycats of the 
Arizona Wildcats, 45-28, over the next few hours. What a sight, watching Trojan 
quarterback Rob Johnson chow down on Arizona's non-filling defense, Desert 
Spam, or whatever it's called. Four hundred and thirty-four yards passing -- by 
Tailback U.! 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the best players I've ever seen," Coach John Robinson called Johnson, 
who led USC teammates on longer drives than even Cowlings did.  
</P>
<P>
 Twelve years ago today, USC and Arizona played an absolutely wacky prime-time 
game in Tucson that went to the Trojans, 48-41. Robinson stepped down as coach 
three games later, only to return in the 1990s with the campaign promise to 
take that football and run, run, run, run, run.  
</P>
<P>
 Well, change of plans.  
</P>
<P>
 Playing without its top tailback, USC went another route Saturday in winning 
one of college football's most entertaining games of this season. We all know 
the Trojans have played some wild ones -- 42-37 over Wisconsin in the 1963 Rose 
Bowl, 46-35 over Washington State in 1973, more recently those 38-37 and 45-42 
losses to U-know-who. This one was so much fun, it felt like Nintendo.  
</P>
<P>
 USC did not have its new Shawn & Keyshawn & Long Gone offense. That's because 
Shawn Walters, the tailback, happened to have a thumb the size of a plum, a 
fact that sneaky old Robinson said, "We weren't going to advertise." 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, but the team did have Keyshawn Johnson, the not-so-wide receiver, who at 
one point sprang so high for a pass that Arizona's defenders must have checked 
for a trampoline.  
</P>
<P>
 And the team also had the other Johnson, the quarterback with the strong arm 
and the weak ankles, whose fabulous play Saturday had so many people shouting 
"Oh, Rob!" everybody in the stadium ended up sounding like Laura Petrie.  
</P>
<P>
 Johnson passed for 368 yards -- in the first three quarters . Then he 
one-footed off the field with a sprained ankle and in came Brad Otton and up 
went Keyshawn Johnson for a 43-yard catch and down-and-out ran Terry Barnum for 
a short gain and up the middle went Leonard Green with a bang for an 11-yard 
touchdown and up went the Trojans, 42-28.  
</P>
<P>
 Everybody had a hand in this one. Off hand, I can count an alert interception 
by John Herpin, a clever maneuver by Johnny McWilliams, a crushing block by 
Norberto Garrido, a moonshot kickoff by Cole Ford (I think it landed between 
Vermont and Normandie), a determined run by Rodney Sermons, a game-saving 
goal-line stop by Brian Williams, a 99-yard dash by Sammy Knight (that didn't 
count, but nice run, Sammy), a heads-up fair catch by a fast-thinking Greg 
Tellam and a 180-degree spin-around by Edward Hervey on his way to the end 
zone.  
</P>
<P>
 Which play won this game? 
</P>
<P>
 None, in my opinion.  
</P>
<P>
 My personal choice would be a tackle by Mario Bradley, the USC free safety, 
for which he should be given a game ball. Late in the third quarter -- game 
even at 28 -- a running back named Ontiwaun Carter, not to be confused with 
Ki-Jana Carter or Lynda (Wonder Woman) Carter or any other able-bodied Carter, 
broke loose 43 yards toward an Arizona touchdown. Except he was caught by USC's 
Bradley, just in time, at the two.  
</P>
<P>
 Two plays later, Herpin intercepted.  
</P>
<P>
 And Arizona never scored again.  
</P>
<P>
 That one was the key play. Rob Johnson was the key player. He was in a zone. 
Johnson fell two yards shy of his school-record 392 yards passing, only because 
he fell to the turf with some fat Wildcat on his ankle. Fifteen passes in a row 
he completed, over one stretch. He threw for three touchdowns, ran for another 
and made me wish he could return to the Coliseum next year to relieve Jeff 
Hostetler.  
</P>
<P>
 "I got it tweaked pretty good," was Rob's way of describing his ankle 
condition, which he says is fine so don't go worrying about him missing the 
UCLA thing next week.  
</P>
<P>
 Everything was clicking so well, Johnson said, "I couldn't wait to get back on 
the field every time. The way everybody was blocking, you should complete them 
all, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 What, against Arizona? Against Desert Spam . . . uh, I mean Storm? 
</P>
<P>
 "They were talking some serious trash last week. That's the best part," 
Johnson said. "Usually, the teams that talk don't play well. We don't talk too 
much." 
</P>
<P>
 Good. Let other people talk about USC. Right now, people are saying that USC 
is playing some of the best football in the country. (Well, maybe not UCLA 
people.)

JIM MURRAY: THE ROUT MENTALITY COULD MAKE THEM SITTING DUCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JIM MURRAY

<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1954, UCLA beat Stanford, 72-0.  
</P>
<P>
 B-i-i-g mistake! 
</P>
<P>
 Within two years, spearheaded by Stanford, the recruiting snitches had torn 
the conference apart to the point where the offending schools, USC and UCLA 
among them, could play their star seniors only half a season for two critical 
years.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1966, Notre Dame beat USC, 51-0. 
</P>
<P>
 B-i-i-g mistake! 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame did not beat SC again for six years thereafter and beat the Trojans 
only once in the next 10 years, by which time the coach who had engineered the 
51-0 massacre, Ara Parseghian, was no longer at Notre Dame. In fact, in the 
last game ever coached by Parseghian, USC spotted Notre Dame a 24-0 lead in the 
first half -- then beat the Irish, 55-24.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1944, Army beat Notre Dame, 59-0.  
</P>
<P>
 Not smart. An important series was allowed to dwindle. Army was able to beat 
Notre Dame only once more in its history and, by 1973, Notre Dame was beating 
the Cadets, 62-3. 
</P>
<P>
 The moral of these stories? Just win, baby. Don't pour it on. Leave the other 
guys a shred of respect. Defeat, don't humiliate. Never kick a man when he's 
down. Gloat now, and you may pay later. 
</P>
<P>
 I bring this up because running up a big score on hapless opposition seems 
endemic in the body of college football today. Coaches who used to know better 
are turning into bullies. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason? The polls. The AP poll, the coaches' poll, the bowl coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 Consult the record: Florida 73, Kentucky 7. Florida 70, New Mexico State 21. 
Florida 52, Georgia 14. 
</P>
<P>
 How about Florida State 56, Wake Forest 14? Florida State 59, Duke 20? 
</P>
<P>
 Then, there's that other tradition-streaked Southern school, Miami. Get a load 
of Miami 56, Georgia Southern 0. Miami 47, Arizona State 10. Go 'Canes! 
</P>
<P>
 Let's move to the Midwest. Nebraska 70, Pacific 21. Nebraska 42, Missouri 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the Big Ten. Penn State 56, Minnesota 3. Penn State 61, Iowa 21. Penn 
State 63, Ohio State 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Not you, Coach Paterno. Say it ain't so, Joe! 
</P>
<P>
 You wish you could say Rockne never did things like that. But he did. The 
record shows that rookie coach Knute Rockne beat Wabash, 67-7. Kalamazoo never 
scored on him in five years. Notre Dame beat Kalamazoo cumulatively, 229-0, in 
those five years. Kalamazoo gave up after losing, 74-0, in 1923. 
</P>
<P>
 John Heisman's name stands for the tops in sportsmanship and achievement on 
the gridiron. The trophy named in his honor is the most prestigious in the 
game. But, a team he coached, Georgia Tech, once beat a school called 
Cumberland, 222-0. The only thing that comes close to that in the annals of 
one-sided war is Little Big Horn. And even Custer scored. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of war, how do you feel about our future generals and admirals being 
kicked around on the football field like rag dolls? How do you feel about Duke 
43, Army 7? San Diego State 56, Navy 14? 
</P>
<P>
 What's going on? How come a team like Illinois, not heretofore thought of as a 
national powerhouse, is humiliating Missouri, 42-0, and Iowa, 47-7? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, what's going on is the polling. 
</P>
<P>
 There are about a half-dozen juggernaut teams in the country, all desirous of 
waving an index finger in the air and shouting, "We're No. 1!" on camera. They 
want the best bowl listing. They want to establish a powerful future recruiting 
tool. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no secret how you get to be good. You just go out and dip into that 
pool of certified brutes that every coach knows is there. Your job is to get 
more than your share. The eight teams who get them dominate their conferences 
and go to the bowls and get voted Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody knows who they are. Sometimes, so do the police. You don't get them 
out of Sunday school. And you don't get them out of chemistry labs. I don't say 
you get them out of a police lineup, but that's a place to look. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't look in your back yard, either. Of the 21 blue-chip recruits for 
Nebraska in 1994, only three were from Nebraska. Their star quarterback is from 
a suburb of Lincoln called Bradenton, Fla. His receivers never husked corn, 
either. They're not from places along the Platte. 
</P>
<P>
 But once you have more than your share of able-bodied ruffians, future Green 
Bay Packers, you can't just win. You have to dominate, obliterate. Take no 
prisoners. Roll up the score. Impress the pollsters. Winning isn't enough 
anymore. Look at Penn State. The Nittany Lions went from No. 1 to No. 2 in one 
poll just because they only beat Indiana, 35-29, while Nebraska was pounding 
Kansas, 45-17. Nebraska claimed the top spot. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the name of the game now. Pour it on. Everybody's doing it. Colorado 
beats the reigning Rose Bowl champion, Wisconsin, 55-17. The Buffaloes beat 
Oklahoma, 45-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it necessary? Is it even sporting? 
</P>
<P>
 We've always had these insensitive types in coaching. Ohio State had a coach 
so ruthless he was known as "Close the Gates of Mercy" Schmidt. He used to beat 
Western Reserve, 76-0. He beat Drake, 85-7. He beat NYU, 60-0. He beat Chicago 
one year, 61-0. Presumably, on his days off, he pulled the wings off 
butterflies. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference today is, these coaches probably know they're breeding a scab 
on their noses. The Big Ten admitted Paterno's team -- but not to beat their 
old established institutions like Ohio State by running up 60 points. That's 
like inviting somebody to your house and he starts insulting the help, making 
long distance calls, wrecking your car and kicking your dog. Can you imagine 
Woody Hayes losing to an upstart like that, 63-14? 
</P>
<P>
 It's a problem of some immediacy to the Pac-10. Consider this: The Rose Bowl 
is coming up and the chances are that Oregon, which hasn't gone since 1958, 
will represent the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State will represent the Big Ten. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Nebraska will be matching some head-knocking team from Florida in a bowl 
on New Year's Night, Colorado will be trading concussions with one of the other 
Florida teams on Jan. 2 -- and Penn State's only hope of attracting attention, 
and votes, will be winning by 80. 
</P>
<P>
 Just remember, no team has scored as many as 50 in a Rose Bowl game. But this 
is because, in the very first game in 1902, Stanford, behind 0-49, wisely 
decided not to play the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State must feel it has to win 80-0 -- or lose. It may not be a game, but 
a track meet. The original West Coast Rose Bowl team refused to play the last 
quarter. This year's probably should refuse all four.

 Elephant racing never caught on the way motocross, in-line skating and jet 
skis have, but Mike Welds of Laguna Hills recalls that on May 11, 1962, a crowd 
estimated at 10,000 showed up at Orange County State College (now Cal State 
Fullerton) to watch the first intercollegiate elephant race. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen institutions filed entries and elephants were rented at $200 a day 
from a Thousand Oaks animal farm. Bill Langsdorf, the college president, 
offered the organizers a barley field near where the University Center is today 
for a race site. It was called Dumbo Downs. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard's entry, the four-ton Sonita, went off a 2-1 favorite and was ridden 
to victory by student mahout Joe Russin. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who is the all-time rushing leader in NCAA Division I-A football? 
</P>
<P>
 Life as a prodigy: Michelle Kwan is the heir apparent to Nancy Kerrigan, but 
she's still only a 14-year-old schoolgirl. On Halloween, the U.S. skating star 
went trick-or-treating as Fred Flintstone. 
</P>
<P>
 No one recognized her, which was as enjoyable to her as winning a medal. 
</P>
<P>
 The safe way: Junior Seau's real first name is Tiaina. In an appearance on 
"The Tonight Show," host Jay Leno asked the San Diego Charger linebacker if 
players ever make fun of his name. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe under their breath," he replied. 
</P>
<P>
 How old is old? In the 1981 Philadelphia Phillies' media guide and the 
National League Green Book, Julio Franco's birthday was listed as 8/23/58. Now, 
it's 8/23/61. 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer savior: World Cup star Roberto Baggio of Italy says he's prepared to 
put the Golden Ball awarded him as Europe's top soccer player up for auction to 
raise money for flood victims in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sports world has the obligation of committing itself," said Baggio, who 
plays for Juventus of Turin. "Times like these need everybody's help. Those in 
the public spotlight must set an example." 
</P>
<P>
 The Turin area was especially hard hit by the flooding.  
</P>
<P>
 Watchful eye: NFL official Larry Nemmers was a high school principal when he 
started officiating. 
</P>
<P>
 "One time I had a Bear game and I called Jim Harbaugh for intentional 
grounding," Nemmers recalled. "It was a fairly easy call. He threw it 20 yards 
out of bounds with no receiver in the area. The Bears had to punt. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next day I was walking into school and I had one of our football players 
come up, put his arm around me and say, 'Mr. Nemmers, you cost me five bucks 
yesterday.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrating: Norman Chad in the Chicago Sun-Times on quarterbacks Scott 
Mitchell and Dave Brown when the Lions played the Giants two Sundays ago: 
"Watching Mitchell and Brown trying to move their teams downfield was like 
trying to watch Gilligan steer the SS Minnow to shore." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Tony Dorsett, Pittsburgh, 6,082 yards, 1973-76. Quotebook: 
Detroit Lion Coach Wayne Fontes, on his star running back: "If Barry Sanders is 
not the best football player in the National Football League, I haven't seen 
one. I know the Browns and the Juices and the Paytons and all those guys. Maybe 
they make one Barry Sanders." SHAV GLICK

RODMAN TAKES LEAVE OF ABSENCE, BUT SPURS CONTINUE TO PAY HIM

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dennis Rodman, the San Antonio Spurs' problematic forward, has taken a leave 
of absence from the team but will continue to be paid, the Spurs said Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been mutually agreed upon by both the Spurs and Dennis Rodman that he 
will be granted a leave of absence for personal reasons," General Manager Gregg 
Popovich said before San Antonio's game against the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
 Popovich didn't specify what Rodman's personal reasons were and said the leave 
was for an undetermined period. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodman, who has been at odds with management over his adherence to team rules, 
was not at the Alamodome for the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodman, the league's leading rebounder the last three seasons and one of the 
game's most controversial players, met with Popovich for about 30 minutes 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodman, who has two years remaining on a contract that pays him $2.4 million 
annually, has yet to play for the Spurs this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Popovich said Rodman will be paid because "we thought that was the right thing 
to do." Rodman was not paid for the first three games of the year, when he was 
suspended after a series of preseason incidents.

NORRIS DISQUALIFIED, LOSES TITLE; BOXING: SANTANA CARRIED OUT WITH CROWN. 
GONZALEZ WINS RUBBER MATCH AGAINST CARBAJAL IN MEXICO CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Terry Norris lost his World Boxing Council super-welterweight title Saturday 
night when he was disqualified for hitting Luis Santana in the back of the head 
in the fifth round at Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 In the final event of the card, Mexico's Humberto (Chiquita) Gonzalez retained 
his WBC and International Boxing Federation light-flyweight titles with a split 
decision over Michael Carbajal in their third bout. 
</P>
<P>
 Two judges scored the fight 117-114 and 116-113 for Gonzalez and the third had 
the 12-round fight a 114-114 draw. 
</P>
<P>
 Santana, awarded the title on the foul by Norris, was carried from the ring on 
a stretcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Santana, of the Dominican Republic, who entered with a record of 38-15-2, had 
swung at Norris and missed, his momentum taking him in the ropes. He was 
leaning on the ropes with his back to his opponent when Norris punched him in 
the back of the head, knocking him to the canvas. 
</P>
<P>
 As he lay on the ground, Dr. Horacia Ramirez shouted to him, "Stand up, stand 
up." Santana didn't move. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd showed its displeasure by throwing seat cushions into the ring and 
shouting insults at Norris. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was robbed," Norris said. "That's all I can say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw him lying there and I knew automatically that my title was gone. I 
think I hit him with my right hand. I didn't hit him good. He was already 
hurting. I definitely want my title back. Everything was against me when I 
walked into that ring." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Norris' first defense of the 154-pound title he regained from Simon 
Brown in Las Vegas in May. Norris had lost the title to Brown last December. 
</P>
<P>
 Norris, of Campo, Calif., appeared to be ahead in the fight, although Santana 
had knocked Norris down in the third round. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez raised his record to 40-2 and said it could be his last fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm thinking about retiring," Gonzalez said. "I'm talking to my family. I 
want to go out a champion." 
</P>
<P>
 Carbajal had knocked out Gonzalez to win the title in March 1993. Gonzalez 
took it back last February with a 12-round victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's defeat was only Carbajal's second loss against 35 wins -- both 
against Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
 Carbajal was the aggressor from the opening bell and cut Gonazalez's left eye 
in the third round. But Gonzalez's corner managed to stop the bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did not mind blowing the first few rounds," Gonzalez said. "I was a little 
stunned by Carbajal's strength. I knew he could hurt me, but I knew I could 
hurt him." 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the card, Genaro Hernandez of Los Angeles, fighting most of the bout 
with one hand, kept his World Boxing Assn. junior-lightweight title with a 
unanimous 12-round decision over Jimmy Garcia of Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez raised his record to 31 victories against only one draw. It was his 
eighth title defense in the 130-pound category. 
</P>
<P>
 He dropped Garcia for an eight-count in the fifth round. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlin Norris (42-3) easily held on to his World Boxing Assn. cruiserweight 
title with a second-round knockout of James Heath. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 John Armijo of Huntington Beach stopped Michael Powell of Denver in the 
seventh round of their scheduled 10-round welterweight bout at the Grand 
Olympic Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 Armijo, 144 3/4 pounds, improved to 18-7-1, with 10 knockouts. Powell 145 1/2, 
dropped to 16-12-1.

 SAME TIME NEXT YEAR 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever Rutgers plays Virginia Tech, it's a good idea to stay for the entire 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 After spotting Virginia Tech a 41-13 fourth-quarter lead, Rutgers scored three 
unanswered touchdowns only to fall short in a 41-34 loss at Blacksburg, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the third consecutive year that Rutgers made a furious rally against the 
Hokies. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Scarlet Knights trailed, 35-7, at halftime and closed to 49-42 
before losing. In 1992, Rutgers trailed, 42-23, but won, 50-49, on a touchdown 
pass on the game's last play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three times! Oh boy, it's not a coincidence anymore," Virginia Tech Coach 
Frank Beamer said. "I don't quite understand what happens when we play that 
team." 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Ray Lucas, who completed 25 of 44 passes for a career-high 374 
yards and four touchdowns, led the Scarlet Knights' comeback with 
fourth-quarter touchdown passes to Chris Hutton and Marco Battaglia.  
</P>
<P>
 Rutgers' hopes for a victory ended when the Hokies recovered an onside kick 
with 1:54 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "We dug ourselves too deep of a hole again," Rutgers Coach Doug Graber said. 
"I can't understand why we can't play football in the first half against Tech." 
THEY ARE PICKING UP. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Prairie View set an NCAA record with its 45th consecutive loss in a 52-7 
defeat to Jackson State. The Panthers, who had shared the record of 44 with 
Columbia, have not won since a 21-12 victory over Mississippi Valley State in 
November 1989. Prairie View's football program was suspended for the 1990 
season, but the team posted consecutive 0-11 records in 1991 and 1992. . . . 
.WHERE LIONS LEFT OFF 
</P>
<P>
 Prairie View can take heart by looking at former losing streak record-holder 
Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind Jamie Schwalbe's four touchdowns, Columbia guaranteed its first winning 
season since 1971 with a 38-33 victory over Cornell. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions, 5-3-1 overall and 3-3 in the Ivy League, last finished above .500 
with a 6-3 record 23 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 They close the season at home next week against Brown (6-3). SMITH TAKES A 
GAMBLE, LESSON WILL BE LEARNED 
</P>
<P>
 Former USC and current Missouri Coach Larry Smith gambled and lost in the 
Tigers' 21-18 loss to No. 11 Kansas State. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith passed up a chip-shot field goal attempt and went for the victory, but 
came up empty when freshman Chris Canty knocked down a fourth-down pass in the 
end zone with 39 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith asked his players what they wanted to do during a timeout before the 
final play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life is about taking risks," said Smith, whose Tigers have lost six 
consecutive games at home. "If you don't, you're not living." LET THE FIRING 
BEGIN 
</P>
<P>
 Despite reports that he might resign this week, Oklahoma Coach Gary Gibbs 
stood firm following the Sooners' 33-14 victory over Oklahoma State. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I'm just happy about (the victory)," Gibbs said. "My focus now will turn 
to Nebraska tomorrow morning." 
</P>
<P>
 Oklahoma plays the top-ranked Cornhuskers on Nov. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tulsa World reported that university officials have been working on a deal 
in which Gibbs would resign before David Boren takes over as school president 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether he had held any such discussions, Gibbs shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talk to (athletic director) Donnie Duncan every day. Certainly he knows my 
phone number," Gibbs said. "People can write whatever they want to. My focus 
has been solely on doing my job." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked whether he expects to be back for his seventh season as coach, 
Gibbs said: "I don't have any idea right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Oklahoma has a record of 6-4 this season (4-2 in the Big Eight) and Gibbs' 
record over six seasons is 44-21-2. SHUTOUT ANYONE? 
</P>
<P>
 Previously unbeaten Grambling was shut out for the first time in six seasons 
in a 13-0 loss to Florida A&M in the 62nd Orange Blossom Classic at Joe Robbie 
Stadium in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers (9-1), who came into the game averaging 49.4 points per game, were 
held to 271 total yards by the Rattlers (6-4). 
</P>
<P>
 The loss means that Grambling Coach Eddie Robinson, who has 397 career 
victories, will not notch his 400th this season. Robinson, however, did have a 
complaint against Florida A&M Coach Billy Joe. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson charged that Joe had refused to provide his staff with Rattler game 
films, despite the fact that the Tigers produced films for Florida A&M's 
review. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe responded that Grambling assistant George Small violated NCAA rules by 
attending the Rattlers' game against Southern on Nov. 5. McNAIR UPDATE 
</P>
<P>
 Steve McNair, who is already the NCAA career leader in total offense with 
16,259 yards, passed for 476 yards and rushed for another 110 in Alcorn State's 
47-44 victory over Troy State. 
</P>
<P>
 McNair scored three touchdowns and added a two-point conversion in his final 
game at Spinks Stadium, as the Braves (7-2-1) rallied from a 44-30 fourth 
quarter deficit to defeat Troy State (7-3), which entered the game ranked sixth 
in Division I-AA. OUT WITH A WHIMPER 
</P>
<P>
 Napoleon Kaufman, Washington's career rushing leader, re-injured the big toe 
on his left foot in the first half and did not play in the second and gained 
only 11 yards on six carries in the Huskies' 31-19 victory over California. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a disappointing final home game for Kaufman, a senior. He had his 
lowest rushing total since he gained 10 yards in two carries against Washington 
State as a freshman in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of hard to sit out the second half," Kaufman said. "But I can't 
complain much. I've broken almost every record they have here. I'm not going to 
hang my head because I'm very proud of what I've accomplished." THE BEAT GOES 
ON. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Alleghany broke school and North Coast Athletic Conference records for most 
points scored in a game with an 83-0 victory over winless Oberlin at Meadville, 
Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Bell completed all seven of his passes for 157 yards and three touchdowns 
and Kyle Smesko rushed for 128 yards and two touchdowns as Allegheny (10-0) 
rolled up 635 yards total offense to Oberlin's 47 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Alleghany, which led 42-0 at the end of the first quarter, broke the previous 
scoring mark of 75, set against Earlham in 1991, the only other year in which 
Allegheny has finished the regular season 10-0. . . . . AND ON 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Sherriden May became the NCAA I-AA career touchdown leader as 
Idaho routed Weber State, 79-30, at Moscow, Ida. 
</P>
<P>
 Idaho scored 51 points in the first half with its defense accounting for 16 of 
those points with two returned fumbles for touchdowns and a safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Weber State could have used former quarterback Brad Otton, who transferred to 
USC before the season. Wildcat quarterback Bryan Martin completed 14 of 32 
passes for 153 yards. . . . . AND ON 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia Southern set team records with 66 points, 729 total offense yards and 
31 first downs in a 66-13 victory over Glenville State at Statesboro, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman quarterback Kenny Robinson ran for 139 yards to lead three Georgia 
Southern rushers with more than 100 yards as the Eagles ran for a school-record 
665 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Wright added 110 yards for the Eagles and Roderick Russell had 108. All 
nine Georgia Southern touchdowns came on the ground. A FALSE CALL 
</P>
<P>
 The Coliseum public address announcer certainly got the attention of the 
61,264 fans attending USC's 45-28 victory over Arizona Saturday when he 
disclosed late in the second half that Penn State had lost to Illinois, 31-28. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the score he read was not a final but only a late fourth-quarter 
update. The announcer made a correction minutes later when he found out that 
Penn State, which defeated the Trojans early in the season, rallied for a 35-31 
victory to gain its first Rose Bowl berth. NOTEWORTHY 
</P>
<P>
 -- Carey Bender scored eight touchdowns in Coe College's 63-48 victory over 
Beloit. The 5-foot-8, 185-pound senior has scored an NCAA record 528 points. 
His four-year rushing total of 6,125 yards is an NCAA Division III record. 
</P>
<P>
 Bender, who averaged 224.2 yards per game, rushed for 347 yards and moved into 
second place on the NCAA all-division rushing list behind Texas 
A&M-Kingsville's Johnny Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pat Barnes of California passed for 389 yards, the most ever in a game 
against Washington, in the Bears' 31-19 loss. In his second career start, 
Barnes completed 33 of 44 passes for two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mike Alstott, who rushed 18 times for 181 yards in Purdue's 42-30 loss to 
Michigan State, has 1,087 yards for the season. That makes him only the fourth 
Boilermaker to rush for 1,000 yards and the first since 1976. The others were 
Otis Armstrong, who did it twice, Leroy Keyes and Scott Dierking. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Melvin Williams became Southern University's first 1,000-yard single-season 
rusher in 40 years when he ran for 146 yards and one touchdown to lead the 
Jaguars over Texas Southern, 21-10, in a Southwestern Athletic Conference game 
at Baton Rouge, La. Williams and his 1,110 yards tied a school record held by 
three others.

<P>
 Out of the blocks, the Comanches are the favorites to take the league title 
and possibly be a Top 10 county team. All five starters return from last year's 
team, which finished second behind Villa Park and reached the second round of 
the playoffs. A total of 12 players return from that squad, including four 
seniors. Canyon has the most experience -- three seniors and two junior 
starters -- and the most height in the league, with no starter under 5-7. 
Kuhlmann, a 5-10 point guard and first-team all-league selection last season, 
led the team with a 13-point average and should be able to improve on that from 
the shooting guard spot. Brown averaged 10 points last season and is also 
expected to increase her scoring. Spjut and Fish, who averaged eight points 
each, will need to step up this year. The team has grown together over the last 
season under Herrera. SCHEDULE

 Canyon senior Robynn Kuhlmann isn't fond of interviews. And it's no wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 In Kuhlmann's first few weeks at Canyon High, after transferring from Fountain 
Valley, she was interviewed by a local newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 "They misquoted me and the way they wrote the article made me sound 
conceited," Kuhlmann said. "They made it sound like I thought I was great and 
was going to come in and break all these records, and that wasn't what I said 
at all." 
</P>
<P>
 The article made adjusting to a new school more difficult than normal. 
</P>
<P>
 Around school, teammates who didn't know her shunned her, and upset parents 
called first-year girls' basketball Coach Nelson Herrera to complain. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a lot of dissension on the team because of it," Herrera said. "I had a 
lot of problems with parents who wanted to know how I could let her say those 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuhlmann was upset. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't even want to go to school after it came out. I was hoping nobody 
read it, but of course, everybody did," Kuhlmann said. "It's like walking on 
ice when you are a new student anyway; that just made it worse. I was really 
upset. Teammates who didn't know me that well were really mad. It was really 
hard to deal with." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, now it's a new season. Kuhlmann has endeared herself to the team and she 
tries to stay away from reporters. But if she has another season like her last, 
and if the Comanches win the Century League title like many expect, it will be 
hard for her to remain out of the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuhlmann, who is 5 feet 10, was a first-team all-league point guard last 
season when she averaged a team-high 13 points and five assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuhlmann began competing early in her life. A self-proclaimed tomboy, she grew 
up in a neighborhood of mostly boys. Basketball, football, street hockey, you 
name it, she played it. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was the runt of the block, about one to two years younger than all the 
boys," her father, Willis Kuhlmann, said. "But she was always out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuhlmann can't handle boredom. If she gets restless, she will go out and run 
five miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father says when there is nothing else to do, she will get on her bike and 
ride to the beach, and from Weir Canyon that's about 60 miles round trip. She 
also surfs and likes to play the guitar and hang out at coffee houses with her 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 She also works out with weights five times a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played one-on-one with her and she pushed me around," Herrera said. "She is 
very aggressive and very strong. She is the hardest-working kid I've ever seen. 
She always has a basketball in her hand. I expect great things from her this 
year."  
</P>
<P>
 Kuhlmann is going to have to meet those high expectations in a new role. 
Herrera plans to rotate her at the shooting guard and small forward positions, 
where she can better utilize her size and strength. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuhlmann came to Herrera on his first day on the job last season and asked him 
if she could play guard.  
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to play the post, because I can't play that in college," 
Kuhlmann said. "At the point I can free-lance, I feel more free to do things. 
The point is the position that gets things flowing." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though she enjoys running the point, Kuhlmann doesn't mind changing 
positions as long as it will benefit the team. And as far as worrying about the 
college scouts, she will now have a chance to show off different skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuhlmann has already received letters from more than 40 colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really excited about college," Kuhlmann said. "I'd like to possibly go 
back East, where I can see different cultures and meet new people."

 Santa Ana Valley could pull off some surprises this year under Stipp, the 
Falcons' first-year coach. With a few key victories, the Falcons could find 
themselves competing in the playoffs. Santa Ana Valley, El Modena and Villa 
Park should battle for the third and final automatic playoff berth. After a 
fourth-place finish last season, the Falcons return five lettermen, including 
three starters. Like most of the league, Santa Ana Valley is going to rely on 
guards to control the game. "Our weakness is that we need to learn how to win, 
especially in close, important games, " Stipp said. Defense is also going to 
play a big part in the Falcons' game plan, and Stipp thinks quickness is their 
main strength. Gibson and Lara are the only two seniors on the team, and their 
speed and ballhandling at guard will be one of the keys to Santa Ana Valley's 
success. Napier should also become a standout in the league this season. 
Although only a sophomore, at 6 feet 3 she should be able to handle the 
more-experienced post players around the league. SCHEDULE

 The two-time defending league champions are going to find it tough to win 
three in a row, especially with their coach, Len Whitacre, leaving to take over 
at Costa Mesa. Bynon, an assistant last season, will serve as interim coach. 
Also hurting the team is the graduation of four regulars, including Century 
League Player of the Year Maureen Skehan. On the positive side is the return of 
two potential all-county players: Miyake and Pennington. Miyake is deadly from 
the three-point line, making 53 last season. She averaged 14.9 points and had 
more than 100 assists from the shooting guard position to earn first-team 
all-league honors. Pennington, also a first-team all-leaguer, averaged 9.2 
points. Whitacre was also excited about freshman Bynon: "She is a spectacular 
guard who can handle and shoot with anyone." This year, the Spartans will 
concentrate on their full-court trap and long-distance shooting. SCHEDULE

GOLF / THOMAS BONK; THIS YEAR, AZINGER CAN THINK GOOD THOUGHTS AT SKINS GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About a year ago, Paul Azinger played the Skins Game in such a blur, he 
couldn't even remember what the Bighorn Golf Club course looked like. Azinger 
was terribly distracted.  
</P>
<P>
 He was going to have a biopsy two days later. 
</P>
<P>
 Azinger, who had been so enthusiastic about playing in his first Skins Game, 
was shut out. He won no skins, no money. And the next Tuesday, when the biopsy 
was performed on his aching right shoulder, doctors found a lymphoma. 
</P>
<P>
 Right then, Azinger started thinking about something other than golf. He 
started thinking about cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 After seven months of chemotherapy and radiation treatments, Azinger came back 
and played in four tournaments this year, even defending his PGA Championship. 
He didn't make the cut, but he did in two other tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't really expect to play that well anyway, he said, adding that he 
mostly wanted to see how far he had come in his rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Azinger believes his rehabilitation is complete. He is coming back Nov. 
26-27 to try the Skins Game again, but he will be different this time. He will 
be healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel good," he said. "I just need to be patient. . . . I need to be patient 
on the first hole and not feel like I have to hit it 300 yards and not feel 
like I have to knock the flag out of the hole. 
</P>
<P>
 "Patience is just a hole-by-hole attitude for me. I played with Nick Price the 
other day and he told me when he came back from his thumb injury he found the 
key for him was to be patient early on. He could see the impatience in me." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not hard to understand Azinger's eagerness to play again, mainly because 
he can put the health issue farther behind him at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 Azinger said that 1994 was, well, an interesting year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, my No. 1 priority was to get well again," he said. "Golf was about 
as far down the priority list as it will ever go in my life, I would think. I 
really couldn't have cared less about the game of golf. I was sick." 
</P>
<P>
 Azinger's interest in golf began returning toward the end of his treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're on the front half of seven months of chemotherapy and radiation, 
it feels like a lifetime," he said. "Of course, hanging over your head that 
whole process is the fear of what cancer is capable of doing to you. 
</P>
<P>
 "So it was a tough time, but I think once I got all that behind me, I saw the 
light at the end of the tunnel. But the front side seemed like forever." 
</P>
<P>
 Payne Stewart is the three-time defending champion of the Skins Game at 
Bighorn in Palm Desert. It also features Fred Couples and Tom Watson. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Money talk: One thing is certain, golfers endorse products because it's so 
lucrative. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Golf Digest, some of the top players are getting a lot richer. 
</P>
<P>
 For endorsing its equipment, Greg Norman was allowed to buy 12% of Cobra Golf, 
for $1.2 million, in 1991 and his investment has grown more than tenfold. 
</P>
<P>
 Chi Chi Rodriguez's endorsement deal with Callaway gave him 75,000 shares in 
1992. After two stock splits, Rodriguez's stock has soared to more than $10 
million, almost double his career earnings on both the regular and senior tours 
combined. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Couples' deal with Ashworth gave him stock worth $5 million. 
</P>
<P>

 Shark watch: Raymond Floyd and Steve Elkington are back to defend their team 
title -- and to see if they can win $300,000 again -- in the $1.1-million 
Franklin Funds Shark Shootout Friday through Sunday at Sherwood Country Club in 
Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The other teams are Norman and Price, Arnold Palmer and Peter Jacobsen, Curtis 
Strange and Mark O'Meara, Couples and Brad Faxon, Fuzzy Zoeller and David 
Frost, Ben Crenshaw and Mark Calcavecchia, Hale Irwin and Bruce Lietzke, Chip 
Beck and Jeff Maggert, and Lanny Wadkins and Andrew Magee.

 Special events: A couple of Jack Nicklaus Productions made-for-TV events are 
coming up in December. 
</P>
<P>
 The twice-washed-out Wendy's Three Tour Challenge has moved to the desert and 
will be held Dec. 6 at the Nicklaus course at PGA West, tape-delayed for 
television showing Dec. 17-18. The event features Norman, Couples and Azinger 
from the PGA Tour, Nicklaus, Dave Stockton and Raymond Floyd from the Senior 
PGA Tour and Nancy Lopez, Patty Sheehan and Laura Davies from the LPGA tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicklaus, Palmer, Strange, Zoeller, Irwin, Phil Mickelson and others will make 
up a field of 16 two-player teams in the inaugural $2.1-million Diners Club 
matches Dec. 8-11 on the Nicklaus Course at PGA West. It will be televised 
live.

Kapalua International: "It was almost as shocking as watching George Foreman 
win." Golf notes

 Tom Lasorda, Vin Scully, Mike Scioscia, Don Newcombe, Lou Johnson, Steve

counsel Lloyd Lambert. . . . Nick Price has committed to playing in the 
$2.7-million Johnnie Walker World Championship in Jamaica, Dec. 15-18. 
</P>
<P>
 Final statistics show that Price won the player-of-the-year award by 128 
points over runner-up Mark McCumber and that Greg Norman won the Vardon Trophy 
for the lowest scoring average over second-place Price, 68.81 to 69.39.

 Villa Park won back-to-back Century League titles for the first time. Coach 
Len Whitacre, in his second year, led the Spartans to their best overall record 
(21-4). Villa Park was led by Maureen Skehan, the league's player of the year. 
Skehan led the team in scoring (17.2 points per game), assists (six) and tied 
in rebounds (9.7). The Spartans expected to be seeded among the top four once 
the Division II-AA playoffs began, but the Southern Section never received all 
the statistics that were faxed, so Villa Park went in unseeded. The Spartans 
never led in their game against Oxnard Rio Mesa and lost, 55-44. Michelle 
Miyake led the Spartans with 15 points and Skehan added 13 points and five 
rebounds. . . El Modena also went down in the first round of the playoffs, 
losing to Cypress, 61-50, in Division II-A. Jamie Shine led the Vanguards with 
12 points and six rebounds. . . Canyon defeated Pomona Garey, 46-41, in the 
first round of the Division II-A playoffs. Stacey Fish had 13 points and Sarah 
Spjut added 12 points and 14 rebounds. In the second round, the Comanches were 
outplayed by Troy and lost, 46-30. Robynn Kuhlmann didn't play in the first 
quarter for disciplinary reasons, but tied for the team-high in scoring with 
nine points. Coach Nelson Herrera blamed the loss on "lack of experience."

 Cahill begins his fifth season with the Vanguards. In his previous four, he 
has led his team to the league title twice and made four trips to the playoffs. 
To win another league title, El Modena is going to have to find a solid 
replacement for Jamie Shine, who averaged 15 points and 13 rebounds at the 
post. Filling in for Shine will be Mackie, Mariner and Potter, who Cahill plans 
to rotate inside. The Vanguards are going to have to get solid play out of 
these three to deal with the height of teams such as Canyon. Venturing from 
last year's game plan, Cahill is going to use a three-guard rotation this 
season with Foyle, Herco and Kovacs, who he believes are the "best guards in 
the league." Foyle, who averaged five assists, is the only senior and will be 
looked to for leadership. Herco is a shooting threat from the outside. Using a 
pressure defense, speed and outside shooting, Cahill hopes to counteract his 
lack of experience at the post. "We are going to be a different team without 
Shine," he said. "If our post players can develop, we'll be in good shape." El 
Modena figures to finish among the top three and make it to the playoffs again, 
but they need one of their post players to become a force on the inside.

team will have to pick up quickly to keep pace with the rest of the league. The 
Panthers return four starters from last season's team which won one league 
game. Their main strength should be experience, boasting a roster of six 
seniors and four juniors. Center Conley and forward Brown will be expected to 
lead. Conley shot 40% from the field last season and averaged seven rebounds. 
She is going to face some tough centers in the league, including Stacey Fish of 
Canyon and Mary Jo Pennington of Villa Park. Conley is going to have work hard 
to improve her rebounding average. Huber will start at point guard. The

O'BRIEN FINDS NICHE AS SAVIOR OF ARIZONA FALL LEAGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dan O'Brien walked into his office Saturday morning only to be greeted by 
frenzied employees and a stack of urgent messages. 
</P>
<P>
 It had been raining all night and morning. Managers of the six Arizona Fall 
League teams were waiting for instructions. The Prime Ticket television crew 
wanted answers. Major league general managers were impatient. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien, who has spent 40 years in baseball as a general manager, demanded 
that everyone stay calm. No need for rash decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The rain stopped by 10:30 a.m. By 11, the sun broke through. By 1 p.m., the 
Peoria-Scottsdale game was under way as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien, the man whom the Angels fired unceremoniously a year ago, again was a 
calming influence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone was panicking, but I had an ace in the hole," O'Brien said. "You 
see, I made sure they put a tarp on the field last night. I wasn't taking any 
chances." 
</P>
<P>
 This approach is characteristic of O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
 This approach might have cost him his job with the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien was the antithesis of his co-general manager, Whitey Herzog. While 
Herzog was willing to trade and sign players as if he were at a close-out sale, 
O'Brien deliberated as if he were at the U.N. 
</P>
<P>
 While Herzog told crude, raunchy jokes to the players, O'Brien would inquire 
about their families. 
</P>
<P>
 While Herzog was embarrassed that the Angels couldn't win a division title, 
O'Brien was proud of the Angels' profits. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a partnership that was doomed at the start. By the end of the 1993 
season, Angel President Richard Brown knew someone had to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Herzog stayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very surprised when it happened," O'Brien said, talking publicly about 
his firing for the first time. "It just didn't make sense to me. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that I find funny is that people kept saying that Whitey and I 
never got along. That wasn't true. I mean, Whitey was never around. He did 
things his way and I did things my way. All I know is that I was there every 
day in the office." 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble brewed, according to insiders, when the responsibilities of O'Brien 
and Herzog overlapped. O'Brien believed he was in charge of trades and 
free-agent signings. Herzog claimed that was the reason he was hired. 
</P>
<P>
 It started to become quite embarrassing when the Angels signed free agents 
Stan Javier and Scott Sanderson before the 1993 season, only for Herzog to be 
notified weeks later by a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not my fault I couldn't find Whitey," O'Brien said. "Whitey could have 
been out fishing, hunting, skiing, who knows. But I wasn't going to hold up a 
deal until I could find him." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien's methodical style, meanwhile, irritated Herzog, who wanted to wheel 
and deal, and considered O'Brien a hindrance. If they were going to be 
successful, Herzog said, he needed to be aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
 So O'Brien was fired. Herzog vowed to move quickly. Within a week, pitcher Joe 
Magrane was signed to a two-year contract that guaranteed $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I was there," O'Brien said, "believe me, that wouldn't have happened. Joe 
Magrane would have been a spring-training invitee." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, Herzog saved his most surprising move for Jan. 12, 1994. He resigned. 
Instead of two general managers, the Angels suddenly had none. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe it," O'Brien said. "It had been only four months since I 
left, and now Whitey was leaving too." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, after failing to persuade Herzog to stay, promoted Bill Bavasi. 
And, if little else, it was a nice consolation to O'Brien. He always believed 
Bavasi deserved to become the Angels' general manager one day. 
</P>
<P>
 "He couldn't have been better about the whole thing," said Tim Mead, Angel 
assistant general manager. "Dan called us right away and congratulated us. He 
told us, 'If I can ever be of any help, please feel free to call.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, believe me, we relied on him quite a few times this year. We never 
hesitated. He has been a big help to both of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, O'Brien is being declared a savior of the Arizona Fall League, which was 
on the verge of folding a year ago. O'Brien was the man who helped persuade the 
Chicago White Sox to send their double-A outfielder to this three-year-old 
developmental league. 
</P>
<P>
 A guy named Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, the league sold 21 season tickets. They had an advance sale of 
seven seats from the ticket brokerage firm. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the season-ticket sales were cut off at 2,200. Every team has 
broken its attendance record. They have 10 games scheduled on the Prime Ticket 
network. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien, 65, is as proud of preserving the Arizona Fall League as he was of 
his four-year stint with the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, the Angels never won a division title during his tenure. Only once were 
they in contention. But despite ownership's contention the Angels lost $16 
million during that span, O'Brien insists the franchise made money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know we did," he said, "and I'm proud of that. Sure, you'd like to win a 
pennant or a World Series, but coming a close second to that means nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, it's not a great achievement to win a World Series if you have a $50 
million payroll. Now, if you win it with a small payroll, like the Minnesota 
Twins did a couple of times, now that's saying something." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels had one of the highest payrolls in the game when O'Brien was hired, 
soaring to almost $36 million without ever resulting in a contending team. 
Today, the projected payroll is $24.5 million, and the Angels are expected to 
contend for the American League West title in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien said he harbors no bitterness toward the Angels and no longer desires 
to be a general manager. He's content to stay in the fall league, but if 
Phoenix gets an expansion franchise, he'd certainly listen. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you've been in the game as long as I have," O'Brien said, "you want to 
be involved in it. I enjoy it, and the rewarding part is seeing these players 
developing. There's a lot of future stars here. You look at a 20-year-old kid 
like Ruben Rivera (of the New York Yankees), and in a few years, he could be 
one of the best players in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Besides, there's still a few things I need to do here. I'm not about to let 
Jordan leave here without getting him on the basketball court at least once. 
I've got to show him my set shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "How about that, the NBA season has started, and I've got the greatest 
basketball player in the world playing for me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'm doing just fine."

BALTIMORE STILL IN RAM RACE; FOOTBALL: AFTER MEETING WITH SHAW, ANGELOS 
CONVINCED HIS CITY'S OFFER IS SOLID. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Peter Angelos may not leave Los Angeles Monday with a belief that Baltimore is 
any closer to a deal to attract the Rams. But neither is St. Louis, and the 
Baltimore Oriole owner can at least take comfort in that fact. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm convinced the deal with St. Louis is not a done deal, and that makes me 
optimistic," said Angelos, who met for four hours with Rams President John Shaw 
Saturday night in Los Angeles. "As far as I'm concerned, Baltimore is still 
very much in the running." 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos remains confident the Baltimore package, which includes a new stadium 
and virtually all the perks St. Louis is offering, will be strongly considered. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been one major obstacle to a Baltimore deal -- eventual control of 
the franchise. Angelos would like a majority share of the team, but Ram owner 
Georgia Frontiere wants to retain majority interest. 
</P>
<P>
 But Angelos said he is convinced after Saturday's meeting that the issue can 
be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have a problem with someone outside the state having ownership in 
the team. We're interested in who controls the team, primarily for assuring it 
remains in Baltimore," Angelos said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In documents that are prepared, there would be a separate understanding that 
the team could not be moved out of Baltimore unless the Baltimore ownership 
agreed to that. Operating control is another matter, and that, too, can be 
assumed without complete ownership." 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos wouldn't say that Shaw has agreed to such stipulations, "but I don't 
think it's a problem," he said. "It would just be the last item to be 
resolved."

THE HIGH SCHOOLS / MIKE HISERMAN: DOES ANYONE HAVE CURE FOR ILLS OF SEEDING? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Sniffing, sniveling and whining. 
</P>
<P>
 Happens during flu and cold season. 
</P>
<P>
 Happens during playoff selections. 
</P>
<P>
 Happens every year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Birmingham High football team wins one, ties one and loses five in 
Northwest Valley Conference action yet still goes to the City Section playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Some applaud. Others sniff. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson is forced to forfeit three victories, dropping its official record to 
2-8, yet the Colts go to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Some cheer. Others snivel. 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda wins six of its final seven games to finish second behind undefeated 
Sylmar in the Valley Pac-8 League, yet the Regents -- reportedly at the request 
of their coach -- avoid the big boys of 4-A and are granted a place in the 
softer 3-A field. 
</P>
<P>
 Some celebrate. Others whine. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Fiege, commissioner of City Section athletics, hears it mostly from 
one side. Seems like the jilted always make more noise. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're never going to please everyone, but I think this is a good seeding," 
Fiege said Saturday afternoon, a day after invitations were extended. "I can 
defend it with a clear conscience." 
</P>
<P>
 Attention critics: Listen and learn. 
</P>
<P>
 Top priority for the eight-member selection committee was to include the 
section's best 32 teams in the playoffs. Once the overall field was determined, 
the goal was to place the top 16 teams in the 4-A division. 
</P>
<P>
 Decisions were made after a study of four criteria. They are, in order: 
</P>
<P>
 * A rating developed by football coaches, who ranked each of the teams in 
their respective conferences 1 through 8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Conference record and place in standings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Strength of conference, based, Fiege said, on results from the past three 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nonconference record. 
</P>
<P>
 The only automatic bids went to the section's six conference champions, which 
were seeded in the 4-A bracket. 
</P>
<P>
 Among conferences, the big winners were the Southern Pacific and Northwest 
Valley, which each sent seven of their eight teams to the playoffs. Conversely, 
the Valley Pac-8 and Coastal conferences each placed only four teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Birmingham, from the Northwest Valley, and North Hollywood, of the Valley Pac- 
8, were "bubble teams," Fiege said. Birmingham, which was seeded last in the 
3-A bracket, made the cut based on its league's overall strength and a 3-0 
nonleague record. North Hollywood had a 3-4 record in the conference but was 
0-4 against nonleague opposition.  
</P>
<P>
 Determining Carson's fate was less complicated but more time-consuming. 
Several coaches said the Colts, who were caught using an ineligible player, 
should have been banned from postseason competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Jeff Engilman of top-ranked Sylmar wasn't among them. "I couldn't see a 
4-A playoff without Carson," he said. "They've been a City power for so long. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want the best teams in there. If you win it, you don't want anybody to be 
able to say, 'Yeah, but what about Carson?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Further muddling matters were requests by Reseda and Wilson -- second-place 
teams in their respective conferences -- to compete in the 3-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Reportedly, the committee granted those requests. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, according to Fiege. "Those requests didn't mean anything to the 
committee," she said. "If the committee thought they belonged in the top 16, 
they would have been in 4-A." 
</P>
<P>
 In past years, City teams were designated 4-A and 3-A before the season and 
the top two teams from each league plus a handful of wild-card teams advanced 
to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern Section utilizes such a format, and Engilman wishes the City 
Section would return to it. "Why play all your league and conference games to 
win and then have that all thrown out because other people don't believe your 
conference is that strong?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like the way (committee members) get to pick and choose. It makes a 
mockery of your league season." 
</P>
<P>
 But Engilman also said the playoff field was "the most even" he had seen and 
that the best 16 teams in the City were those listed in the 4-A bracket. 
</P>
<P>
 So, any other ideas? Engilman has none. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no perfect system," he said. "That's why you have people complaining 
every year." 
</P>
<P>
 NCAA officials, take note. Here's that playoff system you've been considering: 
experts representing each conference and region picking the top teams and 
matching them based on record and strength of schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Still there is grumbling. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have a better plan, call Fiege. Maybe she will get back to you. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe not. Hers is a thankless job, hence the voice on her answering machine. 
</P>
<P>
 It says your call will be returned -- if she "feels like it."

EARNING THEIR STRIPES; WOMEN OFFICIALS MAKE THE GRADE IN MAN'S SPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Linda Wilcox ran up and down the sidelines at a high school football game, 
never hesitating to blow her whistle or throw a yellow flag or break up a 
scuffle between aggressive players. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw Coach R.J. Garrett yelled at Wilcox, the only woman on the field, as 
he watched his team lose to Taft: "Damned! What's a lady doing out here? No 
lady can keep up with those boys!. . . . Geez!. . . . Damn!" 
</P>
<P>
 He taunted her all night, and throughout most of the game referred to Wilcox 
as "Mr. Ref." Garrett challenged many of her calls by whining, stomping and 
mumbling sarcastic comments directed at Wilcox. 
</P>
<P>
 Just another Friday night in the life of Linda Wilcox. 
</P>
<P>
 A graduate of Sylmar High and Cal State Northridge, the 34-year-old Wilcox has 
officiated high school football for 11 years. She is the only female City 
Section official in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The only other woman referee in the area is 36-year-old Denise Forlizzi, who 
is in her 13th season and works Southern Section games. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilcox may be a veteran of the job, but she's hardly treated like one of the 
guys. She says she encounters as much adversity today -- mostly from coaches 
and some from colleagues -- as she did a decade ago.  
</P>
<P>
 The snide remarks and condescension are as prevalent as they were when she 
first took the field in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some coaches still live in the dark ages," she said before a game at Sylmar 
earlier this season. "It's actually gotten worse for me because the higher you 
get, and the better games you ref, the worse it gets with the coaches. They 
just can't seem to handle a woman out there." 
</P>
<P>
 But Joe Forlizzi, a fellow referee and Denise's brother who has been on the 
job 14 years, says most coaches treat Wilcox well because she has proven 
through the years to be efficient and knowledgeable. 
</P>
<P>
 "She does a great job," he said of Wilcox. "She's just one of the group. I 
guess the first couple of years coaches tried to rouse her up so they said a 
lot of stuff. But they really don't do much of that anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 The comments are not confined to coaches and colleagues. She also gets an 
earful, she says, from spectators, statisticians, players, coaches' wives, the 
chain crew. . . . The list goes on and on. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the Sylmar-Canoga Park game, two young men on the Canoga Park 
sideline directed obscenities at Wilcox following what they felt was a bad 
call. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilcox ruled that Canoga Park was inches short of a first down after a running 
play. The men, who had already made jokes about a woman football official, 
moaned and shook their heads then made the comments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just laugh," Wilcox said. "None of that bothers me. I can't let it because 
it goes on all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilcox says a coach once told her to "go home and make dinner for your old 
man." Another said: "How come they sent a woman out there to do a man's job?" 
</P>
<P>
 All that abuse for only $48 a game. That brings up a simple but logical 
question. Why ? 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess because girls can't play football and I've never shied away from a 
challenge," Wilcox said. "I kind of like the excitement and bucking the system. 
But I still say anyone would have to have their head examined if they wanted to 
do this. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me there have been times where I've said, 'I'm never coming back. I 
hate everything and everybody!' But I keep coming back. For some reason I have 
a good time." 
</P>
<P>
 Denise Forlizzi shares the sentiment, saying, "I'm certainly not doing it for 
the money. I guess I just enjoy being out on the field and I really like the 
challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 Players, Wilcox says, tend to be the most respectful. She rarely hears snide 
remarks from them. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're pretty good," Wilcox said. "Though one time I was breaking up a fight 
on the field and when I pulled the top guy off the bottom guy, they both 
stopped and looked up and one of them said, 'Oh God, it's a broad!' I said, 
'That's lady to you, buddy!' " 
</P>
<P>
 During a recent junior varsity game at Sylmar, Wilcox ejected several players 
because they used foul language. Each left without saying another word. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's good and she's tough," said Selvyn Cobos, a Canoga Park sophomore 
tackle. "It's just a person out there as far as I'm concerned. As long as she 
makes the right calls, and she has been, I don't see any problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilcox umpired high school baseball and softball for 10 years. She also has 
officiated basketball and volleyball. She added football when a friend who 
served as the coordinator of local high school officials suggested she try it. 
</P>
<P>
 This year Wilcox gave up all sports except football because she is busy 
writing a novel and teaching a pilot class on conflict resolution at Chatsworth 
High. She also does some acting and has appeared in several television 
commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 Forlizzi, a regional sales manager for Alta-Dena Dairy, became an official 
because her father and brother did it. She believes attitudes have improved 
though she still encounters some difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 "Recently I was at a meeting of Los Angeles unit refs and when I walked in 
they looked at me like I just came out of a science-fiction movie," Forlizzi 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 "There were about 60 refs there and I was the only woman. There's still 
surprise and skepticism. I still feel like I have to work extra hard to get the 
same recognition as males." 
</P>
<P>
 But if more than a decade of being treated like an outsider hasn't discouraged 
Forlizzi and Wilcox, nothing apparently will. Both said they expect to be on 
the sidelines for years to come.

play tennis at the University of Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
 Mehlman, the Wolverines' No. 1 singles player, chose the Illini over 
Northwestern, Princeton and Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved all the schools," she said. "But when i took the trip to Illinois, I

 The Southern Section Division I water polo quarterfinals will be played 
Tuesday, and for Jimmy Duff that can mean only one thing: time to silence that 
voice in his head. 
</P>
<P>
 The voice belongs to Harvard-Westlake High Coach Rich Corso, evaluating Duff's 
play shortly after last year's quarterfinal loss to San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said I played All-World in league games," Duff remembered, "and 
All-Nothing in (playoff) games." 
</P>
<P>
 With that message echoing between his ears for the past 11 months, Duff has 
dedicated himself to a stronger performance in his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth-ranked Wolverines (21-5) face fourth-ranked Foothill on Tuesday at 
Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
 And this time, Duff is ready. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took me a while to realize that I really did choke (last year)," Duff 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 "This year I have a new mentality when I come into the pool. Not to be 
conceited, but I just say to myself, 'I am better than the next guy, and I will 
do everything I can to help our team.' " 
</P>
<P>
 A preseason All-American driver, Duff is the Wolverines' captain. He is 
probably their leading scorer, too, but there's no way to be sure because Corso 
doesn't believe in tracking individual statistics.  
</P>
<P>
 Numbers aren't needed to quantify Duff's value to the team, though. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's someone who we can always look to during the game to step up," said 
Harvard driver Doug Kezirian, a close friend of Duff's.  
</P>
<P>
 "When we need a goal, we can go to him. When we need a big play we can go to 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Duff, who is 5 feet 10 and 170 pounds, is not driven by the glory of scoring 
goals. Instead, he seems to be pushed by a distaste for losing. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, for example, Duff competed in his first triathlon. And he 
noticed that his top-10 placement after the swimming portion seemed to 
evaporate while he was on the bike, when rider after rider passed him. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, when he trains for triathlons, he rides 200 miles a week on a stationary 
bike, "just so that feeling never comes to me again of everyone passing me by," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Duff, 18, has since competed in about six triathlons a year, each including a 
one-kilometer swim, a 40-kilometer bike ride and a 10-kilometer run. He won a 
triathlon in Santa Monica in August and he has finished second in his age group 
at events in Davis and Monterey County this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the 1,000 push-ups and 1,000 sit-ups he does six nights a week -- it 
takes him only about 40 minutes -- Duff does not do any triathlon conditioning 
during water polo season. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been dedicated to water polo since eighth grade at Harvard-Westlake. He 
was in a physical education class taught by Corso, who "saw that I could kind 
of throw the ball sort of far, so he said I should try out for the team," Duff 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly Duff, who lives near Hancock Park in Los Angeles, was no longer 
headed to Loyola High, as his family had planned.  
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he stayed at Harvard and his identical twin brother, Brian, went to 
Loyola, where he has been a starting cornerback for the football team the last 
two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fun feeling when we beat Loyola," Duff said. "I feel sort of good, 
because it's like I beat (Brian), too." 
</P>
<P>
 The Duff brothers now have another challenge working.  
</P>
<P>
 Each will be pursuing Southern Section titles this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, both teams lost in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian's defeat was somewhat more acceptable, though, because the Cubs lost to 
eventual section champion Eisenhower.  
</P>
<P>
 Harvard's loss was difficult for Jimmy to take not only because he expected 
more of the team, but more of himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it took a few months for Corso's words of criticism to sink in, Duff 
finally realized his coach was right. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first few times, I said to myself, 'I played all right. I didn't make any 
mistakes.' I didn't make any mistakes, but I also didn't make anything good 
happen," Duff said.  
</P>
<P>
 " For us to be successful and for me to be successful, I have to not make any 
mistakes and also create opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've learned my lesson, especially in the big games." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the six goals Duff scored in the Wolverines' first-round victory over 
Anaheim Canyon on Thursday, there is other evidence that Duff might be improved 
under pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 Corso scheduled a regular-season matchup last month against Corona del Mar, 
now the top-ranked team in Division I.  
</P>
<P>
 The match was to be a playoff simulation of sorts: a trip to Orange County on 
a Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Harvard lost, 14-11, Duff scored nine goals. "For me," Duff said. 
"That was a sign to show everyone that Harvard is for real and I am for real."

MOORPARK PUTS A THIRD TITLE ON ITS SHELF WITH 26-21 VICTORY 
</P>

 Three in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what Moorpark College accomplished Saturday night with a 26-21 victory 
over Ventura in a Western State Conference football game at Ventura High. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders (7-2, 7-1 in WSC play) clinched at least a tie for their third 
consecutive North Division title. It was also the fourth consecutive victory 
for Moorpark, which is 4-0 in the division. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura (4-5, 3-4) dropped to 0-4 in the division. 
</P>
<P>
 Isaiah Mustafa, who had four catches for 64 yards, set a Moorpark 
single-season reception record. He has 56, one more than Dan Russell's 55 in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Damian Delfino completed nine of 23 passes for 220 yards and two 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark broke on top in the first quarter when Justin Simo intercepted a pass 
by Jason Brown and returned it 28 yards to give the Raiders a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders made it 9-0 when several players tackled Brown in the end zone for 
a safety. 
</P>
<P>
 After the free kick, Moorpark drove 57 yards to make it 16-0 when Delfino 
connected with Aaron Whitley on a 24-yard pass play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders led, 23-0, at halftime on a 71-yard pass play from Delfino to 
Joaquin Evans. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura scored in the second half on David Simerly's 29-yard fumble return and 
two touchdown passes by reserve quarterback Aaron Triana -- the second coming 
with 1:01 left in the game.

VALLEY GETS UP, DOWNS COMPTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With his team's dream of an undefeated season having ended in a loss to 
Bakersfield College last week, Valley Coach Jim Fenwick was concerned about how 
his team would respond Saturday against Compton. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, there was little cause for alarm. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs (8-1, 8-1 in the Western State Conference) kept alive their hopes 
of a bowl bid by routing the Tartars, 43-6. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in coaching long enough to know that we might have been in for a 
letdown today," Fenwick said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we cautioned them about it before the game and look how they responded." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Arellanes threw a 15-yard touchdown pass to Brian Comer on Valley's first 
possession and Compton (3-5-1, 2-5-1) didn't look back. 
</P>
<P>
 Arellanes, leading passer in the WSC, completed 21 of 32 for 361 yards and two 
touchdowns and figures to become the school's single-season leader in passing 
yardage against Santa Monica next Saturday. He has 3,082 yards this season, 52 
fewer than the record set by Sean Fitzgerald last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis Delmatoff gained 57 yards, scored a touchdown and caught two passes for 
20 yards in his first start at running back. Comer, leading receiver in the 
WSC, caught seven passes for 102 yards.

CARTER HAS TUNNEL VISION AFTER LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charles White, former Heisman Trophy winner and now assistant coach at USC, 
put his arm around Arizona running back Ontiwaun Carter as the two walked into 
the tunnel toward the locker rooms at the Coliseum Saturday. The Trojans had 
just defeated the Wildcats, 45-28. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pretty much wished him well and said there's going to be games like this," 
said White, whom Carter considers a hero from his hometown of Pacoima. "But I 
think he's got a chance to play on Sundays (in the NFL)." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter once dreamed of such an encounter at the hallowed Coliseum. And how 
poignant it was that Carter had just become Arizona's all-time leading rusher 
after gaining 67 yards in 18 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Kennedy High standout, who had a one-yard run and a 65-yard pass 
reception for touchdowns, overtook Art Luppino, who amassed 3,371 rushing yards 
from 1953-56. Carter has 3,432. 
</P>
<P>
 But many dreams are unfulfilled -- such as this one. Arizona's loss dropped 
the Wildcats (7-3, 5-2) out of a first-place tie in the Pacific 10 Conference 
race and Carter's career will probably end without a trip to the Rose Bowl 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing on my mind right now is team goals," Carter said. "I'm really 
upset. We had a lot of big dreams coming into the season. We just kind of fell 
short." 
</P>
<P>
 After a slow start (nine carries, 12 yards in the first half), Carter finished 
with 163 yards rushing and receiving. He had five catches for 96 yards, second 
in that category to Richard Dice (Alemany), who had nine receptions for 171 
yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Wildcats indeed fell short after getting oh-so close. 
</P>
<P>
 With the score tied, 28-28, in the third quarter, Carter took off on a 43-yard 
run. The 5-foot-9, 186-pound senior slipped through a hole between the center 
and left guard and was headed for the end zone when safety Mario Bradley 
dragged him down at the Trojan one. 
</P>
<P>
 On first down, Carter swept and was dumped for a three-yard loss. On the next 
play, John Herpin intercepted Danny White's pass in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 USC, passing for a school record 434 yards against the NCAA's sixth-best 
defense, then drove for the go-ahead touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 35-28, Arizona again moved to the USC one. On third down, Carter was 
stuffed at the line for no gain. On fourth down, linebacker Brian Williams 
threw Carter for a one-yard loss. 
</P>
<P>
 With 8:06 remaining, USC put together a six-play, 98-yard drive that iced the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough," Carter said. "You take the good with the bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the good: Without Carter, Arizona might never been in the game. His 
touchdown run gave the Wildcats a 21-14 lead in the third quarter. He put 
Arizona on top again, 28-21, with the game's longest scoring play later in the 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter took a dump pass from White behind the line, broke a tackle by Bradley, 
ran away from safety Sammy Knight 10 yards downfield and angled toward the 
sideline, where he slipped past Herpin at the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've accomplished a lot of things," Carter said. "I can walk away knowing I'm 
No. 1 at this school. I think I did well." 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona's list of alumni running backs doesn't include any famous names. Only 
four of the top 10 rushers played in the NFL. Most notable among them was Vance 
Johnson (eighth, 1,873 yards), who became a receiver with the Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
 Luppino never played pro ball but he was the list's only All-American and an 
Arizona legend. He still holds 25 school records in rushing, total offense, 
scoring and all-purpose yardage. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempts to contact Luppino at his home in Tucson after the game were 
unsuccessful. Luppino's wife said he decided to take a nap after watching the 
game on television and didn't want to talk to the press. Luppino plans to talk 
to Carter next week. 
</P>
<P>
 While White ushered Carter off the field he probably didn't realize that 
Carter had passed his nephew, Russell White, as the 10th all-time leading 
rusher in the Pac-10. Russell rushed for 3,368 yards at Cal.

SLINGSHOT NOT ENOUGH TO LIFT CAL LUTHERAN; WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL: REGALS FALL TO

 The NCAA Division III West Regional women's volleyball final was a classic 
David vs. Goliath confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran, in its first appearance in the NCAA tournament, fell to six-time 
national champion UC San Diego, 15-6, 11-15, 15-10, 15-5, Saturday night at UC 
San Diego.The Tritons will face South Regional champion Washington University 
of St. Louis Saturday at a site to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the loss, 1994 was a breakthrough season for Cal Lutheran (20-9). 
After posting four consecutive dismal seasons since joining the NCAA in 1988, 
Cal Lutheran began the turnaround last year, finishing 14-13 under first-year 
Coach James Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've done a great job," said Triton Coach Doug Dannevik. "They're 
definitely one of the top two teams in their conference and James has done a 
really good job getting club players to come to Cal Lu." 
</P>
<P>
 Darcy White and Traci Little paced Cal Lutheran with 10 kills apiece. Freshman 
setter Liz Martinez added 24 assists and 17 digs for the Regals, who have all 
nine starters returning next season.

 Celeste Wright and Genevieve Young each had nine kills as Southern California 
College swept The Master's, 15-9, 15-12, 15-10, in a first-round volleyball 
match of the National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics Far West Regional. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was scared to death," said Vanguard Coach Eric Boyles, whose team defeated 
The Master's twice earlier in the season."It's usually a rule that you can't 
beat a team three times." 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Wendy Jones had 15 kills and Rose Dignadize added 22 assists for the 
fourth-seeded Mustangs (27-13). 
</P>
<P>
 Karajean Stephenson had four kills and 20 assists for fifth-seeded Southern 
California (18-10). 
</P>
<P>
 Master's was tentative early, committing eight service errors and four 
rotation errors in the first game. 
</P>
<P>
 "You play with more confidence when you are ahead," Master's Coach Dean Conk 
said. "But we were behind the whole time. We were playing not to lose and they 
were playing to win." 
</P>
<P>
 With the second game tied, 12-12, Vanguard Janine Katter served out the game. 
Southern California didn't trail again.

SIX-MINUTE OFFENSE WINS FOR WESTMONT; MEN'S SOCCER: TWO WARRIOR GOALS EARLY IN 
SECOND HALF BEAT MASTER'S IN REGIONAL FINAL, 2-0.

 For Westmont College, it was the perfect time for a visit from a long lost 
relative. 
</P>
<P>
 After a listless first half, Westmont gained the momentum by scoring twice in 
a six-minute span Saturday, fueling a 2-0 victory over The Master's in the 
championship soccer match of the National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics' 
Far West Regional. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you can start a half (like that) you can get (momentum) on your side 
and it really occurred for the final 45 minutes for us," said Westmont Coach 
Dave Wolf, whose third-ranked Warriors (20-3) advanced to the NAIA 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
 After a scoreless first half, Westmont needed just over a minute to score as 
Trevor Schuurman dribbled through traffic and beat goalkeeper Kris Bage from 15 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Five minutes later, Ben Hook converted Shuurman's pass into the second goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Master's (15-4-2) did not have a shot on goal in the second half and has only 
a slim chance for an at-large bid to next week's 12-team championships. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs lost to Westmont earlier this season, 3-0, and have not scored in 
their last four matches (390 minutes) against the Warriors.

HARVARD-WESTLAKE TAKES IT EASY; HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL: RESERVES, ENTIRE JUNIOR 
VARSITY TEAM PLAY IN 42-7 VICTORY OVER LA QUINTA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 You know you're in a blowout when a quarterback has his team at the opponent's 
one-yard line and goes to one knee to run out the clock in the second quarter.  
</P>
<P>
 Such was the case for Harvard- Westlake High's Derek Lemkin, who led the 
Wolverines to a 42-7 nonleague victory over La Quinta on Saturday at Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
 The game wasn't nearly that close. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard-Westlake took a 26-0 lead in the first quarter, added a touchdown in 
the second quarter and was threatening to push the margin to 40 points when 
Lemkin made the gesture of mercy. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a change of pace for Lemkin, who riddled the Aztecs for 269 yards and 
three touchdowns on seven-of-seven passing. 
</P>
<P>
 Lemkin spent the second half on the sidelines while Coach Dave Bennett emptied 
his bench to give all of his reserves as well as his entire junior varsity team 
some game experience. All 50 players in uniform saw action. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolverines (8-1-1), who clinched the Camino Real League title last week, 
entered their regular-season finale ranked third in the Southern Section's 
Division IX. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was no accident where we are," Bennett said. "We have a good football 
team. Today we wanted to stay sharp, keep from getting injuries, and everybody 
had a chance to play." 
</P>
<P>
 And all at the expense of a 1-9 La Quinta team that was just playing out the 
string. 
</P>
<P>
 Lemkin connected with Kadar Lewis on an 80-yard touchdown pass on the game's 
first play from scrimmage. Four plays later, Mike Bou intercepted a Jayson 
Gonringer pass and returned it 33 yards for another score. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Abed Abuszleh then scored two touchdowns, one on an eight-yard 
run, the second on a 40-yard pass from Lemkin. 
</P>
<P>
 Abuszleh gained 83 yards in 10 carries before taking his place beside Lemkin 
on the sidelines in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Goldfein added a 46-yard touchdown reception in the second quarter and 
Mike Seid scored on a three-yard run in the third. Lewis and Goldfein each 
caught two passes for 102 yards.  
</P>
<P>
 La Quinta, which gained only 131 yards, was led by Tony Tran, who gained 37 
yards in eight carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Tran broke the shutout with a two-yard run in the fourth quarter.

also caught a scoring pass as Faith Baptist defeated Chadwick, 57-7, on 
Saturday in a Southern Section Eight-Man football playoff game at Faith 
Baptist. 
</P>
<P>
 Granzow completed four of nine passes for 94 yards and rushed 10 times for 92.

USERY HOPES NEW OFFER WILL LEAD SOMEWHERE; BASEBALL: FEDERAL MEDIATOR THINKS 
LUXURY-TAX IDEA MAY AT LEAST PRODUCE MORE MEANINGFUL NEGOTIATIONS WITH PLAYERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Major league baseball owners said Saturday they will make a new proposal when 
bargaining talks resume Thursday in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The new proposal is expected to be based on a payroll luxury tax. The players' 
union previously has rejected the concept because of its similarity to a salary 
cap, but special mediator William J. Usery, concluding three days of talks in 
Rye Brook, N.Y., said he was optimistic it would lead to meaningful 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've said we'll go (to Washington) and hopefully stay there until we can 
conclude an agreement," Usery said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said John Harrington, chief executive officer of the Boston Red Sox and the 
owners' lead negotiator: 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll use the next three or four days to formulate an economic proposal that 
takes our concerns and the players' concerns and moves them closer together -- 
hopefully, at least." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the luxury tax concept, teams could go over a specified ceiling but 
would be taxed if they did, with that money being shared with the 
smaller-revenue clubs. The union has maintained that the ceiling is equivalent 
to a cap, but Executive Director Donald Fehr refused to speculate on the 
owners' new plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this stage they know from us what is important, what the concerns are, 
what we believe is appropriate," Fehr said. "It doesn't serve any purpose to 
attempt to characterize it in advance." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Usery: "I've done my utmost to urge the owners to take into account the 
players' position and the players' concerns to certain things (such as the 
cap). 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of issues have been discussed and continue to be discussed." 
</P>
<P>
 A management lawyer said Saturday that the Washington meetings may be the last 
hope for a negotiated settlement. The owners said Friday that barring an 
agreement, they will probably be forced to declare an impasse and implement the 
salary cap in early to mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyer said that under federal law, any proposal -- such as the cap -- 
that has been bargained to an impasse in good faith can be implemented even if 
another proposal is later put on the table. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not the last proposal that has to be implemented," he said.

THE SUNDAY PROFILE; MCMOM; MULTIMILLIONAIRE ISABELLE VILLASENOR OF CORONA DEL 
MAR HAS A STRING OF FAST-FOOD RESTAURANT FRANCHISES, BUT HER REAL JOY COMES 
FROM BEING A GOOD MOTHER, DAUGHTER AND BICULTURAL CITIZEN. IT'S A LIFE OF 
BUSINESS, FAMILY AND PHILANTHROPY THAT SHE HAS BUILT WITH HARD WORK, VISION, 
DIGNITY AND A SENSE OF HUMOR.

<P>
 Tucking up her navy suit pants, Isabelle Villasenor kneels to mop up a spilled 
soda at her Cypress McDonald's. Quickly, she dispatches a clerk to fetch a 
refill, flashes the frazzled mother an I've-been-there smile and assures her, 
"We'll getchya another one." 
</P>
<P>
 Customers pushing strollers toss her hellos. They ask about her daughters, 
whom they've watched grow up. "So Jenny's getting married!" says a cheery woman 
slurping a Coke.  
</P>
<P>
 During the lunch hour, Villasenor, 48, parks her gleaming white Mercedes 
outside her newest addition, a McDonald's shoehorned inside a Cerritos Walmart. 
Over a cup of black coffee, she can hardly focus on telling her life story for 
watching the counter operation. ". . . Opened this store in July and I was . . 
." The conversation trails as her blue eyes rake the perimeter, checking the 
niggling details that can bring you back for a Quarter Pounder or send you off 
for a Whopper. 
</P>
<P>
 "I walk, talk, eat and breathe McDonald's," she admits with a dimpled smile. 
"It's who I am." 
</P>
<P>
 She's Sonia Braga meets Sally Field, a businesswoman who takes in more than $7 
million a year but someone much more than a burger maven with golden arches. 
The child of an immigrant gardener and a secretary, she used her smarts to turn 
misfortune into her defining moment, yielding not just riches but contentment. 
</P>
<P>
 Hers is a feel-good tale, one of triumphs over challenges -- a loving but 
low-income childhood with no hopes of college, a young marriage, early and 
painful divorce, single parenting with little job experience. 
</P>
<P>
 A working single mom who once ran her business from her bedroom -- her two 
daughters, nonetheless, can't remember a day when she did not pick them up 
after school. 
</P>
<P>
 How many high school students, assigned a term paper on heroes and 
inspiration, would write about their mom? Hers did. Now college graduates in 
their 20s, they manage three of her five -- soon to be six -- franchises and 
visibly adore her. 
</P>
<P>
 Before they marry, they intend to have graduated with their degrees from 
Hamburger University at corporate headquarters in Oakbrook, Ill. At a time when 
other twentysomethings complain about having McJobs, Villasenor's daughters 
dream of owning their own franchises. They consider her their best friend, 
someone who gave them values and responsibility and the true meaning of love. 
</P>
<P>
 She has talked free trade with President Bush and Vice President Quayle and 
wears her wealth with ease. She has been interviewed by the New York Times and 
Fortune magazine, employs 200 people and has the affections of the Sisters of 
the Society Devoted to the Sacred Heart. 
</P>
<P>
 She has presided over the national McDonald's Women Operators, a group that 
helped earn the company an award this year for promoting females and has helped 
raise scholarship funds for college-bound Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 She earns the admiration of senior Orange County Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, 
who strained a 20-year friendship with native son Carl Karcher by granting her 
a lucrative franchise at John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 She may own a charming house in Corona del Mar and a cabin at Lake Arrowhead, 
two Mercedeses and other luxuries, but none of it will ever match her joy at 
being a good daughter, and her original childhood dream come true: being a 
great mom. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's not a do-gooder. She's a good person," says Sister Catherine Marie 
Stewart at the Heart of Jesus Retreat Center in Santa Ana, an oasis for 
children where Villasenor has helped with fund-raising. Stewart never stops 
smiling as she talks about Villasenor -- how she supplies the cups for 
meetings, how she starts and ends every visit praying in the chapel but never 
misses a visit to the kitchen for Sister Hermine's chocolate chip cookies.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've known her six years. What I like about Isabelle is that she's very 
personable. She's a good mother and a good friend. She's given those girls a 
great view of life, but not overprotected. She's been loved, too; you see that. 
Life hasn't been always rosy, but she's come out of it stronger." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Avitachese como una mujer , her father, Jesus, would say. Buck up! Be strong 
like a woman! It was the kind of ironic thing you'd expect to hear from a man 
who "invented the word macho " but admired the women who fought beside their 
men during the Mexican Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 He had left his small town outside Guadalajara to fight in the war before 
migrating to the United States in 1927. Here, he met Villasenor's mother, 
Magdalena, an El Paso native 24 years younger. The two settled in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father maintained the gardens of the wealthy and famous -- actors such as 
Van Johnson, for one. Her mother was a secretary who kept her husband's 
invoices in order. Their first child was a son, stillborn, which may be why 
their daughter believes she was always overprotected, though never spoiled. 
</P>
<P>
 Her parents managed to pay for little Isabelle's Catholic school education, 
and, although Spanish was her first language, she learned English in school. 
Her father did not want Isabelle to lose her heritage. "My mother used to say 
that the only time they fought was after she had spoken to us in English," 
Villasenor says, giggling. 
</P>
<P>
 Given that she attended St. Bernard High in Culver City, a prep school, it 
came as a shock when her parents informed her near graduation that, no, there 
wasn't money for a college education. Besides, her father's dream had been to 
return to his hometown after her graduation. And so they did. But her family 
there was of two classes, and the wealthy bunch frowned on her working for a 
living. So she did volunteer work until she thought she would go stir-crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 After six months, what was to be a visit with girlfriends in Southern 
California turned into a permanent move. She wrote long letters home to her 
folks about why she was staying here and got her first paying job as a 
bilingual dental assistant for a Crenshaw dentist, Armando Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The story of how she got her first car is typical of how many people react to 
her. She was without wheels, so friends drove her to and from work every day, 
but it was becoming a strain. A patient listened to her worry one morning, and 
the next day he returned with news: A Manhattan Beach couple had agreed to sell 
her their aqua Volkswagen bug, and she could make monthly installments on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said to him, 'Who would do such a nice thing?' And he said, 'Isabelle, you 
have a smile that people would do anything for.' " 
</P>
<P>
 She worked there for four years and, during that time, met her future husband 
-- 21-year-old stockbroker Pat Smith -- through friends. A few years after they 
married, his parents bought the Artesia McDonald's, the same year the 
corporation opened its 1,000th store. 
</P>
<P>
 It was 1968. Isabelle and her husband became part-owners of a second store, in 
San Clemente, with his parents, but they still ran them. When Smith's father 
became ill, his parents asked him to step in. They wanted Isabelle to run the 
business side, she said, "but I told them no, all I really wanted to do was be 
a mom to my two little girls." 
</P>
<P>
 Villasenor eventually did step in and kept the books, working out of the back 
office. When her in-laws died, she and her husband bought out other siblings 
and together ran the two restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple divorced in 1981, and, although Villasenor is reluctant to discuss 
why they split, her daughters say they were encouraged to maintain close 
relationships with their father. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Friends say that Villasenor used the divorce to reinvent herself, from 
suburban housewife to working mom. 
</P>
<P>
 The divorce settlement left her with ownership of the Artesia restaurant. But 
that didn't mean McDonald's would grant her a franchise license. 
</P>
<P>
 Villasenor had learned on the job, but she had never been through the formal 
mandatory training at Hamburger University that all owner-operators must pass. 
Only then can one earn a license. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think," she adds, "they were thinking, 'Here's this lady who's been playing 
tennis every day and she wants to be an operator.' " Was she playing tennis 
every day? "Pretty much," she says, laughing. "They figured I wouldn't get 
through it." 
</P>
<P>
 But after she finished her training, took over the store and remodeled it, the 
Artesia store's volume increased 121%, a corporate record that stood for five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Her Artesia, Cypress and John Wayne Airport restaurants generate annual sales 
volume of about $7.4 million, not counting the Walmart, snack-bar-sized 
restaurant that opened in July. An experimental venture that the corporation is 
trying at other locations, that McDonald's is performing double its projected 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year Villasenor opens a McDonald's in Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never dreamed I would be where I am today," Villasenor says, applying a 
quick coat of lipstick without aid of a mirror before throwing her car into 
reverse to head to her Cypress office. "Never dreamed." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like the communities surrounding them, each store has its own flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 Its customers are "multicultural," Villasenor says, fingers tapping. " Very 
multicultural. There were dairies around us when it was first built there. 
Artesia used to be called Dairyland. There's a large Asian community there -- 
Chinese, Filipino and Portuguese communities. Also Eastern Indian and, to a 
smaller degree, Hispanics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cypress is Middle America. Families. It's a younger crowd, too," she says, 
pointing out the excellent location a half mile from Cypress High School and a 
mile from the local community college. 
</P>
<P>
 Also multicultural are her employees. Maria Tablado, 41, has worked for 
Villasenor seven years, starting as a crew member making biscuits and salads. 
She spoke no English when she applied for a job at Villasenor's Artesia 
McDonald's. She had been a secretary for 14 years in Nicaragua before fleeing 
in 1984 with her children and husband, who, she says, left them to return to 
their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 "Isabelle, she give me a lot of opportunity," Tablado, now an assistant 
manager, says emotionally, her eyes tearing. She is taking English courses, she 
says, and wants to continue advancing her work skills. She knows that 
Villasenor values bilingual staffers. The more languages you can speak, the 
more customers you can talk to. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I can help one small part, it makes me feel better. She trusts her people 
and gives you the opportunity to let (you) go more, get better. The Spanish 
people here say, 'Mama Isabelle is here.' " 
</P>
<P>
 When Villasenor's second store opened -- eight years after her first, when her 
daughters were older -- it was a very different feeling, because that store was 
built for her alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was all mine, and I did the whole gamut -- I was really excited about this 
store. I had a reception for city officials and the neighbors; I had speakers 
and the Chamber of Commerce. My family was very proud of me. My godfather came 
all the way from Guadalajara for the opening. We had Mexican food and drinks, 
mariachis." 
</P>
<P>
 Wait, no burgers? Why the Mexican theme? She hits her hand to her chest. "It's 
me! That's who I am!" 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, she points out, there are fajitas on her menus now. 
</P>
<P>
 Next to open were the John Wayne Airport restaurants, the "twins" bookending 
the newly built terminal. It was Villasenor's first big brush with politics. 
There had been city officers and sign approvals and code matters to navigate 
before, but this time McDonald's had competition, and it was from Orange 
County's home-grown burger master, Carl Karcher. 
</P>
<P>
 To get grant money, the county had certain requirements required by the FAA to 
find a food franchisee who was an ethnic minority or woman who lived in Orange 
County and had five years' experience in the business. Fifty-seven applicants 
were whittled down to two. Villasenor, with the guidance of veteran lobbyist 
Lyle Oversby, met each member of the Board of Supervisors so they would know 
that she was the real McCoy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember I told Supervisor Tom Riley that, since the passengers would be 
seeing McDonald's almost the first thing off the plane, that I fancied myself 
the unofficial ambassador to the county," Villasenor recalled. "And I think he 
liked that idea." 
</P>
<P>
 It was no sweetheart deal though, Oversby says. The press was looking into the 
angle that corporate big-shot McDonald's was chasing Karcher out of his own 
playground when, in fact, Villasenor was the deal-clincher. 
</P>
<P>
 She was Latina, a county resident with 10 years of franchising experience; her 
first restaurant increased sales volume more than 100% in her first 18 months, 
and her parent corporation would guarantee payment of her lease and sales 
percentage were she to fail to perform, Oversby said. She came into meetings 
with pages of proposals on how best to zip diners in and out, and in the end 
she gave the board the best business pitch, Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I first met her when we were looking for the installation of a food stand," 
says Riley, a retired Marine general whose supervisorial district encompasses 
the airport that was rebuilt and reopened in September, 1990. "Obviously she 
was a winner. But she first attracts your attention by always looking in your 
eyes when she's talking to you. In the Marine Corps, we called it command 
presence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted somebody who was gonna be successful. Yes, there was a lot of 
pressure. The only time in my 20 years on the board when I called somebody and 
said, 'You're not gonna get it, and you might not want to be at the meeting,' I 
called Carl. 
</P>
<P>
 "But this young lady was far and above in her presentation. She had done the 
most work and preparation. . . . I've always felt the decision we made was a 
good one." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the brush with politicians and meetings she was invited to for Latino 
business leaders to discuss NAFTA and other matters with Bush and Quayle, 
Villasenor remains nonpolitical. She is a registered Republican whose only 
campaign donations were a couple hundred dollars to Supervisor Gaddi H. 
Vasquez. 
</P>
<P>
 She declines to discuss Proposition 187. Childhood friend Cecilia Preciado 
Burciaga, who served in the White House under Jimmy Carter, says they avoid 
discussing politics beyond fun-minded barbs. Like when she sent Villasenor this 
framed saying: "Clinton jogs every morning to a McDonald's." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it is because Oversby by trade deals with the sometimes cynical 
business of politics that he is so filled with superlatives about Villasenor. 
Five years ago, he introduced her to the Catholic order of nuns in Santa Ana, 
where a serene new children's facility has since been built with donated 
millions. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is not at all in the crowd of people who think of themselves as 
political. In five years I've seen her at three functions, and they were all 
for the retreat center," Oversby said. "She's exactly what you see. She's a 
very charming, successful woman in a business that normally grinds people up 
and spits them out. . . . She's a rare commodity." 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody would agree more than daughters Lisa, a UCLA graduate who flirted with 
the literary world before returning to the family business, and Jenny, who 
graduated from USC this year and a couple of months later was managing the 
Walmart McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
 "I admire my mother's determination. She worked her buns off to get where she 
is. I've always said she's like a celebrity in the McDonald's world. People 
respect her; they look up to her. We've been going to meetings with her since 
we were little. It was exciting. But I think I appreciate her love and 
understanding the most." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Family values were pulled into sharper focus in recent weeks. Villasenor's 
father, 95, lay fighting for life in the Huntington Beach home she bought her 
parents. His wife and daughter stayed up through the nights with him and by day 
dozed a few hours beside his bed. On Wednesday he slid into a coma and died. 
Villasenor and her daughters, Jenny, 23, and Lisa, 25, were all there. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a period of time when Isabelle's girls were little, and I was in 
Washington, D.C., when we did lose touch, but a good friend is like a very 
comfortable blanket: You come back to it, and all the creases are there, and 
you know each other without the masks," says childhood friend Preciado, whose 
96-year-old father was friends with Villasenor's. 
</P>
<P>
 The fathers came together from Mexico before the women were born here, and 
both joke that they've known each other "since the womb." To this day they 
refer to each other by childhood nicknames; Isabelle is Biki; Cecilia is Chila. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the same core background. We both view our fathers as the tie to 
Mexico, and a real deep culture, and yet we've both navigated here well, and 
certainly Isabelle has become very successful as an entrepreneur and a woman in 
her own right. 
</P>
<P>
 "I deeply respect and admire Biki, because she may be driving a (Mercedes) and 
calling me from her cellular phone and going off for 'R and R' in Hawaii, but 
when we connect it's really the basics -- 'How are you; I need to lose weight; 
how are your parents, and who are you dating?' " 
</P>
<P>
 "The side of Isabelle that I find fascinating is that because of her looks -- 
blond and blue-eyed -- she's always looked white, just like her father," says 
Preciado, associate dean and registrar of Cal State Monterey Bay and a Clinton 
appointee to the Presidential Commission on Excellence in Education for 
Hispanics. 
</P>
<P>
 "She could have melded in (to a white world). She could've chosen to remain 
Isabelle Smith after her divorce. But it's real clear she's chosen to be 
Isabelle Villasenor. She's traveled to Mexico and is very comfortable there, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the wonder of Isabelle: She's been able to straddle two worlds 
gracefully, beautifully, with apology on neither side."

THE SUNDAY PROFILE; THE GUIDING LIGHT; YOUNG LATINOS WHO BELIEVE THAT COLLEGE 
IS BEYOND THEIR REACH JUST HAVEN'T MET MARTIN ORTIZ. HE'S HELPED THOUSANDS SEE 
GRADUATION DAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL QUINTANILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Martin Ortiz, a man of many firsts, attempts another: crossing a plaza packed 
with well-wishers without being sidelined for a quick hello, handshake or hug. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena suerte.  
</P>
<P>
 Not even Ortiz, a revered Whittier College elder known as El Jefe (the boss), 
can control the pandemonium his presence is causing. 
</P>
<P>
 For 26 years, Ortiz, director of the college's Center of Mexican American 
Affairs and its only Latino graduate in 1948, has guided thousands of students, 
finding scholarships, arranging tutors, securing jobs and sharing words of 
wisdom that many hold dear long after graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 His crusade, or movimiento as he prefers to call it, is inspired by a past 
that taught him, "Don't just cry, qualify" -- an Ortiz original. 
</P>
<P>
 As a boy, a teacher degraded him because he didn't speak English. As a young 
man, restaurateurs, barbers, hoteliers and landlords turned him away because of 
his Mexican heritage. And while walking to class on his first day at Whittier, 
he was stopped cold and asked, "And where do you think you're going?" 
</P>
<P>
 A soft-spoken Ortiz replied: "To get an education." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Ortiz, long considered by educators the nation's father of minority 
student programs, is the college's first Latino namesake of a 
multimillion-dollar scholarship endowment for Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's his personal touch, his chivalrous and charismatic way with people, 
that has lured 700 Latino students and parents on a fall day to the hilltop 
mansion of Whittier College President James Ash for a tardeada , or afternoon 
reception .  
</P>
<P>
 An 11-piece mariachi orchestra plays "Cielito Lindo" on the vihuela , guitarra 
de golpe and guitarron , high-gloss guitars of various sizes and sounds. Nin n 
os , perched on their fathers' shoulders, reach for helium-filled balloons. 
Streamers in patriotic red, green and white flutter like kite tails above the 
throng. 
</P>
<P>
 Ortiz, in a receiving line, manages to break away. 
</P>
<P>
 He takes three steps before a former student hits him with a kiss and asks if 
the man she considers her surrogate father might give her away at her July 
wedding. 
</P>
<P>
 Another student approaches to vigorously pump the hand of the man he 
respectfully calls "Dad" -- the man who provides the encouragement to stick 
with college, especially when the student's own father, an alcoholic, abuses 
his mother until the violence becomes unbearable. 
</P>
<P>
 Then a proud Mexican woman whose son is the first in the family to attend 
college bashfully asks Ortiz to pose with her for a photo. Wearing a gorgeous 
braid and fringed shawl, she wraps her arms around his waist, snuggles her head 
against his chest and smiles, revealing several gold-capped teeth. "One day I 
will show my grandchildren his picture," she says later in Spanish, "and I will 
tell them, ' El Jefe is the reason for my son's success."' But Ortiz, a 
painfully shy man, flatly refuses to take the credit. 
</P>
<P>
 The praise, he says, should be showered on the parents and their kids. Thanks 
should go to Ash and his predecessors -- except the one who tried to put the 
center out of business in its early years. And, he says, the center's Hispanic 
Students Assn., the Hispanic Parents Advisory Council and the Hispanic alumni 
group should also be commended. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1970, two years after returning to Whittier to teach Chicano studies, 
Ortiz, then 49, became the center's founding director. The college's enrollment 
was 5.5% Latino. Five years later, it reached 16%. This year, 27% of the 1,260 
students are Latino -- the highest percentage among the 73-member Assn. of 
Independent California Colleges and Universities. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Jonathan Brown, the association's president: "Carefully and cautiously, 
Martin has followed a social mission to deeply enmesh Whittier into the Latino 
community. He is the foot soldier who has made it work." 
</P>
<P>
 No matter what their heritage, students pop into his small office, four 
flights up from the president's suite, to ask for advice and letters of 
recommendation, or to just say hello to "Mr. Whittier College," another of 
Ortiz's monikers. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual tardeada , held since 1970, is one of the many ways Richard Nixon's 
alma mater embraces its diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 And every year Ortiz revels in introducing parents to professors and students 
to administrators, then slips into the background because the spotlight, he 
says, "belongs on our students." 
</P>
<P>
 But not this year. 
</P>
<P>
 After everyone settles into their chairs with plates of carne asada tacos, 
rice and refried beans, after the band brilliantly performs its last classical 
song, after the announcement "to hold onto your beer cups because we're all 
out" comes the real reason for the celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Ash, simply, eloquently: "We are here today to celebrate the gentleman 
whose work is the glorious fulfillment of his hopes and dreams." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, El Jefe , surrounded by cheering and applauding students, is moved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in heaven," he whispers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, Ortiz is strolling across the velvety green grounds of 
Whittier College, founded by the Quakers 107 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In the distance, a trio of students strikes out of their path to say hello, 
filling him in on their schedules, assignments and grades, and regaling him 
with stories about their families, from little brothers and sisters to 
grandparents Ortiz has befriended. He never forgets a name or a face. 
</P>
<P>
 Destiny must have brought Ortiz to a place where he could touch many lives, 
where he could help tear down the barriers that keep many Latinos from going to 
college. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the decades, in his low-key but persuasive style, he tells parents who 
never finished high school, who never considered higher education, to change 
history by giving their kids a shot at the American Dream. He reassures Latinos 
that attending college, instead of working full time to help their families, is 
the right thing to do. And he manages to alleviate fears about fitting in at 
Whittier, where wealthier white students are in the majority. 
</P>
<P>
 He speaks from his own experience. 
</P>
<P>
 His father never encouraged education because he never went to school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not even for one day," Ortiz says. Tirso Ortiz rode with Pancho Villa during 
the Mexican Revolution and later immigrated to the United States, settling in 
Wichita, Kan. His wife died when Martin was 4. He later remarried, but Martin 
never bonded with his stepmother. There were too many children. The oldest of 
12, he worked whenever he could to help. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in a Wichita barrio called El Huarache, he grew up in poverty. Even 
though he couldn't speak English, he understood enough of the language to love 
school -- until the eighth grade. As long as he lives he'll never forget his 
teacher that year. It was Mrs. Mitchell, a tall, skinny woman "with a strange 
hairdo" who chastised him every time he spoke Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember just asking if I could go to the bathroom because I didn't know 
how to say it in English. One day Mrs. Mitchell sat me in the corner of the 
classroom by myself. She emptied all the desks around me and pinned a sign on 
my shirt." 
</P>
<P>
 For an entire semester, the pinning became a ritual. 
</P>
<P>
 Every morning, his classmates would dance around him, laughing, pointing to 
the placard that proclaimed: "I am retarded." 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know what the sign meant then," Ortiz says. "But I know that I 
didn't cry." That ordeal fired a resolve "to never let that happen to anyone 
again" and to dedicate his career -- with help from his assistant, Rose 
Hernandez -- to creating opportunities for Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If he's not on the telephone pitching the college to high school counselors, 
corporations and contributors, he's showing the campus to a prospective student 
and parents, catching up on scholarship fund-raising letters or typing speeches 
with index fingers on his 20-year-old Remington. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Ash: "Mr. Ortiz has generated enormous respect both at Whittier College 
and across the country for his work. He is an amazing man -- very modest, but a 
real giant in the education field." 
</P>
<P>
 Adan Ortega, a 1984 Whittier graduate and one of three Latinos on the 
college's board of trustees, was a high school sophomore and an aspiring U.S. 
Senate page when he met Ortiz, who served on the selection panel that year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Martin is a cultivator," says Ortega, the first college graduate in his 
family. He recalls riding his bike to the campus that summer. Ortiz would treat 
him to lunch, "always stressing college." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, after Ortega's father lost his job, Ortiz helped him get financial aid. 
While taking a slate of classes, Ortega worked full time as a movie theater 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "The beauty in what Martin has done through the center is not give students a 
handout," Ortega says. "He has created a network that empowers students." 
</P>
<P>
 And he has also forged lifelong friendships. 
</P>
<P>
 "Martin has given me windows into the different stages of life," Ortega says, 
explaining that his friend has advised him on everything from his career to a 
painful divorce. "He's the patron saint of Whittier College." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Olivia Cervantes doesn't need convincing. 
</P>
<P>
 As chairwoman of the Hispanic Parents Advisory Council, a support group that 
meets at the center, she sees Ortiz work his magic on parents as well, 
arranging financial-aid workshops and other programs. He translates at 
meetings, visits parents at home and invites them to campus for walks and 
lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 Cervantes' oldest daughter, Jacquelyn, graduated in 1987 thanks to Ortiz's 
scholarship assistance. Today, her youngest daughter, Judi, a sophomore, is in 
the same good hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Guatemalan-born Joseph Solorzano, a 21-year-old senior and Hispanic Student 
Assn. member, credits Ortiz with keeping him in school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had some family problems at home this summer and when I got back to school, 
I talked to Mr. Ortiz about that," Solorzano says. "He shared his personal life 
with me and made it obvious that returning to school was the best thing for 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Ortiz told the student of his own brief escape from school.  
</P>
<P>
 At 13, toward the Depression's end, Ortiz was frustrated, pressured by 
discrimination in school and alienation at home. He and two friends went to the 
local railroad yard and caught the first freight train headed for Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 "We became hobos for 3 1/2 years," Ortiz says. He remembers jumping aboard 
boxcars filled with two or three families, riding atop and underneath cars, and 
getting locked inside one for days at a time. His nickname was "Wichita." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was on the move. But I didn't beg or steal," he says. He worked on a sugar 
beet farm. He gathered potatoes. Picked cotton. Harvested apples. He slept in 
railroad jungles, heated food in tin cans over campfires, and learned to speak 
English. "I went wherever the tracks took me with no destination in mind." 
</P>
<P>
 At 16, tired of his directionless lifestyle, he returned home and enrolled in 
high school, one of three Latinos. In his senior year, he became the school's 
first Latino student council president. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ortiz never planned to attend college. He had to work and was content sacking 
groceries at the neighborhood Safeway. But one morning a friend rousted him out 
of bed and took him to Friends University, a Quaker-run school, on registration 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 "My friend had a paper bag with him. We went into the men's room in the 
basement, and he pulled out a shirt. 'Put this on. You're going to college,' " 
Ortiz recalls his friend saying. 
</P>
<P>
 "My friend did this because he felt that I was college material. He had faith 
in me." So did three other Anglo friends who dipped into their pockets to pay 
Ortiz's $200 tuition, and later tutored him. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, Ortiz was the guest speaker at his high school reunion in the 
very hotel where he had been barred as a youth because of his brown skin. In 
the back of the ballroom sat his four buddies, wiping away tears as he spoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you fellows did for me is what I have been doing all these years at 
Whittier College," Ortiz recalls saying. "Nurturing the minds of young people 
with potential." 
</P>
<P>
 Ortiz put in one semester at Friends, then signed up with the Marines in 1942, 
serving in the South Pacific as an aerologist and language specialist. After 
World War II, he enrolled at Whittier because it offered a YMCA management 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 His skin color, his last name, his sack lunches of tacos -- who knows why, he 
says -- kept him from feeling accepted by other students. "I just kept to my 
own and in my own place because it was more comfortable to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 In town, no barber would touch his head, no restaurant would give him a table, 
no landlord would rent an apartment to Ortiz and his young Cuban-born bride. So 
they lived in veterans housing near City Hall and persevered. 
</P>
<P>
 After he earned a sociology degree, the couple moved to Chicago, where Ortiz 
got his master's degree in sociology from George Williams College. He also 
founded the city's Mexican American Council and taught Spanish at a YMCA. 
</P>
<P>
 Then his wife, Maria, was found to have a brain tumor. After two operations 
she lapsed into a coma that would last 4 1/2 years. Eventually, Ortiz returned 
her to Cuba -- her body stretched across six plane seats -- where the press 
dubbed her "La Cubana Dormida," the sleeping Cuban woman. She died at 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Ortiz remarried in 1980. He and his wife, Linda, a bilingual kindergarten 
teacher, share a home in La Habra with Peluso, a floppy-eared rabbit; 
Valentine, a turtle; Perlita and Emi, two cats; Iggy, the iguana, and Foxy, a 
mutt Ortiz found beaten and left for dead 11 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other night I went home and the dog bit me," Ortiz says. "He hadn't seen 
me for a few days because I'd been so busy, coming home late from meetings. 
Finally, he said, 'I'll get your attention.' " 
</P>
<P>
 When Ortiz isn't caring for his menagerie, he's working in his rose garden, 
reading one of five newspapers or reliving his hobo years at National Hobo 
Assn. meetings in Century City. And when he isn't deep into work at the center, 
he's serving on commissions, committees and boards across Southern California, 
and planning for his return to school to finish his doctorate. 
</P>
<P>
 But his kids always come first. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people ask me if I have any children, I say, 'Well, this year I have 
340.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Marissa Gallegos is one. 
</P>
<P>
 The 21-year-old senior psychology major says Ortiz has given her ganas . 
Determination. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before I started college I thought of myself as not having the potential to 
excel, not being able to get involved," she says. "But Mr. Ortiz has made me 
feel like I am special and that I do have something special to offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing that scares me is what will happen whenever he leaves. I know 
the students will carry on all his traditions, but it's scary thinking about 
him not being here. Nobody can ever take his place." 
</P>
<P>
 Ortiz isn't going anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 He's healthy. He gets around just fine in his 1989 Olds. He could have left 
Whittier long ago, he says, for jobs with quadruple the salary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to be associated with Whittier College as long as I can do this job 
mentally, academically and physically," he says, adding that he has much to do, 
such as a movimiento to add Latino professors to the four on staff. 
</P>
<P>
 He's looking to the future and the thousands of parents out there with 
children hungry for an education. 
</P>
<P>
 On his own college commencement day, Ortiz's father was in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll never forget when I walked past him after I got my diploma," Ortiz 
recalls. He stops. His eyes water. "My dad was crying. He was in tears because 
a member of his family had graduated from college." Martin Ortiz 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 73 
</P>
<P>
 Native?: Born in Wichita, Kan.; resides in La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
 Family: Married to Linda Ortiz. The couple have no children, but Ortiz calls 
the 340 Latinos at Whittier his kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Passions: "Monday Night Football," historical documentaries, eating seafood, 
taking long walks with students. 
</P>
<P>
 On being 73: "I took a physical not too long ago and the doctors were 
surprised that I was 73. I told them that my definition of an old person is 
anybody who is 10 years older than I am." 
</P>
<P>
 On his love for work: "I'm not ready to stop what I'm doing and just think 
about myself. I have my work, which I don't see as a job. It's a cause that I 
am committed to, that I am passionate about. Why would I want to retire when 
there is still so much work to be done?" 
</P>
<P>
 On his biggest secret: "People don't know that I'm a magician. I can pull a 
coin out of an ear. I'm also a drummer. Friends used to call me 'Drumsticks' 
when I had my own pick-up band in Chicago. We played jazz at weddings, 
receptions and funerals. I used to carry drumsticks up my sleeve and play them 
on everything: books, trash cans, tabletops." 
</P>
<P>
 On the importance of college: "I've had many students who have said, 'Mr. 
Ortiz, my father doesn't want me to go to college. He thinks I should be out 
working or get married and settle down.' Sometimes Latino parents don't 
understand the world of academia. They're conditioned by the past. I tell 
parents that college is the future and their children belong in it."

 Call them "Less Than Satisfying Encounters With Humanity," or LTSEWH for 
short. I swear they're true. Only the names have been omitted to protect the 
imbecilic. 
</P>
<P>
 LTSEWH 1: 
</P>
<P>
 I was driving down Veteran Avenue near UCLA one black night, in my wretched, 
decrepit, backfiring automobile. The one with the duct tape hanging off the 
windows and the petrified bird dung on the roof (guaranteed to prevent 
carjacking). "Rip's Krazy Kar," as my friends call it. The street lights were 
on the blink, so it was especially dark. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, without warning, my headlights caught the image of human-on-bicycle. 
It was all I could see, frozen in stark light like a leaping deer -- a young 
male on a bike, darting diagonally in front of me, no more than 20 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
 I braked and violently swerved. Right into the oncoming traffic lane, which 
was mercifully empty. 
</P>
<P>
 I shouted the name of the symbol of a popular religion. I looked to my right. 
There was the cyclist, cruising blithely along -- with his hands folded against 
his chest! As if he were coasting on a damned unicycle. He was in his early 
20s, I'd guess, and didn't seem the least fazed by the fact that he had just 
nearly lost his life. It was then I concluded that -- for whatever bizarre 
reason -- his maneuver had been intentional. You know, Just do it. Go for it, 
dude.  
</P>
<P>
 "Hey!" I yelled, pulling alongside, rolling down my passenger window. Now, 
understand that there were many picturesque things I wished to say to the young 
man, but instead I gritted my teeth and opted for something civilized. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey! You should wear white clothing and get a light for your bike. I nearly 
killed you!" 
</P>
<P>
 The kid looked at me with plain disgust and yelled, "What?" 
</P>
<P>
 I repeated my advice. 
</P>
<P>
 The kid screwed up his face, actually waved me away, and this -- so help me -- 
is what he said: 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have listen to a lecture from you ! I go to law school!" 
</P>
<P>
 I must say that I still find this remark hard to believe. The celebrated 
dismissive two-word phrase ending in "you" would have been preferable. I think. 
When I recovered, I gritted my teeth and opted to say something . . . 
uncivilized. The parts that I can print in a newspaper went something like this 
(with many lively and colorful terms omitted): 
</P>
<P>
 "That figures. Law school! Right! Of course! What else would an idiotic punk 
like you be doing with your life! You are exactly what's wrong with the law 
profession! No wonder people hate all law students and lawyers! Can't wait to 
graduate and get that BMW, I'll bet. Well, I hope you crash your damned BMW 
head-on into a tree!" 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, I guess you could say I was fairly angry. I probably, at that point, 
looked rather like Lon Chaney Sr. Perhaps as he looked in the film "London 
After Midnight," in which he portrayed a leering vampire. Saliva flew from my 
mouth as I further uttered the wish that untold horrors befall the young man -- 
which did seem to rattle him a bit -- and then I drove on.

 While strolling on the Venice Beach boardwalk, I stopped to browse in one of 
those nice South American import stores, with all those beautiful multicolored 
hats and shirts. I had just purchased two knit caps from another establishment, 
and had one in each front pocket. Because I've noticed that the proprietor in 
this import place watches customers closely and suspiciously, I sought to avert 
any potential misunderstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hi," I said, smiling. "I've got hats in my pockets." 
</P>
<P>
 I pulled the hats part way out of my pockets, so she could see them. She 
looked at me dumbly, and with slight irritation. 
</P>
<P>
 " What? " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got hats in my pockets." I smiled again. 
</P>
<P>
 "So what," she said. "Why are you telling me that?" Oh, good. She didn't get 
it. She thought I was nuts. Next I would tell her about the kangaroo in my 
pants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, sorry -- I just bought these hats outside, and I wanted to let you know 
so you wouldn't think I was shoplifting." 
</P>
<P>
 She eyed me like I was about as consequential as ant breath. 
</P>
<P>
 (Do ants breathe?) 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I don't care!" she huffed. 
</P>
<P>
 "In that case," I smiled, "I'll just steal everything I want!" And I winked. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, the woman looked openly fearful, having concluded that I was 
both crazy and a thief. 
</P>
<P>
 "You better not! I'll catch you!" she threatened, then emerged from behind the 
counter to keep an eye on me.  
</P>
<P>
 Undaunted, I tried on a hat, and walked to what I thought was a mirror to 
inspect it. It wasn't a mirror, though -- it was just a framed hole in the wall 
looking directly into another part of the store. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, that's not a mirror!" I laughed. "It's a passage into another dimension!" 
</P>
<P>
 I waited in vain for the now horrified woman to laugh approvingly at my joke. 
A voice from behind spoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mirror is behind you, sir." It was a young fellow with a wispy 
half-beard, apparently an employee. 
</P>
<P>
 I thanked him, and explained that I had avoided that mirror because it was 
positioned at about knee-level. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mirror is right behind you, sir," he repeated. 
</P>
<P>
 I took that hat off. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never mind. Since I walked into this store, no one has understood a word I've 
said." 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, " said the wispy-bearded young fellow, "maybe you don't speak our 
language!" 
</P>
<P>
 "You're right," I said, "And I thank God for it." 
</P>
<P>
 They both stared after me as I walked out, with what I took to be hostility 
and amazement. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 "What city?" asked the directory assistance operator. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a difficult question, especially when you don't know what city -- that 
the number you seek belongs to someone who resides somewhere on the west side 
of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The west side of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 "West L.A.?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No. West L.A. is a particular city. This is somewhere on the west side of Los 
Angeles -- could be West L.A., Playa del Rey, Santa Monica, L.A. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 "I need a city. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I said, I don't know the exact city. It's on the west side." 
</P>
<P>
 "The west side of what?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 "So, it's Los Angeles, then?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No, well, yes, well -- don't you just have a west side directory?" 
</P>
<P>
 "What city, sir?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what -- " 
</P>
<P>
 "What city?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, I don't know what the (expletive) city is -- " 
</P>
<P>
 "Do not use profanity, sir! It's against the law!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, then, don't act like a goddamned robot!" 
</P>
<P>
 With that, my line went dead. It stayed dead for about 15 minutes. The 
operator had taken my phone away, punishing me for my profanity. What a naughty 
boy I had been! Guess she showed me! When service was finally resumed, a 
supervisor suggested that if I apologized to the operator, my service could be 
permanently restored. 
</P>
<P>
 "OK, I'm terribly sorry," I said, and got my phone back. 
</P>
<P>
 I would like to say at this juncture, should that particular operator happen 
to be reading, that I really wasn't sorry at all. And that, as I write this, I 
am thumbing my nose in her general direction.

PRESERVING THE PAST; PRESERVATION: COMMUNITIES ESTABLISH ZONES TO PROTECT 
NEIGHBORHOODS' HISTORIC, ARCHITECTURAL AND CULTURAL CHARACTERISTICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By R. DANIEL FOSTER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Foster is a Los Angeles free-lance 
writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a city that reinvents itself with each new architectural whim, preserving 
the look of older neighborhoods can be a quixotic task. Indeed, those who live 
in such areas say their fight to shelter their communities is like chasing 
after historic characteristics that only they can see and appreciate. 
</P>
<P>
 But buoyed by a city of Los Angeles ordinance created in 1979 that can seal 
neighborhoods against indecorous development and renovation, city residents 
have since found new teeth. They have battled to create seven such areas, 
called Historic Preservation Overlay Zones (HPOZs), and are pushing for 11 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles is behind other cities that have many more zones," said Barbara 
Hoff, director of preservation issues at the Los Angeles Conservancy, a 
nonprofit group that helps residents win historic designations. "A typical East 
Coast city has 27 zones or more. People forget that historical doesn't just 
mean houses from the 1820s and '30s, it also means those from the 1920s and 
'30s." 
</P>
<P>
 HPOZs are designed to preserve neighborhoods' historic, architectural, 
cultural or aesthetic significance. The majority of homes in HPOZs (the first 
was Angelino Heights, designated in 1983) are over 40 years old. Some zones are 
carved out of neat square blocks of residential tracts. Others have jagged 
boundaries that avoid commercial districts, although one proposed zone in 
Venice consists entirely of commercial real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 An HPOZ does not require homeowners to fix up their properties, but an HPOZ 
neighborhood association reviews any proposed exterior changes that are visible 
from the street. Aluminum windows or stucco, for example, would mar the design 
integrity of a Craftsman bungalow and would not be allowed. Routine maintenance 
is not affected by a zone's design requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Additions or new structures, which, under an HPOZ, require approval from the 
Cultural Heritage Commission and city Planning Department, need not match 
existing architectural styles in the zone, but they must fit the area's 
aesthetic standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who fight for HPOZs say the process is tedious, time consuming, involves 
political infighting among factions of the city council and residents, and is 
often frustrating. It involves numerous community meetings and public hearings, 
petitioning of homeowners, historical surveys, and perhaps most difficult, 
convincing neighbors that an overlay zone is not bad medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 Many homeowners, for example, mistakenly believe they will be prevented from 
altering the insides of their homes or from adding or renovating patios, 
fences, porches, sun decks or balconies without having to navigate the city's 
bureaucratic approval process. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners and renters often begin their battle for an HPOZ when yet another 
Craftsman bungalow or Spanish revival home is razed to make room for garish 
apartment complexes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Developers would buy up 12 homes at a time, tear them all down and put up 
really ugly, huge buildings. Detroit Street is pretty much decimated," said 
Denise Robb, who lives in the Miracle Mile district. Robb formed the Miracle 
Mile Action Committee in 1989 to continue a battle that was begun in 1986 for 
an HPOZ called Miracle Mile South. 
</P>
<P>
 Bounded by 3rd Street and Wilshire Boulevard to the north and south and 
Detroit Street and Hauser Boulevard to the east and west, the proposed zone is 
adjacent to the Miracle Mile North HPOZ, which was secured in May, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Robb's neighborhood consists mostly of Depression-era Spanish-style apartment 
buildings, many designed by celebrated architects Max Maltzman and Milton 
Black. The structures are more difficult to protect than single-family homes 
since landlords are largely absent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always hear the complaint that we shouldn't have a zone because tenants are 
transient, but some have lived here for 15, 25 years," said Robb, who has 
rented in the area for seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 Robb and five other board members have made weekly forays to City Hall and 
libraries, tracking down the neighborhood's history. Since Robb began her 
crusade in 1986, she said that 51 buildings have been torn down and developers 
keep phoning up owners, making offers. According to one estimate, 50% of 
Miracle Mile South has been redeveloped. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Robb and her crew now feel more bitter than encouraged, others say 
their long fight has been worth it, bringing neighbors together in ways even an 
earthquake and riot could not accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
 "At our first meeting in 1987, we packed the old Masonic Temple on Figueroa 
with 400 people," said architect Richard Barron, who helped secure the city's 
most recent and largest HPOZ, Highland Park, awarded in June. "We knew then 
that we had something -- a love of the community." 
</P>
<P>
 To advertise their meeting, Barron and other neighbors posted signs depicting 
a bulldozer about to devour a tiny bungalow. 
</P>
<P>
 Other residents fighting for HPOZs said that neighbors, as well as developers, 
can be blind to a community's past -- owners don't understand how their 
Craftsman bungalow, with its peeling paint and tattered roof, could be deemed 
historic. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a constant fight to keep your neighbors' awareness up about the 
significance of their area," said Richard von Earnst, who began holding 
meetings in January to fight for a Lafayette Square HPOZ in the mid-city area. 
"People here live in a broad range of homes -- Craftsman, Victorian, Tudor and 
Norman styles built from 1912 to the 1920s, but some don't realize what they 
have." 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of an HPOZ is to consider the relevance of whole districts, not 
single structures, said Hoff and others. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell people to picture one row house," Hoff said. "Alone, it's not that 
significant, but lined up block after block it forms the fabric of the 
community. We have to look at the overall picture, rather than individual 
buildings." 
</P>
<P>
 With that concept in mind, the city is looking to revise language in the HPOZ 
ordinance. Some clauses require structures to be associated with an important 
architect, master builder or designer. 
</P>
<P>
 Such requirements have forced residents to do painstaking research to unearth 
a home's past. Charlie Fisher, whose family has lived in Highland Park since 
the turn of the century, scoured newspapers dating pre-1905 for building permit 
records. Fisher, who lives in a 1908 Greek Revival bungalow on Avenue 57, said 
that about half of Highland Park's 3,000 structures are deemed as contributing 
to the zone's historic status. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the city's smallest HPOZ contains 45 homes in Melrose Hill, 
consisting of the 4900 block of Marathon Street and all of West and North 
Melrose Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 During Melrose Hill's fight for HPOZ status, neighbors joined forces to plant 
stands of jacaranda trees along the boulevards and they added antique street 
lights, struck from a 1910 lamp mold once used in New York's Central Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Such upgrading helps real estate agents use a neighborhood's HPOZ status to 
sell homes, and according to the National Trust for Historical Preservation, an 
HPOZ is a good investment. Property values of homes within historic districts 
usually increase because of the designation. 
</P>
<P>
 And the sense of community that zones create often helps to reduce crime, say 
homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 The area surrounding Melrose Hill consists of "major blight -- transvestite 
hookers and drug dealers a few blocks away," said Bill Wilson, the third 
generation of his family to live in a 1917 Craftsman bungalow edged in burgundy 
trim. But like the eye of a hurricane, Melrose Hill stays relatively calm. 
Still, Wilson has fortified his house, adding new features. He said the HPOZ 
has not hindered or added expense to his construction plans, which were 
approved by the community's HPOZ association. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm finishing work on a portal and gate at the base of 20 concrete steps that 
lead up to the house," he said. "It's Craftsman-like -- wood beams with a 
pitched, copper roof." 
</P>
<P>
 The crusade for a Melrose Hill HPOZ, largely led by homeowner Ed Hunt who has 
lived in a 1923 English Tudor brick house for 15 years, took 15 years -- not a 
lengthy time period when considering what is involved in the process, said Hoff 
and others. The procedure often becomes stalled as it languishes in the City 
Council, Planning Department or Cultural Affairs Commission offices. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a recent push by the city to secure the Miracle Mile South HPOZ 
failed because a procedural deadline was missed by over seven years. Other 
times, neighbors just don't agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "We brought up the zone once, at a town hall meeting two years ago," said 
Sesiah Lane, who lives in Atwater Village, known for its colonial and Spanish 
Revival homes and fantasy bungalows with miniature turrets and cupolas. "There 
was a lot of negative feelings. People think we will be telling them what color 
to paint their homes." 
</P>
<P>
 But more than educating homeowners about what's required from an HPOZ, 
residents say that raising their neighbors' appreciation for history remains 
their biggest challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "L.A.'s idea of historic preservation is moving six or seven old mansions to 
Heritage Square where you plunk down your $5 to see them lined up on a fake 
street," said Barron, who is the seventh owner of a Victorian home built in 
1896. "Los Angeles has always prized the new as opposed to the old. Bright and 
shiny has always won over any patina. Look what they did to Bunker Hill." Help

HOT PROPERTY: L.A.'S A WRAP FOR REYNOLDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 DEBBIE REYNOLDS, who opened her hotel/casino in Las Vegas about a year ago and 
is planning to open her Hollywood museum there in January, has put a Beverly 
Hills lot that she has owned for a few years on the market at $1.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going to build a home there, but I bought the hotel, and it takes my 
full time. So I have to give up the house plans," she said by phone from Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Her lot, which she once had listed at $1.75 million, is sloped with pine trees 
across the front. "It's half a block up the hill from the Jack Warner estate 
(now owned by David Geffen) and is right off of Benedict Canyon, near the 
Beverly Hills Hotel," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds, 62, will play a character's mother in the NBC "Wings" segment titled 
"If It's Not One Thing, It's Your Mother," airing Nov. 22, and she appears with 
a number of other stars in the film tribute to MGM musicals, "That's 
Entertainment! III," released in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than such occasional parts, Reynolds only comes to Los Angeles once a 
month, she says, to see her daughter, writer/actress Carrie Fisher, and her 
granddaughter, Fisher's daughter. Reynolds' son, Todd, has been helping to 
renovate and expand the hotel/casino. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had a condo here (in Las Vegas) for 20 years, and though I have a small 
place in North Hollywood, I just fly in (to L.A.) to visit. I don't stay," 
Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
 She has been too busy running the 200-room hotel/casino, which she bought at 
auction as the former Paddlewheel Hotel in 1992. "I had to build a showroom, 
where we do a show every night and two shows on the weekends, and a cafe, where 
we do a lounge show," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds, who is going through her third divorce, is also getting ready to 
display part of her Hollywood memorabilia collection, which she estimates is 
worth $20 million, in an 8,000-square-foot museum on her 8.5-acre hotel/casino 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 "The walls are being covered, and the carpet is being laid," she said. "Money 
(from the lot sale) will likely go for more purchases (of memorabilia)." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Clarke of Fred Sands Estates, Beverly Hills, has the listing. 
</P>
<P>
 MARILYN MONROE'S Brentwood home, where she died in 1962, has been sold, and 
although there were some rumors last week that the house will be razed, there 
are "absolutely no plans right now to tear it down," a source said. 
</P>
<P>
 The house sold for $995,000 to director Michael Ritchie and his architect 
wife, Jimmie, according to public records. The home had been listed at 
$1,025,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Ritchie, who started as a documentary filmmaker on TV's "Omnibus" before 
directing "The Candidate" and "The Bad News Bears," directed this year's films 
"The Scout" and "Cops and Robbersons." His book "Please Stand By: A Prehistory 
of Television" was published earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brentwood home, said to be the only house that Monroe ever owned, is on 
half an acre with a pool, spa and city-lights view. Built in 1929, the 
hacienda-style residence has three bedrooms and a guest house in slightly more 
than 2,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 It was being leased when it was sold by Alexander and Candice Bull, described 
as being in the country music business and living in Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
 The buyers were represented by Marsha Rebney of Prudential Rodeo Realty, 
Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 RICK ROSENFIELD, one of the owners of the California Pizza Kitchen 
restaurants, and his wife, Esther, just purchased an 11,000-square-foot home on 
five acres in Bel-Air for a bit more than $7 million, including some 
furnishings, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent asking price of the home was $8.9 million, but it is said to 
have been on the market at one time at $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The seller, a perfume manufacturer who bought the home in 1991, had nearly $11 
million invested in the residence, sources say. The assessed value is slightly 
more than $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rosenfields recently sold their former Beverly Hills home for just under 
$2 million, other sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not officially on the market but . . . a number of real estate brokers 
say that the Bel-Air home that actor RICHARD GERE and his wife, super-model 
CINDY CRAWFORD, bought in May, 1993, for about $5 million is being shown at 
just under $7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, the famous couple took out a full-page ad in the Times of London, 
proclaiming "reports of a divorce are totally false," but since then, rumors of 
a split have continued to hound the pair.

AT HOME: REDEVELOPED CITY HAS BREEZY ATMOSPHERE; HUNTINGTON BEACH: 
REDEVELOPMENT IN THE 1980S BROUGHT RESTAURANTS, CAFES AND THEATERS TO 
DOWNTOWN'S NEW STREETS. 
</P>

lives in Old Orange.

<P>
 As a kid, Joe Bunney rode his bike from his home in Fountain Valley to 
downtown Huntington Beach, where he dreamed of living someday. Just recently 
Bunney's childhood wish became a reality when he and his wife bought a home 
just five blocks from the ocean.  
</P>
<P>
 Not only does Bunney like living so close to the ocean, he's also fond of 
downtown's casual atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very comfortable, relaxing lifestyle, which is refreshing to come home 
to after a stressful day at work," said Bunney, 32, a dental X-ray equipment 
salesman. 
</P>
<P>
 For a home that close to the ocean, the Bunneys found downtown real estate 
affordable. He and his wife, Angela, paid $355,000 for their three-bedroom, 2 
1/2-bath, 2,400-square-foot house. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Huntington Beach is much different than Angela Bunney's native North 
Carolina, she has been pleasantly surprised by the friendliness of her new 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought people would be standoffish at the beach," the 27-year-old 
schoolteacher said. "But downtown is a really friendly neighborhood like I'm 
used to." 
</P>
<P>
 Downtown is an easygoing area, agreed Tom Van Tuyl, a realtor with Pier Realty 
Inc. "Residents go home, put on their beach clothes and relax," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And the mix of residents in downtown is eclectic. "They're from all walks of 
life, income levels, ages and family situations," Van Tuyl said. 
</P>
<P>
 Downtown covers about 2 3/4 square miles and is bounded by Pacific Coast 
Highway on the south, Beach Boulevard on the east, Yorktown on the north and 
Golden West on the west. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a wide variety of housing styles and prices in downtown, Van Tuyl 
said. For about $200,000 you can find a two-bedroom, one-bath cottage of about 
1,000 square feet that was built in the early 1900s. An average home is about 
2,000 square feet and costs $300,000 for three bedrooms and 2 1/2 baths. On the 
high end of the scale are homes of 3,000 square feet with three to four 
bedrooms and 3 1/2 baths for about $575,000. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also many condominium projects in the downtown area, Van Tuyl said. 
An average condo of 900 square feet with an ocean view that has two bedrooms 
and two baths costs from $200,000 to $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The commercial section of downtown is hopping nowadays as residents and 
visitors stroll the newly renovated streets. In the 1970s, this once-bustling 
area withered as new housing and shopping being built in other areas of 
Huntington Beach pulled businesses away, leaving many buildings vacant. In the 
mid-1980s, the city began redevelopment to restore the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, restaurants, cafes, ice cream parlors, beach ware shops, theaters and a 
few commercial businesses make up the thriving retail area. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing downtown restored to its former glory thrilled longtime resident Tony 
Tovatt, who came to town in 1925 with his family and opened a hardware store 
the next year. Tovatt has spent the last six decades running businesses in the 
city, mostly in downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Today Tovatt and his wife, Marge, 75, live in a condominium they bought 21 
years ago for $44,000. It has 1,400 square feet with three bedrooms and two 
baths.  
</P>
<P>
 "Huntington Beach is a great place to raise a family," said Tovatt, whose four 
children have remained in the area. "I went to elementary school here and 
graduated from Huntington Beach High school in 1937. My kids and grandchildren 
have graduated from there too." 
</P>
<P>
 Tovatt looks back fondly to when the downtown area was in its heyday from the 
1940s to the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a wonderful town then," he said. "You didn't have customers, you had 
friends. A lot of important business deals went on over a milkshake at the soda 
fountain." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the downtown of today is different, Tovatt is pleased with the area's 
improvement. "Downtown has changed with the times, which is necessary," he 
said. "I think it looks great and will flourish." 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Huntington Beach had its beginnings in the downtown area at the 
turn of the century. Henry Huntington founded the city in the early 1900s, 
originally calling it Pacific City. Citizens eventually named the town after 
him, however.  
</P>
<P>
 A lot of the older homes in the area are original summer homes built by 
wealthy individuals who lived in Pasadena and the Los Angeles basin and 
vacationed in Huntington Beach.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1920, oil was discovered in the city, quickly boosting the population. 
After World War II, the area again grew rapidly. In the 1950s and 1960s, 
Huntington Beach became known for its great surfing and was soon the home of 
popular surfing contests. 
</P>
<P>
 When Natalie Kotsch first moved to Huntington Beach in 1977, the realtor had 
no idea that one day she'd help found the city's surfing museum and serve on 
multiple redevelopment committees. 
</P>
<P>
 When Kotsch moved to downtown, she lived in a two-bedroom, two-bath condo she 
bought for $115,000. In 1979 she bought a four-bedroom, 2 1/2-bath home for 
$139,000. After living there five years, she moved to a 2,800-square-foot, 
four-bedroom, three-bath house for which she paid $289,000. Today she lives in 
her first house, which she had kept as a rental. 
</P>
<P>
 For Kotsch, 56, who is originally from Canada, there is no community like 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really like the diversity of downtown," she said. "You can find just about 
any kind of home you might need. There are studio condos with ocean views and 
big houses with yards." 
</P>
<P>
 Like other residents, Kotsch also likes the social climate of downtown. "There 
is really a lack of snobbery here," she said. "It's a real village atmosphere. 
A millionaire may be living next door to a starving surfer student."  
</P>
<P>
 Every year Kotsch rides in the city's Fourth of July parade, which passes 
through downtown. The parade, started in 1909, is the longest running and 
biggest Fourth of July parade west of the Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth of July in Huntington Beach has become controversial in recent years. 
In 1993, 40 men were arrested after a roving party raged out of control for 
about 30 minutes in the middle of a downtown street. In 1994, more than 50 
people were arrested in the downtown area for public drunkenness, resisting 
arrest and failure to disperse. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Shlaudemans, who moved to downtown, in March of 1993, haven't been 
affected by the melees. 
</P>
<P>
 "The morning after July 4, 1993, it wasn't until we walked downtown for 
breakfast that we heard about the rioting," said Bob Shlaudeman, 34, a mortgage 
broker. "We've been lucky. We've talked to some downtown residents who say late 
night parties get pretty loud." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Shlaudeman, who loves to surf, had always dreamed of buying a place 
in downtown, he never thought he'd be able to afford the area until he and his 
wife Mary Lou, 42, a wholesale mortgage banker, found the perfect house at the 
right price. Their three-bedroom, 2 1/2-bath, 2,000-square-foot home cost 
$278,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "The area is great," Shlaudeman said. Every morning that there are waves, as 
long as he doesn't have an early morning meeting, Shlaudeman walks the four 
blocks to the beach and surfs. 
</P>
<P>
 "At 6 a.m. it's very peaceful on the water," he said. "There's no traffic on 
PCH and the beach is deserted except for other surfers. There's nothing like 
having the ocean to myself and thinking about the day ahead of me." At a Glance

HOW TO SECURE AN HPOZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By R. DANIEL FOSTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An HPOZ is usually initiated by homeowners and renters who perceive that their 
neighborhood's character is being lost to development or inappropriate design 
alterations. A member of the Los Angeles City Council makes a motion to look 
into the designation, and the council eventually votes on the issue after the 
following steps are taken: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Neighbors form a committee to prepare an architectural survey for the city. 
The survey includes photographs of homes and other buildings thought to be 
historic, a history of the community and records of individual structures 
(includes building permits, names of architects or builders and architectural 
styles). 
</P>
<P>
 -- The committee holds meetings to educate residents about the proposed HPOZ 
and submits the survey to them for review. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The committee drafts a petition stating its intention to form an HPOZ and 
gathers signatures from a solid majority of homeowners and renters. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The survey and petition are submitted to the city's Cultural Heritage 
Commission and then to the city's Planning Department for review. The city 
council then votes on the HPOZ. Public hearings are held during each of the 
three approval stages. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The new HPOZ forms a five-member preservation association that reviews any 
routine design alterations to structures in the zone. Three of the 
association's members must be owners or renters living within the zone and two 
members are appointed by the city. Once the HPOZ association approves plans, 
owners can proceed with their projects. There are no initial fees or annual 
dues for HPOZ residents. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Proposed building permits for additions, new structures or major 
alterations are sent to the HPOZ association, which sends its recommendations 
to the Cultural Heritage Commission and the city's Planning Department for 
approval. If denied, property owners can appeal to the planning commission, and 
finally, the city council. Approved building permits for major projects often 
require a $298 certificate of appropriateness. Most design plans (replacing 
windows, resurfacing a house, adding a patio, etc.) are handled at the 
neighborhood level, requiring only the HPOZ association's review. They involve 
no extra cost. R. DANIEL FOSTER

REAL ANSWERS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Q: I hear that the Multiple Listing Service is going public. Does that mean I 
can get access to listings on the MLS or put a listing on the MLS without 
dealing with a real estate agent? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Not necessarily. 
</P>
<P>
 The push to open up the MLS to the public has been moving very slowly. Owned 
by members of the local association of realtors, the Multiple Listing Service 
is a closely guarded information tool of the real estate industry. 
</P>
<P>
 However, there are changes being made. For example, the regional MLS in San 
Diego offers limited public information on its Home Select kiosks scattered 
around the county. Through a high-tech touch screen, home buyers can get 
information such as price, location and home features on specific listings. But 
to see the home, buyers must contact the real estate agent listed. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, only licensed real estate agents can access and list property 
on the Combined L.A./ Westside (CLAW) MLS Inc., according to Sandy Regan, 
administrator of CLAW. 
</P>
<P>
 For sellers who want to sell their homes themselves an alternative is an "open 
listing," which requires paying a real estate agent a fee to list their homes 
on the MLS. "The (service) is geared to sophisticated sellers who want to sell 
their homes themselves," said real estate agent Norman Litter of the Real 
Estate Clearing House, Los Angeles.

RENT WATCH: 30-DAY NOTICES TO TENANTS MUST BE IN WRITING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PROJECT SENTINEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: I plan to remodel the small apartment building I own. Because I need 
cash flow, I will do this work unit-by-unit. I plan to do part of the work 
myself and subcontract the rest. I verbally gave a 30-day notice to a tenant 
who is always late with her rent. I thought that her unit would be a good place 
to begin the remodeling project. 
</P>
<P>
 The day before she was supposed to leave, and shortly before the contractors 
were scheduled to arrive, she came to me with a check for next month's rent. "I 
gave you a 30-day notice," I said. She replied, "Not in writing, you didn't. 
I'm staying." What can I do now? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: Immediately, give her a 30-day notice, this time in writing. Then, if 
you wish, you may try to persuade her to move out before the 30 days are over 
by providing her with an incentive. If she stands fast, you will have to 
postpone your remodeling for another month. And, as you have learned, put all 
your notices in writing in the future. Whose Fault Is It If Notice Doesn't 
Arrive? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: My lease states that I must give my landlord at least 60-day notice of my 
intention to renew my lease or else the agreement automatically expires on the 
last day of the lease term. The agreement also states that the notice must be 
given by certified or registered mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-and-a-half months before the expiration of my present lease, I mailed a 
certified letter to my landlord telling him that I planned to renew. Several 
weeks passed and I never got my return receipt, so I called my landlord. He 
said he hadn't received my notice and, as a result, had rented the apartment to 
another person. Whose responsibility is it when the notice is mailed on time, 
but the post office messes up? Can my landlord force me out? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Because your landlord designated the method of service, the risk of loss of 
the notice shifted to him once you deposited the letter with the postal 
service. He need not receive actual notice for your renewal option to be 
effective as long as you can prove that you complied by mailing the notice 
according to his instructions. So, he must now notify the other party that he 
cannot rent to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Contact your local mediation agency for help in resolving this housing matter. 
Better communications between tenants and landlords can prevent problems like 
these from arising. It is good practice to double check the steps required for 
significant actions, such as renewals of a lease, terminations of tenancy or 
major changes in a lease. Does Wood Stove Meet Local Heating Code? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I rent a studio apartment where the only source of heat is a wood-burning 
stove. I wonder if this is legal, and if so, who is responsible for providing 
the wood? 
</P>
<P>
 A: You can check with your local building inspector's office to see if this 
type of heating meets current codes in your area. Under the Uniform Housing 
Code, the heat source must be capable of maintaining a room temperature of 70 
degrees F at a point three feet above the floor in all habitable rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 If your rental agreement does not specify who buys the wood, this is probably 
a negotiable item. There is probably a good argument that whoever is now 
responsible for the other utilities such as electricity and water will also be 
responsible to supply the wood. 
</P>
<P>
 The mounting concern over air pollution may make this academic. It is possible 
that the daily use of wood-burning stoves will be prohibited in the 
not-too-distant future. Guide Dog Pet Deposit Beyond Tenant's Means 
</P>
<P>
 Q: My friend has been trying to locate an apartment that will also accommodate 
his guide dog. Several managers have told him that both he and the dog would be 
welcome, but they have also quoted a pet deposit ranging from $200 to $500. 
This represents a real hardship for my friend who only has enough money to pay 
the first month's rent and the regular deposit. Can this extra deposit be 
waived because of his circumstances? 
</P>
<P>
 A: According to a recent 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decision, landlords may 
be required to waive special charges for guests or pets when these charges have 
an adverse effect on disabled tenants. The 1988 Fair Housing Amendments Act 
makes it unlawful for landlords to impose different terms and conditions 
relating to deposits because of a person's handicap. In light of these 
decisions, a waiver of the pet deposit may indeed be a possibility. Urge your 
friend to contact his local fair housing agency for further information. For a 
referral in Northern California, call (415) HOUSING.

GARDENING Q&A: DETAILS ON COMPOSTING, EARTHWORMS SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK E. CHRISTENSEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: We want more information on composting and earthworms: What about 
using fireplace ashes, dog and cat feces, oleander leaves, etc.? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: I've had numerous inquiries on these subjects, and have decided to 
center my response around a good recommendation from Bill McBride of Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill keeps plastic containers under his kitchen sink, and the McBrides place 
all their unusable produce scraps (spoiled fruit, fruit peelings, potato 
peelings, waste from lettuce and cabbage, etc.) into these containers. 
</P>
<P>
 Then every day he carries the container(s) out to his garden and digs a small 
hole six to eight inches deep, dropping in the scraps and chopping them with 
his shovel as he adds back some soil. Finally he covers it all up with the 
remaining soil. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on the time of year and the temperature, the scraps are usually 
composted within a week. He digs a new hole each day. The marvel to him is that 
without any other effort his garden soil is now full of earthworms. Lots of 
organic matter in the soil is the key to building up earthworm populations. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill's procedure is a good one, because it's easy and effective. Fireplace 
ashes may also be successfully used in the compost pile or buried in the 
garden. 
</P>
<P>
 However, dog and cat feces, as a rule, are not considered appropriate for use 
in compost because of possible contamination with disease-causing organisms, 
but they may be buried under shrubbery and trees. Manures from vegetarian 
critters such as rabbits and horses, etc., work fine in compost. 
</P>
<P>
 I cannot find any reference to the safety of using oleander debris in compost 
for vegetable gardens, but I would not take a chance if I were you. 
</P>
<P>
 Oleander sap contains two extremely toxic glycosides (nerioside and 
oleandroside). According to several authorities, eating any part of an oleander 
plant, even a single leaf -- or breathing the fumes from burning oleander 
leaves or stems -- can be fatal. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, most people seem to know about this plant, because there are very 
few known poisoning from oleanders even though these plants are grown almost 
everywhere in the Southland. So, why take a chance, especially if you plan to 
use your compost around edible crops in the vegetable garden? Growing Apricots 
When Space Is Limited 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I would like to grow apricots in my yard but don't have space for a 
full-size tree. Any suggestions? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Apricot trees on dwarfing rootstocks do well in our area, reaching a mature 
height of about 10 feet with proper pruning. (Apricots tend to form long, 
relatively straight stems. The trick is to cut back these long stems as they 
form in the summertime, so they will branch out into shorter, spur-like stems 
on a main framework.) Choose Dwarf Royal or Dwarf Nugget inland and Dwarf 
Blenheim or Dwarf Royal near the coast.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Kids will busy themselves for more than an hour with an array of activities at 
their very own child-size table with chairs.Coloring with friends or having tea 
parties with their dolls and stuffed animals will be less bothersome for you as 
you'll no longer have to gather a pile of phone books for the kids to sit on.  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, reluctant eaters may even clean their plates when they can dine at 
their own table. 
</P>
<P>
 All three pieces are made from just one sheet of 3/4-inch plywood or pine. 
Step-by-step instructions and full-size traceable patterns make it easy to do. 
Just transfer the pattern onto wood, cut out and assemble.

CUT YOUR UTILITY BILLS: WATER HEATER CARRIES A NO-LEAK WARRANTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES DULLEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Dulley is a Cincinnati-based engineering 
consultant 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: My old gas water heater doesn't supply enough hot water. Will 
installing one of the new designs with a lifetime no-leak warranty also cut my 
utility bills? How can I compare the many high efficiency models? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: The new gas water heaters with a lifetime no-leak warranty are also 
the most energy-efficient models. These also have no-rust stainless steel 
burners. Most water heaters have only a five or 10 year no-leak warranty. 
</P>
<P>
 For a typical family of four, installing one of these super-efficient models 
can lower your annual utility bills by more than $100. This can easily pay back 
its higher initial cost many times over its life. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside a no-leak water heater, the inner tank is made of durable nontoxic 
polybutylene plastic. The outer tank is made of durable polyethylene. Most 
other water heaters use glass-lined steel tanks that eventually leak. 
</P>
<P>
 A small super-efficient stainless steel burner and heat exchanger system is 
located on the side of the plastic tank. A small pump circulates the water 
through the heat exchanger to the tank. An intermittent igniter eliminates the 
cost of burning a pilot light continuously. 
</P>
<P>
 Another efficient design, called Nautilus, uses a submerged burner design. The 
sealed burner is completely surrounded by water. This design transfers more of 
the heat to the water and less is lost up the flue. 
</P>
<P>
 Dip tube design, which brings in the cold inlet water to the burner heat 
exchanger, affects efficiency and tank life. One design creates a turbo action 
over the burner. Another design uses numerous small jet openings for more 
turbulence. Baffles in the exhaust flue also improve efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 You can compare efficiencies and operating costs of various models by the 
energy factors (EF). The EF for various models can range from a low of about 
0.52 to a high of 0.70 for the super-efficient no-leak plastic models. A water 
heater with an EF above 0.60 is considered very efficient. 
</P>
<P>
 The level and type of tank wall insulation is also a good indication of the 
efficiency and overall quality of a water heater. The best ones use two-inch 
thick rigid foam insulation for an insulating value of about R-16. Foam 
insulation also provides more support than fiberglass and resists denting. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are concerned about getting enough hot water for morning showers, the 
"first hour rating" (FHR) in gallons is more important than just the size of 
the tank. A smaller, more efficient tank, with a high output burner, can 
provide more hot water than some models with larger tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 Write for Utility Bills Update No. 797 showing a buyer's guide of 
super-efficient gas water heaters listing EF's, FHR's, prices, tank insulation 
levels, tank warranties and a hot water demand work sheet to determine the FHR 
you need. Please mail $2 and a self-addressed envelope to James Dulley, Los 
Angeles Times, 6906 Royalgreen Drive, Cincinnati, Ohio 45244. How to Seal Gap 
in Home's Door Frame 
</P>
<P>
 Q: My house has settled some over the years and there is a fairly wide and 
deep crack around one door frame. When I seal it, how far down in the gap 
should I push the foam backer rod? 
</P>
<P>
 A: You are correct in using a foam backer rod for a deep wide crack. You 
should not attempt to fill the entire crack with caulk. Push the backer rod in 
to a depth (measure where the edge of the rod touches the sides of the crack) 
equal to the width of the crack. 
</P>
<P>
 Use a silicone or polyurethane caulk. Polyurethane takes longer than silicone 
to cure, but it can be painted. Polyurethane also sticks to about anything. 
Should Stucco Be Covered With Siding? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I have siding on the top half of my house and stucco over concrete blocks 
on the first-floor walls. The stucco is deteriorated. Does it make sense to 
cover the stucco with siding too? 
</P>
<P>
 A: If you like the appearance of stucco on the lower half of your house, do 
not cover it with siding. There are durable plastic based stucco look-a-like 
coatings that you can apply yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 Stucco is an energy efficient wall finish. It seals all the tiny cracks and 
gaps where air, dust and noise can enter your home. If you want additional wall 
insulation, attach rigid foam insulation boards to the wall first.

GARDENER'S CHECKLIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of 
Nurserymen on what to do in the garden this week:  
</P>
<P>
 * It's time to apply the first spray to combat peach leaf curl. 
</P>
<P>
 * A potful of planted bulbs can be started now and given at Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 * Spring and summer flowering perennials to plant now are canterbury bells, 
candytuft, foxglove, columbine, cineraria and sweet william. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fall is the time to pay attention to thatch build-up in your lawn. Water 
does not penetrate well through thatch and insects love to use it as their 
home. Fall is also the best time to put in a new lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 * Check out the early blooming sasanqua camellias at your nursery today.

GREEN THUMB; HER GARDEN'S A PLACE FOR LIVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURA F. OCHOA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Laura Ochoa lives in Rosemead. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Our garden is more than a nice landscaped area. It is more than a tree planted 
here or there and more than beds of annuals and perennials neatly planted. 
</P>
<P>
 Our garden is an extension of ourselves, an extension of me. A place of solace 
and peace. 
</P>
<P>
 I spend much time in my garden hoping, dreaming and coming to grips with 
reality. And when life gets too big for me I head to my gardens to vent my 
frustrations on the weeds and quietly dig and pull my anger away. 
</P>
<P>
 As I work in my kitchen, which faces the patio, more times than I care to 
admit, I abandon my chores and go outside to water a pot or to touch a blossom 
or just sit and take in its calmness.  
</P>
<P>
 The patio is filled with a variety of potted plants. My favorites being 
begonias, azaleas, impatiens, vincas, whatever I fancy at the nursery. 
</P>
<P>
 A fountain with a broken top tier sits in the back of the patio but it has 
become the focal point. The soft soothing sound of falling water attracts the 
birds and they splash and drink from its water all day. 
</P>
<P>
 My husband and I share many happy moments together as we watch the funny 
antics of these feathered creatures. 
</P>
<P>
 A pair of spotted doves once made their home in our yard and they too were 
drawn to the fountain. They were always together until one died. I wrote a 
short story about them for my grandchildren. Of course, it helps to encourage 
the birds with bread crumbs and all this is an educational tool for the 
children and constant source of delight for me. 
</P>
<P>
 I sit at my kitchen desk and gaze out into the patio and it seems to give me 
not only rest for my body and spirit but also give me a bust of energy. Our 
patio has witnessed many happy events shared with family and friends. Bridal 
showers, baby showers, birthday parties, barbecues, all celebrated outdoors. 
Crepe paper and balloons with streamers floating in the air mingling with the 
laughter and love the guests. 
</P>
<P>
 The front yard is at its best in the spring. The sight is a quiet spectacle as 
the roses open their buds to their first bloom. The colors are dazzling, bright 
and true. I go from one flower to another smelling each one deeply. Soon the 
tall stem irises join in and they show off their beautiful splendor with their 
deep blue almost violet petals or "falls." Their fragrance competing with the 
scent of the roses. 
</P>
<P>
 The picture becomes complete when the bougainvillea also wakes up and joins 
the celebration of a new beginning. Because an odd-looking olive tree, always 
in need of correct pruning, stands next to the wall where the bougainvillea 
grows, not too much sun falls on the tropical vine so it does not flower as 
long as it should. I can't bear to remove the olive tree and it does shade the 
impatiens the grows beneath it in a planter. 
</P>
<P>
 We divided our front yard and created a somewhat private, courtyard. My 
husband paved the ground with common brick and did the same for the patio. It 
was a labor of love. 
</P>
<P>
 We often sit at our umbrella-covered table in our courtyard and eat breakfast 
or lunch there. The morning paper is always read there. An old lawn swing still 
stands there and we still sit and rock on it. 
</P>
<P>
 I often rocked and sang my grandchildren to sleep in the same old swing and 
sometimes I still hear their laughter in the air around me. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been so much living in our home and gardens that I believe when we 
are gone our spirits will come back to visit and wander the gardens, especially 
mine.

DECISION ABOUT PAYING LOAN IS A BUSINESS ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After having read "Her Mortgage Check Won't Be in the Mail" (Oct. 16) and the 
subsequent letters pointed at the piece (Oct. 30), I could not resist writing. 
</P>
<P>
 In this time of economic chaos for many in our community, tough decisions with 
property are simply business ones. 
</P>
<P>
 With Southern California property prices at the current depressed level, we 
are talking of actual cash losses of $50,000 to $100,000 for most of us buyers 
just for the down payment. If I am going to pay $2,500 a month for five more 
years just for my home value to maybe get close to what I paid for it three 
years ago, I think I can forgo the pleasure of making my lender and various 
others in the real estate community more wealthy in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, it is not my lender, nor my real estate agent, who is losing all 
this money. Let's face it, people: No matter how bad of a mistake we "normal" 
folks make, the lender and real estate "professionals" make a profit whether we 
win or lose with our property. That is a fact. 
</P>
<P>
 How often do you hear of a real estate person offering to accept a 0% 
commission because they sold you a house that declined in value 25% or more 
after they sold it to you one year ago? How about the lenders? Ever hear of 
them offering incentives to help out the values in the community? 
</P>
<P>
 Of course not. It is simply business, and for that reason, all of us in 
"upside down" loan situations should consider it in the same manner: simply 
business. There is neither a reason to feel guilty, nor one for others to lay 
moral blame.

NOTHING WRONG WITH LIVING IN TORRANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I live in Torrance, and I resent Computer Software King Peter Norton's remark 
(Hot Property, Oct. 16), "We're ordinary. We'd be living in Torrance with 
crabgrass if it weren't for a bit of luck." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, I wouldn't be living in Torrance if it weren't for a lot of luck, but 
that's another story. Before he uses its name in vain, Norton should learn 
about this city, with its Old Downtown, home of the best Mexican food this side 
of the border, its gracious old homes without crabgrass on eucalyptus-lined 
streets, its Civic Center with one of the finest libraries in the state, its 
Madrona Marsh Nature Preserve, home of some of the most elegant birds and ducks 
on our planet, with after-school science programs and Nature Walks, its Natural 
History Center in the planning/development stage. 
</P>
<P>
 And lots more -- all close to El Camino College and Del Amo Mall, with its 
international style, not crabgrass.

TIME TO MAKE DECEPTIVE LOAN DEALS ILLEGAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What outraged me about the article headlined "Undisclosed Fees Spark Truth in 
Lending Battle" (Oct. 9) was that this loan shark was aware that Marta Rodash 
could not possibly afford to make the payments, not to mention the four points, 
but went ahead with the loan anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 I am disgusted that the only recourse the lawyer had was to go after them for 
not disclosing minuscule fees in the truth-in-lending disclosure, when in my 
mind, this is a clear case of fraud.I would like to see our government change 
the legislation to make such loan deals illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 People like Marta Rodash are all too susceptible to such rip-offs, and 
although the truth in lending law was set up to protect us by forcing lenders 
to disclose all fees, what use is it if the Marta Rodashes of the world cannot 
figure out that they are being ripped off until it is too late. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not enough and we have to do more to protect these people.

FOR SAFETY, CHECK GAS APPLIANCES ANNUALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Oct. 16 "Handyman Q&A" question that dealt with the water tank vent and 
carbon monoxide hazard could use some further elaboration. 
</P>
<P>
 This month, most Southern California residents will be turning on their 
furnaces for the first time in more than six months.The gas company or a 
qualified heating technician should make a thorough inspection of each 
gas-burning furnace before start up as a measure to prevent carbon monoxide 
poisoning. Just weeks ago, former tennis star Vitas Gerulaitis was overcome by 
carbon monoxide and died in his sleep. The cause was a faulty propane heater 
installation. 
</P>
<P>
 Carbon monoxide displaces oxygen in the blood, causing lightheadedness, 
nausea, sleepiness, severe headaches and sometimes unconsciousness and death. 
Some symptoms occur within a few hours of exposure; other symptoms may come and 
go over months as a person inhales small but steady amounts of the gas. 
</P>
<P>
 To reduce exposure, every gas burning appliance should be checked at least 
annually. In addition, never use a barbecue grill indoors.

 There is a person who often dumps the contents of his car ashtray on the grass 
near (my) curb. 
</P>
<P>
 I used to put them into the gutter, but now I separate the tobacco from the 
filter and put the tobacco into a jar with an equal amount of water. Then I let 
it set in the sun for a few days. It's the best ant repellent I've ever used. I 
circled the stuff around my lemon tree and kept it free of ants.

WONDERS OF THE SILK ROAD; ADVENTURES IN THE 'FAR WET OF THE FAR EAST,' WHERE 
THE FABLED ROUTE THROUGH CHINESE TURKESTAN LEADS TO VAST RUINED CITIES AND 
ANCIENT ART WORKS.; DESTINATION: CHINA

 The music began as we stepped off our bus in the adobe village of Wupu in 
northwestern China. Barely perceptible at first, a seductive whine gathered 
force as it welled up in the throats of middle-aged men and reverberated from 
their long-necked stringed instruments and sheep-skin tambourines. 
</P>
<P>
 Next came the dancers -- a troupe of little girls, 6 or 8 years old, with 
winsome smiles, velvety brown eyes and shiny pigtails. Dressed in a blaze of 
mismatched patterns, bright leggings, clunky white tennis shoes and embroidered 
square caps, or dopas, they repeated a mystifying litany of arm movements as 
they danced from the front of Wupu's City Hall down a street lined three or 
four deep with villagers. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire population of Wupu seemed to have turned out to welcome us. Maybe 
there wasn't much else to do on Sunday in this remote bit of Chinese Turkestan. 
Maybe our international group of 50 art conservators, scientists and 
journalists looked as exotic to the citizens of Wupu as they appeared to us. Or 
maybe the Getty Conservation Institute (GCI), which had organized our tour last 
fall of ancient cultural sites along the fabled Silk Road, had pulled a few 
strings to provide us with a heartwarming spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
 All three possibilities turned out to be true, but we wasted little time 
speculating. Instead, we did what all red-blooded tourists would do: whipped 
out our cameras and began snapping pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Everywhere we looked, there were friendly, open faces and photogenic costumes. 
Old men with goatees wore long coats, heavy leather boots and embroidered dopas 
; younger men and boys had on wide-billed caps and woolen sweaters; women 
covered their heads with bright kerchiefs and their legs with thick brown 
cotton stockings, which, pulled over pantaloons, gave their legs a lumpy 
appearance; young girls turned up in Western-style warm-up suits in red, 
fuchsia and turquoise. 
</P>
<P>
 One by one, the dancers approached members of our party and bowed demurely, 
inviting us to join them. We lumbered into the center of the street, doing our 
best to emulate the graceful youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 We had arrived in Xinjiang (shin-JAHNG), a vast area of western China that 
became a Chinese province in 1884 and was declared the Xinjiang-Uygur 
Autonomous Region in 1955, making the area an independent state. And we had 
come face-to-face with the Uygurs (oo-ee-GOORS), Turkic-speaking Muslims who 
constitute the largest ethnic minority in a region bordered by Mongolia, 
Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India and 
Tibet. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the Far West of the Far East," a friend mused, as we attempted to 
figure where Chinese Turkestan fit into our concept of geography. 
</P>
<P>
 We had signed up for a professional, six-day tour of cultural monuments along 
a northern segment of the Silk Road, from Dunhuang to Urumqi (oo-room-CHEE). 
But for the first time in a day and a half of bus travel -- through some of the 
most Godforsaken territory I had ever seen -- the journey promised rewards 
outside the bounds of scholarship. We would feast our curiosity on contemporary 
life as well as ancient wonders. 
</P>
<P>
 The Silk Road is the seductive modern name given to a network of trade routes 
which, from the 3rd Century BC to the 14th Century AD, linked Xi'an (CHEE-AHN), 
the historic capital of China, with the Mediterranean. Many tours of the Silk 
Road begin at Xi'an. Our journey started at Dunhuang, where we had attended a 
conference on the conservation of the Mogao Grottoes, a spectacular complex of 
492 caves filled with Buddhist art. 
</P>
<P>
 Located on the southwestern edge of the Gobi Desert, 1,200 miles west of 
Beijing, Dunhuang isn't exactly a garden spot, but it seemed comparatively lush 
as we left it behind and forged northwest into Xinjiang. The landscape soon 
deteriorated into a gray crust, sliced by a recently paved, two-lane highway 
used almost exclusively by overloaded trucks.  
</P>
<P>
 Our first meal on the road -- box lunches of bread, water and a few 
unidentifiable items -- was served near a highway truck stop. Considering our 
options, we carried the boxes across the road, past a pig and a garbage heap to 
the top of a dry hillock, where we chowed down and considered the view. Staring 
down the bleak road and across the decidedly unpicturesque desert, we had 
reason to question our sanity for making the journey at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that we weren't warned. "This is not an easy trip," Sara Tucker, GCI's 
special projects coordinator, wrote in a memo to tour participants before 
departure. "We hope that short presentations by lecturers will liven up the 
journey on the long drives from Dunhuang to Hami and Hami to Turpan. The other 
difficulty is lack of facilities: There are no restrooms along the road, except 
behind sand dunes. Our only option is men to one side of the road, women to the 
other." 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker was right about the lack of amenities, but the trip was not difficult. 
Although I never encountered a completely functional modern toilet and I ate 
parts of animals that I hope never to encounter again -- chewy goat's head, 
crispy chickens' feet, slimy camel's paw -- my most vivid memories of Xinjiang 
don't concern faulty plumbing. The Silk Road I remember took me to ruins of 
ancient cities, an astonishing array of regional art, spectacular scenery and 
modern cities that appear more Turkish than Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
 But little of this had been apparent on our first night in Hami. Although we 
had dined sumptuously and had boned up on Xinjiang history -- with the help of 
our erudite guide, Jeffrey Riegel, chairman of the department of East Asian 
languages at UC Berkeley -- the city was dispiriting. Like the brand new Hami 
Hotel, where a glitzy lobby is a front for dirty, dysfunctional guest rooms, 
the city seemed to pride itself on shoddy new construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, we had been hit with a demand from the Hami police for $17 per 
person. Xinjiang was dangerous, we were informed, and the fee was necessary 
"insurance." As far as we could tell, the charge was the cost of a police 
escort service that we neither needed nor wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 (Hami "insurance" was only one of several attempts by the Chinese to exact a 
little more along the way. As many travelers discover, prepaid travel packages 
in China do not always preclude the possibility of additional charges.) 
</P>
<P>
 But now, only an hour's drive from Hami, we were in a tranquil old adobe 
village with a spirit of generosity.  
</P>
<P>
 Primitive as it is, Wupu is a model of architectural integrity, built to 
accommodate people who live in a climate that ranges from well below zero to 
more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit and gets less than an inch of rain each year. 
Throughout the region, water is channeled underground from mountains to lowland 
agricultural areas where fruits and vegetables are grown and later dried. In 
sharp contrast to high-rise apartment buildings that are sprouting up around 
cities, traditional homes are one-story, thick-walled structures with 
underground storage rooms for produce. 
</P>
<P>
 After the dancing, a Wupu town official escorted us to lunch in a four-room 
adobe house with a roof of poplar beams and reed, a walled courtyard in front 
and an arbor-covered patio in back. We washed our hands under an outdoor hose 
and passed through a hallway into a living/dining/sleeping room, where we took 
off our shoes and crawled up on a brick platform that fills most of the room, 
serving as both a heated sleeping area and a dining place. 
</P>
<P>
 An abundance of colorful fabrics lent the simple house -- the private home of 
a local family -- an air of opulence in keeping with the Silk Road. Runners of 
printed fabric, laid over richly patterned carpets, served as our tablecloth. 
Shelves set into the adobe walls were stuffed with bright quilts and pillows 
decorated with metallic stitchery. 
</P>
<P>
 Feeling a bit like voyeurs in the world of Marco Polo, who traveled this way 
to the court of Kublai Khan in the 13th Century, we sat cross-legged on the 
floor and indulged in a feast: great rounds of naan , grapes and dates, 
followed by generous pots of mutton and potato stew, rice mixed with 
vegetables, beer and tea. 
</P>
<P>
 After another round of entertainment by the same little dancers who had 
greeted us, we finally got down to the business of visiting a nearby burial 
ground. Excavations of Wupu's 3,000-year-old graves in 1978 and 1984 unearthed 
50 corpses, along with clothing, pottery and utensils. (Examples, including 
mummies, are displayed in a small museum that occupies three rooms on the 
second floor of the Hami Cultural Office.) 
</P>
<P>
 The children of Wupu bade us a noisy farewell as we boarded the bus back to 
Hami. On our approach to the city we stopped to see a complex of tombs built 
for kings who reigned over Hami from 1697 to 1930. Mixing Islamic and Chinese 
design, the royal tombs are adjacent to the 300-year-old Great Mosque of Adker, 
where crowds gather on Islamic holy days.  
</P>
<P>
 After another night at the Hami Hotel, we set off for Turpan, the most 
appealing of the three major cities we visited. Stretching out over a large, 
flat area that lies below sea-level, it's a peaceful town of about 100,000 
people where grape arbors cover sidewalks and hand-painted billboards lend 
splashes of color to major thoroughfares. Ancient men in great coats mingle 
with women in dark dresses and heavy brown stockings in Turpan's marketplaces, 
while children in Western-style warm-up suits seem to come from another planet. 
Despite such evidence of change, the people live simply. Walking around the 
city early one morning, I saw sleepy residents emerging from tiny mud-brick 
buildings that double as shops and living quarters. With little space inside, 
they brushed their teeth and ate their porridge outdoors, where they would 
later sell produce. 
</P>
<P>
 Serving as a base for bus tours to several major ancient monuments and home to 
a regional museum, Turpan offers a satisfying mix of history and modern 
culture. Two monuments that bring archeologists and art conservators to Turpan 
are remains of 2,000-year-old adobe cities on the outskirts of town. In a 
wetter climate, the buildings would have long since disintegrated. But here, 
where rain is a rare occurrence and dust a constant challenge, large sections 
of the structures are intact.  
</P>
<P>
 Jiaohe, the larger of the two ruined cities, was established during the Han 
dynasty (206 BC-AD 220) to protect the Silk Road. At its peak in the 9th 
Century, it was home to more than 6,000 people, but was abandoned during the 
13th Century as a result of war, a lack of water or both. Most of the remains 
date from the Tang dynasty (618-907). 
</P>
<P>
 About six miles west of Turpan, Jiaohe sits on a plateau formed by the 
juncture of two rivers. A mile-long stone path through the center of the city 
divided residential and commercial zones. Archeologists have found remains of 
Buddhist temples and courtyard dwellings, as well as artifacts that attest to 
the cultural richness of the deserted city. 
</P>
<P>
 Wandering through the ruins is an eerie experience that evokes thoughts of 
ancient civilizations and profound awareness of the power of nature. While the 
foundations and walls inspire awe for the people who imposed an orderly 
structure on such a harsh land, erosion has chiseled many of the ruins into 
craggy spires that resemble natural rock formations. As the sinking sun cast 
dramatic shadows across my path and I walked alone in the ruins, I had no 
difficulty imagining a caravan laden with silks and spices arriving at this 
historic citadel. 
</P>
<P>
 The other ancient ghost town, Gaochang, is about 30 miles southeast of Turpan. 
Also built as a Han dynasty garrison, the city was abandoned during the 16th 
Century. Although smaller and less well-preserved than Jiaohe, Gaochang was the 
capital of a region that included 21 other towns. Unlike Jiaohe, which was 
protected by steep river banks, Gaochang was fortified by walls. Nothing 
remains of the palace at Gaochang, but archeologists have found houses, temples 
and tombs, as well as Buddhist artworks, mosaic floors and manuscripts in seven 
languages. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Gaochang nor Jiaohe has an on-site museum, but artifacts from both 
cities can be seen in the Turpan Museum and the Xinjiang Museum in Urumqi. The 
same is true of Astana, a large burial ground near Gaochang, where we went by 
bus. Three of Astana's tombs are open to the public, but visitors have to go to 
the two museums to see a cache of Tang dynasty statuary, textiles and artifacts 
excavated there.  
</P>
<P>
 Also near Turpan, in a breathtaking setting, is a complex of Buddhist caves 
known as the Bezekelik Grottoes, which we visited by bus. Situated in a valley 
near red sandstone hills (known as the Flaming Mountains) Bezekelik has all the 
natural beauty a desert-weary traveler could desire. Majestic sand dunes rise 
behind the caves, a river runs through a lush oasis below them, and the air is 
refreshingly crisp. The man-made component of the site -- about 100 caves 
constructed of adobe bricks and cut into one side of a long, curving cliff -- 
is striking as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, if most of the Buddhist wall paintings that once filled these caves 
hadn't been removed by German archeologists and taken to Berlin -- where about 
half of them were destroyed by bombs during World War II -- and if the 
remaining frescoes hadn't been defaced by Muslim zealots, Bezekelik would 
surely be a Mecca for art-loving travelers and scholars. Unlike the Mogao 
Grottoes -- which remain a magnificent cache of Buddhist art despite damage 
caused by the elements, pollution, vandals and losses to foreign museums -- 
Bezekelik's artistic glory can only be divined from photographs and in 
fragments of frescoes at the caves and in Berlin's Museum of Indian Art. 
</P>
<P>
 Monks built the Bezekelik Grottoes between the 4th and the 14th centuries, 
while Buddhism was making its way from India to China along the same road that 
transported old Cathay's precious commodities to the West. Artists covered 
walls and ceilings of the caves with larger-than-life-size portraits of 
Buddhist monks, paintings of Buddha and an international assembly of devotees, 
and depictions of Indian gods. 
</P>
<P>
 The caves were forgotten and filled with sand in 1905 when German adventurers 
Albert von Le Coq and Theodor Bartus found them. Clamoring around the monastery 
complex, the men started an avalanche of sand that revealed the paintings. 
"Suddenly, as if by magic, I saw on the walls . . . splendid paintings in 
colors as fresh as if the artist had only just finished them," Le Coq wrote of 
his chance discovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Le Coq, Bartus and their colleague Albert Grunwedel cut 620 frescoes out of 
the caves and transported them to Berlin, where they were installed in an 
ethnological museum. Like other explorers who have ripped great works of art 
out of their original context, the Germans may have believed they were saving 
the frescoes, but the transported works that couldn't be moved to safety during 
the war were lost. Destruction of the Bezekelik paintings may have been 
inevitable, however. After European explorers were thrown out of China in the 
late 1920s, Muslims disfigured all the images of gods and human beings they 
could get their hands on. 
</P>
<P>
 Depressed by thoughts of these cultural atrocities, we returned to Turpan and 
cheered ourselves up with the spectacle of its street life. The most energetic 
members of our group rented bicycles and rode around the city, while the rest 
of us visited the Emin Minaret (a tapered brick tower built in 1778) and 
strolled along arbor-covered sidewalks, past colorful shops and hand-painted 
billboards promoting local produce and Communist virtues. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest slice of life on view in Turpan is the central market, which fills 
cavernous buildings and sprawls into surrounding outdoor areas. Sunday is said 
to be the big day, but we found no shortage of attractions on Monday and 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A staggering array of clothing, textiles, housewares, hardware and food -- is 
on display. Being a far more dedicated observer than acquisitor, I wandered 
into side corridors and outer reaches, where I saw everything from the 
preparation of noodles to open-air shops for shoe and watch repair. A section 
of health-related products displayed medicines, herbs and hypodermic needles. 
Nearby, a grubby shack offered dental services. How do I know? By the big, 
hand-painted pictures of teeth posted outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Dunhuang, where cheerfully aggressive street vendors had greeted us 
with a chorus of hellos every time we ventured into their territory, Xinjiang's 
merchants seemed to take little notice of foreigners until the latter showed an 
interest in making a purchase. The serious shoppers in our group bought 
carpets, silk scarves and jackets, cotton yardage, cashmere sweaters, donkey 
saddle bags and dopas during our trip.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Our final stop was Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang. This bustling, 
traffic-snarled urban center seems to be gripped by an urge to obliterate 
everything old and replace it with something new, big and ugly. Our temporary 
home, the Friendship Hotel, was not new, but it was big and ugly. 
Inconveniently located on the southern edge of town, the hotel had the look of 
a Communist retreat that had outlived its usefulness. In contrast, a towering 
new Holiday Inn in the center of town is an obvious symbol of capitalistic 
enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 The din and traffic jams of Chinese jeeps and Russian and Japanese vehicles 
that greeted us in Urumqi were a shock, but urbanity has its rewards. One of 
them is the Xinjiang Museum, which has a 30,000-piece collection of regional 
artworks, artifacts and costumes, as well as cultural relics dating back to the 
Stone Age. 
</P>
<P>
 We had already seen an impressive array of ceramic tomb figures and textiles 
from the Astana burial ground at the Turpan Museum. The larger showcase at 
Urumqi displays even more treasures from Astana -- small figurines depicting 
ethnic minorities, statues of male acrobats, paintings of women playing chess 
and serving food and brocade footwear. 
</P>
<P>
 The last day of our journey took us to Heavenly Lake, a mountain retreat where 
Khazak people live in yurts and offer tourists horseback rides and short boat 
trips. Colorful signs offered lodging in a yurt, local dishes and pictures 
"fine and cheap," but we contented ourselves with hikes and views of the alpine 
scenery. 
</P>
<P>
 As we flew out of Urumqi the following morning, the desert swallowed up all 
the sights, sounds, smells, tastes and textures of Xinjiang. Chinese Turkestan 
was already a dream. Back in Beijing, after a dinner of pasta and red wine in 
the squeaky-clean, Swiss-managed Movenpick Hotel, I felt as if I had never left 
home. But now, as I leaf through a small mountain of tour books, museum 
catalogues, notebooks and photographs, searching for ways to put an adventure 
into words, I remember Xinjiang. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a little girl inviting me to dance, women in kerchiefs and heavy brown 
stockings, goateed men in great coats. It's the haunting remains of Jiaohe, 
Gaochang and Bezekelik. It's the modern Asian crossroads that has replaced the 
historic Silk Road. GUIDEBOOK 
</P>
<P>
 On the Silk Road 
</P>
<P>
 Getting there: United, Cathay Pacific, Delta, China Air, Northwest and China 
Eastern fly from LAX to China. United has the most frequent service, with daily 
flights from Los Angeles to Beijing and Shanghai, both connecting through 
Tokyo, and nonstop flights to Hong Kong. Round-trip restricted fares to Beijing 
or Shanghai start at about $1,400; to Hong Kong, $1,200. 
</P>
<P>
 Tourists to China might also consider round-the-world tickets, offered by 
major carriers. United's round-the-world service covering China costs $2,548 
for economy class. 
</P>
<P>
 Air travel within China is restricted to Chinese carriers, which offer limited 
service. Tours of the Silk Road region generally use trains and buses to cover 
relatively short distances within Xinjiang. 
</P>
<P>

TRAVEL INSIDER: AIRLINES TAKING MEASURES TO SIZE UP YOUR LUGGAGE; AIR TRAVEL: 
USING "SIZING BOXES" AND OTHER GAUGES, THE INDUSTRY HAS BEGUN TO STRICTLY 
ENFORCE LIMITS ON CARRY-ON BAGS.

<P>
 Attention, air travelers who hog overhead luggage space: This could be the 
fall and winter of your discontent. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of this is predictable; the holiday season always brings an increase in 
carry-on baggage, since many passengers are reluctant to trust fragile gifts to 
the vagaries of airline and airport luggage handling systems. But this year, 
that seasonal crunch will be intensified by the airline industry's new shuttle 
mentality. 
</P>
<P>
 In its efforts to compete with Southwest Airlines and its no-frills service, 
the Shuttle by United service that opened last month in California has been 
streamlining boarding procedures and strictly limiting the size and amount of 
baggage that travelers can carry aboard. USAir did the same about a year ago. 
Continental Airlines, though its shuttle service is focused in the eastern 
United States, may tighten enforcement on non-shuttle service as well. 
</P>
<P>
 In most cases, the carry-on limits are the same as they have been for years; 
they've just never been strongly enforced. Now, as you arrive at the airport, 
the first sign of the new carry-on squeeze probably will be a metal-framed 
"sizing box," designed to accommodate allowable carry-on items only. The second 
sign could be a cursing infrequent flyer, who until now has been getting away 
with flagrant violations of airline limits. A third sign could be the satisfied 
smiles of travelers who have played by the rules for years, and suffered for 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who bring too much on the aircraft impose on everybody," said Chris 
Chiames, spokesman for the Air Transport Assn., a Washington-based group that 
represents the airline industry.. 
</P>
<P>
 Flight attendants are glad about the new trend, too. For years they've warned 
about safety threats posed by overloaded bins and told tales of passengers 
struck on the head, but been given little help by their employers in dealing 
with the consequences of lax carry-on enforcement. In a 1992 survey of 1,385 
flight attendants for various airlines by the Assn. of Flight Attendants, 60% 
reported that their airline's carry-on program worked poorly, and 83% called 
passengers with large bags a major problem. Now, much of the responsibility for 
enforcing limits has moved to customer service agents at the gates, who 
supervise the sizing boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 There's still cause for concern among rule-abiding passengers, though, because 
there is no industry standard on carry-on limits. Most airlines draw the line 
at two carry-on pieces, but on many commuter flights, the limit is one, and 
everyone's dimension limits seem to be just a little different. If you're 
facing a flight on an unfamiliar airline and you're hoping to carry baggage 
aboard, call to ask the maximum dimensions, and number of carry-on items 
allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 At Southwest Airlines, where sizing boxes have been standard gate equipment 
since 1971, spokeswoman Linda Burke Rutherford reported no changes in 
enforcement or customer behavior. She also noted that deep discount fares on 
Southwest's California flights have led to full loads, which means a shortage 
of carry-on room for the last passengers in the boarding line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, if you're among the last several people to board, we may be out of 
overhead bin space," Rutherford said. If the item can't be wedged under the 
seat in front of you, you may be asked to check it. Southwest's maximum 
carry-on dimensions: 16 inches in height, 10 inches width, 24 inches length. 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, the changes are most prominent at United Airlines, 
which began its Shuttle by United service in Los Angeles on Oct. 1. (Phoenix 
becomes the 10th city in the system on Dec. 1.) United has placed sizing boxes 
at all participating airports. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been some complaints, acknowledged airline spokesman Tony Molinaro, 
but United reported no substantial problems. If the first month's figures from 
Shuttle by United are an indication, it's unlikely that the airline will be 
backing away from these new procedures anytime soon. In its first 30 days, 
Shuttle by United reported that 71% of its seats were filled, about 5% more 
than on United's traditional service. The airline also reported that 96% of its 
shuttle arrivals were within 15 minutes of the scheduled time -- about 8% 
better than for other United flights. 
</P>
<P>
 United's maximum carry-on dimensions: 14 inches in height, 9 inches in width, 
22 inches in length. 
</P>
<P>
 At USAir, officials started using sizing boxes nationwide about a year ago, 
when the airline debuted its own quick-turnaround service. USAir's maximum 
carry-on dimensions: 45 inches in combined height, width and length. Unlike its 
competitors, USAir also specifies a carry-on weight limit: 45 pounds, for up to 
two pieces combined. 
</P>
<P>
 At Continental Airlines, said spokesman David Messing, "The main reason that 
we want people to be more aware is that we've found that stowage problems are 
contributors to departure delays." Sizing boxes and other signs of tight 
enforcement are more obvious at eastern airports served by Continental Lite 
shuttle flights, but Messing said the airline is hoping to take what it learns 
about efficiency from Continental Lite and use it in Los Angeles and other 
destinations. Continental's maximum carry-on dimensions: 45 inches in combined 
height, width and length.Illustration by J. D. CROWE

WEEKEND ESCAPE: SAN FELIPE; A CASUAL -- MAKE THAT FUNKY -- BAJA FISHING VILLAGE 
LURES A VISITOR TO ITS NEW RESORT, AND HOOKS HIM 
</P>

<P>
 Funky is not a word that translates well into Spanish, but that has never 
stopped this tiny Sea of Cortez fishing village from being the quintessence of 
good Mexican funk: a steamy, remote, no-frills playground that lures its 
visitors with bathtub-warm water and cheap seafood tacos. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been my personal Margaritaville since the mid-1980s, when I started 
making the 350-mile drive from Los Angeles, usually at the height of summer, 
when the insane heat of Baja's interior coast has an almost transcendental 
effect -- sort of like Death Valley-by-the-Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 As a rule, these have been low-budget affairs, the single largest expense -- 
apart from our bar tab -- being a $25 motel room split two or three ways. Once, 
on a July 4 weekend, we joined hundreds of other revelers camping out right on 
the beach, where the fusillade of firecrackers and bottle rockets didn't 
subside until dawn. 
</P>
<P>
 Having savored this town on the down and dirty, I was skeptical when I learned 
that San Felipe was trying to refashion itself into a more upscale tourist 
destination. A new luxury resort with triple-digit prices opened last year to 
great fanfare and, in conjunction, the first international flights began 
arriving at San Felipe's dinky air strip. 
</P>
<P>
 But I was also intrigued by the prospect: Could this sweltering seaside 
community draw enough free-spending visitors to sustain such a venture, or had 
some developer overestimated San Felipe's allure? More importantly, would it be 
worth dropping big bucks for my wife and I to fly to a deluxe suite for the 
weekend, or would we be happier wallowing in funkiness for a fraction of the 
cost? 
</P>
<P>
 These were tough questions, but Raynelda and I decided we were up to the task. 
Welcome Tours, one of many travel agencies specializing in Baja vacations, 
provided us with a $690 package that included round-trip air fare on Air L.A., 
two nights at the San Felipe Marina Resort & Spa, a taxi between the hotel and 
airport, free breakfast and a welcome cocktail. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the actual flying time from LAX to San Felipe is less than 1 1/2 
hours -- a vast improvement over the grueling 6 1/2-hour desert drive -- we 
soon discovered that arriving by plane was anything but a breeze. 
</P>
<P>
 As someone who can be mildly claustrophobic and a bit nervous about flying, I 
regretted not being heavily medicated before stepping onto our twin-prop, 
19-seater, which was so cramped that we had to crouch, almost doubled-over, to 
get down the aisle. Without the benefit of bathrooms, refreshments or flight 
attendants, we felt more like thrill-seekers than vacationers on our way to a 
resort. 
</P>
<P>
 The convenience of our flight was also dampened by a change of planes at the 
Tijuana airport, where we were forced to pass through customs and immigration, 
even though cars headed to Mexico are waved across the border with hardly a 
glance. Before re-boarding for a turbulent, seat-gripping flight to San Felipe, 
we had spent nearly an hour in airport limbo -- a sensation with which we 
unfortunately would become even better-acquainted on the trip home. 
</P>
<P>
 My anxiety did not begin to melt until our plane landed at 2 p.m. Friday in 
the hot wind of San Felipe. This is extraordinarily beautiful terrain, a 
melding of arid desert harshness, the starkness of the towering San Pedro 
Martir mountains and the tropical flavor of a palapa-dotted coastline. 
</P>
<P>
 Our taxi, which was briefly delayed by a herd of cattle meandering across the 
highway, took only a few minutes to arrive at the rust-colored Marina Resort, 
an angular, bunker-like development that is an odd combination of hotel, condo 
and time-share rental. Our beachfront room, a $143-a-night suite, was 
surprisingly stylish, decorated with fragile ceramic folk art, woven Indian 
rugs on white tile floors and a well-appointed kitchenette, including microwave 
and blender. (Prices, for two adults, range from a $100 basic room to a $165 
junior suite. For six to eight people, master suites are available for $275.) 
</P>
<P>
 We wasted little time ordering that welcome cocktail, which we downed in the 
hotel's fabulous blue-tiled horizon pool, where the water drips over a jutting 
edge that seems to disappear into the shimmering Sea of Cortez. We were still 
so wound up from our journey, though, that a quiet afternoon of poolside 
relaxation was totally out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopping a taxi for the three-mile trip into town, we eagerly embraced the San 
Felipe we knew best. We drank beer and cooled off over a few games of pool at 
the great old Club Bar Miramar. Out on the oceanside boardwalk, which is lined 
with a fantastic array of fresh seafood vendors, we feasted on fried-shrimp 
tacos -- sharing seven of them, plus two icy Tecates, for just $11. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the night was over, we had hit several more tequila joints, made plans 
to go fishing with a couple of seedy characters and danced to gangsta rap at 
Rockodile, a disco featuring a sand-filled volleyball court that overflows with 
Americans and rich Mexicali teen-agers on most Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, after a breakfast of huevos rancheros and chilaquiles at the 
Marina Resort's outdoor palapa restaurant, we took a cab back to town and 
hunted down our weathered fishing guide, Pancho, who had agreed to provide a 
24-foot motor boat, poles, tackle and bait in exchange for $50 and an ample 
supply of beer. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a couple of sport-fishing agencies in San Felipe that can hook you 
up with a licensed guide for about the same price, but Pancho proved an able 
seaman, helping us catch about a half-dozen corvinas while a sudden 
thunderstorm pelted us with warm raindrops.  
</P>
<P>
 After two hours, somewhat nauseated and tired, we asked Pancho to bring us 
back to shore, where we grabbed a taxi to the hotel and napped for the rest of 
the afternoon. We woke up feeling relaxed and ready, at last, to appreciate the 
comforts of our superb lodging. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By San Felipe standards, prices at the 60-room Marina Resort are through the 
roof, but I've also paid twice as much for a place in Laguna Beach that wasn't 
half as nice. Our room had a semi-private patio just a couple of yards from the 
nearly deserted beach. There was a glassed-in indoor pool, under a skylight, 
next to a lounge with wide-screen TV. The rustic, wood-beam dining hall was 
closed for remodeling, but our seafood dinner at sunset in the thatched-roof 
cafe outdoors was good. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't even want to think about going back into town again," Raynelda said. 
</P>
<P>
 We spent the rest of the night enjoying a warm breeze at the pool, floating on 
our backs as the inky sky filled with stars and bats darted overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday morning we woke early, jogged on the long white beach and collected 
shells. We agreed that we could get to like this new take on San Felipe, which 
reminded us more of a Caribbean resort than the San Felipe we'd known before. 
But our 1 p.m. flight brought us back to reality. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the first leg of our return was pleasantly uneventful. But when we 
landed in Tijuana, our newfound tranquillity quickly unraveled. After changing 
planes, we were approached by an Air L.A. official who told Raynelda and me 
that we had to give up our seats to make room for a group of connecting 
passengers. Our fellow voyagers, almost all of them California travel agents 
who had been guests of Air L.A. and the Marina Resort that weekend, were 
allowed to stay on board. We, however, were unceremoniously booted off the 
plane and told to wait 3 1/2 hours for the next flight. 
</P>
<P>
 The Air L.A. crew finally agreed to compensate us with two round-trip tickets 
from Los Angeles to San Felipe, good anytime over the next year. I later found 
out that it was a hollow gesture. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Sept. 19, Air L.A.'s service to San Felipe has been canceled, leaving, 
for the moment at least, the old options of driving or taking an indirect bus 
route. Budget for Two

DESTINATION: FRANCE; CARDINAL VIRTUES; A PROVENCE HOTEL'S CHARM AND CUISINE 
INSPIRE A STANDARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 This week we introduce a new feature profiling hotels with special appeal -- 
based on exceptional service, distinctive character and unforgettable charm. Or 
one unique feature -- historic significance, a great concierge, a remarkable 
location.  
</P>
<P>
 A dense canopy of sycamores shades one side of the old, three-story stone 
building. Ivy scrambles up the walls, and along the structure's side, 
rambunctious rose bushes, sprawling in every direction, illuminate the stone 
with glowing pink and red. Across a narrow lane, the dark green Rhone river 
courses past with a fluvial swoosh. 
</P>
<P>
 The building, which houses an establishment called the Hostellerie La 
Cardinale, is not a recognized historical landmark, but for the luxury-minded 
traveler, it might well be considered something of a shrine: It was here, 40 
years ago, that the world's most glamorous and exclusive association of 
top-quality hotels and restaurants, Relais & Chateaux, was born. 
</P>
<P>
 France today is crisscrossed by a network of excellent autoroutes or toll 
expressways. Clean and well-equipped with gas stations and roadside restaurants 
(and even hotels), these roads make it possible to travel long distances 
quickly and in at least relative comfort. Even a comparatively pokey American 
driver can average at least 60 m.p.h., with rest stops figured in. That means, 
for instance, that it would be possible to get all the way from Paris down to 
Nice, on the Cote d'Azur, in nine hours or so -- if you wanted to spend the 
whole day driving. 
</P>
<P>
 But before the expressways were built, the journey along the main road (or 
Route Nationale) would have taken any sane driver at least two days if not 
three, with overnight stops as necessary along the way. Though it was 
optimistically dubbed la route du bonheur ("route of happiness"), the section 
of the road along the southern Rhone, with Provence on one side and the Ardeche 
on the other, was a grueling thoroughfare. It was a three-lane road, with one 
lane in each direction and a sort of free-for-all passing lane (sometimes 
called "the suicide lane") in the middle. Poplar trees lined much of the route, 
leaving little room for driver error on the outside. 
</P>
<P>
 One good thing about the route was that there were a number of attractive, 
restful small hotels along its path, many of them ancient inns or stagecoach 
stops -- relays, or relais in French. One of these hotels, in the village of 
Baix (pronounced somewhere between "bakes" and "becks"), about 20 miles south 
of Valence (and roughly 350 miles south of Paris), was the Hostellerie La 
Cardinale. Originally a nobleman's manor, the house hosted the infamous 
Cardinal Richelieu in 1642 -- hence its name. (Actually, Richelieu was Le 
Cardinal; La Cardinale means a kind of red-blossomed flower that grows locally. 
The oblique reference to the notorious churchman, though, is intentional.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Early in this century, the place was converted to a five-room roadside inn, 
and in July, 1954, its owners, Marcel and Nelly Tilloy, had the idea of 
creating an association of fellow innkeepers from along the Route Nationale. 
They signed up seven other establishments and dubbed the organization, 
romantically enough, "Relais Compagne" -- country stagecoach stops. This was 
not a chain, in the sense of a collection of properties under common ownership, 
but rather a voluntary association of places that agreed to live up to common 
(high) standards, and to help promote fellow members. The group was an 
immediate success -- and in two years had grown to about 25 member hotels all 
over France. 
</P>
<P>
 So much for the Relais. The Chateaux part came along a bit later. In 1962, 
inspired by the success of Relais de Campagne, Raymond Thuillier (legendary 
owner/chef of the acclaimed Oustau de Baumaniere in Les Baux-de-Provence) and 
an associate, Rene Traversac, founded a rival group called Chateaux-Hotels. It, 
too, was a success, and for more than a decade the two organizations flourished 
side by side. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tilloys retained ownership of the Hostellerie La Cardinale until the 
mid-1970s, but in 1971, Marcel Tilloy relinquished directorship of the 
ever-growing Relais group to another hotelier, Joseph Olivereau. The following 
year, Olivereau and famed chef Pierre Troisgros founded a restaurant-only 
offshoot of Relais de Campagne, called Relais Gourmands. In 1975, Relais de 
Campagne, Relais Gourmands and the rival Chateaux-Hotels merged to form, yes, 
Relais & Chateaux. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, in its 40th anniversary year, the organization boasts some 410 members 
all over the world. The sole representative of the group in Los Angeles is a 
restaurant, L'Orangerie. The nearest hotels are the San Ysidro Ranch in Santa 
Barbara and Rancho Valencia in Rancho Santa Fe.  
</P>
<P>
 The organization likes to say that it includes only establishments of the 
highest quality on its roster, and that it judges quality by "five C's" (which 
work both in French and English) -- character, calm, charm, courtesy and 
cuisine. Judged on that basis, the birthplace of Relais & Chateaux, the 
Hostellerie La Cardinale, remains a paradigm. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When I arrived at the place one afternoon last May, I parked under one of 
those aforementioned sycamores, gazed for a moment at the Rhone, then climbed a 
flight of stone steps and walked into a warmly furnished reception area full of 
fresh cut flowers. When I learned that I wouldn't be staying in this main house 
but rather in an annex in another location, I was disappointed -- and, frankly, 
I feared I was being the victim of a kind of bait-and-switch operation (show 
the American the nice old house, then shunt him off to the apartment block down 
the street). 
</P>
<P>
 I couldn't have been more grievously mistaken. The annex, called La Residence, 
is a former private estate about two miles away, on the other side of Baix, 
which was purchased and converted into guest rooms by the Tilloys in the 1960s. 
La Residence consists of two large two-level houses made of rough-cut beige 
stone, with tile roofs and lacquered beige shutters. Beyond them, back toward 
the town, stretch acres of lush lawn surrounded by patches of intense green 
woods.  
</P>
<P>
 My room was the usual Relais & Chateaux mix of period charm (with Empire 
furnishings and walls covered in chartreuse fabric and framed in white tracery) 
and up-to-date facilities, including a minibar, a TV with cable channels in 
four languages (including English) and a large bathroom well stocked with 
fragrant Roger & Gallet toiletries. As for calm, it must be admitted that the 
hum of the nearby Route Nationale could be heard across the rolling 
grass-covered hillocks, and that the sounds of passing trains -- a railway line 
runs through one side of Baix -- occasionally rumbled through the atmosphere. 
On the other hand, at night, after a good dinner, with the shutters closed, all 
was silent, and I slept superbly.  
</P>
<P>
 And the dinner -- served in the main hotel building back on the Rhone, in a 
handsome multi-room dining area with red tile floors and whitewashed walls hung 
with antique farm implements -- was very good indeed (despite the attitude of a 
particularly supercilious and inefficient maitre' d). La Cardinale always has 
had a reputation for fine food. The chef is young Eric Sapet, a veteran of 
Jamin, Jacques Cagna and the Tour d'Argent in Paris, and he has been awarded a 
star from Michelin. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant, it must be said, is quite expensive: Virtually every appetizer 
and main course is priced between $28 and $32; add dessert, a bottle of good 
but not extravagant wine, and mineral water and coffee, and the bill for two 
can easily top $200. I spent half that on a meal of flavorful local trout, 
boned and butterflied and served with pureed peas, morel mushrooms and bacon, 
followed by delicious Provencal baby lamb with mashed fennel and potatoes, a 
selection of perfect regional goat cheeses and a bottle of mediocre St-Joseph 
Rouge.  
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, there is an excellent example here of that great French 
tradition, the prix-fixe (fixed price) menu. This offered the night I was there 
fresh sardines stuffed with Swiss chard, a saute of new potatoes with asparagus 
and baby carrots, farm-raised chicken stewed with morels and rhubarb sorbet 
with wild strawberries, for only $35 per person (not including wine). Relais & 
Chateaux quality never comes cheap, but it's so indulgently enjoyable that it 
seems almost like a bargain. GUIDEBOOK: Chez La Cardinale 
</P>
<P>
 Getting there: The Hostellerie La Cardinale is on the road designated as N-86, 
off the A-7 expressway, about 350 miles south of Paris and approximately 
halfway between Valence and Montelimar. Take the L'Oriol exit and follow signs 
toward Privas. Past the village of Le Pouzin, follow signs to Cruas-Le Teil. 
When you reach Baix, don't turn at the sign for La Residence, but continue into 
the village and watch for the sign for La Cardinale. 
</P>
<P>
 Staying there: Between its two facilities, La Cardinale has 10 rooms, priced 
from about $135 to $190 per night, and five suites, priced from about $230 to 
$330 per night. Breakfast is extra, at about $18 per person -- but it is quite 
extraordinary.(See main story for meal prices.) For reservations: Hostellerie 
La Cardinale, Quai du Rhone, 07210 Baix, France, tel. 011-33-75-85-80-40, fax

DESTINATION: SICILY; BLOOD AND WATERMELON; HER BLOODLINES WERE NORTHERN, BUT 
SHE'D ALWAYS WANTED TO VISIT THIS ISLAND WHERE PASSIONS REPUTEDLY ROIL JUST 
BELOW THE SURFACE

 The watermelon man was armed, and he looked as though he could be dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 "EH!" he shouted, stopping us dead in our tracks. There wasn't the hint of a 
smile on his face, there was a very large knife in his hand, and that knife was 
pointed menacingly our way. Our crime had been a small one, with no offense 
intended. My husband and I had spent the day wandering around Enna, a mountain 
town located high in the heart of Sicily. As in so many places on that island, 
human passions and long-held beliefs seemed to surge not far below even 
deceptive surfaces. We ate in a little restaurant said to have been one of 
Mussolini's favorites. Although it was the sleepy part of midday, the antipasto 
table was stacked as if they thought the Pope just might stroll in. We walked 
by modern apartment buildings festooned with garlic bulbs to guard against 
ancient terrors like the mal occhio (evil eye). 
</P>
<P>
 Then we saw a truck brimming with watermelons. No big deal, except its wares 
were advertised by a poster of a naked woman lying in a sea of watermelons. It 
made us laugh. Snap a picture, we thought. But then the watermelon man saw us. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eh!" he said gruffly, still holding out the knife and making it clear he 
didn't plan to let us just shuffle away. Why did we have to try to take the 
picture? What geeks. Why didn't my father, the son of Italian immigrants, let 
me learn Italian as a kid? Not that this Sicilian man was likely to understand 
my grandparents' far-northern dialect, nor they his. I mumbled what I thought 
might be the expression for "I'm sorry." My Irish husband looked at me as 
though I was nuts. 
</P>
<P>
 But then the watermelon man made a move. Satisfied that we weren't going 
anywhere, he turned the knife away from us and plunged it into one of his 
watermelons. With great flourish and care, he cut away and cut away. We shot 
each other "What is he doing?" looks. Finally, he plunged the knife into the 
wedge and then, holding the juicy fruit aloft like a prize and grinning 
broadly, gestured toward our camera. We were never in danger. The guy was just 
trying to help us make a better picture. Why photograph just a truck? We 
offered to pay for the watermelon, but he wouldn't hear of it, shaking his head 
at our lire and shoving watermelon wedges into our hands. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't think my grandmother would have appreciated my going to Sicily. Our 
family, after all, was from the north, the land that gave birth to the Italian 
kings, or so as a child I was told. Even if my grandparents came here as poor 
as any immigrants, we had nobility coursing through our past. 
</P>
<P>
 The southern Italians were something else again. And Sicily? Forget about it. 
It was a wild land of wild people, the poorest of the poor, the brunt of jokes 
and the captives of their own passions. To my nonna , now deceased, that meant 
chaos. 
</P>
<P>
 But years later, after visiting other parts of our family homeland, I remained 
curious about those Italians-in-the-extreme. Last summer, I finally caught an 
Alitalia flight bound for Sicily. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 My first impression of Sicily was, well, chaos. (OK, Grandma, OK.) At the 
Catania airport, there were no signs at the baggage claim but the uniformed 
airport guard assured us we were at the right carousel. We weren't. Then 
getting an espresso at the airport bar was like engaging in a contact sport; 
there was no line, just a mob moving amoeba-like toward the register. Picking 
up the rental car was easy enough. But then there was the drive into Catania. 
</P>
<P>
 Italians drive fast, and Sicilians drive faster, but it wasn't just a matter 
of speed. We weren't in the city proper long before we realized we were hitting 
no traffic lights, no stop signs, and if there were any rules of the road, no 
one seemed to be following them. Later, at night, walking around the city, 
there seemed to be hardly any people on the streets. Particles of something 
soot -- ash from Mt. Etna? -- stung our eyes, and beyond the open shutters of 
apartments, people lay on beds, surrendering to the heavy heat. We ate Italian 
food in a Chinese restaurant, about the only place we could find open at the 
hour. Was this what all of Sicily would be like? 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back on it, Sicily is one of the most varied places I've been to. 
Small wonder: Since ancient times, Sicily has been held by the Greeks, the 
Phoenicians, the Romans, the Saracens, the Normans, the Swabians, the French 
Angevins, the Spanish and, finally, the Italians, all leaving their mark. In 
three weeks we saw the peasant poor, the haughty rich, the graceful, the 
beautiful, the corrupt; sex and piety and lives seemingly lived out of another 
time. We got a broad sample the very next day. 
</P>
<P>
 On the drive north from Catania, we passed brilliantly flowering vines, old 
villas left to ruin, and Etna smoking in the distance. The road cut through 
mountains with towns perched precariously on top. We sped by Taormina, the 
seaside resort of the jet set, until we hit Milazzo, where we would catch a 
ferry for the nearby Aeolian Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aeolians, sometimes known as the Liparis after the largest island in the 
archipelago, were to be the R & R part of this trip, but they were a lot more 
interesting than that. On Lipari, the island we stayed on, we climbed up 
narrow, winding streets where families live one on top of the next and men hang 
signs for homemade Malvasia wine. Out of town, farmers eked out a living from 
the soil, growing tomatoes and grapes, with makeshift scarecrows to keep the 
birds away. On the far side of the island, pumice mines make the sea look like 
pastis. 
</P>
<P>
 We could have stayed on Lipari for days, but other islands beckoned. 
</P>
<P>
 Vulcano was another lesson. Vanity at times seems like an Italian national 
pastime, so I guess I shouldn't have been surprised to see people lining up on 
Vulcano to breathe in allegedly beneficial sulfur fumes seeping from a hole in 
the ground, or lolling about in a sea made bubbly by volcanic activity. And 
believe me, you haven't seen it all until you've seen a family of 12 -- 
grandmother, daughters, sons, grandchildren, cousins -- caked in mud said to 
have therapeutic qualities, yakking on the beach and passing around sandwiches 
of mozzarella and prosciutto. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Back on Sicily, we headed west on the northern coast, past the Monti Nebrodi 
mountains, along cliff-like roads. About midway between Milazzo and Palermo, we 
stayed in a small beachfront town called Castel di Tusa at the Hotel L'Atelier 
sul Mare. By day on the beach, pouty teenaged girls of leisure flirted with 
posturing boys who played U2 loudly on car stereos. By night, families walked 
to the piazza on the beach to the open-air cafe to listen to the sea, laugh, 
debate and eat gelato. Most mornings, we took the train into Palermo, thanks to 
the strike that didn't happen. A strike is always looming in Sicily. 
</P>
<P>
 Palermo would have given my grandmother pause. Chaos under the guise of 
control. It is grand, sinister, dark and gay. And perplexing. Well-heeled 
Palermitans read their newspapers in the lovely public gardens, but just a 
block or so away, you have to leap out of the path of a pack of speeding motor 
scooters. Palaces, churches and statues have survived for centuries, but damage 
done during World War II still remains. The Mafia wasn't exactly boasting its 
presence, but why do so many of the men have scars? And the banks were equipped 
with state-of-the-art security systems. But try getting an explanation as to 
why changing money on that given day or that given hour was absolutely non e' 
possibile . 
</P>
<P>
 The contrasts of life in Palermo come back in mental snapshots. An 
ancient-looking street with laundry billowing from the balconies and a man 
sitting on a step below, doing animated business on a cellular phone. A 
tractor-trailer truck with a porn poster on one window and a picture of the 
Virgin Mary on the other. The old priest stationed outside the chapel at 
Monreale and the young women in shorts he forbade to enter. I remember a street 
that sold almost nothing but wedding gowns the most opulent imaginable. 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere I once read that Agrigento was an unremarkable city, except for its 
famous Greek temples. I don't know what they were talking about. True, the 
temples are hauntingly beautiful, whether lit up at night or gridlocked by 
tourists by day. But one of the things I remember most is the passeggiata in 
the evenings along the sloping Via Atenea. People-watching elevated to a 
communal rite, the passeggiata starts every day around 6 p.m. in just about 
every Sicilian city and town. Families, couples, young women and young men, 
they all take to the streets to see and be seen in this nightly stroll. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hotel Kaos, a restored villa where we stayed, somewhat lived up to its 
name with wedding after wedding checking in to be photographed in its elaborate 
gardens. Sicilians take their weddings seriously. One day we saw a car 
approaching with so much white fabric in the back seat I thought it was the 
hotel laundry. It turned out to be a bride. 
</P>
<P>
 Gentle Agrigento gave way to Sicily's mountainous core. What strikes you when 
you get into the countryside is how incredibly empty it seems. Some 90 percent 
of Sicily's population is jam-packed into its cities and towns. But traveling 
through the island's heartland, you can be left speechless by the solitude of 
the panorama. 
</P>
<P>
 The road turns down in a small town. Outside a bar, a girl sings into a play 
microphone to an old man. He applauds with gusto. You can't help but smile. But 
in moments, you're back in the yellow hills again with nothing but olive trees 
and pines, white rock and the play of shadow and light. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, we were getting the hang of Sicily by then. We had gotten used to 
extremes that could change without warning. And that was a good thing, because 
we were to be staying in the town of Caltanissetta. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a mostly grittily modern town, its industry mining, and judging from the 
graffiti, its politics socialist. We got the feeling our hotel was not exactly 
loved by the townspeople. Big and modern, with a convention center feel to it, 
it was guarded by men with automatic weapons. But unexpected things happen in 
places not jaded by tourists. At the train station, a man who had gone there to 
see his family off insisted on giving us a ride to our hotel. Then one night, 
after a very good dinner in a restaurant called Cortese, we asked the owner if 
it would be possible to call a taxi. He said he'd do it for us. When we were 
told our ride was ready, it turned out to be two of the owner's friends who had 
agreed to give us a lift. No money, please, the very nice gentlemen insisted. 
They chatted to us all the way. Again, I wished I spoke Italian. 
</P>
<P>
 And Caltanissetta was a good base from which to visit nearby towns. One day, 
we went to Enna, home of the watermelon man. Another day, we went to Piazza 
Armerina. Most people go there for the Roman villa outside town, and we did, 
too. But the real treat for me was Piazza Armerina itself. 
</P>
<P>
 It turned out that our visit coincided with the Feast of the Assumption, 
which, in Piazza Armerina, we learned, is a big deal. 
</P>
<P>
 A brass band was tuning up on the steps of the Duomo, and a throng of people 
and cars was gathering in the square below as a Mass went on inside the church. 
Just when the square looked as if it could hold no more, the big doors of the 
church swung open, and the band broke out in a very loud, somewhat off-key 
rendition of what sounded like the theme from "The Brady Bunch." Then the 
bishop appeared from within the church. Stepping up to a microphone, the bishop 
began to speak. I couldn't tell what he was saying, but I knew his last words 
were a blessing. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd erupted: 
</P>
<P>
 "BRAVO!" 
</P>
<P>
 Honk! Honk! 
</P>
<P>
 Ah-OO-gaa, ah-OOO-gaaa! 
</P>
<P>
 "Yea!" 
</P>
<P>
 For fully five deafening minutes it went on until the crowd, happily 
shouted-out, began to leave the square for home. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly alone, we wandered through the streets. Inside houses, we could hear 
the intimate sounds of families and plates, and the rich smells of sauce, pasta 
and meat. It reminded me of Sunday afternoon suppers in my grandmother's 
kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 The day of our flight home, we got to the airport early, so I had time to shop 
for postcards. I went to change some lire back to dollars, and the clerk 
playfully tsked-tsked when, after reading my surname on my passport, learned I 
spoke no Italian. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sicilians speak Italian," he told me in English. "But only more beautifully." 
</P>
<P>
 Over at the airport cafe, the amoeba line was moving at its expected pace. As 
I neared the register, an uppity American woman tried to cut in. "It's what all 
these people do," she told the man she was with. 
</P>
<P>
 I looked the part, and I couldn't resist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scusi!" I objected, trying my best for Italian indignation. She kind of 
shrank away, muttering excuses. 
</P>
<P>
 I just gave her an annoyed, noncomprehending look, and ordered un espresso, 
per favore . 
</P>
<P>
 My grandma would have liked that. GUIDEBOOK: Sicilian Connections

TASTE OF TRAVEL: SONOMA; ALMOST LIKE A DAY IN PROVENCE; EATING, DRINKING, 
PEDALING IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. OR IS IT FRANCE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Mendocino.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The day begins with croissant and coffee. We sit on a bench in the village 
plaza surrounded by cafes and bakeries, and eat while the cool morning air 
warms to the sun. Our bikes lean against a tree. A baguette pokes out of my 
husband's backpack and I rearrange the fruit tart in my pack. We pedal to the 
Saturday morning market a block away and pick up a couple of apples and a few 
figs. Olive oil, mushrooms, baby lettuces fill the stalls. We linger over the 
produce, look at each other with wistful sighs and laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 The moment is strikingly similar to another day, another time, another place. 
We were in a village in Provence, where we lived for a short time. We were 10 
years younger, with small children, no money and no cares. Instead, we are less 
than two hours from our Mendocino home, astride our bikes in Healdsburg, a 
vineyard-fringed market town in Sonoma County. The resemblance to Provence 
begins in town and rushes past us, carrying with it nostalgia with every push 
of the pedal, as we head west to Dry Creek Valley and through our 20-mile day 
trip biking through the vineyards. 
</P>
<P>
 There are differences. Here the moist morning sea air travels up the Russian 
River, not the Rhone. Fitch Mountain is no less a landmark than Mt. Ventoux 
near Avignon, though a fraction of the size. Buildings here are redwood, not 
limestone. But we don't have to worry about the exchange rate. The signs are in 
English. We don't need passports. Nor did we spend thousands on airplane 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, the similarities are enough to make us smile. Valley and tiered 
hillside vineyards are woven with orchards, wildflowers, vegetable gardens and 
farm animals, as in the Luberon region. Oak and olive trees, poppies and wild 
herbs edge the narrow winding lanes, reminding us of routes between Bonnieux 
and Apt and Avignon, in Provence. The main thoroughfare -- Dry Creek Road -- is 
a wide two-laner with a deli and a market along the way. Just past the market a 
major fruit drying company smells like a famous candied fruit factory near Apt. 
Family-owned vineyards and wineries are easy cycling distances apart. From 
across the valley one of Gallo's wineries, with its red-roofed buildings, 
resembles the "cave cooperative," a large community winery that handles grapes 
from a number of appellations in the middle of the Provencal valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the light. Anyone who has been to Provence knows about the magic 
of that region's radiance, as it changes from the morning's misty gray to a 
clearer steeliness; from the high noon glow to a purple-pink dusk. All the 
shades are muted, prompting you to open your eyes wider or squint them into 
slits to coax definition from colors and shapes that run into each other. The 
tree leaves spin into the grassy hillsides the way Van Gogh saw them. Pastel 
produce fills roadside fruit stands like a Cezanne still-life. Although 
comparatively more vibrant, perhaps because we are so far from Provence, when 
viewed from the closeness of a bicycle the scenery has for us similar appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Our first stop out of Healdsburg is the Dry Creek Store, about 3 1/2 miles 
from the bakeries in town. Here we pack a picnic to eat at wineries along the 
way. Wheels of domestic Brie, chunks of Sonoma chevre and slices of Virginia 
ham are measured off and wrapped for our packs. 
</P>
<P>
 Stepping into the adjacent bar -- dark and old, but not as old as the one we 
frequented at the restaurant de routiers near Lacoste -- we split a beer served 
in a frosty glass as the noontime sun begins releasing its full force. 
</P>
<P>
 Mounting our bikes again, we ride a mile or so up the road to Timber Crest 
Farms, home of Sonoma's famous dried fruit. Today, the last of the season's 
tomatoes scent the air as they are sorted, sliced and readied for an initial 20 
hours in the propane-fueled dryers before being finished in the natural air. We 
go inside to sample the excellent dried fruit. A bag of trail mix, some dried 
pears and dried tomatoes are added to our packs. 
</P>
<P>
 We decide to bike the next five miles to Lake Sonoma Winery at the top of the 
valley. Although this road is relatively wide and has a bike lane along the 
way, we appreciate the moderate speed of American drivers in sharp contrast 
with harrowing rides we've shared with France's latent race-car drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Sonoma Winery can't be seen from the road, but you know it's close when 
you see the spillway from the dam at Lake Sonoma. 
</P>
<P>
 A road sign indicates the next sharp right is the winery. Strong legs propel 
us to the top . . . even if it means pushing the bike on foot for a bit. But 
the view from the porch of the tasting room is worth the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 The deli case displays French and American cheeses, salami from San Francisco 
and marinated vegetables, olives and condiments from Sonoma County producers. 
Rolls and baguettes are on hand, as well. We can't pass up the jars of basil 
garlic mayonnaise and orange Cabernet mustard made by a kitchen in nearby 
Sebastopol for the winery. We taste a Chardonnay and a house wine called 
"Spillway Red" and purchase a reserve Zinfandel to drink with our lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside on the porch, we lay out our baguette, cheeses, ham, apples, dried 
fruit and the fruit tart. A well-fed black lab named Rex pulls himself into a 
pathetic, half-hearted beg. His fat tail wags and fetching eyes try to catch 
our attention. We ignore him as long as possible, opting to look across the 
railing at the entire expanse of Dry Creek Valley. Fitch Mountain rises between 
the Russian River and Healdsburg to the south. 
</P>
<P>
 Between bites of bread, cheese and fruit we succumb stingily to Rex's subtle 
solicitation and are impressed by his enthusiastic appreciation. Feeling 
stuffed we wrap up the remains of our repast and re-cork the wine to stow in 
our packs. 
</P>
<P>
 Bidding the hostess at the bar adieu, we give the dog a farewell pat and mount 
our bikes for the breakneck ride down the hill. Grapevines are trellised and 
canopied but without fruit while the leaves begin to dry and curl in the early 
autumn. They border both sides of the road as we head south on Dry Creek Road a 
couple of miles to the winery Ferrari-Carano's Italian-style villa and gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 Olive trees, lavender and brilliant flowers that border the acres of gardens, 
ponds and waterfall could be on the Cote d'Azur, where this Italianate villa 
would be right at home. We park our bikes and walk to the visitor's center with 
its terraced entrance, marbleized interiors and vinous frescoes. Before tasting 
we head down the stairs to view the magnificent cave. A vaulted room, softly 
lit by chandeliers, is home to thousands of French oak barrels aging the 
winery's famed Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. We look out over the beautiful 
space and head up to taste the finished products. The price is $2.50 for 
tasting (applied to any purchases), but we put this off for another time since 
we are carrying one half-full bottle and we've only just begun our journey. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After another walk through the garden, we ride out through the stone and iron 
gates and turn right. About a mile later at the only stop sign on the road, we 
turn right on Yoakim Bridge Road. Along the way, intrigued by the various 
stages of grafting evident in the vines along the road, we pull over. A 
vineyard worker looks up and we ask him to explain grafting. We thank him and 
he goes back to his cultivating. 
</P>
<P>
 Just across the road we see the sign to Dry Creek Peach and Produce. Coming by 
here in the summer you can smell the ripe peaches and taste them at the 
roadside stand behind the white farmhouse. At other times of year, you must 
call ahead to find out if other garden produce is available. 
</P>
<P>
 We cross the simple highway-style bridge and stop to look down at Dry Creek, 
which has a year-round flow thanks to the Warm Springs Dam. As we turn right on 
West Dry Creek Road, my husband looks back at me with a grin and I signal a 
thumbs up. We don't need to speak but simply immerse ourselves in our 
independent reveries while cycling along. 
</P>
<P>
 Preston Vineyards is the destination. Here, Rhone-style varietals offer a 
taste of the grapes we came to love. Proprietor Lou Preston adds his own 
Provencal touch with loaves of crusty bread he makes nearly every day for the 
tasting room. When we tell the genial staff member at the bar about our 
fondness for southern France, he directs us to the boccie ball court outside by 
the picnic tables. 
</P>
<P>
 We know the game as boules and the image of men in black jackets and berets 
standing near the village square, cheering each other, flashes nostalgically in 
my mind. Even though we brought home a set of steel balls our neighbor gave us, 
we never play. Today, we take time for a brief competition to see who can roll 
the heavy ball closest to the market. As we often did in Provence, we argue 
about whose ball is closest, leaving the winner a point we will debate again 
and again as we share details of this trip with our friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the oxbow in the river, the road from Preston makes sweeping turns 
before we are back on West Dry Creek Road. A diversionary slip back into pure 
Americana is irresistible and we turn right to stop at the Meeker Vineyard, 
with its magnificent tepee tasting room and robust Cabernet and Zinfandel 
wines. A mobile bottling plant is in operation and a young man sticks his head 
out of the truck to say he'll be right with us. We mosey around and peek into 
the tepee, which isn't yet finished. The flagstone floor is in and its 
projected opening is spring, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, tasting is done inside a weathered redwood building with a 
makeshift bar and laboratory table. Mike, one of the winemakers, pours us 
supple, rich wines. We promise to return with a car so we can purchase a few 
bottles. 
</P>
<P>
 Turning south for the next few miles we ride past the familiar small vineyard 
blocks and a row of olive trees. The thick afternoon warmth is trapped within 
the sloping valley. It scents the air with the aroma of hot foliage, earth and 
the compost of dropping oak leaves. The road dips and turns sinuously in the 
dappled shade. An occasional car or vineyard truck passes by. I'm glad we 
aren't here during crush, when the mechanical movement of all these grapes 
could be a threatening intrusion on this bucolic stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 A large new redwood barn with a sailboat weather vane appears on a flat on the 
left. Just around the corner is Quivira Winery, a quintessential Sonoma-style 
winery, even with all the plantings of Grenache, a typical Rhone grape. In 
Provence, Grenache is often made into thin, dry roses, but here it is blended 
with Mourvedre, Syrah and Zinfandel to make Quivira's prized Dry Creek Cuvee. 
</P>
<P>
 We find out in the tasting room that the barn we passed is on the site of an 
old Pomo Native American encampment. It lies on the bank where Wine Creek joins 
Dry Creek, once a bastion of salmon fishing until the fish were totally 
depleted, about 20 years ago. Just like the Romans, whose knack for seeking out 
pleasurable pursuits brought them in full force to Provence, the Pomos found 
this pleasant valley while establishing a route between the excellent salmon 
fishing on Russian River and Dry Creek and the warm springs in the redwoods to 
the west. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaving, we ride out past the rose-bordered vineyards that add more color to 
the scenery on this last third of our trip. 
</P>
<P>
 A. Rafanelli, one of Sonoma's better-know wineries for Zinfandel, is open 
today (it isn't always) so we pedal up the driveway to the rustic redwood 
cellar behind the residence. Dave Rafanelli is busy with a couple of men who 
are negotiating to buy more than the winery's quota, a testament to the wine's 
popularity. His daughter smiles sweetly and offers us a taste of the 1992 
vintage. We are delighted to find this generous offer after admitting we are on 
bikes and won't be taking any wine with us. "You'll be back," she replies with 
confidence. We will. 
</P>
<P>
 From here we turn east at Lambert Bridge Road after stopping to photograph the 
signpost with flags pointing out wineries in all directions. Lambert Bridge has 
been made famous by the winery of the same name with its advertisement touting 
the "Bridge of Sonoma County." The trestled classic crosses Dry Creek at a wide 
point before the road makes a sharp S-turn past Robert Stemmler winery and on 
to Dry Creek Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
 The prolific flower garden in front of Dry Creek's simple French-styled stone 
winery is one of the valley's most romantic and popular picnic sites. We walk 
past people seated at redwood picnic tables and on the lawn. Thirty-foot fir 
trees provide a shady respite today. The style is truly French, but inspired by 
the Loire Valley rather than the Rhone. Owner David Stare's affection for that 
more northerly region inspired the architecture as well as his winemaking 
style, which includes a Sauvignon blanc called fume blanc and a dry fruity 
chenin blanc. With only 3 1/2 miles remaining in our ride, we feel we can 
handle the load and buy a bottle of fume blanc to stick in the pack as 
refreshment for later. 
</P>
<P>
 After we pull out of the winery, when we see Dry Creek General Store at the 
end of the road, we've come full circle. Here, we turn right and forge along 
and up the slight (but feeling steeper) incline in the full glare of the 
dropping sun. We take a bottle of mineral water out of my pack and wander out 
to the deck to sit a minute. We look out over the vineyards as the light casts 
a lavender-rose haze over the autumn colored vines. When we arrived in Provence 
it was also October. This late afternoon pause could have been from the terrace 
of our home there and we know we have been here before. GUIDEBOOK

LOS ANGELES CITY HALL JOURNAL: A SUMMARY OF SELECTED CITY HALL ACTIONS THIS 
WEEK AFFECTING CENTRAL LOS ANGELES.

<P>
 CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
<P>
 * REWARD OFFERED: Approved a $25,000 reward for information leading to the 
arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible for the slaying of 
Willie Lee Smith Jr., who was killed Sept. 12 when he was chased into the 
intersection of 54th Street and Wilton Place and shot. Two police officers 
witnessed the shooting, but the suspect fired at them and escaped. 
</P>
<P>
 * LATINO MEDAL OF HONOR WINNERS: Approved the use of $250 from the city's 
general fund to assist the Eugene A. Obregon Memorial Foundation in erecting a 
monument in Pershing Square honoring the 39 Latinos who have received the 
Congressional Medal of Honor. Obregon was a 19-year-old soldier from East Los 
Angeles who saved a fallen comrade during the Korean War, but was killed while 
holding off a platoon of enemy soldiers. The monument is scheduled for 
unveiling on Nov. 11, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 * JOB TRAINING PROGRAM: Authorized the general manager of the Community 
Redevelopment Department to issue a $266,000 contract to the United Auto 
Workers union and one of its related groups, the Labor Employment Training 
Corp., to provide training and job placement services to workers who have been 
affected by layoffs in the aerospace and electronics industries. The two 
groups, in conjunction with USC's Multimedia Technology Center, will offer a 
master's degree program in electrical engineering and computer science. City 
officials estimate 27 workers will enroll in the program. 
</P>
<P>
 * CONVENTION CENTER RENTAL RATES: Approved an ordinance that will maintain the 
current rate of 30 cents per square foot for exhibitors at the Los Angeles 
Convention Center in an effort to remain competitive with other convention 
facilities in Southern California. With the recent large and costly addition to 
the convention center, some city officials contended that a rental fee increase 
was needed, but convention center officials argued that such a move would 
result in a decrease in revenue. They warned that a convention center in San 
Diego, which charges 25 cents per square foot, and one in Anaheim, which 
charges 23 cents, would lure prospective conventions if the fee for the Los 
Angeles facility was hiked. Also, the cost of renting space in the center's 
north hall, at the corner of 11th and Figueroa streets, will decrease to 25 
cents from 30 cents in an effort to attract local business. 
</P>
<P>
 FIRE ENGINE SALE -- Approved the sale of a surplus city fire engine to the 
Croatian National Assn. for $1. The association will send the fire engine to 
the Croatian city of Dubrovnik, which lost many of its emergency vehicles 
during the war in the former Yugoslavia. MICHAEL KRIKORIAN

DEMOCRATIC WINS IN CENTRAL CITY EASE PARTY'S WOES; ELECTIONS: BUT THE 
INCUMBENTS' EASY VICTORIES, AIDED BY LOPSIDED VOTER REGISTRATION, OFFER LITTLE 
SOLACE AMID PROP. 187 PASSAGE AND HEAVY GOP GAINS ELSEWHERE IN THE STATE AND 
NATION.

 Democratic incumbents in central Los Angeles overwhelmed their largely unknown 
and underfunded opponents in the general election Tuesday, but for many, 
celebrations were tempered by the passage of Proposition 187 and significant 
Republican victories across the state and nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopsided voter registration favoring Democrats in the core city's 
congressional and state legislative districts meant that the actual competition 
for the seats occurred in the June primary. As usual, Tuesday's vote resulted 
in a series of Democratic landslides -- in the area's closest contest, Rep. 
Matthew Martinez (D-Monterey Park), won re-election by a comfortable 18 
percentage point. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the winners generally reacted more soberly than in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio Villaraigosa fought a bruising primary battle in June for the 45th 
Assembly District. On Tuesday he sailed past Republican Robert K. Jung and 
Libertarian Pam Probst in the general election. But Villaraigosa said he had 
barely campaigned since the primary, focusing instead on the governor's race 
and against Proposition 187, the initiative, soundly approved by voters, that 
cuts off most public services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The 45th District "is one of the most progressive districts in the city and 
maybe in the state, so it's tailor-made for me," said Villaraigosa, 41, a 
longtime community activist and teacher's union representative who took the 
Northeast Los Angeles district with nearly 66% of the vote. "But it's hard to 
frankly feel good with the climate we're in." 
</P>
<P>
 He referred to Gov. Pete Wilson's easy election to a second term over Democrat 
Kathleen Brown and Republican gains in the Legislature that have split the 
Assembly almost evenly between the parties and left the Democrats with narrow 
control of the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Louis Caldera (D-Los Angeles), who trounced Republican opponent 
Yongchul Yang and Peace and Freedom candidate William R. Williams to win his 
second four-year term, called the election results "extremely sobering." He 
predicted that the apparent lack of party majority could immobilize the 
assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Los Angeles), who defeated Republican David A. Ramirez 
and Libertarian R. William Weilberg, mustered an upbeat tone despite the 
Democrats' loss of a majority in Congress after four decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone says adversity brings out the best in people, and so I think this is 
a call to the Democratic Party to define itself and also a call to Latinos to 
work with some other communities out there," said Becerra, 36, who won his 
second two-year term. "(Proposition) 187 is not going to stop in California." 
</P>
<P>
 In other races, Rep. Walter R. Tucker III (D-Compton) retained his seat, 
winning nearly 78% of the vote despite his indictment in September on federal 
extortion and bribery charges. Tucker's only opponent was Libertarian Guy 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker has denied the charges against him.  
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles) stepped up to a Senate seat in the 
22nd District with 72% of the vote, soundly defeating three opponents. Polanco 
vacated his 45th Assembly District seat to run for state Senate and will 
represent much of the same area, stretching from Highland Park through Echo 
Park and Silver Lake to South-Central, including parts of the Eastside, 
Hollywood and Mid-City. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Murray's victory in the 47th Assembly District gives the state its first 
father-son legislative duo. Murray, who won with 70% of the vote, joins his 
father, Willard H. Murray Jr. (D-Paramount), who coasted to reelection in the 
52nd Assembly District, which includes Compton, Gardena, Lynwood and Watts. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Murray will represent an area in which he grew up. The district includes 
parts of Baldwin Hills, the Crenshaw district, Culver City, Palms and 
South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little disappointed that the rest of our (Democratic) ticket didn't do 
so well, but I'm looking forward to representing my neighborhood," Murray, an 
attorney in Windsor Hills, said after the polls closed Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Murray said his priorities will be to help small businesses grow in his 
district, reduce juvenile crime and eliminate teen-age pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no point in tackling crime when you've still got teen-age mothers 
cranking out more at-risk kids," he said.

GROUP WORKS TO SAVE CHURCH; HOLY ROSARY MISSION HAS HISTORIC, EMOTIONAL TIES IN 
TEMPLE-BEAUDRY AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Inside a little faded-yellow church surrounded by dirt lots in Temple-Beaudry, 
symmetrical lines on the brown tile floor mark where pews once stood. Spiders 
are now the only visitors to the confessional booths, leaving behind cobwebs in 
place of sins. 
</P>
<P>
 The last Sunday Mass was celebrated at Our Lady of the Holy Rosary Mission on 
Aug. 29, 1993, shortly after the Archdiocese of Los Angeles agreed to sell the 
property on the northwest corner of Colton Street and Beaudry Avenue to the Los 
Angeles Unified School District for the construction of a new middle school. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction is slated to begin in a year. But several former members of the 
congregation are still unwilling to let go of the church they considered the 
cornerstone of their once-vibrant neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The Committee to Save Our Lady of the Holy Rosary Mission, a fledgling group 
of 10 current and former area residents, has leased the one-acre property from 
the school district, using the vacated church building as a community center 
while trying to raise funds to move the structure to an unspecified site. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our first intention is to preserve our heritage," said Luisa Vela, a 
paralegal who raised her children in the neighborhood during the late 1960s and 
early 1970s. "We want to preserve the sense of family unity this church gave to 
the community." 
</P>
<P>
 The transformation of the former church into El Rosario Community Center has 
begun. Vela and the rest of the committee are planning to polish the floor and 
paint the walls, removing the grayish outlines that mark where stations of the 
cross hung undisturbed for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Through Luisa Padilla, who spent her teen-age years down the street from the 
church and now directs the nonprofit Concerned Citizens of Echo Park Youth 
Empowerment Council, they have brought to the community center free English and 
arts and crafts classes for neighborhood children. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee is in the process of looking for a van to take local youngsters 
on field trips to plays and museums. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee has also invited other community groups to use the space for 
meetings. Several fund-raisers are planned for next month -- including a 
hair-cutting party, rummage sales and a children's Christmas play -- to 
continue to expand activities and help buttress the donations and members' own 
money that pay the $800 monthly rent. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to build the place up," said Padilla, whose teen-age home was 
demolished long ago for a new development that was never built. "If it becomes 
well-known as a community center, hopefully we'll be able to attract more 
help." 
</P>
<P>
 Vela, the group's secretary, is looking into grants to pay the cost of moving 
and preserving the church building, which dates back to the 1920s. So far, the 
least expensive estimate she has heard for moving the structure is $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Losing the church to bulldozers, which are scheduled to begin rolling through 
in late 1995, would be too much to bear for a neighborhood that, over the 
years, has lost much of its sense of community to demolition in the name of 
development, little of which has actually taken place, Padilla said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All these streets that are now empty were filled with rows of houses," she 
said. "Everyone was like family around here. The people who lived here were 
longtime residents. And this church was the heart of the community." 
</P>
<P>
 The site on which Our Lady of the Holy Rosary sits is its third, Vela said. 
Originally constructed by Mexican Catholics who were unable to attend white 
churches, its first site was near the intersection of Grand Avenue and Temple 
Street, an area now taken up by the Hollywood Freeway. The church was relocated 
to a site across Beaudry in 1942 and moved to its present location in 1975 when 
Bank of America bought its previous site, Vela said. The current land was 
donated by a parishioner, and relocation costs were covered by the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the school district offered relocation money to the archdiocese when 
it first offered to buy the property for about $2.6 million, the archdiocese 
declined. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't make sense," said Neal Blaney, the archdiocese's director of real 
estate. "First, we didn't have any place to move it to, and it would have been 
an inefficient use of space and resources. The number of parishioners attending 
that church was very small." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who used to attend church services disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it was a religious holiday, it was so crowded you couldn't even enter," 
said Emma Palma, a former neighbor who lived near the church for 32 years 
before relocating to Echo Park after her home was demolished for development in 
the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Vela, who moved to Santa Monica around the same time, remembers coming to the 
church even after her family left. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lots of people who had relocated would come to Sunday Mass here," she said. 
"It was always crowded." 
</P>
<P>
 Although priests no longer visit Our Lady of the Holy Rosary, a handful of 
former congregation members still gather occasionally for informal prayer 
meetings. Older members of the community, who Padilla said still consider the 
building their church, sometimes drop by to meditate. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee's lease expires in August, 1995. District officials said they 
hope that by that time the group will have found a way to relocate the church 
before the onset of construction. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the committee will keep trying to come up with a new site and 
the funds it needs, one way or another. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still believe in miracles," Palma said wistfully. "We're hoping for one."

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: DOWNTOWN; STATELY SENATOR GETS A NEW FACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRETT MAHONEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It wasn't the stately terra-cotta tiles or its recently scrubbed red-brick 
face that attracted Glenn Taylor Jr. to the historic Senator Hotel. It was the 
cheap rent and clean rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 The newly renovated Senator Hotel is unique among the single-room occupancy 
hotels along Downtown's Skid Row. Its owners can boast that the 82-year-old 
building has a historic exterior, facing Spring Street between 7th and 8th 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 That, however, did not impress tenant Taylor, 55, one of 16 who moved in last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't notice. I did see the sign hanging out front that said phone and 
cable TV available in the rooms, though," Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of Skid Row Housing Trust, the nonprofit organization that 
owns the Senator Hotel, were not surprised by Taylor's indifference. In fact, 
it wasn't their choice to maintain the hotel's exterior. 
</P>
<P>
 Their mission is to provide "decent, affordable housing for decent people." 
</P>
<P>
 When Skid Row initiated its proposal to take over the four-story hotel in 
1991, it wasn't pleased to discover that the building's historical landmark 
designation by the Community Redevelopment Agency forestalled any plans to 
demolish it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just didn't see what they saw," said Lisa Grady, Skid Row Housing Trust's 
project manager. "We were seeing a very old and decrepit building that would 
have been easier just to demolish."  
</P>
<P>
 The Community Redevelopment Agency, however, was interested in maintaining the 
integrity of the Downtown historic core around Main Street, Spring Street and 
Broadway from 1st to 9th Streets, said Charles Sifuentes, an agency 
representative. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Senator's significant historical elements, including its flat 
terra-cotta key stones, green ceramic tile diamonds and cavetto cornice, and 
brick craftsmanship embodied in the Spring Street exterior, the redevelopment 
agency allowed the developers to demolish everything but that facade. 
</P>
<P>
 To save it, the demolition crew had to attach a steel frame to the outer wall 
and bolt it to the ground while the rest of the building was destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Grady admitted that after its thorough cleaning, the Senator's face, formerly 
marred with broken windows and soot, is now "gorgeous." She lamented, however, 
that maintaining the historical facade added an estimated $150,000 to the 
project, whose total cost was estimated to be $8.7 million paid with public and 
private financing. 
</P>
<P>
 The structure, built by a prominent pioneer family in 1912, had decayed over 
the past few decades. It had become a haven for drug dealing and prostitution, 
said Sergio Vasquez of the Community Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Skid Row Housing Trust's management, the Senator now offers a clean, 
safe home for those with annual incomes below $13,500, according to the 
Senator's new manager, Kenneth Moore Sr. 
</P>
<P>
 The rooms rent for $255 per month for individuals with annual incomes of under 
$13,500 and for $190 per month for those receiving general assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 There is yet another change at the Senator -- things have literally turned 
around. As a result of the construction, the Spring Street facade is now the 
rear of the building, with tenants entering through a new doorway on the 
opposite end on Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
 As one of those tenants, Taylor appreciates the newness of the building. It 
mirrors his own fresh start. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor said he isn't drinking anymore and is trying to take better care of 
himself since he was diagnosed with a heart condition a few years ago. The 
former gardener and truck driver now supports himself with a disability check. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles native never thought he would be living Downtown. But as he 
settles into his dorm-like room -- he hasn't yet put up any pictures of his six 
children, three of whom are no longer living -- he has found it to be 
surprisingly peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
 He has all that he needs, he said: a pine desk, so he can study his King James 
Bible, a dresser, a wardrobe, a twin bed, a small refrigerator and a sink. 
Taylor will share a bathroom, right next door, with about six other residents 
when the Senator reaches its 96-person capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, though, when he goes to prepare his stew and hot-water corn bread 
in the communal kitchen, he is usually the only one there. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked what he likes about the Senator, Taylor said he loves the quiet and 
that the water runs "really" hot. BRETT MAHONEY

 Seeing the reconstructed guard tower standing in Little Tokyo gives Sue 
Kunitomi Embrey the same chill it gave her in 1943, when she entered the 
Manzanar internment camp in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 For Embrey, who was 19 years old then, it meant that "something not very good 
was about to happen." Her freedom was being taken away. 
</P>
<P>
 The guard tower and the barracks, across the street from the Japanese American 
National Museum, are a featured part of this weekend's "Family Expo: Sharing 
the Japanese American Legacy," whose primary location is the Los Angeles 
Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 90 groups from all over California have been invited to present 
their piece of the Japanese American Legacy. This is the first time the museum 
has sponsored an event of this size, and organizers hope that more than 10,000 
people will have visited by 5 tonight when the event ends. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the largest gathering of Japanese American history and culture under 
one roof," said Chris Komai of the Japanese American Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 The attractions at the expo were intended to represent the spectrum of the 
Japanese American experience: musicians playing traditional instruments like 
the koto, the group Hiroshima jamming their own jazz fusion, demonstrations of 
origami and calligraphy, and a fashion show featuring the creations of designer 
Anne Namba of Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
 Embrey, 71, an Echo Park retiree who helped organize the Expo, hoped the event 
would help educate those less familiar with the Japanese American experience. 
She wants them to understand that what she endured for 17 months, 24 days in a 
World War II internment camp is part of America's collective experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had nothing to do with Pearl Harbor. We were Americans, but the government 
made us leave our homes anyway. I hope this weekend helps people understand 
that character is what is important, not ethnicity." BRETT MAHONEY

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: CHINATOWN; PLAN FOR SIX-STORY MALL GAINS GROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Plans for a six-story shopping mall, its roof embellished with a ship mast and 
wire-cloth sail to reflect the early Chinese immigrant experience, are sailing 
forward despite neighbors' concerns about traffic congestion and pedestrian 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Community Redevelopment Agency officials expect to review the developer's 
final plans by early next year. The Broadway Pavilion project, proposed at 
North Broadway and Alpine Street where a private parking lot now operates, is 
one of the biggest projects in Chinatown since 1990, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 78,140-square-foot building would include a basement and three bottom 
floors of retail and restaurant space. A Chinatown art and history exhibit 
would display local artwork in the center's lobby. And 168 parking spaces would 
occupy the top three levels.  
</P>
<P>
 The city Department of Transportation has permitted the developer, Fidelity 
Investment Partnership, to widen Alpine Street and North Broadway to improve 
access to the complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents and businesses have complained that the project will bring more 
traffic into the already congested area, turning Chinatown into a less 
pedestrian-friendly business district. 
</P>
<P>
 Some locals also point out that many Chinatown residents are senior citizens 
who walk the sidewalks daily. Widening streets in front of the complex, they 
say, might make it dangerous for pedestrians and hurt businesses that rely on 
foot traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't walk as fast as I used to," said Paul Louie, a retired 76-year-old 
community activist. "I want to see growth and development in Chinatown, but not 
at the expense and safety of its residents." 
</P>
<P>
 CRA officials say they will try to preserve the width of the sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the shopping complex say it will revitalize the stagnant 
Chinatown economy. Developers expect to generate 193 jobs.  
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that for Chinatown to economically survive, we need that building," 
said Irvin Lai, a Chinatown general contractor for 35 years.  
</P>
<P>
 "I want that place (the pavilion) to have traffic jams every day because that 
would mean people and businesses are there."

dropout prevention program based at Markham Middle School in Watts. Of 60 
Watts-area students in kindergarten through high school who participated in the 
photo competition organized by Giorgio Beverly Hills, 13 were winners. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can hardly take pictures, so I thought I wasn't going to win," said Tenille 
Hyde, 12, a Markham student who made two winning pictures capturing 9-year-old 
Matthew Johnson in a midair flip. Johnson was also one of the winners of the 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Over three days in September, the youths received pointers from professional 
photographers and then let loose with disposable Kodak cameras. One day they 
were escorted through Nickerson Gardens and Will Rogers Park in Watts to search 
for the "perfect" neighborhood photo of children at play. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw kids playing on mattresses and started to take pictures of them," Hyde 
said. "They got very camera-happy and wanted us to take pictures of them 
jumping." 
</P>
<P>
 The next day they were taken to Venice Beach and the Santa Monica Pier to 
capture urban images in a "city shoot." 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 15 a panel of judges made up of professional photographers and gallery 
owners chose the winners. After the exhibit ends at the Directors Guild, 7920 
Sunset Blvd., the works will be displayed in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 "The camera is an extension of one's eye and mind," said Jan Kesner, owner and 
director of a gallery near Hollywood. "In these pictures you recognize the 
children's sense of wonder and discovery in using a camera for the first time." 
 
</P>
<P>
 Kesner said judges were looking for decisive moments that captured universal 
themes where play was occurring, whether there was action in the photo or not. 
</P>
<P>
 Hyde's mattress acrobat and Johnson's snapshot of two girls on park swings are 
a sampling of what the other winners' work is like. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonisha Mellon, 11, caught her neighbor Rachel with a Mona Lisa smile as she 
was about to blow out three candles on her birthday cake. That same day in 
Watts, Erica Perez, 20, immortalized her 2-year-old daughter Kimberly picking 
bright red roses from a garden.  
</P>
<P>
 Cities in Schools is a national dropout prevention program. It works 
one-on-one with young people, preschool through high school, and their families 
to keep children in school and to develop their confidence for success. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Simpson, managing director in Watts of Los Angeles Cities in Schools, 
said the photo competition typifies what her program strives for. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the littlest -- like Matthew -- to the oldest, they feel good about 
themselves," she said. "That's what these opportunities are all about. A lot of 
it is building self-esteem while at the same time seeing their own home through 
other eyes -- the camera." ENRIQUE LAVIN

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: CRENSHAW; GALLERY CAPTURES SPIRIT OF BLACK LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is an unlikely spot for a fine art gallery, the far end of a sprawling 
horseshoe-shaped shopping center that is populated mostly by beauty salons, 
cleaners and small markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the Black Gallery, founded to showcase rarely seen talent, is used to 
being something of an oddity. 
</P>
<P>
 Now in its 10th year at the Santa Barbara Plaza, the gallery prides itself on 
providing a haven for photographers who strive to capture aspects of black life 
largely absent from the gritty pages of daily newspapers.  
</P>
<P>
 "L.A. is very rich visually, but most images that are supposed to represent it 
are not done by people in the community," said gallery co-founder and director 
Roland Charles. "We've got to go beyond that, bring out the best in people." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the Black Gallery's neat storefront is a spare, airy interior 
frequently filled with the mellow, piped-in strains of jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 The stark white walls are lined with works by Cameroonian photographer Angele 
Etoundi Essamba. Her dramatic and sensual images of African women, wrought in 
black and white, are selected originals from her book "Passion." 
</P>
<P>
 It is aesthetics such as these, says Charles, that are too rarely displayed in 
mainstream galleries but find a home at Black Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people have a limited idea of what art is, who don't even accept 
photography as an art form, particularly among African Americans," said the 
soft-spoken Charles, a Louisiana native and photojournalist. 
</P>
<P>
 "With black photography, we're used to seeing social statements, reflecting on 
crisis situations. But the comments photographers are making now are a lot more 
subtle, a long ways from the civil rights era." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles co-founded the Black Gallery with three other photographers who, in 
the wake of a successful group show at the California Afro American Museum, 
decided that the city needed a permanent spot for black fine-art photography. 
The gallery relies largely on the nonprofit Black Photographers of California 
and corporate sponsorships for funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, the gallery has offered a wealth of photo technique and 
development workshops, photo contests, round-table discussions and programs for 
youth. It also houses photographic archives, a slide registry of portfolios and 
a resource bank of photographers and photographic services. 
</P>
<P>
 The Black Gallery also has opened and curated several exhibits that have 
toured the world, including the comprehensive "Life in the Day of Black L.A.," 
a 10-photographer exhibit that premiered at the California Afro American Museum 
and traveled to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were amazed," said Charles of reactions to the show in countries such 
as Germany and England. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only images they had of blacks in Los Angeles came over the news -- boys 
with their hands up against a wall, wearing rollers in their hair, 
gangbangers." 
</P>
<P>
 Which isn't to say that the gallery doesn't have its share of works depicting 
social strife. 
</P>
<P>
 Scenes from civil uprisings nearly 30 years apart -- 1965 and 1992 -- adorn 
the walls of the back room, images of National Guardsmen and smoldering 
buildings looming eerily similar. 
</P>
<P>
 But far more dominant are fine-art images by artists such as Essamba and local 
jazz photographer Bob Douglas, ethereal moments like the one Charles himself 
captures in an uncharacteristically still moment at First A.M.E. Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Charles said he believes that reflecting black life accurately also 
entails showing interaction with other people. To that end, he has gathered 14 
black and Korean photographers, painters and sculptors for "Collaborations," a 
series of jointly created works scheduled to open next year at Black Gallery as 
well as the Sabina Lee gallery in Koreatown. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea for this show is really working together," said Charles, leaning 
forward excitedly. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's so much energy, so much harmony. It's going to be great." 
</P>
<P>
 And how did he turn up so many artists willing to commit to the project over 
several months? 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh," he said, smiling, "that was easy." ERIN J. AUBRY

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: LEIMERT PARK; BUSINESS VENTURE IS A MOVING 
EXPERIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ron Carter and his associates didn't have to move mountains to get their 
project under way, but they came pretty close: They had to move a building. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were really determined to get things done, and we had to move the building 
we owned from Downtown to 8th Avenue and Vernon," explained Carter, chapter 
president of Phi Beta Sigma fraternity, one of the partners in a venture that 
recently opened a business center in Leimert Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knocked down some transformers in the process, got the city to change some 
laws for us. . . . But we just had to get it over here." 
</P>
<P>
 That tenacity led to the relatively quick completion of the center, a 
two-story structure at 3001 W. Vernon Ave. Funded by two African American 
nonprofit organizations -- the fraternity and the Crenshaw-based Black 
Employees Assn. -- the center is one of the few post-riot projects completed 
without any government aid. 
</P>
<P>
 The center will provide new quarters for the BEA and its fledgling 
South-Central People's Federal Credit Union, as well as office space for 
several small new businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 For BEA president Clyde Johnson, who has been hard-pressed to find space for 
the credit union that would satisfy strict federal security regulations, the 
joint project materialized none too soon. Phi Beta Sigma members say the 
building represents a significant step for their organization, long known for 
community and social service. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a real group effort, an economic collaborative that's entirely 
community-based," said commercial developer Anthony Samad, who like several 
others involved in the project is a member of the fraternity's Los Angeles 
alumni chapter. Phi Beta Kappa has a national membership of 90,000 black men. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-story, 6,300-square-foot building is not only home to the BEA and the 
credit union, but a post office box business called Leimert Park Mailboxes, as 
well as the Small Business Incubator. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterned after similar East Coast operations, the incubator provides office 
suites, receptionists, phones, fax machines, copiers and meeting rooms for 
start-up small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Incubator clients stay until they generate enough capital outlay to move into 
their own quarters elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses at the new center include a plumbing service, construction company, 
a nonprofit economic development corporation and a black personnel 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Samad said that, since opening, the incubator has developed a waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the only one of its kind in the area," he said. "We figured, if this 
works in other cities, why not South-Central?" 
</P>
<P>
 The joint venture took shape soon after the fraternity bought a vacant 
Downtown post office from the federal government for $1 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson landed the Vernon Avenue site, which Phi Beta Sigma helped secure with 
a $125,000 loan obtained from the mortgage of their fraternity house on 
Crenshaw Boulevard.  
</P>
<P>
 With additional loans from Westside-based Royal Thrift and Loan and $20,000 in 
individual donations from fraternity members, the partners were able to 
literally get things off the ground. Some transformers were the only casualties 
during the awkward move of the 34-foot-tall building across town in August.  
</P>
<P>
 Of all the improvements to the building, the biggest was transforming the 
former site of a liquor store burned out during the riots into something truly 
benefiting the community, said Phi Beta Sigma region director Daryl Sweeney. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not just bringing a building here, we're bringing jobs," he said. "It's 
something people can be proud of. They can walk by and not be afraid it'll 
attract crime." ERIN J. AUBRY

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: EAST LOS ANGELES; 75 FAMILIES SOUGHT FOR LEADERSHIP STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A search has begun for 75 families to take part in "Building Up Los Angeles," 
a yearlong program to develop leadership skills and improve community 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, part of the federal AmeriCorps national service program, will 
focus on families with children attending Roosevelt High School, Hollenbeck 
Middle School and Sheridan Elementary School -- one of seven areas in the city 
targeted for the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're focusing on the whole family as a group," said Eastside coordinator 
Ruben Duenas. "The idea is to focus on those families. By building those 
skills, hopefully they will spread out to other families." 
</P>
<P>
 The families will attend workshops and meetings that will involve 60 agencies 
citywide, including colleges, universities and social service organizations. 
The sessions, to be led by 30 AmeriCorps workers, will focus on public safety, 
the environment, education, health and housing. 
</P>
<P>
 At the "Building Up Los Angeles" kickoff Oct. 22, 500 people gathered to plant 
30 trees at Sheridan and Hollenbeck. Community organizations distributed 
information and conducted health screenings. 
</P>
<P>
 Duenas said he hopes to have all the workers and families -- who will be 
recommended by the schools -- selected by the end of December. 
</P>
<P>
 The workers will each receive $4,725 in college tuition from AmeriCorps in 
exchange for their services. 
</P>
<P>
 In the schools, the students chosen for the program will meet regularly, like 
a club. They will work on coming up with ways to address problems they see on 
their campuses and in their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 The families will discuss how to access government and social service agencies 
to improve their neighborhoods. They will also seek ways to hold their schools, 
public officials and community agencies accountable for what they often promise 
to do, Duenas said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the bigger challenges, he said, will be to teach parents and children 
how to work together. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to have the parents understand where the kids are coming from and 
have the kids understand where the parents are coming from," Duenas said. "The 
goal is to get things done in the community and having these people who are 
community residents come up with ways of addressing the problems." MARY ANNE

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: LINCOLN HEIGHTS; PLAZA THEATER STAFF, BOARD IN MEDIATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MARY ANNE PEREZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal mediator has been asked to help employees of the nonprofit Plaza de 
la Raza performing arts center and its board of directors reach a contract 
agreement after several months of failed negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 The employees, who voted to join the California Professional Employees Union 
last December, have been working without a contract since then and fear for 
their job security, said union representative Chris Graeber. The six employees, 
all non-teaching support staff, decided to join the union because they worried 
that their benefits and wages would be cut as the organization tightened its 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "Plaza wants to reduce staff and their hours, and we have major concerns about 
that," Graeber said. "Management isn't doing much to solve the problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Lydia Lopez, board president and interim director, did not return phone calls 
last week. She replaced former director Gema Sandoval, who left in July to 
concentrate on her dance troupe. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Medine, who works for the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, 
an independent agency of the federal government, met with both sides Thursday. 
He declined to comment on the negotiations, saying he wants to remain neutral.  
</P>
<P>
 The union, which represents more than 700 members of nonprofit organizations, 
has requested a three-year contract for support employees -- not including 
teachers -- increases in wages and benefits, and an updated personnel policy.  
</P>
<P>
 Graeber said the union requested a mediator two months ago when the board 
proposed reducing staff and hours before a contract was drawn up. Medine had 
held a meeting before Thursday's but no agreement was reached. 
</P>
<P>
 Plaza de la Raza's School of Performing and Visual Arts, an after-school 
program established in 1978, has an enrollment of 300 to 600 music, art, dance 
and drama students. The Plaza, located at Lincoln Park, also holds public 
performances at its outdoor stage and in the Margo Albert Theater. MARY ANNE

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: REGION; UPHEAVAL AT TOP OF CONFERENCE AGENDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Chaos can be good for a city, right? 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Park city planner Jack Wong believes the massive demographic 
changes that have transformed his city and others in Los Angeles County have 
forced planners, architects and others on the bureaucratic rungs of the 
municipal ladder to formulate new ways of planning for their communities' 
futures. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took two big social upheavals -- the Watts riots and what happened in 1992 
all over Los Angeles -- for people to start thinking about advocacy planning," 
Wong said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now some planners have started to identify workable solutions to enormous, 
structural changes that have taken place." 
</P>
<P>
 Next week, Wong and his wife, May Ying, will share their theories about the 
usefulness of change with other city officials at the third annual Ethnopolis 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple are founders of Ethnopolis, a nonprofit education and research 
group specializing in ethnicity and urban planning issues. The conference will 
focus on demographic issues that Huntington Park and other cities are grappling 
with. 
</P>
<P>
 Ying, an architect with a business in the South Bay, is president of 
Ethnopolis. Wong, her husband of 17 years, is chairman of its five-member 
board. The title of the conference Friday is "Planning Within Ethnically 
Diverse Communities." 
</P>
<P>
 Topics to be discussed include recent demographic changes in Orange County, 
issues surrounding the English-only movement, ethnicity in mass media, 
immigration, and the effects of alcohol and liquor stores on ethnically diverse 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials from throughout the Southland are invited to attend, along with 
academics from area universities, legal aid specialists and substance abuse 
consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 For Sylvia Ruiz, president of Tierra Concepts -- a Los Angeles-based urban 
planning and consulting firm, the Ethnopolis conference is a chance to exchange 
ideas about economic development strategies in minority communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very important forum for representatives from the public and 
private sectors to discuss the futures of their communities," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year Huntington Park contracted with Tierra Concepts to develop a 
detailed plan for economic development. The city, once predominantly white but 
now 92% Latino, had lost thousands of manufacturing jobs when nearby steel 
foundries and manufacturing firms closed.  
</P>
<P>
 "We found upon researching the city that the general skills and educational 
levels were very low," Ruiz said. "Those are clear deterrents for industries 
looking to relocate or hire people." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Huntington Park is home to a satellite center of East Los Angeles 
College. Following Ruiz's recommendations, the center concentrates on programs 
that quickly certify people in legal or medical professions, especially as 
nurses or legal assistants. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruiz, who will participate in an Ethnopolis panel that discusses the role that 
liquor stores play in a city's economic development, will relate her 
experiences in Huntington Park at the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the better-paid and better-educated residents that the 
satellite will bring, Ruiz said, the restaurants and a bank that have located 
near the campus are examples of success stories in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The city 's economic future, Ruiz said, is "brighter than it used to be." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ethnopolis conference will be held from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. at the Wyndham 
Garden Hotel, 5757 Telegraph Road, in the City of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Admission is $95; students receive a $20 reduction in the registration fee.

 Hollywood's spotlight shined brightly on the Cambria Apartments recently, 
giving the newly tenant-owned building a ghoulish look for a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Actor Eddie Murphy and a host of camera crews from Paramount Pictures 
descended on the three-story building on South Union Street for a night of 
filming for Murphy's upcoming film "Vampire in Brooklyn." 
</P>
<P>
 Production company employees saw pictures of the turn-of-the-century building 
in a news article about its purchase by tenants and thought it would be perfect 
as an eerie Brooklyn tenement. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, a nonprofit cooperative of community leaders and more than 30 
residents bought the decaying structure from its absentee landlord. 
</P>
<P>
 The purchase ended years of ramshackle conditions that included rotting 
plumbing and windows, trash-strewn hallways, and graffiti-scarred walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the sale of the building, the cooperative, Comunidad Cambria, has 
repainted apartments and hallways and begun repairing other problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Those repairs did not evoke images of horror for the movie makers, so black, 
movable walls, beat-up furniture and just the right lighting were added to give 
the lobby an eerie look. A creaking wooden staircase winding its way up three 
flights was the focus of a scene involving a casket.  
</P>
<P>
 "They kept bringing the coffin up and down the stairs from 8 at night till 5 
the next day," said tenant Teresa Lopez. "You could hear the clanking of chains 
and things in the hallway." 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount paid $10,000 to Comunidad Cambria. Tenants said the money will be 
used for more improvements to the 66-unit building. LUCILLE RENWICK

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: WILSHIRE; POLICE STATION WINS AWARD FOR EXCELLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Wilshire Division police station has earned the 1994 Eureka Award for 
Quality and Service Excellence.  
</P>
<P>
 The Eureka Awards are the California edition of the Malcolm Baldridge National 
Quality Award Program, named for the late former Secretary of Commerce.The 
awards recognize quality and service in four categories: government, nonprofit, 
and small and large business. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Hinton, president of the San Diego-based California Council for Quality 
and Service, the nonprofit organization administering the awards, said the 
station was noted for outstanding leadership and community outreach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wilshire happens to be very successful in their efforts to get the community 
involved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We completed a 40-page evaluation of the things we do here at the Wilshire 
Division," said Sgt. Ron Batesole, head of community relations. "We had a 
12-person team brainstorming." 
</P>
<P>
 Batesole said the Wilshire Division took the lead in reaching out to the 
community when Chief Willie Williams called for more community-based policing, 
establishing the Wilshire Community-Police Advisory Board more than two years 
ago. The station also sponsors several other community, youth and charity 
activities, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 An awards ceremony will be held Friday beginning at 6:15 p.m. It is open to 
the public, and reservations may be made by calling the council at (619) 
491-3050.

A LESSON IN MUSICAL CHAIRS; PLAGUED BY AN EVER-SHIFTING ENROLLMENT, INNER CITY 
SCHOOLS HAVE BECOME REVOLVING DOORS, LEAVING TEACHERS FRUSTRATED AND PROGRAMS 
IN DISARRAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 AT DORSEY HIGH IN THE CRENSHAW DISTRICT, about 1,100 students -- nearly 90% of 
the enrollment -- will either leave or enter some time after the school year 
begins. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation is only a little better at the 1,700-student Bethune Middle 
School in South-Central Los Angeles, which lost 713 students and gained 513 
last school year. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most other inner city schools in Los Angeles, Dorsey and Bethune have 
become revolving doors for students who enroll and leave -- often without 
providing a trace of their whereabouts. Such instability -- dubbed "transiency" 
by administrators -- has left teachers frustrated, students constantly playing 
catch-up with course work and schools losing money, inasmuch as the level of 
state funding is determined by attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Transiency has always been one of our monumental problems in the inner city," 
said Edith Morris, Bethune's principal. "It breaks up the continuity of our 
whole program and it drastically affects test scores because youngsters don't 
have any continuity in their education." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Yvonne Noble, principal at Crenshaw High, where the rate of transiency 
is well above the district average: "It affects the entire program because when 
our population declines, our funding is cut and we lose teachers. When we lose 
teachers, we can lose programs." 
</P>
<P>
 Such flux has several causes. Sometimes, students switch schools because of 
academic or gang-related problems. They also leave when their families move to 
new neighborhoods or go back to their home countries. Still others become 
transient when they simply choose to be truant. 
</P>
<P>
 Transiency plagues every school in the Los Angeles Unified School District, 
but inner city schools tend to have the highest rates because they are havens 
for recent immigrants, apartment dwellers and others who for either economic or 
social reasons tend to move frequently. 
</P>
<P>
 Transiency is expressed as a percentage of the school's average monthly 
enrollment. Because the figure includes students who may enroll, leave and then 
return to the same school twice in the same year, some students may be counted 
twice. High schools generally report the highest rates and elementary schools 
the lowest. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's 46% overall transiency rate has gradually increased over the 
years, though there was a slight drop between the 1991-92 school year and 
1992-93. The rates at some schools, however, continue to climb. At Dorsey, the 
transiency rate jumped from 56% in 1987-88 to 87% five years later. Bethune's 
rate also rose from 70% to 77% during the same period, according to the 
district's most recent figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Mike Roe, Bethune's attendance counselor: "This area is in a tremendous 
state of change because people are constantly moving to find work or new places 
to live." 
</P>
<P>
 He added, "We've seen a lot of folks, especially black families, move to other 
areas like Phoenix, Las Vegas, San Bernardino and Riverside. Around 1978, this 
school was almost totally black. Now, it's mostly Latino." 
</P>
<P>
 During the last week of October, Bethune lost 20 students. Five of those 
students went to Mexico; eight moved to other Los Angeles Unified schools; 
three transferred to other California districts; one student moved to Virginia, 
and three others went unaccounted for. During the same week, 13 new students 
enrolled at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Roe said that at the start of the school year, 1,200 of the students who were 
supposed to attend Bethune didn't show up. 
</P>
<P>
 Roe tracked down most of the missing students, but he still has no idea what 
happened to 577 of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the biggest problems is the tremendous number of kids who go back to 
another country," Roe said. "They leave and visit their home countries, but 
they don't come back for several weeks and don't tell anyone at school where 
they are." 
</P>
<P>
 Many immigrants also move to areas such as South-Central or Watts when they 
first arrive, then to areas where the population is more stable and where they 
can find jobs, Roe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Olga Martinez, a junior at Dorsey who moved to Los Angeles from Mexico in 
1988, provides an example of today's itinerant student. 
</P>
<P>
 She attended Butler Elementary, Muir and Bethune middle schools, then switched 
back to Muir before moving on to Dorsey. During this time, Martinez said, her 
family moved five times. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, we moved to different places because we had no money," she said. 
"I felt funny moving around because when I went to Bethune, I didn't know 
anybody and I didn't have any friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez also recently spent three weeks of the school year in Mexico because 
she had to take care of personal matters. 
</P>
<P>
 "You miss a lot of things when you go," she said. "It makes it tougher." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ceola Holmes, 14, attended seven elementary schools and three junior highs 
before enrolling as a freshman at Dorsey High this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 She went to 61st Street, Budlong, 42nd Street, Holmes Avenue and Miller 
elementary schools in South-Central, along with Taper Avenue Elementary in San 
Pedro and another elementary in Carson, whose name she can't remember. She then 
went to Muir, Gompers and Audubon middle schools before coming to Dorsey. 
</P>
<P>
 Holmes paused when asked how long she planned to stay at Dorsey. "I don't know 
how long I'm going to be here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most other students who move from campus to campus, Holmes' erratic 
school enrollment is linked to changes in her family life. Although she and her 
two younger sisters lived mostly with their mother in various places, they also 
lived periodically with their grandmother in South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a problem with some neighborhoods or my mom just got tired of 
someplace," said Holmes, who now lives with her grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Making friends hasn't been a problem for Holmes, but she said she has had 
trouble keeping up with her studies because her classes haven't been 
consistent. For instance, she enrolled in algebra at Muir Middle School, 
pre-algebra when she transferred to Gompers and regular math when she went to 
Audubon. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Holmes shrugged off the constant moving. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, you're not used to it," she said. "But then, you just get used to 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 At Jordan High, where the transiency rate is close to 71%, attendance 
counselor Eno Otoyo confronts another key factor leading to high transiency 
rates: truancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Every week, Otoyo makes 20 to 25 house visits to try to find out what happened 
to students who have been absent for more than 10 days. His current list 
includes the names of 43 students. 
</P>
<P>
 He recently met with Paula Barajas to talk about why her 16-year-old son, Jose 
Corrales, hasn't been in school for more than a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is the problem you're having with Jose?" Otoyo asked Barajas through a 
Spanish-speaking interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
 "He ran away and he's not coming to school," Barajas said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a problem with gangs. Your son is a gang member," Otoyo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Otoyo then turned to Corrales and lectured him about his baggy clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't dress like a gang member and not get in trouble," he said. "You're 
showing that you don't really care about your life. But even if you don't care, 
your mother cares about you, and you should respect her." 
</P>
<P>
 After Corrales explained that he hadn't been coming to school because rival 
gang members on campus were after him, Otoyo agreed to transfer the boy to a 
different school. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than an hour later, Otoyo drove to the neighboring Jordan Downs housing 
complex to track down 16-year-old Alejandra Garcia, who hadn't been at school 
in more than two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good morning, my dear Alejandra. Why aren't you in school?" Otoyo asked the 
girl after she appeared at her doorstep with her mother and older brother. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got in a fight and I'm afraid to come back," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "So you're loafing and staying home -- just kicking back," Otoyo said. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I'll come tomorrow," the girl said. 
</P>
<P>
 As Otoyo headed back to his car, he saw a group of teen-age boys sitting on a 
wall between the school and the housing complex. As he walked toward them, they 
jumped back on campus and began throwing rocks, sticks and a worn cushion over 
the cement wall at him. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the people you're trying to help, but they don't see it that way," 
Otoyo said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ones that frustrate me are the ones who are bright and capable," he said. 
"That's when I really get upset." 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1992-93 school year, Jordan High had about 33,500 "non-approved 
absences," which amounted to a loss of nearly $600,000 in state funds. The 
district lost this money because state funding is linked to the number of 
students who show up at school every day. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the financial loss, transiency makes it difficult for many schools 
to simply educate students. 
</P>
<P>
 "You barely get to know students, and then they're gone," said Tom Nauman, a 
teacher at Locke High in South-Central. "It's difficult to plan lessons and 
(give) long-range assignments because new students keep coming to class." 
</P>
<P>
 Schools also lose textbooks because some students leave school with their 
books and without providing an address where they can be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had students who check in on a Monday and check out three weeks later," 
Locke teacher Cynthia Williams said. "We lose a lot of books that way." 
</P>
<P>
 The National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 also found that students who 
change schools twice by eighth grade are more than twice as likely to drop out 
of school. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time some kids get to middle school, their skills are so low that they 
don't want to come to school," Roe said. "It's too embarrassing for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Morris Guzman, a sophomore at Manual Arts High in South-Central, attended four 
elementary schools and four junior highs before coming to Manual Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 It's difficult for him to remember the names of all the schools, but he's sure 
of one thing: He's sick of moving around. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty hard because some people treat you badly because you come to 
school and you barely know anybody," he said. "It's been hard to keep up in 
class because every school is so different. Sometimes, I don't know what's 
going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Although there is little educators can do to keep students from moving to new 
schools, various programs have been initiated to cut back on truancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Bethune started an attendance incentive program in which students with perfect 
attendance get five extra minutes for midmorning nutrition breaks and lunch and 
can attend the school's "Perfect Attendance Dance." 
</P>
<P>
 And at Jordan High, Principal Etta McMahan is trying to get every student to 
learn the school's alma mater to boost school pride, and possibly attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 Realistically, however, McMahan and others at the school know the situation is 
somewhat beyond their control. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem we're encountering is so monumental that it's difficult to do 
anything," Otoyo said. "The situation we're seeing at schools is merely 
reflecting societal problems." High School Transiency Rates 
</P>
<P>
 The high rate of central Los Angeles students who don't finish the school year 
in the same school is most evident in high schools. Transiency refers to the 
number of students who either leave or enter a school during the year. It is 
expressed as a percentage of the school's average monthly enrollment: 
</P>
<P>
 Bell: 32.16 Belmont: 58.32 Crenshaw: 70.26 Dorsey: 86.50 Franklin: 45.64 
Fremont: 60.69 Garfield: 46.59 Huntington Park: 58.71 Jefferson: 65.41 Jordan: 
70.76 Lincoln: 40.49 Locke: 82.38 Los Angeles: 76.87 Manual Arts: 82.91 
Roosevelt: 51.59 South Gate: 36.32 Washington: 72.89 Wilson: 46.63

 Sharon Yamato Danley traveled to Heart Mountain, Wyo., to dismantle two 
barracks used at an internment camp for Japanese Americans during World War II. 
One of the barracks has been reassembled across the street from the 
Japanese-American National Museum in Little Tokyo as part of an exhibit.  
</P>
<P>
 I learned that my family was in terned in a concentration camp from my 
first-grade teacher, some 10 years after the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout my childhood, my parents, now dead, had managed to build a wall 
between me and the memory of that horrible time in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 So when I saw the plea for volunteers to participate in a project to dismantle 
two of the barracks in Heart Mountain, Wyo., and rebuild them at the 
Japanese-American National Museum in Los Angeles, I jumped at the opportunity 
to grab whatever I could of the truth that I feared had died along with my 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 I am a third-generation Japanese American living in Venice, where I write and 
work as a transcriber. I was born in 1949, after my parents were released from 
the camps. Four of my older sisters, however, lived through the forced 
detention and told me what little I knew about those three years. 
</P>
<P>
 One sister, about 5 at the time, remembered eating frozen canned fruit 
cocktail as the only relief against the blistering heat. My parents were sent 
to a camp in Poston, Ariz. -- like Heart Mountain, one of a number of remote 
sites selected for the internment camps. My mother, born and raised in the 
milder climate of Los Angeles, would only say that the camp was "so hot." 
</P>
<P>
 My father, who moved to Los Angeles from Hawaii and opened a small travel and 
employment agency in Little Tokyo, would say nothing at all about his 
detention. 
</P>
<P>
 At Heart Mountain we were greeted by dry, 80-degree weather, but the 
temperatures seemed higher as we ripped through weathered tar paper, pulled up 
thousands of rusty nails from every corner of the hastily constructed barracks 
and dragged heavy wood planks to a flatbed truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike my sisters and parents, we were provided with bottled spring water with 
ice, fresh apples and oranges, sweet rolls and doughnuts as we toiled in the 
dust. There were 25 volunteers in all, most of them men in their 60s who had 
been interned at Heart Mountain.  
</P>
<P>
 I was accompanied by two cousins, one of whom was born at Heart Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 The work was hard and long, though sometimes punctuated by laughter. So 
intently did we attack the job, in fact, I couldn't help thinking that we were 
trying to shelter ourselves from the truth of the concentration camp 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 As a contingent of Nisei men in their 60s, all former camp interns, labored 
from dawn to dusk, I thought of my father. He was a proud and passionate man 
who, despite two heart attacks, refused to give up his hard life -- his long 
hours of work in Little Tokyo, his nighttime gambling and trips to the track, 
and his excessive fondness for drink.  
</P>
<P>
 I reflected on how often I lose myself in my work or social life to avoid the 
demons that creep in when I stop. How could such a thing happen to my parents, 
whose only crime was being of Japanese descent? How could my parents allow this 
to happen? And how could I so easily inherit their shame? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the deepest fear -- the hardest to admit -- was that somehow we 
deserved this. My parents' silence only emphasized what I felt inside, that the 
shame of what happened to them was something you didn't talk about. They taught 
me gaman, to grin and bear it in the face of adversity -- which only made my 
feelings of sadness build inside me. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, sometimes that repressed shame raises its head in anger. Anger at an 
American Legion plaque along the Wyoming highway that implies the barbed-wire 
enclave at Heart Mountain benefited those who were interned there. Anger at 
governments that allow injustice. Anger at those who still hate Japanese 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the shame manifests itself in an overwhelming depression, a feeling 
that no matter how hard I try to be good -- to please others and to fit in -- 
that I will always fall short. This is the legacy of my parents' wall of 
silence. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, standing in the empty barracks for the first time, I knew why my mother 
and father chose not to speak. The raw wood floor, the cramped living space, 
the dust that crept through the walls, the emptiness -- I imagined their first 
glimpse of a barracks like this, their new home. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pain is just too great," said one man who could have been my father, 
standing in the ruins and fighting back tears. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no one could deny that preserving these barracks fostered joyful 
camaraderie and a tremendous sense of accomplishment, this project meant so 
much more to him. The barracks were not just artifacts to be put on display in 
a museum. They were a tangible part of his life, a part that he would rather 
have forgotten but knew he could not. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that I am near the end," he said quietly, there was no denying that his 
past, especially the painful part, was far too important to be allowed to rot 
and be thrown away. Thanks to this experience, he said, he was now ready to 
share his Heart Mountain memories with his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 In the four short days it took to dismantle these barracks, I touched the 
silent pain of my parents' lives. At Heart Mountain, I took a hammer and tore 
down a wall.

VOICES: LAYING DOWN THE LAW IN A NEIGHBORLY WAY; BARBARA KENNEDY HELPS CLARIFY 
POLICE POLICY IN WATTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Barbara Kennedy is a 21-year resident of the Imperial Courts housing project 
in Watts, where she runs a state-funded program to prepare people for the job 
market. In September she took a 30-hour LAPD course, called Community Police 
Academy, designed to improve relations with the community by familiarizing 
residents with police procedures. She was interviewed by Mike Wyma.  
</P>
<P>
 I always have paid close attention to the activities that are going on in 
Imperial. The thing that I was concerned about was when the police detain young 
men unlawfully. Often the young men don't understand the law totally. They 
don't understand that the police are supposed to give them a statement, a 
reason why they are detaining them. If they don't, they're detaining them 
unlawfully. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes I intervene. I go up and ask, "Why are you stopping them?" They ask, 
"Who are you?" If the residents are just having a beer or are just gathered in 
a group and the police put them on the ground and search them, I tell the 
residents the law. First thing is they can't be drinking in public. Some of 
them are 16 and 17 and don't know that. At a seminar we held for residents I 
told them, "You want me to police you or you want me to call the police to 
police you?" They said, "Go ahead, Barbara, you police us." So I tell them the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 Imperial is primarily very young, 35 and under. If they don't know and haven't 
been taught, they're in ignorance. You learn from mistakes of the people before 
you, or you'll have to learn from your own mistakes. It can be a cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 The harassment has stopped a great deal here. The tensions with police, it's 
slightly better. The officers have been given some good training on being 
sensitive in the area they're patrolling. There have been a lot of things that 
happened here -- deaths and drive-bys and even children being shot. 
</P>
<P>
 When a little girl got shot and was killed in 1990, the police were there and 
didn't even chase the car that had just driven by. The shooter was in it. 
Someone who was there told the police, "That's the car! Go after it!" But they 
went to see if the girl was really shot. There was almost a mini-riot because 
they didn't pursue the car. That was in 1990. It really is different now. The 
kids are still on alert, because there's so much shooting at night. It's a 
shame you have to teach the kids to dodge bullets, but that's the way it is. 
</P>
<P>
 We had a meeting on search warrants. That was after the LAPD came in at 6 
o'clock one morning and they had a search warrant for someone who didn't even 
live at that residence. They went ahead and tore up that place looking for 
evidence, and that was unlawful. We had a meeting with the LAPD to look at some 
search warrants and get some information, so people can tell if it's a 
legitimate warrant. Some of them aren't. They look like photocopies of some 
other warrant with the new information put in. 
</P>
<P>
 The search was the first part of '92. The warrant was for people who had lived 
there before but moved out. I didn't know then how to put in a complaint with 
the LAPD. But the congresswoman, Maxine Waters, gave us some forms. She came in 
and told us the laws about police harassment and informed the guys what they 
could do: Document the date and time of the incident and send in the forms. 
Abuse used to happen out in the open. Now people know to report it. You have to 
report it. 
</P>
<P>
 We've talked to the young men. They know that if they're stopped, make sure 
the taillights are fixed and your seat belt is on. Have your driver's license 
and your insurance form and don't bring on the appearance of doing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 We really are trying to police our own people. Something they think is petty 
can be a felony. For example, tripping the mailman and picking up the mail he 
dropped. Or doing something to the mail truck. They think that's petty but 
that's a felony. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime seems on the rise. The police say it came down about 2 or 3 percent, but 
you don't notice that. It's bad. Tempers rising, people arguing. To defuse it, 
you pull them away and listen to it. They want you to know how they're really 
feeling. If they get to the point where they're not being heard, then their gun 
or their fist or their stick is going to do the talking. But I believe it can 
be defused. They can be talked out of violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The police understand it. In domestic problems they'll step aside if I ask 
them to give me a chance. That's if they think he will listen or she will 
listen. But if they see a weapon they won't step away. They taught me that. The 
first thing is to disarm them. The police have to protect themselves and the 
other people around.

THE GROWL GROWS LOUDER; CRENSHAW COUGARS ARE THE AREA'S TOP-SEEDED TEAM HEADING 
INTO PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN WATERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Crenshaw High's football program has played in the shadows of the school's 
more successful basketball team and their success, they feel, often goes 
unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
 More players try out for the varsity basketball team than compete for school's 
two football teams. Opponents often beat up on the football team because they 
know they don't stand a chance against the Cougars during basketball season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know when we line up, we're in for a dogfight each week," Crenshaw Coach 
Robert Garrett said. "We know that athletes who play dual sports are tired of 
getting beaten down in basketball. They want to win and they know their only 
chance may be during the football season." 
</P>
<P>
 But Crenshaw is not giving opposing schools much chance to win during the 
football season either. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars are having their best season since they won the City Section 3-A 
Division title in 1991. They had a 7-0 mark in the Southern Pacific Conference, 
9-1 overall. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, the City Section named Crenshaw the third-seeded team in the 4-A 
playoffs behind top-seeded Sylmar and second-seeded Taft. 
</P>
<P>
 South Gate, the Southeastern Conference champion, is the No. 4 seed and 
Franklin is seeded fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a big step for our program," Garrett said. "This is an opportunity to 
prove that we are deserving of a top seed.  
</P>
<P>
 "Are we for real or are we a fluke?" 
</P>
<P>
 It's rare for a basketball team to attract more fans than its football teams. 
It's even rarer to see more players try out for a basketball team than play for 
the football team. But at Crenshaw, basketball takes precedence over football. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here we have a winning season, play the best teams around and we can't draw 
300 people to a home game," Garrett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Four weeks ago, while preparing his team for a football game against San 
Pedro, Garrett yelled instructions to his 60-member varsity football team. 
Inside the Crenshaw basketball gym, more than 100 players tried out for the 
varsity basketball team, which is coached by Willie West. 
</P>
<P>
 At Crenshaw, unlike other schools, there is an unwritten rule that athletes 
cannot compete for both teams. Very few have ever tried. 
</P>
<P>
 "I envy Coach West," said Garrett. "He has 80, 90, maybe 100 players trying 
out for a 15-man squad. I tell the same kids, 'You don't have to try out for 
that. I'm taking 16.' "By the time they get cut from basketball tryouts, it's 
too late to play football. The season is practically over." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars were one of six conference champions granted an automatic berth to 
the 4-A playoffs. Ten at-large teams rounded out the 4-A field and the next 
best 16 teams were placed in the 3-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The playoffs begin Friday and continue with the quarterfinals Nov. 23, the 
semifinals Dec. 2, the 3-A championship Dec. 9 and the 4-A championship Dec. 
10. The higher seed is home team for the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars play host to Kennedy in the first round, a team they traditionally 
play during nonleague. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw has two outstanding running backs in Farrel Payton (971 yards, 14 
touchdowns) and Brandon Seals (878 yards, five touchdowns). Rashard McGee is 
the team's leading receiver (23 receptions, 518 yards, four touchdowns). 
</P>
<P>
 In other 4-A first-round matchups, Franklin plays host to Carson, which 
qualified for the playoffs despite forfeiting three games and finishing 2-8, 
and Fremont will play host to Banning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this will be a much more competitive playoffs," said Dorsey Coach 
Paul Knox, who was a member of the eight-man playoff selection committee. "I 
think there are 16 teams that are capable of winning the championship. It makes 
for more interesting first-round matchups. That's the advantage of this system 
over the ones in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Manual Arts is the highest seed of five Central City teams in the 3-A 
playoffs.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think we deserve the No. 2 seed," Manual Arts co-Coach Chuck Hollis said. 
"We beat Dorsey and we hung in with Crenshaw." 
</P>
<P>
 That's a sign that teams are showing respect for Crenshaw -- its football 
team, that is.

GAME OF THE WEEK; BAD CASE OF 'OOPS' SINKS MANUAL ARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Manual Arts receivers dropped four potential touchdown passes and the offense 
committed seven turnovers in a 30-18 loss to Westchester in a Coastal 
Conference game Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss, however, worked in Manual Arts' favor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Toilers, 6-4 overall and 5-2 in conference, slipped from a potential 
last-seeded team in the 4-A playoffs to second seed in the 3-A playoffs, where 
they have a better opportunity to win a championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Westchester improved to 9-1 and 7-0 in conference and was seeded sixth in the 
4-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Comets did their best to aid Manual Arts, committing two first-quarter 
turnovers that led to Toiler touchdowns. Westchester quarterback Damion Ward 
fumbled when Luis Interiano tackled him in the end zone, and Thomas Brown 
recovered for the score. Jermaine Estrella intercepted a Ward pass and ran 66 
yards for a touchdown to give Manual Arts a 12-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Manual Arts had a chance to increase its lead in the second quarter when 
quarterback John Hildreth threw a pass that deflected off Timothy Boykins' 
fingertips. Punter Lumar Lightburn then watched as a bad snap sailed over his 
head, and Westchester got the ball at the Toilers' 14-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 Two plays later, Ward hit Tony Griffin on a 14-yard out pattern and then again 
for the two-point conversion to put the Comets ahead, 15-12. Griffin had three 
receptions--all for touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 The Toilers committed three fumbles, and quarterbacks Hildreth and Willie 
Laffitte combined to throw four interceptions.

VANIS, LOYOLA PUT CRESPI ON ICE WITH 21-7 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a night when it was tough enough keeping warm, Loyola High cooled off 
Crespi's passing attack by controlling the clock and the game in a 21-7 Del Rey 
League victory Friday night at Pierce College. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind a workhorse performance by junior tailback Mike Vanis, the Cubs kept 
the ball on the ground and the Celts' offense on the sidelines en route to 
extending a 14-7 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanis rushed for a game-high 156 yards in 35 carries--25 in the second 
half--and scored two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 The win pulled Loyola (7-2, 3-2 in league play) into a second-place tie with 
Crespi (5-5, 3-2) and gave Loyola the league's No. 2 berth in the Southern 
Section playoffs behind Bishop Amat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know when we've had a guy run 35 times," Loyola Coach Steve Grady 
said. "But we thought that if we could run the ball and chew up the clock, that 
would keep their explosive offense off the field. Our offensive line did a 
tremendous job tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Crespi quarterback Dave Lins, who entered the game third among area passers 
with 1,732 yards, finished with 18 completions in 36 attempts for 151 yards and 
a touchdown. But Lins was limited to only three series in the second half, two 
of which did not yield first downs and ended with interceptions.  
</P>
<P>
 Vanis spearheaded second-half drives of 13 and 17 plays. Vanis capped the 
second march of 80 yards with a three-yard touchdown run. Crespi seemed to have 
a secure 7-6 lead with 1:15 left in the first half after a punt pinned Loyola 
at its 15-yard line. But quarterback Kyle Spielbuehler engineered an 85-yard 
touchdown drive that culminated with Vanis' three-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
 Spielbuehler finished with eight completions in 16 attempts for 192 yards.

 It was like old times for Belmont High in the City Section cross-country 
semifinals Wednesday at Pierce College. 
</P>
<P>
 Paced by individual winner Manuel Lopez, Belmont High -- winner of 10 of the 
last 12 City titles -- placed three runners among the top 11 to win its heat. 
Monroe and Birmingham were second and third, respectively, followed by South 
Gate and Westchester. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, a sophomore, overtook early leader Juan Cortes of Reseda with less than 
half a mile to go and pulled away for a three-second victory in 15 minutes, 51 
seconds over the three-mile course. 
</P>
<P>
 Belmont's Jose Garcia finished fourth in 16:07 and Cristobal Martinez was 11th 
in 16:32. Epigmenio Mateo (16:43) and Luis Bejar (16:46) rounded out Belmont's 
scoring in 16th and 17th place, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sentinels, however, figure to be strongly challenged in their bid for a 
third consecutive title by Palisades and Garfield, which finished first and 
second, respectively, in the other heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Gilmore of Palisades turned in the meet's fastest time of 15:13. The 
Dolphins had four runners in the first five at 16:11 or better. Garfield, led 
by runner-up Richard Martinez in 15:44, was second, and Bell was third.  
</P>
<P>
 The top five teams in each heat, along with individuals among the first 15 who 
are not on a qualifying team, advance to the City championship meet at Pierce 
College on Saturday at 10 a.m.  
</P>
<P>
 Delfina Martinez of Belmont turned in the second-fastest girls' time, winning 
her heat in 19:33. Melinda George of Chatsworth and Lizette Zermeno of Wilson 
were second and third, respectively, in 19:37 and 19:38. 
</P>
<P>
 Birmingham edged Bell, 83-85, in the team standings, followed by Huntington 
Park with 86. Five-time champion Belmont was fourth with 103. 
</P>
<P>
 Palisades edged Taft, 41-42, in the other heat. Garfield (93) and Bravo 
Medical Magnet (125) qualified as the third and fourth teams.

 East Los Angeles College won the men's and women's divisions in the Southern 
California Athletic Conference championships Friday at Griffith Park to qualify 
for the Saturday's state meet in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 Monique Mejia (18:43), Lilly Covarruvias (18:45) and Lynnette Alfaro (19:11) 
of East L.A. swept the first three places in the women's three-mile race as the 
Huskies beat LACC, 26-34, for the team title. 
</P>
<P>
 Ismael Bernal of East L.A. passed LACC's Cesar Vasquez in the final 600 meters 
to win by five seconds in 20:32 in the men's 3.9-mile race. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Cal State L.A. women placed three runners among the top four to win the 
NCAA Division II Western Regional in San Francisco on Nov. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Marisa Avendano won the 5,000-meter race at Golden Gate Park in 17:32, 
followed by teammates Marisol Cossio and Martha Pinto in 17:41 and 17:52. The 
Golden Eagles totaled 38 points to advance to Saturday's national championships 
in Lincoln, Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
 UC Davis was second with 44 points and Humboldt State, buoyed by the 
eighth-place finish of former Bell Gardens High standout Sara Flores (18:21), 
was third with 65.

 The Roosevelt High girls' volleyball team, seeking their ninth City final 
berth in 14 years, defeated El Camino Real, 15-17, 12-15, 15-13, 15-11 in the 
4-A quarterfinals Wednesday. The Roughriders will play defending City champion 
Palisades in Tuesday's semifinals in a rematch of last year's 4-A final. 
Franklin beat Poly, 16-14, 15-13, 16-14 in a 3-A quarterfinal to improve to 
14-0. The Panthers face Fairfax in a semifinal Tuesday.
