 WAKE-UP QUAKE: JS Seminars of Huntington Beach has had no trouble since Monday 
morning filling up seats for its two-day seminar next month for business and 
industries. It's about planning for emergencies -- like earthquakes."We help 
people prepare for just about anything -- natural disasters, hazardous material 
threats," says spokesman Gary Stockdale. "But Monday's quake was a wake-up call 
to some. Our phones have been busy since."

 HOPPY REDUX: Hopalong Cassidy -- portrayed by the late silver-haired William 
Boyd -- was a huge early Western hero. Now negotiations are complete to 
resurrect the character for the big screen. And that's good news to Grace Boyd 
of Dana Point, the actor's widow. "He was a force for good, a role model," says 
Boyd. . . . She retains a percentage of the profits and final approval of how 
the character is portrayed, "just to keep the Hopalong property from being 
bastardized basically," she says.

 IT'S MAGIC: Amusement park attractions get more complex all the time. But 
parts of Disneyland's new Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin are decidedly 
old-fashioned (OC LIVE!). For some of the illusions on the ride, for instance, 
designers turned to principles long used in stage magic tricks. . . . "It's 
just done simply," says Joe Lanzisero, the design team leader. "I was proud 
that we didn't have to rely on lasers and sophisticated technology to get our 
effect.". . . . Grand opening for the new ride, already in operation, is 
Wednesday at Mickey's Toontown.

AROUND TOWN / BEVERLY BEYETTE: A MAN, A MURAL & MOSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 We pull off Coldwater Canyon and into the driveway of the house that Ben Hur 
built. I'm holding a cowboy duster. Kent Twitchell is holding a sepia photo of 
Abraham Lincoln seated in the Lincoln Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
 We have come to monumentalize Charlton Heston. 
</P>
<P>
 Twitchell paints murals. BIG murals. Most days, he can be spied on 
scaffolding, at work on "Harbor Freeway Overture." If you've been on the 110 
North at Eighth Street, you've seen it, all right -- members of the L.A. 
Chamber Orchestra gazing down from the 14-story Citicorp Plaza garage. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he wants to see Heston four, five, maybe 12 stories high, on a building 
somewhere in Hollywood. Heston, his hero.  
</P>
<P>
 From the moment Twitchell first saw him in "Ben Hur" (18 screenings, at last 
count), he's "just had this thing" about Charlton Heston.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to paint him as if he were the Lincoln Memorial -- in front of a 
broody, threatening Western sky." 
</P>
<P>
 Heston, in shorts and stocking feet, greets us outside his knoll-top home, 
looking neither broody nor threatening. He has good news. He's rounded up a 
vintage Winchester rifle for this photo shoot. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, Twitchell and his photographer, Dana Ross, set up in the studio where 
Heston's photographer/wife Lydia normally works. Lights, camera, props. This 
will be the image from which Twitchell will paint Heston larger-than-life. 
</P>
<P>
 In due time, The Man appears again, looking pretty big. He is wearing a dark 
green shirt, jeans-and the rent-a-duster from Western Costume. A red kerchief 
is tied at his throat. His Western hat appears well-worn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," he says, "I suppose you're wondering why I've asked you all here . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
 Heston takes an ivory-handled prop pistol from its holster and spins the 
chamber to make sure it's empty before buckling on his gun belt. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can deal with the stocking feet?" he asks. Twitchell, re-draping the 
duster and retying the kerchief, explains that on his murals feet disappear. 
"There's something about seeing the feet that takes away the strength." 
</P>
<P>
 As Twitchell is shooting Heston, he himself is being filmed by a local 
documentary team. For them, Heston has gone on record as being "delighted to be 
memorialized by Mr. Twitchell." Especially as a benign (albeit gun-toting) 
cowboy, sort of a "generic" American Western figure. 
</P>
<P>
 To Twitchell, who was reared on a farm in small-town Michigan, Heston at 70 is 
the embodiment of "a simpler, cleaner, more charitable time, something we had 
when I was a kid growing up in the '40s and '50s." 
</P>
<P>
 Heston stands patiently atop a blue footlocker. First Twitchell has Heston 
holding the rifle in front, the butt resting on the ground. Twitchell likes the 
pose. "A lot of strength, architecturally." 
</P>
<P>
 Heston thinks the rifle held in the crook of his arm looks "a little more 
imminent." Maybe, Twitchell suggests, he should hold it with folded arms. 
Heston, no stranger to Westerns (he's currently in "Tombstone"), says a real 
cowboy wouldn't do that because he couldn't get at it. 
</P>
<P>
 The actor poses for an hour, chin up and strong. Then he shakes hands all 
around. Yes, he says, this will be a first, though he once appeared three 
stories high on an El Cid poster. 
</P>
<P>
 We say goodby and head back to Twitchell's studio in Echo Park. He is pleased 
with the shoot, though he knows he may "take it on the chin" for painting 
Heston with guns. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter. "I want to do a cowboy and I don't want to take his guns away just 
to be politically correct." 
</P>
<P>
 When he finds a suitable site for Heston, he'll seek private funding, as 
always. He'd like to start and finish it in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days after the Heston shoot, Twitchell is 14 stories above the roar of 
the freeway atop the Citicorp Plaza garage. He buckles himself into a harness 
and climbs over the wall and onto the gently swaying scaffolding. Once, he was 
terrified of heights, but that was many murals ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Twitchell isn't actually creating up there. In his studio, he makes a mural 
cartoon, grids it, photographs each of the grids and enlarges them onto a long 
strip of blotter-like material. Next, he saturates the material with acrylic 
and paints it. Finally, he glues the strips onto the mural wall. (The chamber 
orchestra mural, covering a nine-story wall and two adjacent eight-story walls, 
will have 346 strips, each 30 inches high and up to 8 1/2 feet wide). 
</P>
<P>
 At 51, Kent Twitchell did not expect to be a renowned outdoor muralist. As a 
kid painting roosters on the side of the barn, he dreamed of Norman Rockwell. 
Still, he always thought big. "Stonehenge, Mount Rushmore, those are the kind 
of images I really loved." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1971, he was offered a wall at 12th and Union. He wanted to do Marilyn 
Monroe floating through space, but the building didn't lend itself. So, he 
created a 15 by 20 foot Steve McQueen. He'd found his calling. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Twitchell dreams of Charlton Heston, Monument. He dreams of him in earth 
tones, sort of carved out of a cliff. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Mount Rushmore. Pure Animal Lust 
</P>
<P>
 There was something irresistible about the notice of a social for singles 50 
and over: "If you think people have trouble getting it together, wait till you 
see what goes on at the zoo!" 
</P>
<P>
 So there was L.A. Zoo docent Dee Harris in the community room of a Woodland 
Hills bank showing X-rated slides of smooching bears, necking giraffes and 
orangutans in love. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, she sang to members of Singles for Hope Chapter, City of Hope, "Birds do 
it, bees do it . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the courting camel. "Camels, in their finest hour, are rotten 
animals." The male, who smells awful, expresses ardor by biting the female, 
then kicking her legs out from under her until she decides, "Oh, what the 
hell." 
</P>
<P>
 A woman in the audience groaned, "That'd do it for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the Indian rhino, which, explained Harris, likes the rough stuff. 
When they mate, they "beat each other up" and females "have been known to be 
killed in the heat of passion." 
</P>
<P>
 As if that weren't enough, a rhino is pregnant for 17 months before giving 
birth to a 100-pound infant. 
</P>
<P>
 Titters aside, the evening wasn't just about voyeurism. Harris answered 
questions about whether elephants have twins (rarely, if ever) and why animals 
are traded among zoos (to keep the gene pools clear). 
</P>
<P>
 And, somewhere between the chimps and the zebras, she managed to mention that 
zoo memberships, which she happened to have available, help save endangered 
species.

ON VIEW / MARY LOU LOPER: WHAT'S THE FLAP ABOUT? A JAZZED UP CHARLESTON PARTY 
OF THE ROARING '20S 
</P>

<P>
 The invitations said "Charleston!" And Joan and John Hotchkis guaranteed 160 
guests by flying in the nine-piece Louisiana Repertory Jazz Ensemble Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Leader and clarinetist Fred Staff had a good time explaining that the group 
has "resurrected the totally lost music of New Orleans -- that of the old 
pre-jazz parade funeral bands." 
</P>
<P>
 The vibrations shook the feathers on countless maribou boas and headbands as a 
swank spangled and black-tied group entered Campanile Restaurant on La Brea to 
Hotchkis' hugs and kisses. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly Day, tasseled and maribou-ed, walked in with Georgette Mosbacher, who 
wore a cloche and long strands of pearls. (Their husbands were hunting.) 
</P>
<P>
 The new chief judge of the federal District Court in Los Angeles, Matthew 
Byrne, arrived with former Ambassador to Ireland Peter Dailey and Dailey's 
wife, Jackie. There were four ambassadors in the crowd. Besides Dailey, former 
Ambassador to Mexico John Gavin with Connie, former Ambassador to Finland Rock 
Schnabel with Marna and former Ambassador to Jamaica Glen Holden with Gloria. 
The Holdens were a perfect study on the Charleston. 
</P>
<P>
 For originality, however, Mary Milner, dancing with husband Reese, took the 
cake, as they used to say, with her novel mix of Charleston and rock to "The 
Darktown Strutters Ball." 
</P>
<P>
 The night was a '20s fashion show: Betsy Bloomingdale tied up at the hip in a 
glittery chemise, Carrie Ketchum in twirling orange chiffon fringe, Marina Day 
in ruffled polka dots. 
</P>
<P>
 Bridget Martens resurrected a Zandra Rhodes hand-painted copper chiffon. Susie 
Niven, who flew from Sun Valley, wore rings over her elbow-length black gloves. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles' former Italian consul general Alberto Boniver and his wife Suzy 
-- now in the same spot in New York -- flew in. Gordon Davidson arrived past 
midnight to join wife Judi, after his flight was rerouted to Las Vegas because 
of fog. Carol and Warner Henry arrived at 5:30 p.m. from Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 Penny Bianchi almost didn't make it. She said it had taken "35 minutes and 500 
hooks" for Adam to fasten her into Susie Hollingsworth's mother's '20s gown. 
</P>
<P>
 Patti and Tommy Skouras Charlestoned all night. Gretchen and David Seager 
cavorted. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the Hotchkises fly off to St. Moritz for the Cresta (toboggan) Run. 
</P>

 QUAKE AFTERMATH 
</P>
<P>
 Relief Concert Planned: Comedian Paul Rodriguez and producer Jeff Wald have 
announced plans for a charity concert to aid victims of Monday's earthquake. 
Called "Shake, Rattle and Give," the concert will take place within the next 
month and benefit the American Red Cross' earthquake relief efforts. The duo, 
who recently raised $250,000 for the National Hispanic Scholarship Fund with a 
concert starring Linda Ronstadt, plan to announce a lineup and venue in the 
next few days. "This is God's wake-up call," said Rodriguez. "Maybe the silver 
lining in this disaster is that it gives us a golden opportunity to come 
together as a community . . . to rebuild the city without focusing on race, 
creed or color." Among those already on the concert's planning committee: 
Columbia/TriStar Chairman Mark Canton, Walt Disney Studios Chairman Jeffrey 
Katzenberg and Jon Peters, a producer and former co-chairman of Sony's Columbia 
Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Orchestral Car Pools: The Los Angeles Philharmonic has lined up free 
round-trip bus service to the Music Center for patrons who live in the Valley 
and Westside, two areas hard hit by Monday's temblor. The buses will run Friday 
through Jan. 30 to Philharmonic performances (other Music Center presentations 
are not included). Westside residents can leave their cars at the Federal 
Building parking lot at 11000 Wilshire Blvd., with buses departing for evening 
performances at 6 and 6:45 p.m. and leaving for Sunday matinees at 12:50 and 
1:30 p.m. Valley buses will depart at the same times from the parking lot at 
Rockwell International Corp.'s Rocketdyne Division, 8900 De Soto Ave., Canoga 
Park. Reservations are necessary; call (213) 850-2000. MOVIES

 A Matter of 'Fact' and 'Fiction': An Irish family depicted in "In the Name of 
the Father," the critically praised film about the wrongful conviction of three 
men and a woman for IRA bombings, said Tuesday the movie was a misleading 
account that confused fact and fiction. In a statement, seven members of the 
Maguire family, whose own convictions for running an IRA bomb factory in a 
London suburb were overturned in 1991, said the film's documentary style gave a 
misleading impression and failed to credit the many people involved in quashing 
the convictions. "This film's audience may leave the cinema believing that what 
they saw is fact. Much of the detail of the film is fiction," they said. The 
"Maguire Seven" were jailed for between five and 14 years for handling 
explosives. The film's main characters, the so-called "Guilford Four," were 
jailed for life in 1975 for their alleged part in blowing up a pub in Guilford, 
south of London. They spent 14 years in jail before being freed on appeal. The 
film stars Daniel Day-Lewis and is considered a contender for several Oscar 
nominations. TELEVISION

 Eyeing the Winter of '98: CBS chairman Laurence Tisch said Tuesday that his 
network will pay $375 million to broadcast the 1998 Winter Olympics, a record 
amount that will be "just about a break-even number." He called it "a very fair 
number and one we can live with. The Winter Olympics are two weeks of 
programming in February that have been growing in audience share over the 
years." CBS won the rights to the 1998 games -- its third Winter Olympics since 
1992 -- one month after its surprising loss of NFL football to the Fox network. 
Richard Pound, chairman of the International Olympic Committee negotiating 
committee, said that Fox last week had decided not to bid on the games, in 
light of the network's bid to win the NFC. "We agreed with them -- and they 
with us -- that the time was not right," Pound said. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting Critical: It was quite a scene at the TV critics' press tour in 
Pasadena Tuesday. Geraldo Rivera, in town to "promote" his new show for CNBC, 
instead lashed out at the critics, saying: "Most TV critics won't go back to 
their newsroom and say something (nice) about (Geraldo) because it would 
require a personal act of courage." His new talk show, "Rivera Live," begins on 
cable's CNBC Feb. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 'Out There II' Scheduled: "Comedy Central" was apparently pleased by the 
results of "Out There," a gay comedy special that aired last fall. The cable 
network announced that a second all-gay and lesbian comedy and variety special, 
"Out There II: Loud and Proud," will air this summer. The hourlong special will 
be taped before a live audience in New York in late June to coincide with the 
annual Gay Pride Weekend. The lineup has not yet been announced. QUICK TAKES

 Singer Rod Stewart bowed out of Wednesday's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame

THEATER REVIEW; A HUMANISTIC FESTIVAL FEATURING FOUR ONE-ACTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD STAYTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fed up with disaster-watch television? Had enough catastrophe? Then get a 
humanism fix at Theatre 40's fifth annual One-Act Festival. This quartet of new 
American plays offers earthquake relief in the form of compelling characters 
who overcome crisis without the aid of rescue teams. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the Craig Lucas monologue "Credo" depicts a solitary male 
confessing a tale of personal disaster that could have led to suicide. On 
Christmas eve, he loses everything that matters to him, yet salvages hope out 
of despair. This epiphany is gracefully acted by Christopher Michael Moore. 
Director April Webster boldly conceives "Credo" as an exercise in minimalism, 
rejecting props and restraining gestures; the gambit wins on all counts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Festival's keynote play is Richard Hellesen's "Dos Corazones." Two women 
in a maternity ward have recently given birth. One is poor and speaks Spanish. 
The other is wealthy and speaks only English. Their intimate hospital room 
becomes a microcosm of Los Angeles, evoking the city's bilingual differences 
and cultural conflicts. Poignantly directed by Peter Ellenstein, profoundly 
performed by Suzanne Goddard and Jill Remez, the production's only flaw is a 
single sentimental gesture at the close. 
</P>
<P>
 The only Festival misstep is "Santa God," "a play about the end of Christmas 
as we know it." Tim Sims' holiday satire is a witty sketch that director 
Stewart J. Zully has swollen into a long-winded morality play. The outrageous 
story is set in a North Pole bar owned by Frosty the Snowman (richly realized 
by Jeffrey Winner). It seems Santa's alcoholic wife (Cecilia Riddett, a hoot) 
has the hots for Rudolph (an antlered Jonathan Read). But Rudolph is lobbying 
the Pope to anoint animals with sainthood. Santa (a fiendishly silly Bill 
Erwin) is trying to manipulate Rudolph into guiding his sleigh. When the play's 
magic works, it speeds along like a Tim Burton nightmare; when it brakes for 
wisdom, "Santa God" puts us to dreamless sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 Interrupted sleep triggers the conflicts in Glenn Alterman's moving "Spilt 
Milk." The gifted Edith Fields impressively portrays a long-suffering spouse 
who won't repress a past indiscretion, particularly when her husband (an 
equally impressive Milt Kogan) refuses to let her brood in silence.  
</P>
<P>
 * "The Fifth Annual Theatre 40 One-Act Festival," Theatre 40, Beverly Hills 
High School, 241 Moreno Drive, Beverly Hills. Due to earthquake damage, the 
theater will be dark through Saturday. Shows are at 8 p.m., Wednesdays through 
Saturdays, 2 p.m., Sundays. Ends Feb. 6. $10. (213) 466-1767. Running time: 2

MUSIC REVIEW; ORGANIST CATHERINE CROZIER CELEBRATES 80TH WITH RECITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As some restaurants should be saved only for special events, some concert 
venues should be used only for musical marathons, anniversaries or other gala 
occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Crystal Cathedral, home of that huge, 12-year-old amalgam of two mammoth 
instruments -- a Ruffatti and a Skinner, an organ standing five stories tall 
and incorporating 13,000 pipes, five manuals and 223 ranks -- is such a venue. 
</P>
<P>
 The massive instrument was utilized appropriately Tuesday night, however, when 
Catharine Crozier, the veteran American organist who turned 80 last Friday, 
shared her birthday recital with a large audience of well-wishers, a few of 
whom no doubt came to see if Crozier still retains her fabled technique and 
probing musicality. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to worry. The beloved organist -- looking slender but not frail, 
approaching the instrument with a purposeful walk and revealing its complex 
resources with unfailing insight -- still offers musical integrity and 
virtuosic elan as the foundation of her recital performances. With Crozier, now 
as always, it seems, satisfaction can be guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
 Her anniversary recital -- she had also given comparable concerts at the 
Garden Grove church noting her 70th and 75th birthdays -- took no easy course. 
</P>
<P>
 It began with three organ chorales of Bach, crested on a suite of excerpts 
from Nicolas de Grigny's "Mass for Organ," revived for our delectation Jehan 
Alain's brief and haunting Second Fantasy and ascended the several breathtaking 
climaxes of contrasting virtuoso pieces by Leo Sowerby: the late Fantasy for 
Flute Stops, "Requiescat in Pace" (1920) and the Toccata (1940). 
</P>
<P>
 All these works Crozier delivered with sense and affection. Having conquered 
their various and pesky demands long since, she could concentrate on 
communicating their messages and structures. The results were, not 
surprisingly, engrossing and instructive: The music, piece by piece, sounded as 
important as it is, revealed its beauties without strain, and left one wanting 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end, two encores had to suffice. First, a Postlude by Alain, then the 
Toccata from the Fifth Symphony by Widor.

CLUB REVIEW; INFINITI HAS THE GOODS EXCEPT FOR HEART, SOUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HEIDI SIEGMUND

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Infiniti's chances of becoming one of the Southland's worthwhile nightclubs 
are definitely finite. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the West Hollywood venue, which is open from Wednesday through 
Saturday, contains the essential elements -- a strong sound system, a dance 
floor, a live performance area and a room that's removed from the action -- it 
has no soul. 
</P>
<P>
 The design elements incorporate the highlights of other clubs, and the music, 
which most nights focuses on hip-hop, is a predictable, voiceless blend of 
current chart-topping artists. Its coupling of George Clinton funk with current 
club standards -- Dr. Dre, Snoop Doggy Dogg, Salt-N-Pepa -- is generic club 
fare that could be livened up by throwing in more independent rap acts and 
digging deeper for less obvious funk records. 
</P>
<P>
 And without the human touch that would be provided by periodic announcements 
from deejays and promoters, the audience gets lost in the cold, uninviting 
scene. From the time you walk in the door, you're pretty much on your own in 
trying to figure out what's going on in the venue. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Infiniti is one of the casualties of L.A.'s capricious tastes. Each 
night is rented out to different promoters, and although many clubs around town 
take this tack, they don't all forfeit their identity. 
</P>

WINE: FIRESTONE'S FAMILY VALUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scrub brush, grass and weeds ran up the scruffy, sand-colored hillsides. At 
the peak, cracks in the thin topsoil showed the erosion by rain and wind and 
the effects of summer heat. 
</P>
<P>
 This stark view faced Brooks and Kate Firestone as they drove up rutted, 
deserted Zaca Station Road in 1972, trying to determine if it was a likely 
location for a vineyard. The view gave no hint. This was a barren mesa 
apparently devoid of water, and the rocky slopes clearly posed a hazard for 
even large earth-moving equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no wineries nearby, only one in all of Santa Barbara County, and 
that one had a history of making not table wine but dessert wines. The entire 
county had a mere 100 acres of grapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the forbidding appearance of the land, the Firestones spoke with 
experts who believed in the area, so they cast their future here, built a 
winery and began to make wine. That opened the door to dozens of other 
entrepreneurs. Santa Barbara County now has more than three dozen wineries, 
almost all of them family-owned. 
</P>
<P>
 To the list of family-owned wineries, you can now add Firestone Vineyard, 
which until recently was a joint venture between the Firestones and Suntory 
Ltd. of Japan, the huge wine and spirits company. Last week, Firestone 
announced he had acquired the 31% share of the winery the family didn't own. 
"Three years after we started the winery I knew I wanted full control," admits 
Firestone, 57. "Kate and I now have six grandchildren and we wanted to keep the 
winery in family hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've put our careers, our lives -- and our line of credit -- into this 
decision because we believe in the future of the wine industry," says 
Firestone. "We visited Burgundy recently and we saw families that had been 
making wine on the same soil for 18 generations. We feel families are the soul 
and essence of this business, and we'd like our children to keep this fire 
alive." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pioneering this area as he did, Firestone awakened a sleeping giant. It's true 
that other people suspected there was potential for fine wine here. "But 
Brooks," says Rick Longoria, winemaker at nearby Gainey Vineyards, "proved it 
in a very convincing way. The Firestone project was very important to this 
area, particularly with grape planting. They plunked down 250 acres of 
vineyards just like that, which was a great commitment to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone looking at doing 20 or 30 acres had to feel better," adds Longoria, 
who grew up in the area. "Brooks fueled so much optimism because he was doing 
it just as Napa and Sonoma would have done it. It was big-name, big-time. This 
had been a remote agricultural area, and he was really a famous name." 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Barbara area certainly wasn't without wealth. Some of the nation's 
top thoroughbred horse breeders had huge ranches between the Danish tourist 
community of Solvang and pea-soup stopover Buellton. 
</P>
<P>
 But Firestone, who was reared in Los Angeles and worked in London (where he 
met his wife, Kate), didn't feel out of his element in this wild country when 
he moved here 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people might have felt this was desolate," says Firestone, "but I was 
like Bre'r Rabbit and the briar patch. The California golden pasture and live 
oak are where I want my ashes scattered. It was summer when we came through 
here and the fields were golden, and I loved the smell of the dry grass and the 
atmosphere. I was totally at home with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Firestone's original plans called for growing grapes, not building a winery. 
"My father had bought land here in 1971 and decided to plant wine grapes," says 
Firestone. "I had just left the (tire) company, and I went out to see how sound 
an investment grapes were."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He said he did an in-depth report for his father. The good news was water: 
There are subterranean springs all over the property; wells could be dug to 
feed the young plants. More good news: A neighbor, Dean Brown, had done a 
10-year weather study that showed perfect growing conditions for fine wine 
grapes. "This was the cornerstone of the whole project," says Firestone. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was one huge economic drawback, he says: "I told my father there 
were no wineries here, so he'd be sending his grapes north (to Napa or Sonoma), 
where they may not pay the prevailing price for grapes." He suggested the 
family should consider starting a winery. 
</P>
<P>
 But the elder Firestone was not convinced and called on his close friend and 
golfing companion, Keizo Saji, then president of Suntory, to see if the winery 
was a good idea. Saji, whose firm also owned a winery in Japan, sought 
assistance from company experts, who did a careful analysis of the area. 
Finally, Saji said he liked the idea and formed a partnership with the 
Firestones to found the winery. 
</P>
<P>
 The move was a gamble. Firestone was the first winery built in the Santa Ynez 
Valley, which had no reputation for fine wine. But Brooks was sure the experts 
from UC Davis and Fresno State, the two leading viticultural institutions in 
California, were right in saying that this was a good area for fine wine. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the experts were encouraging. Firestone called Andre Tchelistcheff, 
the state's top winemaker, and asked him to be the consultant on the project. 
"I told him I wanted to make wine in the Santa Ynez Valley, and Andre said: 
'Good. How much money have you got to lose?' " 
</P>
<P>
 But Tchelistcheff visited and then came on board. He assisted Tony Austin, the 
first winemaker and now owner of nearby Austin Vineyards, in making the first 
wines, from the 1975 harvest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realized soon after we opened the winery that this wasn't a hobby, it was a 
serious and very competitive business," says Firestone. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What did intrigue him those first years was how the wine would taste, and he 
admits that a few of the early wines were not mainstream. One or two probably 
shouldn't have been released, he admits now. 
</P>
<P>
 Did he ever doubt his decision to open the winery? 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess it was like going through a dark forest," he says. "You don't peer 
behind every rock and tree, you just keep on moving. So, yes, I can't deny 
there were times when I was profoundly frightened, just realizing that I had 
gotten myself into something pretty scary. I was swimming in water over my 
head, and I suppose the answer then is to just keep on swimming and don't think 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
 By 1977 Firestone was producing superior wines from its own young vineyards, 
yet sales were never easy. "I remember in 1976 driving to L.A. to deliver five 
cases of Rose of Cabernet and being damned happy," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Firestone's first real break came that year in Akron, home of the family tire 
company. "It was a dull news day there, so the Akron Beacon-Journal put out a 
front-page story on the winery owned by the tire people, and we sold out 300 
cases of wine in a day. It was our first truckload order of Rose of Cabernet. 
That was just incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 The company made a profit in 1981. "We've made a profit every year since," 
Firestone says. Gross sales topped $5 million in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after the original purchase, Firestone began thinking of bringing the 
winery under family control. The 20-year deal was to be renegotiated before the 
end of 1993, and more than two years ago, Firestone approached Saji and asked 
if he could take complete control of the winery. 
</P>
<P>
 Firestone declined to say how much he paid for the 31% stake in the winery, 
but wine industry sources estimated he paid nearly $2 million to gain full 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 With the closing of the deal last Dec. 31, 45% of the winery is now owned by 
Brooks' father, Leonard K. Firestone, former ambassador to Belgium and former 
chairman of the Firestone Tire and Rubber Co. of Akron, Ohio. Brooks and Kate 
Firestone own 43% and each of their four children, Adam, Hayley, Polly and 
Andrew, own 3%. 
</P>
<P>
 By putting the winery under full family control, Firestone admits, he'll face 
even greater demands to market the wine. And Brooks is splitting his time these 
days -- part time as a wine salesman, part time as a politician. 
</P>
<P>
 Firestone, who lost a race for the 35th Assembly District seat in 1982 by 
1,190 votes out of 102,550 cast, announced last November that he would seek 
that post again. The man who won the 1982 race, Jack O'Connell, is vacating the 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Firestone's vision proved that fine wine was possible in the Santa Barbara 
area. Today there are 9,200 acres of vines in this county, and Firestone is one 
of 34 wineries that market wine with a Santa Barbara appellation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really, I'm amazed at what we've accomplished here in just 20 years," says 
Firestone.

TASTING NOTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In some respects, Firestone Vineyard blazed a trail, but it was other wineries 
that paved it. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Santa Barbara County is rated probably the third-best growing region in 
California (after Napa and Sonoma counties), and while wines from Firestone are 
excellent values, many of the best wines are from tiny producers such as Au Bon 
Climat, Babcock and Qupe. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason is that Firestone, unlike others in the area, hasn't 
specialized in one or two grape varieties, preferring instead to make a broad 
range of wines. With Firestone's 85,000 cases of wine, winemaker Alison Green's 
attentions are divided among various Chardonnays, Rieslings, Gewurztraminer, 
Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and one of the better roses in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are tasting notes from a few of Firestone's current releases: 
</P>
<P>
 1993 Rose of Cabernet Sauvignon ($6) -- Fresh, lively aroma of maraschino 
cherries and pomegranate juice; soft and fruity, with very appealing crisp 
notes of citrus. A nearly dry wine that has a soft finish, making it excellent 
with highly seasoned foods, or as an aperitif. One of the best roses on the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 1992 Chardonnay "Barrel Fermented" ($12.50) -- Smoke and toast combine with 
buttery, oaky notes in a wine reminiscent of some French Burgundies. But the 
fruit seems so subdued it's more technique than grapes. Attractive for those 
who like heavy, rich styles of Chardonnay. 
</P>
<P>
 1992 Chardonnay "North Valley Ranch" ($10) -- Nicely crafted wine of more 
fruit than the previous wine, but with none of the complexity. An attractive 
lighter-styled wine that is a bit overpriced for what's there. 
</P>
<P>
 1992 Johannisberg Riesling $7.50 -- Faintly Germanic in style, the aroma here 
is honeysuckle and pears, with a hint of typical petroleum in the background. 
Just off-dry, it will match with spiced foods and with delicate main courses. 
Good value. 
</P>
<P>
 1992 Gewurztraminer ($9) -- The 1992 vintage wasn't as successful a vintage 
for this variety in Santa Barbara County as 1991, so this wine contains fruit 
purchased from Mendocino County. The wine is, therefore, not as harmonious and 
classic as was Firestone's great 1991, but it is still fragrantly spicy and 
very attractive. Almost totally dry, the wine is excellent with fowl and any 
dish prepared with Asian spices. 
</P>
<P>
 1991 Merlot ($12) -- Generous and loaded with cedar, cherry fruit, and nuances 
of tarragon and tea. An elegant, pleasing wine that offers richness without the 
tannic bite of many other Merlots. 
</P>
<P>
 1990 Cabernet Sauvignon ($12) -- Herbal, green tea and dill aroma is typically 
varietal, but the wine has a bit less fruit than I prefer. A nicely made, 
fairly tasty wine in a style more earthy than I like. 
</P>
<P>
 1990 Cabernet Sauvignon "Vintage Reserve" ($20) -- More depth and 
concentration than the previous wine, and with a bit more oak, but the herbal 
notes are a bit strong for consumption now. Needs three to five years to blend 
the flavors. A bit steep in price for the lean flavors. DAN BERGER

 Marge Powers, Food News Editor, converted her stove-top chicken paprikash to 
an oven dish -- she wanted to simplify the recipe. She roasts the whole 
chickens in the oven rather than pan-frying them on top of the stove because, 
she says, the long, slow cooking makes lots of wonderful pan juices for gravy, 
and chicken so tender it falls off the bone.

 For this beef Burgundy, adapated from a recipe from the recently closed 
Pioneer Boulangerie in Santa Monica, we use beef shoulder because it makes for 
a moist, tender stew. Just brown the meat and saute the onions and garlic. Add 
everything else except the flour and butter and let it cook in the oven. Blend 
flour and butter and thicken the juices on the stove top. This is wonderful 
when served with noodles or small boiled potatoes.  
</P>

 The technique of roasting the lamb on a rack over the vegetables allows the 
meat juices to flavor the vegetables. This one-dish oven meal from Patricia 
Wells is easy to prepare and needs only a bottle of wine and a loaf of bread to 
make it complete.

 This lamb daube, a stew of meat braised with red wine, vegetables and herbs, 
comes from Patrick Healy, consulting chef at Xiomara in Pasadena. The casserole 
is sealed with a flour and water paste thick enough to hold onto the edges of 
the pot. An easy method of applying the paste is to spread it around the edges 
of the casserole, place the cover on the pot and then spread the paste over the 
edge of the cover to seal. This holds the moisture in the pot, allowing the 
meat to steam to a perfect tenderness. The flavor of the daube is spectacular 
and well worth the extra effort involved in preparation.  
</P>

 This classic Transylvanian stacked potato recipe comes from Gabriella Rado, 
who was born in Nagyvarad (also known by its Romanian name, Oradea), 
Transylvania. For the flavor to be authentic, use a semi-dry 
Transylvanian-style sausage. We purchased ours at Tibor's European Meat Market 
in West Hollywood. The soothing but tangy flavor of sour cream helps to balance 
the richness of the sausage. This simple one-dish meal is very substantial and 
will easily feed a family of six.

THE DINNER POT; YOU CAN'T TUNA DISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS PARSONS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No single dish has done so much to degrade the image of the casserole as the 
seemingly ubiquitous combination of canned tuna, canned mushroom soup and 
smashed potato chips. It's gotten so that the mere phrase "tuna fish casserole" 
has become a kind of punch line. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a long and winding road the dish has taken from an innocent conception, 
and as such it serves as a kind of reverse role model for the casserole story. 
</P>
<P>
 The dish we now joke about can be traced back to an entirely honorable way of 
using up leftover salt or fresh cod. Usually consisting of flaked fish bound 
with bechamel and baked with a bread crumb topping, it's called cod a la 
bechamel in "Mrs. Beeton's Everyday Cookery and Housekeeping Book," published 
in 1865. A similar dish is called deviled fish in the 1898 "Mrs. Rorer's New 
Cookbook." Occasionally, quartered or sliced mushrooms were added to the sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuna, which was first canned commercially in 1903, shows up in Ida Bailey 
Allen's 1932 "Modern Cookbook" bound with bechamel and called escalloped tuna 
fish. Canned cream of mushroom soup was introduced by Campbell's in 1934, and 
the first tuna casserole as we know it shows up in "Joy of Cooking" author Irma 
Rombauer's 1939 book "Streamlined Cooking": tuna, mushroom soup and noodles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By 1947, the dish was so ubiquitous that in the kitchen memoir "Pot Shots From 
a Grosse Ile Kitchen," Lucy and Sidney Corbett casually mention that when one 
dinner was unexpectedly ruined, they fell back on the desperate combination of 
tuna, mushroom soup and potato chips. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1949 "Good Housekeeping Cookbook" probably marks the beginning of the 
Baroque era of the tuna casserole. Here we find club tuna loaf; scalloped tuna 
and potato casserole; tuna casserole (alternating layers of white sauce and 
potato chips); creamed tuna supreme (made with mushroom soup); tuna noodle bake 
(mushroom soup) and quick curried tuna (mushroom soup plus curry powder). 
</P>
<P>
 And by 1967, the Surrealists were in full flower, with William I. Kaufman -- 
the Salvador Dali of tuna casseroles -- publishing his "Art of Casserole 
Cookery," including: all-in-one tuna chip casserole (tuna, mushroom soup, 
mushrooms and potato chips); tuna Swiss cheese casserole (with cream of celery 
soup); tuna Romanoff (cottage cheese and sour cream); Cinnamon Bay casserole 
(tuna, celery soup, peas and Cheddar cheese); eggplant tuna Parmigiana (tuna, 
eggplant, tomato sauce and mozzarella), and perhaps his greatest work, fruited 
tuna casserole -- an unearthly combination of tuna, cream of mushroom soup, 
canned cherries, canned peaches and grapes with slivered almonds on top. RUSS

HOME COOK: COMFORT THERAPY; THE DINNER POT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARION CUNNINGHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The best therapy for winter days is comfort food. Even if you don't cook much, 
any of these dishes will be easy to make -- and the results will lift your 
spirits. And if you go a step further and invite someone to share your food, 
you can't help being cheered.  
</P>
<P>
 The first recipe for comfort food was the most daunting, because I felt a 
low-fat dish should be included. For me, the definition of comfort food is the 
feeling of being completely satisfied when finished eating, and somehow this is 
difficult to accomplish without fat. But Chinese winter soup has the magic of 
an elixir: You feel restored afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, it was easy. Split pea soup is a timeless classic, beyond fashion 
and style. As such, it must be plain and simple (I have had "creative" versions 
that included rosemary, garlic or even hard-boiled eggs and capers, which is 
like taking your paintbrush and trying to improve a Cezanne.) The flavor should 
be of earthy dried peas with a hint of aromatic onion and ham or bacon, and the 
texture must be thick and creamy. Serve it hot.  
</P>
<P>
 The cheese-and-chile supper dish is a cross between a custard and a frittata. 
Rich with three melted cheeses and spiced with green chiles, it goes well with 
sliced tomatoes -- or a tomato salsa -- and warm tortillas. This dish is good 
either hot or cold.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You can mix it and pour it into the pie plate hours before you are going to 
bake it. Just refrigerate covered until near serving time. Be sure to put it 
into a cold oven if you bake it straight from the refrigerator. What could be 
more comforting than that? 
</P>

THE DINNER POT; GABRIELLA RADO AND THE STACKED POTATOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whenever her mother tried to give her a cooking lesson, Gabriella Rado ran out 
of the kitchen crying, "I want to marry a rich man!" (A rich man, presumably, 
who would pay someone else to cook.) And indeed, she married a dentist, one of 
the wealthier men in her small Transylvanian town. They ate out all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 After her son was born, however, Rado had to learn how to cook; her boy was 
sickly and required special dishes. Her cooking was terrible. "Oh, it smells so 
good," everyone would say to encourage her. But when they sat down to eat, the 
food was so awful, they had to throw it away and go out to eat in a restaurant. 
 
</P>
<P>
 A strong, quick-witted woman, Gabriela was an artist, a painter. Eventually, 
without using cookbook or measuring cup, she got the hang of cooking. The first 
dish Rado made that everybody liked was chicken soup. Little did she know that 
she'd eventually be sought out by her countrymen for her terrific Hungarian 
dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Rado is a Hungarian from Transylvania, which used to be a part of Hungary and 
is now a part of Rumania. As an ethnic minority in Transylvania, the Hungarians 
suffered under Rumanian rule. The Rado family came to the United States in 
1976. Tamas Vetro, a Hungarian from Budapest and a close family friend, relies 
on Rado to supply him with the beloved flavors of their homeland: stacked 
potatoes, stuffed cabbage, a thick soup goulash, and Transylvanian cabbage, a 
dish made with filet mignon, sauerkraut and sour cream.  
</P>
<P>
 "I really think cooking is now Gabriella's second nature," says Vetro. "She 
doesn't have to think about what she's doing. I went to see her last week and 
the house smelled wonderful. I asked her what was on the stove and she said, "I 
really don't know!" 
</P>
<P>
 Stacked potatoes is a substantial and filling regional dish. Ask 10 different 
Transylvanian cooks to make it, and you'll probably end up with 10 slightly 
different versions. While many cooks will use salami or ham in their stacked 
potatoes, Rado's version includes smoked sausage made by her younger brother 
Tibor from a closely guarded family recipe. The cheese? "A not-yellow cheese," 
says Rado vaguely. But it must be layered generously to keep the potatoes 
moist. The sour cream is thinned with milk so it won't dry out and crack as it 
cooks. Serve stacked potatoes as a main course, with a little soup beforehand, 
and a sour pickle -- maybe some pickled beets with the casserole itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Rado won't take a compliment. If you tell her a dish she cooked is 
delicious, she'll say, "That's just the way it's supposed to taste." 
</P>
<P>
 Note: For Rado's Transylvanian stacked potato recipe, see above.

SANDWICH OF SUBSTANCE 
</P>

<P>
 Sometimes a sandwich is just right for supper. Of course, you want more than a 
few slices of cold cuts slapped between two slices of bread. You want 
sandwiches of substance. Something you can sink your teeth into and taste in 
layers, like the following recipe for a club sandwich that I have re-christened 
the Dagwood Italiano. 
</P>
<P>
 It starts with chicken or turkey cutlets marinated in a heady mixture of 
crushed garlic, fresh thyme, oregano and olive oil. The same marinade is used 
for the zucchini slices. I cook both the cutlets and the zucchini on a 
stove-top griddle, but a non-stick skillet will work as well. The roasted sweet 
red peppers and reconstituted dried tomatoes add color and depth of flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 The bread is of utmost importance. I like the kind from the deli department in 
my supermarket. It comes pre-sliced and is not the authentic 
crisp-outside-soft-inside Italian bread I like for other occasions. This bread 
has a soft but sturdy crumb and crust -- perfect for a sandwich. 
</P>
<P>
 DAGWOOD ITALIANO 
</P>
<P>

GOOD COOKING: NOT-SO-INSTANT GRATIFICATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABBY MANDEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite the excellent bakeries we now have, bread continues to be one of the 
most satisfying things to make at home. What else equals the thrill of removing 
a crusty loaf from the oven with that heavenly aroma permeating the house, then 
letting it cool slightly and savoring it with a slather of butter? 
</P>
<P>
 For years, I made a straightforward loaf with flour and a proofed yeast 
mixture, meaning that the yeast was first activated in warm water before it was 
mixed into the flour. It was a 1-2-3 procedure. More recently, however, I have 
had impressive success with loaves using a sourdough starter. 
</P>
<P>
 The extra step of making a starter requires a little planning, but it's simple 
enough. You make a batter of flour, potato water (water that potatoes have been 
cooked in) and yeast and set it aside in a warm place for about two days, until 
the yeast ferments and the mixture is bubbly. At this point, some of the 
starter can be used as the base and partial leavening in bread dough. The 
remaining batter should be refrigerated. 
</P>
<P>
 You can keep this starter going in the refrigerator for years, as long as you 
feed it regularly. Whenever you remove some starter for baking, replace that 
amount with fresh batter. At least every two weeks, whether you've been baking 
or not, you should stir in one cup bread flour and one cup water (discard some 
starter first, if you're running out of room). Before using or replenishing the 
starter, bring it to room temperature. Should the starter discolor over time -- 
turn orange or pink -- discard it. 
</P>
<P>
 This sourdough starter enhances the quality of bread in terms of texture, 
crust and flavor. Consider the recipes that follow. The sourdough baguettes 
have great spring to their texture and substance in their taste, while the 
sourdough focaccia is chewy and robust, laden with garlic, shallots and 
rosemary. One of the distinct advantages of a flat bread is time -- no need to 
let it rise on the pan, as loaves typically do. This not only saves an hour but 
allows for at least fairly instant gratification. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is a simple formula for a starter. You can use tap water but water that's 
been used for cooking potatoes is preferable. Just be sure to let the water 
cool down to warm -- about 105 to 115 degrees.  
</P>
<P>
 SOURDOUGH STARTER 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups bread flour 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups warm potato cooking liquid 
</P>
<P>
 1 package dry yeast 
</P>
<P>
 Combine bread flour, potato liquid and dry yeast in glass or pottery bowl. 
Cover with cheesecloth (to allow air to contact mixture). Let stand at room 
temperature 2 days, stirring at least once per day. It should become bubbly 
with clear, yellowish liquid on top that becomes incorporated when stirred in. 
</P>
<P>
 (Each time you use starter, replenish with equal amounts of bread flour and 
water. Starter should be at room temperature before using. When not in use, 
keep refrigerated in airtight container. Should starter turn pink or orange, 
discard it. As starter ages, it will develop stronger sourdough flavor.)  
</P>
<P>
 For 3-cup flour recipes, use 1/2 cup starter with 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons 
warm water mixed with 1 package of dry yeast for mild sourdough flavor. For 
fuller flavor, use 1 cup starter and scant 1 cup warm water mixed with 1 
package of dry yeast. Makes 2 cups. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mixing dry yeast into the starter as well as adding it to the bread dough as a 
boost to the starter makes sourdough bread baking predictable and satisfying. 
For a great crust, shape the loaves, drape them with plastic wrap, and 
refrigerate overnight. Let come to room temperature (they will not double) and 
place in cold oven. Then turn on oven to 375 degrees and bake until bottom of 
loaf sounds hollow when rapped, about 35 to 40 minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 SOURDOUGH BAGUETTES 
</P>
<P>
 1 package active dry yeast 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons warm water (105 to 115 degrees) 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup Sourdough Starter 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup all-purpose flour 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups bread flour 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 Oil 
</P>
<P>
 Cornmeal 
</P>
<P>
 In bowl stir yeast into warm water. 
</P>
<P>
 Put starter, flours and salt into processor fitted with metal blade. Turn on 
processor. Through feed tube, slowly add yeast mixture, then 1 tablespoon oil. 
Process dough until supple, elastic and sticking slightly to sides of work 
bowl, about 1 minute. Add more water or flour by teaspoon, if dough is too dry 
and hard or too soupy. Dough should be slightly sticky. Alternately, use mixer 
fitted with dough hook until dough is kneaded, about 6 to 8 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Transfer dough to large plastic food bag, squeeze out air and seal tightly at 
top of bag to allow enough room for dough to expand. Set bag in bowl and let 
dough rise in warm spot until doubled, about 1 hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil double baguette bread pan. Sprinkle bottom lightly with cornmeal. Punch 
dough down, place on generously floured work surface, and divide in half. Roll 
each piece into rectangle. Start on long side to roll up dough. Pinch seams to 
seal. Gently stretch to fit pan. Place seam side down in prepared pan. Sprinkle 
flour lightly over top. Drape loosely with plastic wrap, oiled on underside. 
Let dough rise in warm spot until doubled, about 1 hour. Slash loaves with 
sharp knife. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake loaves on bottom oven rack at 375 degrees until golden brown and sound 
hollow when tapped on bottom, about 30 to 35 minutes. Remove from pan. Let cool 
on wire rack. Makes 2 baguettes.

 This is an irresistible raisin-laden bread, inspired by the raisin-pecan bread 
at the Corner Bakery in Chicago. The whole-wheat flour reinforces its peasant 
characteristics.  
</P>
<P>
 RAISIN-PECAN SOURDOUGH BAGUETTES 
</P>
<P>
 1 package active dry yeast 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons warm water (105 to 115 degrees) 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup Sourdough Starter at room temperature 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups bread flour 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup whole-wheat flour 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups raisins 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup coarsely chopped pecans 
</P>
<P>
 Oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 egg 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 In bowl stir yeast and sugar into warm water. 
</P>
<P>
 Put starter, flours, salt and cinnamon into processor fitted with metal blade. 
Turn processor on. With processor running, pour yeast mixture through feed 
tube, then oil. Process dough until supple, elastic and sticking slightly to 
sides of work bowl, about 1 minute. Add more water or flour by teaspoon, if 
dough is too dry and hard or too soupy. Keep in mind that dough should be 
slightly sticky. Alternately, use mixer fitted with dough hook until dough is 
kneaded, about 6 to 8 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Transfer dough to large plastic food bag. Add raisins and pecans. Through bag, 
work raisins and pecans into dough until uniformly distributed. Squeeze out air 
and seal tightly at top of bag to allow enough room for dough to expand. Set 
bag in bowl. Let dough rise in warm spot until doubled, about 1 hour, 20 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil double baguette bread pan. Punch dough down, place on generously floured 
work surface. Divide in half. Roll each piece into rectangle. Start on long 
side to roll up dough. Pinch seams to seal. Gently stretch to fit pan and place 
seam side down in prepared pan. Drape loosely with plastic wrap, oiled side 
down. Let dough rise in warm spot until doubled, about 1 hour, 15 minutes.

GARDEN FRESH; CALL ME KALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIA THOMPSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What if I invited you to dinner, you accepted, and then I said, ". . . and I'm 
making my favorite dish of kale. . . ." Would you suddenly remember your Aunt 
Maude was due in town that night?  
</P>
<P>
 But had I said, ". . . and I'm making a salad of warm purplish peacock kale 
with shreds of Gruyere cheese, balsamic vinegar and toasted pine nuts," Maudie 
might be persuaded to stay home. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, when did you last tuck delicate leaves of summer kale into a tossed 
salad? Or dress hot ribbons of frost-sweetened kale with olive oil and lemon 
juice and serve them with garlic toast?  
</P>
<P>
 Some of you are nodding and smiling and saying, "Yesterday!" From a sheltered 
place or from the cold frame you may have picked smooth, blue-green leaves of 
Lacinato, the mildly flavored Italian heirloom kale. Or oak-leaf purple-veined 
leaves of Red Russian (a.k.a. Ragged Jack), a delicious American heirloom that 
reddens, like children's cheeks, in the cold. Or perhaps you harvested young 
crimson leaves from the center of a Chidori ornamental kale that looked like 
crinkly roses bordered with green. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps you're planning to order ornamental red and white peacock kales to sow 
in summer. They make an extraordinarily lacy spray in the border, stalks of 
cream or rosy purple etched with blue-gray-green. Plucked young, their leaves 
are delicious. Arranged as garnish on a platter, peacock kale looks like 
something between exotic feathers and a Martian doily. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although it's not as showy, you kale cognoscenti know the value of the savoyed 
green culinary kale most of us see -- nay, overlook -- at the market. Have you 
a patch of it, with leaves ready to chop into a cream sauce as filling for 
green lasagna? Have you tried Verdura, a Dutch strain with succulent, dark, 
blue-green leaves (tastiest kale I've tasted). In the garden, curly kale looks 
like giant ruffled parsley. 
</P>
<P>
 Kale is a cool-season vegetable; it grows and tastes best when temperatures 
are in the 50s and 60s, as they are now. Most kales are even happy in the 40s 
and 30s. And a few sharp frosts deepen their colors and intensify their 
sweetness. 
</P>
<P>
 The best timing is to start heirloom culinary kale seeds around July and 
hybrid ornamental kales in August, so plants can be going strong by September 
or October. These kales will winter over, and likely be harvestable through 
February. Some plants may give you delectable leaves for another year. Some may 
yellow in spring and send up flowers. These buds are like broccoli, so cook 
them up!  
</P>
<P>
 In gardens where there is little or no frost, you must choose a kale that 
grows tender and sweet without the cold. Try Dwarf Blue Curled Vates, a 
culinary kale with finely curled blue-green leaves. Place it in your chilliest 
spot. When you pick the leaves, refrigerate them in the crisper for a few days, 
and you'll gain some of frost's effects.  
</P>
<P>
 In the High Desert, sow Dwarf Blue Curled Vates in February and March. Where 
seasons are short, sow seeds in May and June. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But even where summers are warm, sow a few seeds of Red Russian kale in very 
early spring. Give plants a coolish spot and you can harvest before the heat, 
even during it. It's worked for me. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvest young leaves individually with a knife, taking them from near the 
center. Let the mature leaves stay. 
</P>
<P>
 As you can imagine, kales have few rivals for beauty in the border. From 12 
inches to 24 inches tall and usually just as wide, springtime kales like the 
company of daffodils and irises. Autumn kales love partying with marigolds. 
</P>
<P>
 Kales are easy to grow. They need five hours of sunshine daily, an inch of 
water weekly and shelter from wind. All must have well-drained, 
moisture-retentive soil. Green sorts want a fertile soil to give their best, 
both in vigor and nutrition. In lean soil, the struggle to overcome 
deficiencies actually makes ornamental kales grow brighter. 
</P>
<P>
 Kale is susceptible to aphids. Swoosh them off with a hose (but be careful not 
to break the leaves). Past that, if there are signs of damage, consult a county 
agricultural agent. And let three years pass before you grow kale in the same 
place again. This helps prevent disease and provides an even drain on the 
soil's resources.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, but not just to look at, these are plants to eat! Kale is among the most 
nourishing of vegetables. One serving gives twice the RDA of vitamins A and C, 
and healthy amounts of readily available calcium and iron. Also, kale leaves 
don't shrink in cooking the way spinach and chard leaves do, so you don't have 
to harvest buckets for a meal. 
</P>
<P>
 When the time comes that you must take up the whole plant, peel the thick main 
stem, unless it's old and tough. You can cut it into matchsticks and treat as 
you would celery. 
</P>
<P>
 So-called Chinese kale, by the way, isn't the familiar European sort of kale 
but a kissing cousin.  
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of China, it's exciting to know that the rose quartz, ruby, amethyst, 
ivory and jade of ornamental kales adorn gardens all over the Orient and across 
Europe and Britain. I wish I could tell you that the kales from these gardens 
come into kitchens and are sent to tables in splendor. But I can't because they 
don't -- and aren't. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Portugal, Scotland, Ireland, a corner in the north of Italy and pockets 
in Holland appreciate kale properly. The national dish of Portugal is kale and 
potato soup -- caldo verde . Irish cooks mix finely chopped kale with mashed 
potatoes and spoon it up with pools of butter -- colcannon (which is also made 
with cabbage). In Scotland, kale is simmered in stock and the soup is thickened 
with barley, oats or rice -- kale brose. An Italian spoon-stands-up-in-it soup 
of white beans, pasta, tomatoes and garlic is given depth of color and taste 
with rags of kale -- pasta e fagioli verdi. And wearing a Greek cap, I turn a 
broth speckled with kale into a lemon-tangy egg-creamy avgolemono.  
</P>
<P>
 So it's up to us to rouse the gardeners of the world into growing and eating 
kale! 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Let's begin with a dish inspired by a Dutch classic. It's wonderful when you 
can have intriguing shapes of leaves in front of you. How many cooked leaves 
can you think of that are more than a nebulous heap on the plate? Kale leaves, 
whether deeply cut or nattily curled, are sculpture.  
</P>
<P>
 If you have sensational sausages -- something like the designer chicken and 
turkey I found the other day made with "fire-roasted red peppers, cilantro, 
spices, and garlic" -- you can give this to friends for supper. Pass a basket 
of radishes, black olives and carrot sticks. Drink a Dutch lager. Let mellow 
Edam cheese follow. Then for dessert, chopped candied ginger pressed into the 
icing of a bittersweet chocolate cake.  
</P>
<P>
 And best invite Aunt Maude . . . .

 Peacock kales wilt rapidly once picked, so cook them ASAP. But don't cook in a 
skillet, even with moisture. The leaves will turn drab and tough. Boiling them 
in a pot of water intensifies their hues and renders them tender. 
Unfortunately, unless the leaves are very young, the stalks are too fibrous to 
enjoy.

 To prepare and cook kale (and other leaves with tough stalks), swish in lots 
of cold water. If home-grown, soak 30 minutes to float any aphids, then rinse 
well again. Fold each leaf lengthwise. Run a sharp knife along the inside of 
the stalk, freeing the pair of greens. Leave greens whole or chop as desired; 
if stalks are tender, chop and cook separately. This is less a soup than a meal 
in one with its broth. Add more broth if you'd like it soupier.

PARTY LINE; HOW GREEN WAS THEIR SALSA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 When chefs John Sedlar and Hans Rockenwagner threw a combined staff Christmas 
party last month, nobody would leave. "They were having too great a time," says 
Sedlar, chef/owner of Bikini restaurant in Santa Monica where the party was 
held.  
</P>
<P>
 "John finally had to kick my staff out at 2 a.m.," adds Rockenwagner, who 
celebrated with the staffs of two of the four restaurants he started, Fama and 
Rockenwagner in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Held outdoors on Bikini's patio, the menu was geared toward the chilly night 
air: Heaping bowls of pork and pinto bean stew, hominy, salsas, and stacks of 
piping hot fresh tortillas, from Bikini; pizzas, vegetable pie, couscous from 
Fama and Rockenwagner. 
</P>
<P>
 The food was set up on the bar and everyone helped themselves. Rockenwagner, 
who had the flu that evening, skipped the food and sipped hot tea liberally 
spiked with rum. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it was the rum, maybe not, but before Rockenwagner went home to bed, the 
two chefs got up and belted out Carly Simon's rendition of "You're So Vain," 
with accompaniment provided by a karaoke machine. "We butchered it,' says 
Sedlar. "I don't know who chose the song, but I think it was probably 
appropriate."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sedlar made this fresh green salsa to accompany the pinto bean stew, but it's 
also terrific on grilled chicken, fish or grilled shrimp.  
</P>
<P>
 SALSA VERDE 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 zucchini 
</P>
<P>
 4 tomatillos 
</P>
<P>
 2 Anaheim chiles, peeled, roasted and chopped 
</P>
<P>
 1 green pepper, coarsely diced 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 bunch cilantro, chopped 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon fresh oregano 
</P>
<P>
 3 green onions, chopped 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon pickled ginger, optional 
</P>
<P>
 1 garlic clove, minced 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
 In pot blanch zucchini in boiling water about 30 seconds. Remove and dice. Add 
tomatillos to water and and boil about 4 minutes. Remove, peel and chop.  
</P>
<P>
 In medium bowl, combine zucchini, tomatillos, chiles, green pepper, cilantro, 
oregano, green onions, ginger, garlic and olive oil. Cover. Refrigerate 2 
hours. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Makes about 2 cups.

CONVERSATIONS WITH A HEAD HUNTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHIE JENKINS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The headhunter is talking to Rarotonga. It's his first call of the day, and he 
keeps glancing at his wristwatch. "Of course, I know what kind of person 
belongs there," he says soothingly into the phone as his fingers nervously 
click a ballpoint pen. The business day is almost over in other parts of the 
world, and there are more calls to be made. His eyes look worried. He's just 
gotten an order for an executive chef, and filling it won't be easy.  
</P>
<P>
 As a headhunter, Benoit Gateau-Cumin recruits and relocates stars of the 
restaurant and hotel industry. In his desktop computer are 4,200 resumes, which 
he updates every month. The data are so precious that he keeps a duplicate copy 
in a safe deposit box. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past three and a half years, Gateau-Cumin has been operating his 
small, specialized agency out of a tidy office in Santa Monica, but his clients 
range from the Ritz in Paris and the Regent of Bangkok to Robert Redford's 
Sundance Institute in Utah. Locally, he's recruited for Arnold Schwarzenegger's 
Schatzi on Main, Merv Griffin's Beverly Hilton, and Remi in Santa Monica. He 
also recruits private chefs for famous clients who want to remain anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
 Today his mission is to find a qualified chef willing to travel to a tiny 
tropical island. This is tougher than it sounds. The chef will need experience 
cooking in a Third World country because it's extremely difficult to get 
delivery of fresh food into the Cook Islands. He must also be able to invent 
lots of dishes using bananas, taro, arrowroot and other locally grown 
ingredients. Even more important, the chef must be single. On tropical islands, 
chances are a married man will cheat on his wife. "It's a macho kind of 
reasoning," Gateau-Cumin says matter-of-factly, "but probably true. There are 
an incredible number of incredibly beautiful women there." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all of Gateau-Cumin's clients have such exotic requests. The Hershey Hotel 
in Pennsylvania commissioned him to scout around for a chef. Upjohn 
Laboratories in Kalamazoo, Mich., wants him to find someone to feed its staff 
of 11,000. And he is in the process of filling key positions at a major 
Southern California hotel.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, this kind of headhunting can be lucrative. For his services, 
Gateau-Cumin is paid a fee equivalent to 25% of the first year's salary of the 
person he places. In return, he guarantees his candidate will stay six months. 
Even with the recession, Gateau-Cumin earned $120,000 last year. This year, he 
expects to make even more. "All I sell is hot air," he says. "In the '80s it 
was easy money. Today I work a lot harder." 
</P>
<P>
 Gateau-Cumin, 43, came into this business through the back door. In the 1970s 
he was a French law student hitchhiking across America; to support himself, he 
took a job as a busboy at a summer resort in Michigan. Upon his return to 
France, Gateau-Cumin wrote the owner thanking him. He also brashly offered a 
few suggestions for improving the resort's wine sales. The owner's response was 
to invite Gateau-Cumin back the next summer to implement his plan . . . for the 
grand pay of $2.25 an hour plus 10% of all wine sales. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, the resort restaurant was selling five or six bottles of wine a 
night, so the owner wasn't being especially generous in his offer of a 
percentage of the sales. But the first night, wearing a tuxedo borrowed from 
his father, Gateau-Cumin sold 90 bottles. "I was running around in that dining 
room like you wouldn't believe," he says. "I ran out of everything. That summer 
I made more money than I had made in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Entranced, Gateau-Cumin came back the next summer. This time he ran the 
restaurant. At the end of the season, he went back to France to get his law 
degree, then promptly registered in the hotel and restaurant program at Cornell 
University. His new career in hotel management took him all over the world -- 
to Chicago, Jamaica, Istanbul, Hawaii, Washington, New York and California. 
Between hotel stints, he owned -- and closed -- two restaurants. Tired of 
management and the politics that go with it, Gateau-Cumin decided to become a 
headhunter instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the hotel and restaurant business, and this way I am still part of 
it," he says. "It's a lot of telephone calls, a lot of Christmas cards, a lot 
of reading the paper. But if I weren't in this business, I'd still want to know 
where everyone is." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His first headhunting job was at a firm with offices in New York and Florida. 
He moved to Santa Monica in 1990 to go into a partnership, and then opened the 
Benoit Gateau-Cumin agency. 
</P>
<P>
 At one time, restaurant and hotel headhunting was big business. But as the 
economy worsened, most of Gateau-Cumin's competitors gradually disappeared. In 
Los Angeles there are only four headhunting firms specializing in restaurant 
placements, including the Prospection Group, run by his former partner, Louis 
Ercout. 
</P>
<P>
 Gateau-Cumin's phone rings often and the dialogue is friendly. In fact, many 
of his clients are former classmates and colleagues. But just mention the 
phrase "celebrity chef" and Gateau-Cumin frowns. "There is nothing wrong with 
being a celebrity chef as long as you are reasonable ," he says, "but the prima 
donna crap is over. At one time, Jonathan Waxman was as important in this town 
as Wolfgang Puck. He stopped working intelligently 10 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 What do chefs think about all this? Mention headhunting to Thomas Keller and 
he sighs. "I had headhunters calling me right after I left Checkers," says 
Keller, who was lured away from the trendy Rakel in New York by a Boston 
headhunter to take over as executive chef at Checkers. It is the only job he's 
ever gotten through a recruiter. "A lot of these guys will call up and say, 'I 
have this great opportunity just for you,' and they don't even know you. It 
takes a long time to build up a relationship with these people." 
</P>
<P>
 Keller compares headhunters to stockbrokers. "When you get right down to it, 
they both trade in a commodity," he says. "If you do bad on your stock, you are 
going to drop your broker." 
</P>
<P>
 "When Tom was hired at Checkers, he was hired by reasonable people," says 
Gateau-Cumin. "People like Bill Wilkinson and Patrick Willis are not your 
run-of-the-mill hotel operators. Checkers was a boutique hotel. Now it is part 
of a large chain. Imagine. It is an investment that doesn't make sense. The 
result is we haven't heard anything about Checkers since Tom left." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the hotel changed management in 1992, Keller left. Last month he 
bought the French Laundry in Yountville, a restaurant known for its unique wine 
cellar. During his time off, Keller worked on a cookbook and a line of olive 
oil. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there are a bunch of Tom Kellers out there not working," Gateau-Cumin 
says, "that certainly lowers the salary scales." The average starting salary of 
an executive chef in Los Angeles is down 15% from three years ago; it now falls 
between $45,000 and $52,000 a year.  
</P>
<P>
 Even so, restaurants have to be careful. If the chef considers his salary 
inadequate, he will find the money elsewhere, even in the form of kickbacks 
from suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a couple of chefs in this town known as Mr. Five Percent," says 
Gateau-Cumin. Although extracting cash from purveyors for the privilege of 
doing business is unethical (and illegal), some hotel managers and 
restaurateurs look the other way. "What they have to remember," says 
Gateau-Cumin, "is that the purveyor isn't going to take the money out of his 
pocket. Instead, he will raise his prices." 
</P>
<P>
 But money isn't the only reason chefs are unhappy. When Jean-Pierre Bosc left 
the dying Fennel in Santa Monica to cook at the new, hot Le Comptoir in New 
York, he lasted six weeks. "All of a sudden he had to work his ass off," says 
Gateau-Cumin, who got Bosc the job. "In New York you don't have designed 
kitchens like you do in Santa Monica. No big windows, No sunshine. You are in a 
basement and there is grease dripping. It was too much of a cultural shock for 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I made the right choice," says Bosc, who is currently cooking at 
Lunaria in Century City. "I did a good job for the restaurant, but I didn't 
like New York." 
</P>
<P>
 "Jean-Pierre was my first failure," says Gateau-Cumin, "but I still think he 
is a heck of a chef." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While Gateau-Cumin's business is steadily growing -- he's become 
bi-continental recently, opening another office in Lyon -- his current 
challenge is finding enough good Italian chefs. Italian food is still very hot 
in the United States. In the Far East, it's all they want. "Italians never stay 
in one place very long," says the headhunter. "A person that has a never-ending 
source of Italian chefs would probably become very wealthy very quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 Here in America, says Gateau-Cumin, the best recruiting ground is the "School 
of Puck." It's because Wolfgang Puck trains his people well. "If you are hired 
by Wolfgang Puck, you might start out as the butcher, but you are not going to 
be the butcher forever. And since his food happens to be extremely creative and 
good, and since his restaurants are always so busy, everybody works that much 
harder and learns that much faster." 
</P>
<P>
 So why isn't it the same for those who work at Joachim Splichal's busy, 
top-rated Patina? "You work at Spago one year and you become somebody," says 
Gateau-Cumin. "But Joachim is always paranoid that someone is going to steal 
his thunder." 
</P>
<P>
 From Puck's perspective, the matter is clear-cut. If one of his people wants 
to move on, or gets a great offer to open his own restaurant, he is happy. He's 
even going to send them customers. "If somebody leaves," says Puck, "it doesn't 
mean that they become your enemy." 
</P>
<P>
 Puck, who came to California from Monte Carlo via Indianapolis -- "I was a big 
fan of auto racing and I thought Indianapolis was like Monte Carlo" -- has 
never used a headhunter. "I don't need to, here in California, especially in 
this economy," he says, "but if you have a restaurant in Nebraska or Wyoming or 
somewhere in the middle of nowhere, it might be necessary." 
</P>
<P>
 And if your restaurant is on Rarotonga, a headhunter is a must. Last month 
Gateau-Cumin finally found someone qualified, and willing, to go there. He was 
thrilled -- and then he discovered that another headhunter had already filled 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, Gateau-Cumin got another call: The Rarotongan resort hotel 
was being sold. "I got a fax from the general manager," says Gateau-Cumin. "He 
asked me to find him a job."

BACK TO BASICS: KNOCKING OUT GNOCCHI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The three most traditional types of gnocchi are made with potatoes, with 
semolina flour or with spinach and ricotta cheese. But distinctive variations 
of what translates as "little lumps" have evolved in every northern Italian 
region and have been concocted by innovative chefs and cooks. Whatever 
ingredients are used, the aim is to turn out tiny dumplings that are 
feather-light and fluffy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of potato gnocchi, purists do not use eggs. That's fine as long as 
the potatoes are waxy, but less attention needs to be given to the type of 
potatoes if you use eggs. The dough will be easier to handle and the gnocchi 
won't collapse during cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 For best results, it's important that the eggs be at room temperature and the 
potatoes freshly cooked. Press the still hot potatoes through a ricer (Step 1), 
then set them aside while heating the milk and butter to boiling. The liquid 
should boil rapidly so the fat is dispersed, not just floating on top of the 
milk. 
</P>
<P>
 Add the flour all at once and beat vigorously with a wooden spoon until the 
mixture is smooth, pulls away from the sides of the pan and forms a ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove the pan from the heat, cool two to three minutes, then beat in the eggs 
one at a time (Step 2). The mixture will separate at first, but become smooth 
again as you continue beating. 
</P>
<P>
 When finished, the batter should look satiny. Pour this mixture over the 
potatoes (Step 3) and gently fold the two together. 
</P>
<P>
 If the gnocchi are to be shaped by hand, place the dough on a floured surface 
and roll into logs about a 1/2-inch in diameter (Step 4), incorporating a 
little flour if the dough is too soft and sticky to handle. Cut the logs into 
1-inch lengths (Step 5) with a sharp knife. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking" (Knopf: 1992), author Marcella 
Hazan gives the following instructions for shaping the gnocchi: 
</P>
<P>
 "Take a dinner fork with long, slim tines, rounded if possible. Working over a 
counter, hold the fork more or less parallel to the counter, with the concave 
side facing you. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the index finger of your other hand, hold one of the cut pieces against 
the inside curve of the fork, just below the tips of the prongs (Step 6). At 
the same time that you are pressing the piece against the prongs, flip it away 
from the tips and in the direction of the handle. The motion of the finger is 
flipping, not dragging. As the piece rolls away from the prongs, let it drop on 
the counter. If you are doing it correctly, it will have ridges on one side 
formed by the tines and a depression on the other formed by your fingertip." 
</P>
<P>
 This shaping is not done solely for aesthetics. The thinner center becomes 
more tender during cooking, and the grooves and depressions help hold the 
sauce, which is added afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Novices (and those in a hurry) will find it easier and faster to force the 
dough through a pastry bag, cutting it to the desired length with a sharp knife 
(Step 7) and letting the pieces fall into the poaching liquid. 
</P>
<P>
 Test the amount of poaching needed by dropping one or two gnocchi into 
simmering salted water or broth and cook, uncovered, three minutes. Remove the 
gnocchi with a slotted spoon (Step 8) and taste; if the flavor is floury, 
increase the cooking time. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook the gnocchi in batches, not crowding the pan. Transfer them to a warm 
platter and sprinkle with melted butter, a little minced fresh sage and a 
sprinkling of Parmesan cheese. Potato gnocchi also team well with pesto, tomato 
or Gorgonzola sauces. 
</P>
<P>

well combined. Stir in 1 teaspoon salt. Pour mixture over potatoes and gently 
fold together. 
</P>
<P>
 Bring 4 quarts water to boil in Dutch oven. Season to taste with salt. Reduce 
liquid to simmering. 
</P>
<P>

 Pizza doesn't have to be high in fat and calories to taste great -- especially 
if you start with a no-fat pizza dough. Nonfat milk is used in the dough for 
flavor. The small amount of fat in the final recipe comes later. A small amount 
of oil is brushed on the dough and atop the tomatoes for flavor. Fresh basil 
and Parmesan cheese are sprinkled over the pizza after baking. 
</P>
<P>
 PIZZA POMODORO 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons dry yeast 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup warm water (105 to 115 degrees) 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup nonfat milk 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons minced garlic 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 3 cups flour 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons yellow cornmeal 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 4 to 5 thinly sliced Roma tomatoes 
</P>
<P>
 Pepper 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup shaved Parmesan cheese 
</P>
<P>
 Sprinkle yeast over warm water in small bowl. Stir until dissolved. Stir in 
sugar. Let stand until mixture begins to bubble. Stir in milk, garlic and 1 
teaspoon salt. 
</P>
<P>
 Beat in enough flour to make moderately stiff dough. 
</P>
<P>
 Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and satiny, 
10 to 12 minutes. Shape into ball and place in lightly greased bowl, turning to 
grease all sides. Cover and let rise in warm place until doubled. 
</P>
<P>
 Punch dough down. Roll out on lightly floured surface to 13x9-inch rectangle. 
Place on lightly greased baking sheet sprinkled with cornmeal. Brush dough with 
half of oil. Cover with tomato slices slightly overlapping in rows. Brush 
tomatoes with remaining oil. Season tomatoes to taste with salt and pepper. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake at 350 degrees 20 to 25 minutes or until edges of pizza dough are 
browned. Sprinkle with fresh basil and cheese. Cut into 2x4 pieces. Makes 8 
servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Each serving contains about:

lashed its lethal tongue in my direction, and I ran for home as I never did 
before. It followed me through my house up to the roof and there I stopped. I 
was at the edge of the roof. It just slowly approached, its large tongue rolled 
out. I slipped and started falling off the roof. I woke up in a cold sweat to a 
slight painful sensation throughout my back. It felt like I actually did fall 
off a building."

<P>
 It's hard to estimate how much a high school student spends on extras during 
four years of school -- the dances, proms, pictures, yearbooks, football and 
basketball games, class rings, school concerts, caps and gowns, to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fullerton Union High School student newspaper, the Pleiades, took a stab 
at figuring it out.The paper estimated that the average student at Fullerton 
spends $1,327 for the school extras, not including things like lunch, 
fund-raisers, raffles, paper, pencils etc. 
</P>
<P>
 A cheerleader who is on the squad for three years pays $3,279 for extras over 
four years -- more than any other student, according to the paper. That 
includes the expense of uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletes? A student who plays three sports a year for four years comes in at 
$2,535. 
</P>
<P>
 So who has any money left for lunch at a taco stand?

PRACTICAL VIEW: RESIDENTS HAVE FIGHTING CHANCE AGAINST INTRUSIVE TELEMARKETERS; 
CONSUMERS: A LITTLE-USED FEDERAL LAW OFFERS PROTECTION FROM PESKY TELEPHONE 
SALES PITCHES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY LIBMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 People worn out after a long day's work often have an uninvited dinner 
companion: a ringing telephone bringing a solicitation for charity or someone 
selling a whazzit.  
</P>
<P>
 At one time, recipients of telemarketing calls could do little. But a 
little-used law offers hope of expanded privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act, which took effect in 1992, 
provides for consumers to notify marketers that they do not wish to receive the 
calls, and authorizes lawsuits of up to $500 for each unwanted call and up to 
$1,500 each time a caller willfully or knowingly violates the regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to take advantage of the law, when telemarketers call, consumers must 
say they do not accept telemarketing calls and must ask the caller not to phone 
again. Companies receiving that message must keep a "do not call" list and may 
not phone the consumer again for 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
 To provide evidence for a lawsuit, consumers should also "jot down the date of 
the call, the time, the company, what they're selling and the operator's name," 
says Michael Jacobson, head of the Center for the Study of Commercialism in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 In what may be the first successful suit under the law, Jacobson sued Citibank 
Corp., which was telemarketing its credit cards, for $2,000 and settled out of 
court for $750 in December. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Associated Press reported Jacobson's settlement, the nonprofit 
center, which opposes what it regards as the over-commercialization of society, 
received 3,000 requests for its stop-the-calls kit. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are lot of furious people who are sick and tired of being pestered by 
marketers," Jacobson says, adding: "This is not a scientific study, but I think 
people perceive the main offenders as being banks and newspapers."  
</P>
<P>
 Suits can be filed in many state courts, most easily in small claims courts by 
filling out a standard, one-page form. 
</P>
<P>
 Most small claims courts are part of the municipal courts listed under county 
government sections in the front of telephone books, and court clerks can 
answer questions about procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 Determining who to name in the complaint was the difficult part of the case 
for Jacobson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Citibank is headquartered in New York and has a registered agent in 
Washington and has its credit-card operation in South Dakota," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lawyer who represented me on a pro bono basis made the calls to figure 
out who should be served with the papers." 
</P>
<P>
 (In small claims courts, parties are allowed to consult with lawyers outside 
court, but attorneys are not allowed to represent them during hearings.) 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, the filing fee is $15 and the maximum award is $5,000. The 
average wait for a case to be heard here is 40 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers may also take steps without resorting to the legal system. 
</P>
<P>
 For $20, call recipients may join Private Citizen in Naperville, Ill. This 
consumer group tells 1,200 telemarketers across the country that its 2,600 
customers don't want to be called. Telemarketers may subscribe to the list at 
no cost.  
</P>
<P>
 The Direct Marketing Assn. of Farmingdale, N.Y., also provides a list of 
consumers who want to be left alone. The trade group charges no fee for its 
Telephone Preference Service and doesn't say how many telemarketers order its 
list. Only 82 telemarketers were subscribers in 1991, according to testimony at 
congressional hearings on the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Buchan of Troy, Ohio, has designed a call-screening device to warn off 
commercial callers. The machine answers the phone with a message warning all 
callers that telemarketing calls are not accepted and asks the commercial 
caller to place you on the do-not-call list.  
</P>
<P>
 The message also gives a touch-tone number that family members and friends may 
use to ring through during the message. Telemarketers who hear the message and 
ring through are already in violation of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices for the machine from Buchan's Prefone Filter Co. range from the 
JunkBuster at $89 to the Filter Deluxe at $149. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the Telephone Consumer Protection Act won't be a panacea. Warnings 
to telemarketers remain in effect only for a year, so marketers can call again 
12 months later. And critics add that lawsuits will be rare. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in general are reluctant to use that as a remedy," USC marketing 
professor David Stewart says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just going and filing, in and of itself, is probably more time than most 
people want to spend on the types of issues that they might want redress on." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's expensive to sue," says Herschel Elkins, head of the consumer law 
section for the California attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "The remedies are not that clear and the companies that are the worst won't be 
around for you to bring action. The most troublesome telemarketers are calling 
from out of state." 
</P>
<P>
 The future may solve the problem, Stewart says. Most consumers don't object to 
calls in general, but to the calls on items that don't interest them. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart anticipates that the United States may adopt a system similar to 
Minitel in France, which allows shoppers to pursue items they want. 
</P>
<P>
 "Minitel is not unlike CompuServe and Prodigy, the on-line computer services, 
except it's through the telephone company," Stewart says. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are about 15,000 products and services available at your finger tips. 
Rather than have a lot of calls coming in, customers seek the products and 
services they want. 
</P>
<P>
 "My prediction is that's the way we're headed in this country. Firms will put 
out large menus in some format, whether it's telephone access, interactive 
computer systems or interactive television," Stewart says. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this country, it looks like it will be interactive TV like the home 
shopping networks, but that remains to be seen."

INSIDE LINE: CHEATING IS COMMON 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 According to the 24th annual survey of high achievers conducted by Who's Who 
Among American High School Students, 80% of the teens interviewed said cheating 
is common in their school. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventy-eight percent of about 500 teens interviewed added that they 
themselves have cheated. The most common form of cheating, according to the 
survey, is copying someone else's homework. Of the teens interviewed, all of 
whom are considered high achievers, 67% admitted to copying homework; 14% 
admitted to plagiarizing part of an essay. 
</P>
<P>
 A reason teens cheat, according to the survey, is self-imposed pressure and 
pressure from parents to do well in school.

 The Parent, Teacher, Student Assn. at Esperanza High School in Anaheim says it 
is alarmed at the growing number of alcohol and drug-related parties that 
students apparently are attending at homes in Yorba Linda, Placentia and 
northeast Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the PTSA has passed a resolution urging local law enforcement 
agencies to make it a policy to notify homeowners when police become aware that 
a party involving alcohol and minors has occurred in the home. The group is 
also urging all parents to take a zero tolerance stand against alcohol or drug 
use by Esperanza students and has called on all local merchants who sell 
alcoholic beverages to demand proof of age to reduce the potential for purchase 
by minors.

MOTHER CAN RELATE TO GAY TEEN'S CONFUSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was very moved by the article you ran ("Growing Up Gay," Jan. 6) regarding a 
homosexual high school student. This young man is making a courageous effort to 
struggle with his emotions by himself. I can understand what he is going 
through because my son had the same experience.  
</P>
<P>
 During his high school years we knew he was having problems, but no matter how 
hard we tried to get things resolved he would not communicate with us. 
</P>
<P>
 When he asked for psychological consultations we went along with the idea, 
hoping that this would straighten out his problem. 
</P>
<P>
 I would take him for his appointments, but my son insisted that I not consult 
with his psychologist or ask him any questions. It was very hard to go along 
with his request because as a parent I wanted to know what was going on. But at 
the same time I had to respect his wishes. 
</P>
<P>
 After a few visits, he decided he no longer wanted to see his psychologist. 
However, I could sense that his problems had not been resolved and I felt that 
when he was ready he would discuss things with me. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back, perhaps I should have pursued him further to answer my 
questions. But at the same time we had another son one year younger and two 
very small children to keep me busy. In a way, I feel that I let my son down by 
not trying harder to help him with his particular problem, but at the same time 
feel that he was not ready to let me into his world. 
</P>
<P>
 He soon graduated high school and was accepted to our state university -- two 
hours away from home. With him being away from home his problems went with him, 
and I hoped he had "outgrown" them. 
</P>
<P>
 He had been in dramatics in high school and decided to take dramatics in 
college. Therefore, we were not surprised to see all sorts of makeup in his 
apartment. We never questioned him regarding this. We soon started meeting my 
son's closest friends. 
</P>
<P>
 If occurred to me that my son might be having homosexual tendencies, but I 
would immediately dismiss the thoughts. I would not allow myself to think of 
this because of my religious background. I attended Catholic schools and was 
brought up as a very strict Catholic. I could not think that my son might be 
gay. 
</P>
<P>
 During my son's second year of college I received a call from my eldest 
daughter. She was married and had always been very close to my sons. She asked 
me if I had noticed the kind of friends my son had and if I had any opinion of 
them. I told her that they seemed like homosexuals to me and I couldn't help 
wondering why my son chose them. 
</P>
<P>
 She then asked me if I had wondered if my son might be homosexual. At this 
point I felt insulted and asked her if she was trying to tell me something. She 
said that yes, she and my son felt that it was time I knew that he was gay. 
</P>
<P>
 My initial reaction was no, no this cannot be true. We did everything right. 
We could not have failed as parents. During the next few days everything fell 
into perspective. I understood his struggles during high school and felt so bad 
that he had to go through that struggle trying to understand himself, society 
and how we would react. 
</P>
<P>
 I knew that many parents disown their children when they find out that they 
are homosexuals. But I cannot understand why. They are still your children. 
They are still human beings capable of loving, feeling emotions and functioning 
as adults! 
</P>
<P>
 How can anyone consider a homosexual less a person because of their sexual 
orientation. I knew that I did not love my son less because he was homosexual. 
Although I do not like it and wish things were different -- especially for his 
sake -- we have to accept him for who he is -- our son. 
</P>
<P>
 I have met a lot of homosexuals because of my son and have found them -- male 
and female -- bright, articulate and sensitive people.  
</P>
<P>
 It's sad that society cannot accept that these people exist. Why do we have to 
be so judgmental and insist that "straight" is the only way to live? 
</P>
<P>
 We as humans have to learn to accept each other regardless of race, religion 
or sexual orientation. 
</P>

<P>
 Thank you for your sensitive article on "Growing Up Gay." Hopefully, the 
continued existence of the Student Alliance will encourage the kind of 
intelligent discussion necessary on the issue of homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unfortunate that Robert, Steve and Mat in their response titled "Moral 
Outrage" feel so threatened by the Student Alliance they find it necessary to 
start a Future Good Boys of America club, a venture which will be unsuccessful 
because the Equal Access Act does not permit the establishment of clubs that 
foster prejudice and discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps education, a healthy respect for the dignity of others and a better 
understanding of the constitutional right to free association will help the 
Future Good Boys to grow up and become Good Men.

 SOUTH EL MONTE: Mayor Raul Pardo has dismissed as a lie an anonymous mailer 
sent to residents that accused the city of backing a plan for a card club. 
Pardo said the mailer falsely accused the City Council of approving a card club 
and offering a $16-million loan to help build it. Council members said they had 
never considered such a project and voters would have to decide if it did.

CITY HALL; SOUTH EL MONTE; NAME CHANGE PROPOSED FOR CITY

 How can you raise property values instantly in the midst of a recession? 
</P>
<P>
 A simple name change ought to do it, some council members believe. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Art Olmos came up with the idea of changing South El Monte's name 
to Santa Anita or Potrero Grande. Such a change would send property values up, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Anita is the name of the city's main thoroughfare, and the Potrero 
family originally settled the area. 
</P>
<P>
 South El Monte officials are quick to emphasize that their city, a mixture of 
well-kept houses, run-down neighborhoods and light industry, is different from 
El Monte, with a much lower crime rate. South El Monte was incorporated in 1958 
and has about 22,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Among South El Monte council members, only Vera Valdiviez opposed the name 
change outright at last week's meeting. But the 30 or so long-time residents 
who showed up at the meeting opposed the change. 
</P>
<P>
 After listening to residents express their opposition, council members opted 
for a series of public hearings rather than a ballot measure on the name-change 
idea. The hearing dates have not been set.

CALL MADE TO REALLOCATE 710 EXTENSION FUNDS FOR RETROFITTING; SAFETY: A STATE 
SENATOR SAYS CALTRANS SHOULD MAKE REINFORCING ALREADY EXISTING FREEWAYS ITS TOP 
PRIORITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD WINTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A state senator is trying to use the money allocated for the long-argued Long 
Beach Freeway (710) extension to retrofit existing freeways for earthquake 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic Sen. Nicholas C. Petris represents the part of Oakland where the 
1989 Loma Prieta earthquake caused the Nimitz Freeway to collapse and kill 43 
people. On Tuesday, he said Caltrans should set a higher priority on finishing 
the $1.5-billion program to reinforce or retrofit key roadways, and should 
redistribute the funds to get it done. 
</P>
<P>
 "The approximate $1 billion, of which 80% is federal, allocated for the 710 
Long Beach Freeway construction project through Pasadena should be reassigned 
to this effort," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6.2-mile freeway extension would run north-south through Pasadena, South 
Pasadena, Alhambra and parts of Los Angeles. But Petris said he will ask U.S. 
Secretary of Transportation Federico Pena to reassign federal dollars for the 
extension to the reinforcement program, focusing on the freeways destroyed or 
damaged this week. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Petris said he will ask Sen. Quentin Kopp (D-San Francisco), 
chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee, to make the retrofit program 
Caltrans' priority. 
</P>
<P>
 "There needs to be an unprecedented reorganization of priorities by the 
Department of Transportation to reallocate all of its funds and manpower," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's quake damaged six freeways. Hardest hit were the Santa Monica Freeway 
(10), where the elevated roadway buckled near La Cienega Boulevard, and the 
Antelope Valley Freeway (California 14), where an overpass of the Golden State 
Freeway (5) collapsed. It is expected to take about a year to rebuild them. 
</P>
<P>
 Both were scheduled for retrofitting under the Caltrans program, Santa 
Monica's segment this spring. Caltrans officials say they had retrofitted the 
state's high-risk overpasses and were moving on to the medium-risk ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, if we have more money we could progress at a lot faster pace," 
Wilfred Iwan, head of the California Seismic Safety Commission, told the Times 
on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of extending the 710 endorse the idea of investing the freeway's 
funds in upgrade the existing freeway system. "There are literally hundreds of 
bridges and overpasses that need upgrading throughout the state. Nine of them 
pass over the Pasadena Freeway (110)," said Kenneth C. Farfsing, South 
Pasadena's city manager.  
</P>
<P>
 If the state takes care of the retrofitting work that needs to be done, 
Farfsing said, "the Long Beach Freeway won't be built until 2035." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from Alhambra, who support the freeway extension, say that because 
money for the 710 project is earmarked for future years, it doesn't really 
exist now and cannot help a short-term retrofitting program.

 "Concern about retrofitting freeways is nothing new. . . . Alhambra supports 
these programs but it also supports the 710 Freeway," said City Manager Julio 
Fuentes. 
</P>
<P>
 "New freeways are just as important," he said. "If it wasn't for the (recently 
opened) Century Freeway (105), there wouldn't be an alternative to the Santa 
Monica Freeway."

SIERRA MADRE SHOWS IT LEARNED FROM EXPERIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some of the most confident people who rode out Monday's earthquake could be 
found in Sierra Madre, where a disastrous 1991 temblor led to a widespread 
retrofitting movement. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, 1991, the 5.8-magnitude Sierra Madre earthquake damaged more than 400 
structures in that city alone, and 22 houses were eventually razed. While some 
structures still sit condemned, many residents finished rebuilding as recently 
as several months ago, and a host of businesses just completed seismic 
strengthening. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, this week's quake left its imprint among Sierra Madre residents, if 
only psychologically. The temblor brought back some of the 1991 terror for 
Gretchen and Don Kelly, but they had consoling thoughts as they clung to each 
other and waited for the violent rocking to end. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1991 earthquake ripped open their home of 25 years on South Sunnyside 
Avenue, sending their chimney flying across the living room into Don's favorite 
chair and cracking the outer walls. They rebuilt from the ground up with 
seismic safety in mind, exceeding code requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Kelly supervised the construction, relying heavily on a book called "Peace 
of Mind in Earthquake Country." After two years of rebuilding, the couple moved 
into their fortified home last summer. They completed their landscaping in 
early December.  
</P>
<P>
 "We built this one hell for stout," Kelly said. "We have gone over it very 
carefully, and there's one tiny six-inch crack over a doorway, and no broken 
dishes. We are very pleased." 
</P>
<P>
 Fear is a bit harder to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is difficult emotionally. It sort of plunges you back into the nightmare," 
said Gretchen Kelly. "We put in extra money to make it an earthquake-proof 
house, but I was still scared to go downstairs." 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's earthquake did little more than cosmetic damage in Sierra Madre, 
sending more than 100 bottles crashing to the ground in a liquor store, 
loosening tiles, and popping nails out of Sheetrock. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1991 quake spread its wrath over a string of West San Gabriel Valley 
cities, doing more than $50 million in damage, and killing a San Dimas woman at 
Santa Anita Racetrack. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sierra Madre, signs of the damage persist: A graceful Spanish-style home 
sits ringed by chain-link fencing, its front door boarded up and windows 
shattered. Huge cracks scar its face. To the south, a pretty pink and blue 
Victorian house is finally home again to its owners after recovery from 
earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 And at the Sierra Madre Congregational Church, Minister of Administration 
Kenneth Cromeenes breathed a sigh of relief Monday to find only cosmetic cracks 
and slight damage to the round stained-glass windows in the sanctuary. In 1991, 
before the church had completed $300,000 worth of rebuilding and retrofitting, 
the bell tower collapsed along with a wall. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has attempted to enforce state-mandated retrofitting requirements for 
businesses, but some have been slow in completing the costly work. The deadline 
was extended from July to December and then again to Jan. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's earthquake "kind of emphasizes the importance of getting 
(retrofitting) done," said Councilman George Maurer, who manages The Only Place 
in Town restaurant, which finished retrofitting just a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Vito Corazzelli, who owns K.C.'s Closet on Baldwin Avenue, finished 
retrofitting a week before Christmas. In 1991, the antique and secondhand 
clothing store suffered cracked walls. This time, it came through with just a 
few broken items. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Munn, 67, whose house lost its back room in 1991, said his wife, Gloria, 
found Monday morning a little hard to take. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since the Sierra Madre earthquake, she's a lot more jumpy about things that 
shake."

NO MAJOR DAMAGE, BUT QUAKE DEFINITELY LEFT ITS MARK; AFTERMATH: ABOUT 120 
PASADENA RESIDENTS ARE FORCED FROM THEIR APARTMENT COMPLEX. ONE HEART ATTACK 
DEATH IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE TEMBLOR. 
</P>

<P>
 The San Gabriel Valley rode out Monday's 6.6-magnitude earthquake with one 
death attributed to the temblor and no major damage to buildings, water mains 
or power lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The valley was spared severe damage because the earthquake's ground motion 
moved primarily north-south rather than east-west, said Caltech spokeswoman 
Heather Lovasz. The earthquake faults believed to be involved generally run 
north-south. 
</P>
<P>
 An 84-year-old Monterey Park man suffered a heart attack and died shortly 
after the quake struck at 4:31 a.m., Police Lt. Maynard Merkt said. The man's 
name was not released. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, falling bricks forced about 120 residents from their Pasadena 
apartment complex into Red Cross shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena building inspectors condemned the apartments at Villa Street and 
Marengo Avenue early Monday after bricks from the top stories tumbled into the 
parking area bordering the three buildings, City Councilman Bill Crowfoot said. 
The councilman spent Monday morning translating directions to the Red Cross 
shelter in Victory Park to the mostly Spanish-speaking residents of the 
apartments. They were not expected to be allowed back in the building until 
late this week at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
 The effects of the quake were visible as residents carted off their belongings 
in garbage bags and babies cried in their mothers' arms. Resident Carmen Dill, 
24, a nurse, said she and her husband were going to stay with her parents in 
Altadena. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people are being uprooted, it's very traumatic. Many don't speak 
English, and they're definitely going to need some counseling to get through 
this," said Health Department program coordinator Joe Huerta as he helped 
Crowfoot translate. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-one residents without relatives in the area spent the night at a second 
shelter set up at the Jackie Robinson Center after a free El Pollo Loco dinner 
at Victory Park, said Deane Winant of the Red Cross. An additional 20 people 
arrived at the shelter from Altadena and the Northridge area. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of additional buildings in the valley's 29 other cities will also 
require repair. Almost all police departments reported numerous calls for help 
in dealing with shattered windows and fallen brick facades caused by the quake 
and its aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Roughly 40 buildings were damaged in Pasadena, 18 of them in the Old Town 
area. Some businesses also suffered merchandise loss. For instance, about 
$3,000 worth of damage was reported at the Crate and Barrel store in Old 
Pasadena after the shaking toppled glass merchandise from shelves, and owners 
of the Dodsworth bar estimated broken liquor bottles would cost them thousands 
of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Gabriel Mission, newly reopened after undergoing $1.2 million in 
repairs from the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake, survived the latest temblor 
intact, but tremors shifted its tower about an inch and damaged its museum, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena's Colorado Bridge, also recently reopened after seismic retrofitting, 
weathered the shaking with no problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Broken water mains were reported in South Pasadena and Monterey Park, among 
other cities, but officials said the water supply for the Valley remains pure 
and all tap water is safe and drinkable. An estimated $10,000 worth of water 
damage was reported at The Plaza in West Covina when some 50 gallons of water 
sprayed out of a broken sprinkler head and damaged four stores, mall officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of brief power failures caused lights to go out all over the valley 
in the wake of the quake, but electricity was quickly restored, according to 
Southern California Edison. El Monte suffered an hourlong blackout, and power 
was cut off to parts of Temple City, Azusa and Arcadia as well. Downed power 
lines at a Vons grocery store at 10150 Lower Azusa Road in El Monte burned two 
unoccupied cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The brief outages also caused many traffic signals to start blinking red 
valleywide, and a security guard was trapped in an elevator for about 90 
minutes at Alhambra Hospital, said hospital security supervisor Scott Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Officer Rudy Patron) got stuck between the third and fourth floors right 
after it hit," said Johnson, who cracked jokes to Patron over a walkie-talkie 
while engineers and firefighters slowly lowered the car into the basement and 
pried open the doors. 
</P>
<P>
 Patron, 44, is a Vietnam veteran who said he's been through much worse than 
being trapped in an elevator. "But right now, I'm taking the stairs," he added 
with a laugh. "I've had enough of elevators for a couple of days." 
</P>
<P>
 Other hospitals across the valley reported mostly minor injuries due to the 
shaking. "We've only gotten cuts and scrapes, which is great," said Steve 
Willis of Huntington Memorial Hospital. Dozens of nurses, doctors, police and 
firefighters from San Gabriel also traveled to San Fernando to aid quake 
victims, and Huntington has taken in babies needing intensive care from 
hospitals in the Northridge area. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Person, Pasadena's assistant to the city manager, said the city hopes 
to have the 41 apartment residents who have no place to stay relocated to new 
apartments by Friday. After an Earthquake 
</P>
<P>
 There's little doubt about it: Feeling the ground move can grip us in fear the 
way little else can. 
</P>
<P>
 The psychiatric and social services staffs at Las Encinas Hospital in Pasadena 
offer the following advice for the worry that may come in the weeks that 
follow: 
</P>
<P>
 * Find a way to seize some control. For example, pick up items that shook 
loose during the quake as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 * Develop and practice a family disaster preparedness plan. Every family 
member should participate. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep up with the news. Staying informed is critical. 
</P>
<P>
 * Discuss your feelings with family, friends or other helpful people. 
</P>
<P>
 * Slow down and think about your actions. Do not overreact; panic is 
contagious. 
</P>
<P>
 When dealing with children:  
</P>
<P>
 * Calmly explain the situation. Children take their cues from you. 
</P>
<P>
 * Include your children in developing a plan to deal with the aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Encourage your children to discuss their feelings. Listen to their fears and 
do not try to make light of them. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep your children occupied by playing or talking with them. They need you 
for comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 * Do not hide your feelings. Let them know how you feel. 
</P>
<P>
 Las Encinas Hospital is sponsoring a free counseling hotline for people 
suffering from post-quake anxiety: (800) 4-HELP-44.

TRANSPORTATION; MORNING TRAIN WHISTLES INTO PASADENA HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The dependable whistle heralding the arrival of early morning trains in 
Pasadena popped 68-year-old Moses Moreno's eyes open for the last time Friday. 
And it was 40 minutes late. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno joined nearly 400 people who watched Amtrak No. 3 from Chicago squeal 
to a halt in front of the Santa Fe station on North Raymond Avenue for the 
final time, marking the end of 108 years of transcontinental passenger rail 
service in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 "I live five blocks from here, and every morning when I was in bed, before I 
would get up, I would hear that whistle," said Moreno, who retired from his job 
as a foreman at Kern Foods nine years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno said he will miss his Amtrak alarm clock, but he is looking forward to 
riding the Blue Line, the $841-million light rail system designed to link the 
city with Los Angeles by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Fe station will become a transit center incorporating a Blue Line 
stop and shuttle service to airports and local hotels, Pasadena Mayor Rick Cole 
told the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 The new transit center will be one of six Blue Line stations along the 
13.6-mile route between Pasadena and Union Station in Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The last Amtrak train rolled into Pasadena just before 8 a.m., about 40 
minutes behind schedule because of a storm in the Midwest. City dignitaries and 
about 70 railroad buffs who had bought $6 tickets boarded the train for the 
historic last leg of its trip to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining crowd yelled a final "All Aboard!" as the train edged forward. 
Then, about 20 people swarmed over the rails to pick up souvenirs -- the 
now-flattened coins they had placed on the tracks in the moments before the 
train arrived.

EDUCATION; HOMELESS YOUTHS OFFERED SOME REAL STREET SMARTS

 A Cal Poly Pomona mobile education center will visit Pomona this month, 
offering free services aimed at enrolling homeless children in school. 
</P>
<P>
 The education van will include a bilingual tutor, and parents may get help 
filling enrollment forms.A therapist will provide counseling, and referrals 
will be made for immunizations, physicals and other services for children. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Poly organizers do not have statistics on the number of homeless children 
in Pomona, nor on how many are not enrolled in school. But directors at 
homeless shelters report that the number of children on the streets is rising, 
said Nancy Harkey, a Cal Poly professor of behavioral science who is organizing 
the mobile center. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so erratic. They're in school for a little while, and then they're out," 
Harkey said. Children do not need a permanent address to enroll in Pomona 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, homeless families are so preoccupied with day-to-day survival that they 
neglect their children's education, said Shirley Abrams, an administrator for 
the county Office of Education, which is providing funds for Cal Poly's 
education van through a federal grant. 
</P>
<P>
 The tutor will help younger children reach their appropriate grade level, and 
older ones do independent study programs and prepare for high school 
equivalency examinations. 
</P>
<P>
 The van will be at First Lutheran Church in Pomona on Wednesdays from 1 to 5 
p.m. and Thursdays from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., starting Jan. 26. Appointments are 
not necessary.

BUSINESS; 2 MORE MALLS BAN SMOKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying they are reacting to strong public sentiment against smoking indoors, 
managers of the Plaza at West Covina and Eastland Shopping Center, also in West 
Covina, began a ban Friday on smoking in their malls. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, many Southland shopping centers, including Plaza competitors 
Montclair Plaza and Brea Mall, adopted no-smoking policies for all indoor 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our No. 1 complaint: that there's so much smoke in the mall," said 
Tracey Gotsis, marketing director of the Plaza, which is owned by St. 
Louis-based CenterMark Properties, which also owns Eastland. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Anita Fashion Park and Plaza Pasadena already ban smoking.

BUSINESS; QUAKE A BOON TO VENDORS OF SAFETY DEVICES

 Until this week's wake-up call, business had been horribly slow for Steve 
Sanders, an Arcadia entrepreneur who prepares homes for earthquakes by 
anchoring everything from figurines to furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until (Tuesday) I'd done two houses in the last eight months," said Sanders, 
who also works as a special-effects technician for television and film. 
</P>
<P>
 He started his home-based earthquake preparedness business, called Quakeprep, 
shortly after finishing work on a 1990 NBC miniseries called "The Big One: The 
Great Los Angeles Earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 "Some have tried to take this line of business large-scale, but I think 
they've all gone bankrupt because in this state people only get concerned about 
earthquakes right after they happen," Sanders said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Monday's quake, his business phone has been ringing again as anxiety 
reigns over disaster preparedness. Business hasn't been this good for Sanders 
since the 1991 Sierra Madre quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The phones also have been ringing nonstop at the Pasadena office of one of 
Sanders' suppliers, Q-Safety, which manufactures and sells fastening devices to 
anchor household and workplace furniture and computer equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had more reports of televisions falling over in homes than anything 
else," said owner Tom Rundberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Q-Safety caters mainly to the needs of corporations, providing equipment and 
service to secure costly computer equipment and file cabinets. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers from one of Rundberg's local customers, the Department of Water and 
Power, were buying more fasteners Tuesday morning to secure equipment purchased 
after Rundberg completed anchoring the department's computer equipment and 
other valuables in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Another customer, Marty Motia, disaster preparedness chairwoman of the 
Paradise Canyon Elementary School in La Canada Flintridge, was buying straps 
Tuesday to hold down a dozen computers the school recently purchased. 
</P>
<P>
 During the quake, Motia said, four of the new computers were knocked off a 
table and damaged. Other computers at the school had been secured with Q-Safety 
fasteners, some of which employ Velcro straps. School administrators had told 
Motia to delay buying straps for the new ones because security locks had been 
ordered for them.

BUSINESS; WAL-MART PLANS INDUSTRY STORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wal-Mart has committed to building another of its huge discount stores in the 
San Gabriel Valley, this time in City of Industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The City of Industry redevelopment agency and Wal-Mart signed a development 
agreement this month that calls for the agency to buy an 11-acre site for about 
$7.5 million and resell it to Wal-Mart for about $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are willing to make the $2.5-million "land write-down" in order 
to entice the retail giant to locate on a lot at the southwest corner of Azusa 
and Gale avenues, just north of the Pomona Freeway (60).

counts of lewd conduct with a child. Paul Lynn Loe, 46, who entered the plea 
Jan. 13 in Citrus Municipal Court, faces a possible 20-year prison term when he 
is formally sentenced Jan. 27 in Pomona Superior Court. He was arrested Dec. 31 
after the photos of Loe and the child were found in a Whittier garbage bin. As 
part of a plea bargain with the district attorney's office, two other lewd 
conduct counts and five counts of child pornography were dropped.

POLICE BLOTTER; SLAIN WOMAN POSSIBLE 4TH SERIAL KILLER VICTIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A slain woman whose body was found in an Ontario park last week has been 
linked to the unsolved killings since November of three black female 
prostitutes in the East San Gabriel Valley, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth victim, Deborah Denise Brown, 33, of Los Angeles, was found 
strangled at 5 a.m. Jan. 12 in San Antonio Park. She was lying fully clothed in 
a grassy area, Ontario police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although police would not confirm that the same killer is responsible for the 
deaths of all four women, the profile of Brown and her cause of death are 
consistent with the other homicides, said Ontario Police Det. Mike Macias. Like 
the other victims, Brown had a history of prostitution, court records show. 
</P>
<P>
 But Macias and investigators from other police agencies said Brown's death 
differed slightly from that of the other three victims. They declined to reveal 
those differences. 
</P>
<P>
 The other victims were Helen Hill, 36, of Covina, found Nov. 14 in a parking 
lot in a City of Industry business park; Donna Goldsmith, 35, of Montclair, 
found Nov. 17 next to a trash bin in a Pomona business park, and Cheryl Denise 
Sayers, 34, of Ontario, found Dec. 30 in Ganesha Park in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 All three women had minor criminal histories, police said. All were strangled. 
</P>
<P>
 The similarity in Brown's death was established after Ontario detectives met 
with investigators from the Pomona and Chino police departments, as well as the 
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. Each department is conducting its own 
investigation but will continue to network on the cases, Macias said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the four women, police are still investigating two other deaths 
for possible links. On Nov. 1, Betty Harris, 37, of Pomona, was found dead in a 
business park in Diamond Bar. On Nov. 5, Roxanne Bates, 31, of Pomona, was 
found dead on a rural road in Chino.

IRWINDALE'S FAMILY VALUES; THE CITY'S CLOSE-KNIT RESIDENTS HAVE CARVED OUT A 
BIT OF PARADISE AMID THE ROCK QUARRIES -- AND THEY'RE KEEPING IT TO THEMSELVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cities across the San Gabriel Valley gutted recreation programs last year and 
slapped taxes and fees on everything from utilities to dog tags. But Irwindale 
expanded its library hours and started tutoring kids for free. 
</P>
<P>
 Demographic change is sweeping through Southern California and rising crime 
tops a litany of modern Angst in suburbia. But Irwindale, a quarry-pocked 
working-class city of about 1,050, grew by only 20 people in the 1980s -- and 
most of them were related to the families whose Mexican ancestors put down 
roots there at the turn of the century. There is no local gang; home burglaries 
tallied a modest eight last year; there were no rapes; and the city logged only 
two murders, neither of them involving residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven years after the city suffered a costly embarrassment in its failed bid 
to lure the Raiders, Irwindale finds it can hold its head higher than ever, 
especially compared with its neighbors. And in the case of its senior citizens, 
those heads are barbered or coiffed at city expense. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're surrounded by big towns and corporations that want to eat us alive. 
People are envious of what we have. But we've built this place -- with our 
hearts and souls," said Dolores (Peaches) Barbosa, 37, who moved away from 
Irwindale for a decade before coming home to the comfort of family five years 
ago. "There's poor people here and they're in paradise." 
</P>
<P>
 The national media mocked the city as naive after the sour Raiders deal 
emptied once-bulging coffers of more than $20 million; and as long ago as 1961, 
only four years after incorporation, a local press account snidely dubbed the 
city "a study in dust and dejection . . . as attractive as a goiter." 
</P>
<P>
 But since the Raiders fiasco, the luster in better-groomed Southern California 
cities has faded in the face of increasing crime and a long-suffering economy. 
And Irwindale finds itself looking pretty good. 
</P>
<P>
 What other city offers all its residents medical prescriptions for $3, plus 
vision care and free trips for the kids to Disneyland? Students are driven to 
outlying school districts in city buses, and tuition for college is as easy as 
filling out a request and handing it over to the Chamber of Commerce. Senior 
citizens' benefits kick in at the spry age of 50 and include free piano lessons 
and barbering. And the city will fork over a $5,000 grant to any homeowners who 
need to bring their houses up to code. And come Christmas, every child gets a 
stocking stuffed with goodies. 
</P>
<P>
 So how do you get in? It's almost impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While for-sale signs dot front lawns in other cities, Irwindale residents 
recall seeing only two over the past three years. Nearby realtors don't 
remember any. Even the most run-down cottages are coveted as tickets to 
privilege: When they are sold or rented out, more often than not they are 
passed on to relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The median family income in 1989 was only $29,900, the third-lowest in the 
Valley, higher only than El Monte and South El Monte. But a dollar goes further 
in Irwindale. Garbage pickup is free, and residents are exempt from the steep 
7.5% utility tax imposed on business. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Ortiz family home on the tiny cul-de-sac of Nora Avenue, a workman dabs 
finishing touches around a $5,000 window job that will finally keep the winter 
air from seeping through the cracks. The bill: to be paid by a city grant. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the corner at the city's recreation center, Rebecca Ortiz, 16, and 
sister Laura, 12, pile into a city bus with dozens of other Irwindale youths 
for a trip to Disney on Ice in Anaheim. Tickets are free for kids and half 
price for teens. And just two days earlier, their mother, 39-year-old Cheryl 
Ortiz, picked out a new pair of eyeglass frames -- billed to the vision plan 
the city offers all Irwindale residents. 
</P>
<P>
 If Barbosa's sister, recreation supervisor Veronica Lara, didn't use the 
city's prescription plan, the $65 injections she needs to alleviate recurring 
migraines would cost her between $150 and $300 a month. She pays $3 per shot. 
</P>
<P>
 City trips are half price for adults as well as teen-agers. Last month, a 
busload headed for the Bette Midler concert at the Universal Amphitheatre. The 
$50 tickets cost residents $25. And three weeks earlier, $10 got Irwindale 
residents prime seats to watch the L.A. Rams play the Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Ortiz thanks the new tutoring program, staffed with credentialed 
teachers who pull in $22 an hour, for upping her science grade from a D to a B. 
Held at the old City Council chambers next to the library, the program is open 
to all of Irwindale's school-age children. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And at the $2.5-million senior center, residents enjoy everything from 
ceramics to knitting, and can get beauty and health instruction free of charge. 
Ladies get their hair done every Friday, and the men's barber comes every two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 To most of those who live there, Irwindale is family -- intimate and 
inescapable -- and more than the redevelopment cash and industrial tax base 
that fattened city coffers, residents credit bloodlines for their town's 
stubborn survival. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's control. We have control of our own city, our own development, and who 
comes in," Barbosa said. "That's really what we base our lives on -- to keep 
that control -- because all we have is ourselves."  
</P>
<P>
 Although chronic political squabbling among the Irwindale families that have 
governed the city for decades drove Barbosa away, the constant specters of 
crime and homelessness in San Jose, and the lure of her own deep Irwindale 
roots, brought her home to the little town she both loves and hates. 
</P>
<P>
 Most families, including those who have dominated the five-member City Council 
for decades -- Barbosa, Miranda, Breceda and Diaz among them -- have claimed 
Irwindale as home since at least the beginning of this century. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Barbosa's grandparents settled here during the Mexican Revolution of the early 
20th Century. Her grandmother harvested citrus and walnuts in what was once a 
sea of orchards surrounding the dusty town. Her grandfather helped build the 
historic Presbyterian church on Irwindale Avenue with wheelbarrows full of 
rocks hauled from the San Gabriel River bed.  
</P>
<P>
 For 27 years, Barbosa's mother served as city clerk and treasurer, and her 
father served on the council. Now her brother, Councilman Frederick S. Barbosa, 
is taking his turn. 
</P>
<P>
 But Irwindale's roots go even deeper. Many residents trace their lineage to 
Gregorio Fraijo, one of the region's earliest Mexican settlers, and his wife, 
Francisca. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the research of James Vasquez, a University of Washington 
professor and Fraijo descendant who is documenting the family history, Gregorio 
Fraijo came to the Los Angeles area around 1848 from Sonora, Mexico, and in 
1871 purchased a piece of Rancho Azusa from English-born merchant Henry Dalton. 
That land now constitutes the residential hub of Irwindale -- dubbed 
"Sonoraville" at one time. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are thousands of descendants in the area," said Vasquez, who attends a 
Fraijo reunion in Irwindale every year. Last summer, 500 descendants gathered 
there and cast a heavy bronze plaque dedicated to Gregorio and Francisca Fraijo 
that will be mounted in City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The community forged by these families made history. After incorporation, 
local press accounts pointed to the Irwindale City Council as the only 
all-Latino council in the country. And the little rock church that still stands 
on Irwindale Avenue is the first Presbyterian church in California -- possibly 
the nation -- where Spanish is the primary language. 
</P>
<P>
 Irwindale, 86% Latino according to the 1990 U.S. Census, was a haven in a sea 
of hostility and demeaning glances. 
</P>
<P>
 "Covina looked down on everybody here. Oh, the prejudice was so strong," said 
61-year-old Mary Duarte, an Irwindale native whose maiden name is Diaz. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nellie Tapia, 68, whose grandmother was a Fraijo, recalls how neighboring 
cities jeered when the fledgling Irwindale Police Department became the first 
of the region's cities to get radar. 
</P>
<P>
 Irwindale closed ranks. Resident Carmen Gomez, 73, who as a child purchased 
water for five cents a bucket from the Fraijos, remembers years when whites and 
African-Americans began moving in. Most left, she recalled, because some 
long-timers "beat the hell out of them. They didn't want any other race here -- 
only Mexicans." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, residents cling to the stability the community offers. 
</P>
<P>
 Lara married a man who grew up two blocks behind her. She now lives in one of 
44 subsidized houses the city doled out by lottery to Irwindale residents or 
their relatives in 1988. She is surrounded on her block by the same people she 
played with as a child. Many of those three-bedroom houses were sold for only 
$55,000, complete with microwave ovens and garage-door openers. 
</P>
<P>
 Brenda Marin's grandfather came to Irwindale with his parents in 1900, when he 
was 3 years old, and eventually married a Fraijo, served on the first City 
Council and came to be known as "Mr. Irwindale." Marin's great-grandmother's 
house still stands intact with the pomegranate tree she planted there. Five 
generations of Marin's family have called the house home. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, she lives eight houses from where her grandparents lived for 62 years. 
The stability and the benefits have not been lost on her children, aged 12 and 
15. 
</P>
<P>
 "They fight over who gets the house when I die," Marin said laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 To an outsider's casual glance, Irwindale looks like it isn't worth fighting 
over: The city's nine-square-mile area is scarred by sand and gravel pits and 
dotted with industry. Houses line only about a dozen streets, most of them tiny 
cul-de-sacs within walking distance of City Hall, the park and recreation 
center. Many are decades-old run-down bungalows on land still zoned for farm 
animals. Their tiny yards are crammed with old cars and littered with 
children's toys. 
</P>
<P>
 From the ties that link these city blocks by blood or marriage comes 
Irwindale's credo of privilege, responsible for a wealth of small luxuries even 
at a time when most cities are grappling with fiscal crises. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really take care of our own. That's what Irwindale's all about," said 
Julian A. Miranda, 24, whose uncle, Councilman Patricio Miranda, served on the 
city's first Planning Commission and has sat on the council for decades. 
Another uncle sat on the council for years, and Julian's father, Julian S. 
Miranda, is the Irwindale police chief. 
</P>
<P>
 Non-residents, however, can enjoy some services: the tennis courts, the 
well-maintained park, the gym and the swimming pool, although they pay slightly 
more than residents do for use of the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 But other programs, including the gym's tiny weight room, are for residents 
only, as are trips and other programs paid for with city money. Outsiders have 
tried to cash in on Irwindale's riches, but in a town this small, it's hard to 
convince people you're a resident when they've never seen your face before. 
</P>
<P>
 While the city's wealth skyrocketed after it formed its redevelopment agency 
in 1976, Irwindale has long drawn on a hefty industrial tax base from a 
once-thriving sand and gravel industry, and resident perks are nothing new. As 
early as 1960, the local press was leering at Irwindale's just-completed 
recreation center, chiding its lavishness as "a veritable Taj Mahal." And 
yellowed newspaper photos show a smiling group of residents about to board a 
city bus with their fishing rods for a complimentary city field trip more than 
30 years ago.  
</P>
<P>
 Things only got better. The city incorporated with few more than 600 residents 
-- a number that has not even doubled in more than 36 years. The recreation 
department budget, however, has exploded, from about $5,000 in 1958-59, to 
$80,000 in 1960-61. The adopted recreation budget for 1993-94: $583,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Irwindale is immune from the economic woes plaguing most other 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The rock industry is not providing much sand and gravel to a depressed 
construction industry, and mining tax revenue is down, said City Manager David 
A. Caretto. So are sales tax revenues and business licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chamber of Commerce college scholarship fund, combined with another 
private fund started by former redevelopment consultant Fred Lyte, has for 
years doled out tuition and book money to any Irwindale resident with a C 
average or better. One woman got $40,000 to go to law school. But the chamber's 
fund has dwindled to $22,000. Depressed local businesses just aren't 
contributing, said chamber executive director Joe DiShanni. Over the past year, 
38 businesses packed up and left Irwindale, many of them for other states, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1987, city and redevelopment coffers had swelled to $35 million. Now, those 
reserves total about $8 million, said Irwindale Finance Director Abraham De 
Dios. This is about the same as the city's budget this year. General fund 
revenues are down $300,000 this year from 1992-93, Caretto added. 
</P>
<P>
 While library hours expanded in July, a Police Department position and park 
maintenance position remain unfilled, Caretto said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not as if we haven't tried to control or limit expenditures. But because 
of the small size of the population, we have been able to provide services that 
other cities just could never afford to provide," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Newcomers -- and there are few -- are grateful for the services they would 
never receive elsewhere, but some complain that they can never feel as much a 
part of the city as those who have claimed it for generations. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Ortizes have relatives in Irwindale, they have lived there for 
only three years, having purchased the house from friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's too many people that talk. On the street, you turn your back and 
they're there, talking about you," complained Teresa Ortiz, 12, Laura's twin.  
</P>
<P>
 Longtime residents concede the community can be painfully resistant to change, 
with some residents even opposing plans for 36 new subsidized low- and 
moderate-income houses. While the houses will almost certainly go to Irwindale 
residents and their families, as did the last batch, even that type of 
expansion could upset the fine balance of power in a town with only 659 
registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Come election time, the same predictable accusations of voting fraud fly: that 
families bring in nieces and nephews, who had long ago moved away, to cast 
their votes; that certain families are out to line their own pockets and find 
city jobs for their relatives. Brenda Marin remembers the time when her aunt 
tried to run over a councilman who had launched a recall drive against her 
grandfather -- one of many such campaigns to shake the city in its early years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here, one vote means everything. Because here people win or lose by one 
vote," said Peaches Barbosa. "It's an injustice, but people will lie to the 
ground. . . . 'Yes, so-and-so has been living here,' when you know damn well 
they've moved away." 
</P>
<P>
 And blood as much as substance often determines the way those votes are cast, 
with people committing their votes because "someone did their father a favor 45 
years ago," Barbosa said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the decades since incorporation, the same issues keep emerging with a 
virulent ferocity: Now, as in 1960 and again in the 1970s, Irwindale families 
are sounding a battle cry against a developer's plans to bring in a card club. 
</P>
<P>
 The family feuds go back for generations. Even two Fraijo branches -- 
descendants of Gregorio's son, Pablo, and descendants of his son, Bernardo -- 
have held separate reunions for years, although last summer they all came 
together, Vasquez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Privacy is hard to come by. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the kind of place where you go to the post office in your jammies," 
Marin said. "But everything has its down side. You have a fight with your 
husband and everybody knows about it." 
</P>
<P>
 When 24-year-old Julian Miranda won a council seat two years ago, he hoped 
residents would see in him a refreshing perspective. Many, he complains, see 
just another Miranda. Now, even Julian is toying with the idea of "taking off," 
maybe for Oregon or points beyond, although he said he would definitely come 
home to Irwindale to raise a family. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in the heat of a decades-old conflict, however, most Irwindale residents 
unite in times of tragedy.  
</P>
<P>
 Several years ago, Marin sued Councilman Pat Miranda for conflict of interest 
in a scandal that led to the firing of redevelopment consultant Lyte. The 
lawsuit drove an even deeper wedge between two families that have long sparred 
in the political arena. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the heat of the lawsuit, which was eventually resolved in an 
out-of-court settlement, a member of the Miranda family died in an accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Marin nor the Mirandas were surprised by what happened next. There she 
was, helping out after the funeral, side by side with the family she would face 
in court the very next day. Irwindale at a Glance

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After being phased out 22 years ago, motorcycle police returned to San 
Gabriel's city streets this month under a $375,000 grant from the National 
Highway Safety Program. 
</P>
<P>
 The two officers and a sergeant who began cruising city streets are part of an 
overall traffic safety program that includes educational lectures and sobriety 
checkpoints. The grant enabled the city to acquire a radar display trailer that 
flashes the speed of cars to motorists driving past and to obtain hand-held 
laser beam speed detectors to replace the older radar units. 
</P>
<P>
 Also under the grant, San Gabriel officers must increase the number of 
citations given motorists for hazardous driving, such as drunk driving or 
running red lights, Police Capt. Richard Arnold said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: ALTADENA; PSYCHOLOGIST SENTENCED FOR MOLESTING BOYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Altadena psychologist has been sentenced to five years in prison for 
molesting his foster son and another boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Mercer, a 44-year-old former foster parent and teacher of 
learning-disabled children, was described as a "Jekyll and Hyde" character by 
Pasadena Superior Court Judge Thomas W. Stoever, who handed down the sentence 
last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercer was convicted Dec. 22 of nine counts of oral copulation and lewd 
conduct with adolescent boys. 
</P>
<P>
 All the incidents occurred between 1990 and 1992. His two victims, who were 14 
and 15 in 1992, were his students at Marianne Frostig Center for Educational 
Therapy. The boys reported the molestation to a center official in June.

 "It's like pulling a carpet out from under it," said Sylvis, owner of Seismic 
Safety in Pasadena and co-founder of the Southern California Assn. of 
Residential Retrofit Professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a long way of saying people should bolt houses to their foundations so 
that the two stick together in a quake. And city inspectors say that while 
Monday's quake is fresh on your mind, you might want to think about doing just 
that if you have an older house. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have a building that is not secured, is not seismic safe, then you 
have trouble," said Roy Streeter, the building official for the city of 
Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
 Retrofitting usually involves bolting, then shoring up what are called cripple 
walls -- wooden outer walls that elevate your floor off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 The easiest way to know if your house might need retrofitting is to look 
underneath it. If you can't because there's solid concrete between your house 
and the ground or if you pull up your carpet and there's nothing but concrete 
underneath, then your house was built on a slab foundation and was very likely 
bolted down when it was built. If you have a crawl space, your house could be a 
retrofit candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Most city building inspectors will be glad to check your house for seismic 
safety, especially since retrofitting requires a building permit. According to 
staff structural engineer Fred Turner, of the state Seismic Safety Commission, 
the inspectors can also tell you whether it's a do-it-yourself project. 
</P>
<P>
 Before World War II, houses were often built so that they rested on their 
foundations with nothing but gravity to keep them there. When the ground starts 
shaking, gravity loses to other forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Retrofitters bolt the house onto a concrete foundation with 9-inch-by-9-inch 
steel plates all along the interior of the crawl space. They also add framing 
anchors every few inches. If the house is resting on cripple walls, they add 
plywood reinforcements. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of retrofitting is fairly minimal compared to most other home 
improvements. The work usually ranges between $1,800 to $5,000 for a 
conventional house. Houses with bad foundations, rock foundations or pier- and 
post-foundations can cost considerably more. 
</P>
<P>
 San Marino resident Lorraine Saunders spent $2,800 to bolt down her 1927 
two-story house, a job that was finished just last week. Even before Monday, 
she considered it a good investment. Now she thinks it was a great investment. 
As she rode out the earthquake in her bed, "I thought, we've done what we can. 
We've done the best we can." 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners need to be aware of unscrupulous or incompetent contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, what we do is in an area most people don't look," said Craig 
Boatman of Seismic Safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody can do it. The fact is some people just aren't set up (for it). It's 
always a good idea to use somebody who has some experience," said South 
Pasadena director of community development Bill Campbell. His job includes 
checking retrofitting plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Architect Elizabeth Meaves, associate director of Pasadena Heritage's 
preservation fund, also recommends using a seismic safety specialist, and said 
word of mouth or contacting your local historical society are the best ways to 
find one. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers should also call the Contractors State License Board information 
line (800) 321-2752 for the free booklet "What You Should Know Before You Hire 
a Contractor." 
</P>
<P>
 Will retrofitting hold through an earthquake of magnitude 8 on the Richter 
scale? Sylvis said yes, adding that if the house "went cartwheeling down the 
street," the foundation would still be attached. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Bill Liebman, owner of Cal-Seismics, another retrofitter, said, "What 
it will withstand, nobody can say. Once this system is in place, the next weak 
point in the chain is the materials in the house."

 St. Francis basketball Coach John Jordan suffered through some lean times a 
few years ago when the Golden Knights were struggling to stay competitive 
against other parochial schools. 
</P>
<P>
 That's hardly the case now. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Francis began the week ranked among the top 5 in the state in Division 
III. After beginning the season 1-3, the Golden Knights have won 13 of 14. They

<P>
 The Golden Knights are led by 6-11 center Chris Ott and 6-8 forward Braden 
Webber. St. Francis has won all of its league games by six points or fewer. 
</P>
<P>
 "They play very smart," Bishop Amat Coach Alex Acosta said of St. Francis. 
"They don't try to do anything they're not capable of. They walk the ball up 
the floor and power it inside to the big kids. And they win close games. That's 
the sign of a good team."

<P>
 Chick Hearn lives and dies with the Lakers, so I was concerned about his pulse 
as the NBA schedule approached the halfway mark. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been my most difficult season ever," said Hearn, who will broadcast 
his 2,647th consecutive Laker game tonight. "What makes it so tough is that you 
have to report it as it is." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 For sure, he has not sugarcoated the 25 losses that have more than doubled the 
11 victories. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "The chemistry doesn't seem to be right," he said. "There have been a minimum 
of seven games that they seemingly have had won, but let get away." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 He has not been easy on the players or their coach. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Randy Pfund has made mistakes," Hearn said. "He knows he has. But he's in a 
tough position. He really doesn't have the talent to achieve the kind of 
success he would like to. He's pretty well groomed for the job and, remember, 
Pat Riley wanted to take him along when he went to New York." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Many NBA scientists believe the lottery draft, in which the Lakers figure to 
participate for the first time, is the surest fix for floundering teams. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 However, Hearn says free-agent signings are more important. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "In the draft, you're getting someone who is unproven," he said. "It's very 
difficult to step in and make a difference right away. The Magics, Birds and 
Shaquilles are the exceptions." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this team needs a couple of veteran players who are class acts. 
They're out there. Knowing Jerry West and Jerry Buss, I think they'll get 
them." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Among potential free agents are forwards Horace Grant of the Chicago Bulls and 
Danny Manning of the Clippers. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Either would make Hearn's job easier next season. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Don't get me wrong," he said. "I still love the job. I love the league. 
They'll have to fire me to get me out of the booth." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 During his 34 seasons, some of the NBA's most famous players have worn the 
purple -- formerly known as Forum blue -- and gold. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Hearn's all-time Laker team: Magic Johnson and Jerry West at guards, Elgin 
Baylor and Jamaal Wilkes at forwards and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Wilt 
Chamberlain at center. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Sorry," he said, "but I can't separate Kareem and Wilt." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pity Jack McDowell, the unappreciated Cy Young Award winner, who will receive 
only $5.3 million next season if he loses his arbitration with the Chicago 
White Sox. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Kansas City Royals are planning to invite former Houston and Baltimore 
first baseman Glenn Davis to spring training. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball America rates USC fifth, Cal State Fullerton sixth and Pepperdine 
seventh. Georgia Tech is No. 1. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Marv Levy isn't getting enough credit for coaching the Buffalo Bills to their 
fourth consecutive AFC championship game appearance. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City might keep the Bills away from another Super Bowl, though, by 
blitzing and keeping the pressure on Jim Kelly, something the Raiders didn't 
do. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Raider band director Horace Heidt says that, along with "Hoss" in honor of 
Jeff Hostetler, his repertoire includes "Rocket Man" in honor of a certain wide 
receiver. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 How much will moving the Arizona State and Arizona games out of the Sports 
Arena this week hurt USC? The Trojans are 46-5 at the Arena since March of 
1990. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Z Boys: UCLA has received solid, aggressive center play from George Zidek and 
Rodney Zimmerman and will need more of the same against the Arizonas. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 America's Team: Arizona starters hail from New York (Khalid Reeves), Oregon 
(Damon Stoudamire), Texas (Joseph Blair) and California (Ray Owes and Reggie 
Geary). . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Spots are still available for the American Red Cross celebrity golf tournament 
Monday morning at Cypress in Los Alamitos. . . .

<P>
 San Fernando heavyweight Alex Garcia, trying to work himself back into 
contention after a disappointing 1993, opens the 10th year of boxing at the 
Irvine Marriott tonight against George O'Mara. . . .

 Trainer Charlie Whittingham, 80, has two Kentucky Derby prospects in his barn. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 Strodes Creek was so impressive winning his debut Saturday at Santa Anita that 
Whittingham immediately nominated him for the Triple Crown races. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Numerous, a $1.7-million yearling purchase, is expected to begin his 
3-year-old campaign next week. . . .  
</P>

 Not that it is any consolation for the Arkansas Razorbacks, but they were not

 The Bulldogs improved to 11-2 overall, and are 5-0 in the Southeastern 
Conference for the first time in more than three decades. Arkansas fell to 12-2

</P>
<P>
 Mississippi State made only two of five free throws in the closing minute, but

<P>
 Brian Price had 15 points and 15 rebounds and freshman Erick Dampier 15 points

Coast Conference, took sole possession of first place in the league. Kevin 
Salvadori led North Carolina (13-3, 3-2) with 16 points, but he failed to score 
in the final 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 10 Connecticut 79, Providence 78 -- Kevin Ollie dribbled the length of the 
court and made his only field goal of the game, a layup with 2.2 seconds to 
play, to lift the Huskies in a Big East game at Providence, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
 The Friars (9-4, 3-3) took a 78-77 lead on Michael Brown's sixth three-pointer 
with 8.8 seconds left.  
</P>
<P>
 Ollie then took Donyell Marshall's inbound pass down the left side and 
connected from the baseline for the winning basket.

</P>
<P>
 Tim Duncan had 18 points, 16 rebounds and six blocked shots for Wake Forest 
(12-4, 3-1). Georgia Tech is 10-5 and 1-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Marquette 60, No. 18 Alabama Birmingham 58 -- Jim McIlvaine scored 24 points, 
including two free throws with seven seconds to play to seal the Great Midwest 
victory at Birmingham, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
 Alabama Birmingham (13-2, 2-1) shot only 38%. Marquette improved to 10-4 and 
3-0.

ORANGE LEAGUE BOYS' BASKETBALL; VALENCIA STAYS COOL AFTER ICING SAVANNA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM Q. BERKSHIRE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After such an important victory, one would have expected the doors of the 
Valencia locker room to burst open with an excited gaggle of players pouring 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 Quite the contrary. The scene after the Tigers' 66-59 Orange League boys' 
basketball victory over Savanna Wednesday night at Valencia High was the 
picture of tranquillity. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't want to get too excited, even after a game like this," said 
Valencia Coach Dean Yoshimura. "Their goal from the beginning of the season has 
been to win this league, so they know this is just a step. They're keeping an 
even keel." 
</P>
<P>
 The game, which broke a tie in the league race, wasn't as balanced as 
Valencia's emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially for Savanna (9-9, 3-1). The Rebels' score by quarters: eight points 
in the first, 21 in the second, seven in the third and 23 in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Valencia (10-8, 4-0) was balanced, not scoring fewer than 13 or more than 19 
points a quarter, just enough to keep the Tigers a step or two out of the 
Rebels' reach. 
</P>
<P>
 But what eventually did in Savanna was Valencia's cool-headed shooting at the 
free throw line. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't fold," Yoshimura said. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . and they made their free throws," Savanna's Paul Waldrop interjected. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers made 30 of 37 free throws, including Max Zamora's 10 of 10 and Erik 
Jackley's nine of 12.  
</P>
<P>
 "Great free throws," Waldrop repeated as he left the gym. 
</P>
<P>
 Valencia led by as many as 13 points early in the second quarter, but Savanna 
went on a 12-5 spurt to pull to 34-29 at the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Having difficulty adjusting to a defense that switched from zone to man-to-man 
indiscriminately, the Rebels slipped again in the third and found themselves 
trailing, 47-36, going into the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-point play by Dan Avila, followed by a three-point basket by Jermaine 
Moore with 2:12 left pulled Savanna to within 55-52, but the Rebels kept 
fouling Valencia and the Tigers rarely missed. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackley and Phil Franklin scored 15 points each and Zamora added 13 for 
Valencia. Moore scored a game-high 18 points, including four three-pointers, 
and Avila contributed 17 for Savanna. 
</P>
<P>
 In other Orange League games: 
</P>
<P>
 Magnolia 45, Brea-Olinda 37 -- Brandon Hearvey scored 18 points and Frank 
Henderson added 16 for host Magnolia (13-6, 3-1). Magnolia led, 21-14, at the 
half and extended the lead to 34-19 going into the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Bodiford scored 11 points for Brea-Olinda (5-15, 1-3). 
</P>
<P>
 Western 78, Anaheim 50 -- Richard Mackey scored 28 points and Neil Hensley 
added 14 for host Western (10-9, 1-3). Chanta Iemsisanith led Anaheim (4-14, 
0-4) with 14 points.

EMPIRE LEAGUE BOYS' BASKETBALL; NO. 2 LOS ALAMITOS BLASTS NO. 10 ESPERANZA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If Esperanza is the best challenger the Empire League can muster for Los 
Alamitos, perhaps the Griffins' remaining league games will be merely tune-ups 
for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos, ranked second in Orange County, blasted No. 10 Esperanza, 69-41, 
in an Empire League boys' basketball game Wednesday at Los Alamitos High, and 
it wasn't even that close. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Lin had 15 points, including three three-pointers, and Brady Doyle added 
14 to lead Los Alamitos (16-3, 4-0 in league), which scored the first 12 points 
of the game and led by as many as 32 points in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza (12-7, 2-2) didn't score until Josh Greer made an 18-foot jumper, 
the Aztecs' lone basket of the first quarter, with 1 minute 58 seconds 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos' defense frustrated the Aztecs into 21 turnovers, while forcing 
them to shoot 17% (four of 23) from the field in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Ali Ton and Lin took turns hounding Esperanza's Mike Thimgan, who entered the 
game averaging 14 points, and their denial defense held Thimgan to three points 
and just five shots in the first half while the Griffins built a 36-14 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Thimgan didn't get his hands on the ball in the Esperanza offense until the 
first quarter was nearly halfway finished. 
</P>
<P>
 Offensively, Ton set the pace dishing out 10 assists to go with his seven 
points. Forward Ryan Staniec, who had 11 points and 12 rebounds, was one of 
Ton's many beneficiaries as the Griffins scored 40 of their 57 points in the 
paint during the first three quarters. Los Alamitos shot 51% (24 of 47) through 
three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ali set the pace on offense and we got a lot of good opportunities in 
transition," Los Alamitos Coach Steve Brooks said. "They executed well 
tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Thimgan had 11 points and 10 rebounds and Greer had eight points and four 
blocked shots to lead Esperanza. 
</P>
<P>
 In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
 Katella 50, Cypress 41 -- Nick Roditis scored 16 points for host Katella 
(11-6, 2-2). LaBryon Clayton added 13 and Mike Pahl 11 for the Knights. 
</P>
<P>
 Chad Boberg scored 19 points for Cypress (11-8, 2-2), which led, 15-9, at the 
end of the first quarter. Katella then outscored Cypress, 11-3, to take a 20-18 
lead at the half.  
</P>
<P>
 Katella, Esperanza and Cypress are tied for second, two games behind Los 
Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 El Dorado 63, Loara 49 -- Dante Spencer scored 22 points and Dustin Miller and 
Jeff Moore each added 12 to lead El Dorado (6-11, 1-3).  
</P>
<P>
 Scott Davis scored 19 points for Loara (11-8, 1-3), which started well, 
leading, 17-13, at the end of the first quarter. Ed Dorado then outscored 
Loara, 30-20, over the next two quarters.

CENTURY LEAGUE SOCCER; SANTA ANA VALLEY OVERWHELMS VILLA PARK WITH LATE FLURRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eighth-ranked Villa Park was already playing out of its element on a short 
field and before an unfriendly crowd. It didn't need to be playing a man short 
against fourth-ranked Santa Ana Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's what happened when the Spartans' Chris Miller was given a red-card 
ejection early in the second half. The Spartans (9-3-6, 2-1-1) hung tough for 
the next five minutes, but once Santa Ana Valley's Margarito Morales scored, 
the floodgates opened. By the time they were closed the host Falcons had a 
convincing 3-0 victory Wednesday in a Century League boys' soccer game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really opened up after that," Santa Ana Valley Coach Adnan Bayati said. "I 
knew it was going to come eventually, but I thought it would come sooner." 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons (11-1-4, 2-1-1) controlled play and had the momentum throughout 
the first half, but they did not break through until 17 minutes were gone in 
the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once they got the goal, you could see our guys let down," Villa Park Coach 
Pat Noyes said. "Our guys played scared." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller wasn't scared, maybe just a little stupid. After being called for 
interfering with Valley goalkeeper Alfonzo Limus inside the box, Miller swore 
at the referee and was given a red card. Miller was not only tossed out of 
Wednesday's game, but he also will miss Villa Park's game on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was stupid enough to yell the 'F' word at the ref," Miller said. "I didn't 
think I touched the keeper and then I got kneed in the head after that." 
</P>
<P>
 Morales' goal was followed by one from Rafael Reynosa on an assist from Cirilo 
Cabrera 26 minutes into the second half. Adan Navarette's header off a corner 
kick from Paulo Gonzalez ended the scoring with seven minutes to go.  
</P>
<P>
 "We like long fields where we spread it out and use our speed," Noyes said. 
"We weren't able to do that today. They're very quick and they stay within 
five, six, seven yards of each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's only one game and it's early in the season. We usually don't play 
well here anyway. Our kids don't handle the taunting from the sidelines well. 
Hopefully, we can forget about this game." 
</P>
<P>
 In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill 2, Canyon 1 -- Chris McCauley broke a 1-1 tie by scoring a 
second-half goal for visiting Foothill (5-5-5, 1-1-2) in the upset over 
10th-ranked Canyon. Lars Vreeland's goal in the first half gave Foothill a 1-0 
lead but Sasha Saneff scored two minutes later to tie it, 1-1, for Canyon 
(12-5-1, 2-2). Lanny Rudner had 10 saves for the Knights. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange 1, El Modena 0 -- Lalo Rodriguez's goal 20 minutes into the first half 
won it for visiting Orange (8-5-5, 1-1-2).

<P>
 Cincinnati's Brian Himmler built a 12-game total of 2,769 to take the lead 
after two rounds of the AC/Delco PBA Tournament at Cal Bowl in Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Hoskins of Tarpon Springs, Fla., had opened a first-round lead earlier 
Wednesday, bowling games of 247, 238, 235, 224, 236 and 234 for a total of 
1,414. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hoskins slipped slightly off the pace in the second round as Himmler 
rolled games of 226, 246, 268, 248, 248 and 246 to take a 2,769-2,761 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Firpo of Lakewood, Fla., is in third place at 2,754. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first round, Atlanta's Brian Voss rolled a perfect game before a packed 
audience, but cheers were silenced at about 1:12 p.m. when aftershocks rocked 
the center. DON SNYDER

AUSTRALIAN OPEN; SAMPRAS GETS FIVE-SET SCARE

<TEXT>

 Everything Pete Sampras hit came back at him even harder. Shots rifled past 
him at the net. He shook his head in amazement as the ball caught the lines on 
his side of the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras outlasted Yevgeny Kafelnikov, 6-3, 2-6, 6-3, 1-6, 9-7, to win a 
second-round match Wednesday in the Australian Open, but he left the court with 
respect for the young Russian. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, I was trying everything -- staying back, coming in -- and he was 
coming up with good shots," Sampras said. "He just wasn't letting up. He kept 
on coming after me." 
</P>
<P>
 Steffi Graf, the top-seeded woman, had a much easier time reaching the third 
round, defeating Nicole Provis, 6-1, 6-4, in 61 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth-seeded Stefan Edberg reached the third round with a 4-6, 6-2, 6-1, 6-1 
victory early today against Jan Siemerink. Also advancing were No. 12 Alexander 
Volkov and No. 14 Karel Novacek, as well as Mats Wilander, a three-time 
champion trying to make a comeback.

AT HOME ON THE ROAD AGAIN, DUCKS RALLY TO TIE RED WINGS, 4-4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Another night, another unlikely result for the Mighty Ducks, who continued to 
defy reason Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Just when you think you have them pegged, the Ducks fool you. They have 
through the season's first 49 games. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, they tied the Detroit Red Wings, 4-4, before 19,875 at Joe Louis 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks erased a 4-2 deficit in the second period, held off the Red Wings in 
the third and could have won in overtime in their final game before the 
All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
 If Detroit's Terry Carkner hadn't pulled down Terry Yake, who was streaking 
toward the net in the game's final minute, who knows what might have happened? 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks screamed for a penalty shot, and some said they would have settled 
for a penalty on Carkner and a power play. But they got neither from referee 
Blaine Angus. 
</P>
<P>
 "It should have been a penalty shot as far as I'm concerned," Yake said. "I 
didn't even want the power play. The only thing I wanted was the goal." 
</P>
<P>
 Reminded that penalties are rarely called in overtime, Yake merely shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that's the case, we might as well throw a rope around everybody and play 
lasso the last five minutes of the game," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That play probably won't linger in the minds of the Ducks, though. There are 
so many other, more pleasant thoughts to occupy them during the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
 For openers, the Ducks (18-27-4) are tied with the Kings and San Jose Sharks 
for third place in the Pacific Division and the eighth -- and final -- playoff 
spot in the Western Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, their road record is the best in the Pacific at 12-12-2, and they are 
unbeaten in their last five away from Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there is the subject of confidence, which seems to swell when the 
Ducks play on the road against tough opponents, such as Detroit (26-14-5). 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gone into some places where it's really tough to win and we've won," 
defenseman Bobby Dollas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's tie followed a 3-3 tie against against Toronto (27-14-9) Tuesday 
at Maple Leaf Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just shows you that everybody had more potential than they were able to 
show on other teams," Yake said. "To go to Toronto and Detroit and have a good 
chance to win both. . . . I mean, two ties are not what you want, but it's 
still pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks' rally was particularly impressive, considering past performances 
against Detroit. In three games, the Red Wings had terrorized the Ducks, 
outscoring them 18-8, and Sergei Fedorov had three goals and four assists. 
</P>
<P>
 He had one assist Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Darren McCarty scored 2:33 into the second period for a 4-2 Detroit lead, and 
it looked like the Red Wings might win easily. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Ducks chucked their normal defensive-oriented style and moved the puck 
with crisp passes and hard drives. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven King scored at the 5:03 mark to bring the Ducks to within 4-3, and Bob 
Corkum tied it with his team-leading 16th goal of the season on a power play at 
12:05. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Ron Wilson was concerned the Ducks' scoring would suffer when Anatoli 
Semenov, who had nine goals and 15 assists in 29 games, was sidelined by a 
dislocated elbow Dec. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've played phenomenally without him," Wilson said of Semenov, who might 
return for Monday's game against St. Louis. "A guy like Bob Corkum has come 
through with flying colors, and he's become a complete hockey player now."

NHL ROUNDUP; GILMOUR PROBABLY OUT OF ALL-STAR GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Center Doug Gilmour of the Toronto Maple Leafs suffered a "badly bruised bone" 
in Wednesday night's game with the Hartford Whalers and will probably sit out 
Saturday's All-Star game at New York, his coach said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he's going to go to the All-Star game," Pat Burns said after 
the teams tied, 3-3, at Hartford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilmour, who is third in the NHL with 67 points, injured his right arm during 
the second period when he collided with Hartford's Pat Verbeek. Gilmour was 
taken to St. Francis Hospital and Medical Center, where X-rays were negative. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilmour leads the Maple Leafs and is second in the NHL to Wayne Gretzky with 
52 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Watters, Toronto's assistant general manager, said in a between-periods 
television interview that there were fears that Gilmour's arm was broken. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know where all those reports of him having a broken arm came from -- 
he's on the other side right now and giggling away," Burns told the Sports 
Network. 
</P>
<P>
 Verbeek scored his second goal at 12:40 of the third period. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 3, Boston 3 -- Oleg Petrov scored at 15:15 of the third period to 
give the Canadiens a tie at Montreal less than three minutes after Cam Neely 
had scored his second goal of the game -- and 28th in 32 -- for the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonton 1, Buffalo 1 -- A goal on a 45-foot slap shot by rookie Jason Arnott 
with 2:26 to play gave the Oilers a tie at Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 8, St. Louis 3 -- Eric Lindros scored three goals and had an 
assist to lead the Flyers at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Tampa Bay 4, N.Y. Islanders 3 -- Chris Gratton scored at 4:20 of overtime to 
give the Lightning a victory at St. Petersburg, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 5, Washington 1 -- Bob Kudelski and Jesse Belanger each scored twice 
at Miami to lead the Panthers to their third consecutive victory. The Panthers 
head into the All-Star break with a 19-17-8 record. No first-year expansion 
team has ever finished with a winning record. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 4, Winnipeg 0 -- Randy McKay scored two goals and rookie Martin 
Brodeur recorded his second shutout to lead the Devils at Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
 Calgary 4, Vancouver 3 -- Robert Reichel's goal at 13:16 of the third period 
gave the Flames the victory at Vancouver after the Canucks had rallied from a 
3-1 deficit.

</P>
<P>
 It was the 22nd consecutive conference victory for Golden West, ranked second 
in the state and No. 1 in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 30, 1992, Saddleback beat Golden West to stop the Rustlers' 28-game 
conference winning streak. Golden West has won 50 of its last 51 conference 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Saddleback) always plays pretty good defense on us," Golden West Coach Dave 
Stricklin said. "They kind of shut us down a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West was 18 of 63 (28.6%) from the field but Saddleback was only 
slightly better, making 22 of 75 (29.3%). 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Kravik had 19 points and Deana Itow added 14 for Golden West (23-3, 
5-0). Kristin Brun, a sophomore guard, also had a career-high 16 rebounds for 
the Rustlers. Amy Feniello had 14 for Saddleback (6-11, 1-4). 
</P>
<P>
 In other Orange Empire Conference games: 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Coast 68, Riverside 66 -- LeAnn Kazmer capped a strong night by making 
the winning basket with 16.5 seconds left for visiting Orange Coast (14-9, 
2-2). Kazmer, a sophomore forward, made nine of 10 shots in the first half and 
had 21 points. She was 12 of 18 from the field and finished with 27 points. She 
also had 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton 87, Rancho Santiago 62 -- Nikki Kubota scored a season-high 21 
points for host Fullerton (15-10, 3-1), which is tied with Cypress for second 
place. The teams play Friday at Fullerton.

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK / SCOTT MILLER; SCHEDULE RULE COULD HURT TITANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you are Nevada Las Vegas, you can telephone any basketball program in the 
nation to talk scheduling and your call will sail through the switchboard as if 
the White House were on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are Cal State Fullerton, sometimes days pass before your messages are 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is why the Big West Conference's new scheduling policy will hit 
lower-tier schools, such as Fullerton, harder next season, and it is why the 
Titans already have much of their nonconference schedule finished for next 
season even though they still have two months to play this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Big West has closely watched the ascent of the Atlantic 10 Conference and, 
when four Atlantic 10 teams played in the NCAA tournament last year, Big West 
officials decided to follow that conference's blueprint for success. 
</P>
<P>
 So beginning next year: 
</P>
<P>
 -- No Big West team can schedule a non-Division I opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 -- All Big West teams are required to schedule eight nonconference games 
against a minimum of four opponents ranked in the NCAA's Ratings Percentage 
Index (RPI) top 100 and no more than two opponents ranked No. 201 or below. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference is using last season's RPI index because teams need to work on 
next year's schedule now and, given the time constraints, they cannot wait to 
see the RPI index at the end of this season. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two factors figured into the above two rules: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A team from one of the top eight ranked conferences can be considered a top 
100 team. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Even if the Western Athletic Conference and Pac-10 are not among the top 
eight conferences, teams from those two groups can be considered as a top 100 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 "What our teams did was look at the Atlantic 10 Conference," said Jody 
McRoberts, Big West assistant commissioner. "Our teams used to feel equivalent 
to the Atlantic 10 and, suddenly last year, the Atlantic 10 got four teams in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are the things the Atlantic 10 did." 
</P>
<P>
 Temple, George Washington, Massachusetts and Rhode Island from the Atlantic 10 
played in last year's NCAA tournament. In the Big West, only New Mexico State 
and Long Beach State got in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our teams have played 14 games against non-Division I programs this year," 
McRoberts said. "We looked at the other conferences so far, and (the 14 games) 
are high for a top conference. You look at the Atlantic 10 and there's none." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Fullerton, the Titans are already covered under next year's guidelines. 
They already have scheduled games at UCLA, at Utah and at the Fresno State 
tournament with Texas Arlington and a fourth team to be named; and at home 
against San Diego State. The Titans are also at Loyola Marymount and still 
looking for two home games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (the new guidelines) make it tougher on a school like Fullerton who 
don't have the guaranteed money we can offer people to come in and play us," 
Coach Brad Holland said. "But since they're allowing WAC and Pac-10 schools, 
that gives us more of a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "My personal feeling is that if it's hurting anyone, it's hurting a school 
like ours. It doesn't affect UNLV or New Mexico State." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add scheduling: The top eight conferences in the country last year, according 
the NCAA RPI: Atlantic Coast Conference, Atlantic 10, Big East, Big Eight, Big 
Ten, Great Midwest, Pac-10 and Southeastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA doesn't make the rankings public but does tell each individual 
conference where it ranks. The Big West is 12th. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Miracles do happen: Believe it or not, the Titans will play host to their 
first track and field meets on their newly fixed track this spring. Coach John 
Elders was given permission last week to order 54 hurdles, four steeplechase 
barriers and 10 starting blocks. He also was told to get the curbing done on 
the inside of the track (tracks must have curbs for a meet to be considered 
official). 
</P>
<P>
 He also has ordered miscellaneous items needed to run meets such as flags, 
measuring tapes and pit rakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The schedule calls for Fullerton to play host to a three-way meet against Cal 
State Northridge and UC Santa Barbara on Feb. 19, another against UCSB and UC 
Irvine on Feb. 26 and the Titan Invitational on March 12. Elders also is 
considering adding another invitational on April 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The gymnastics team opens its season Friday with a meet at San Jose State. The 
Titans then play host to UCLA on Jan. 28. . . . The Titan men's basketball team 
is home against San Jose State on Thursday and Pacific on Saturday before four 
consecutive road games at UC Santa Barbara, Long Beach State, Pacific and San 
Jose State. . . . The Titan women's basketball team is at Long Beach State on 
Thursday and then has a week off before playing host to New Mexico State on 
Jan. 27.

NEWSWIRE: PHILLIES' DYKSTRA SENT PACKING BY AGENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a highly unusual move, it was the agent who fired the star this time. 
</P>
<P>
 Fed up with Philadelphia Phillie center fielder Lenny Dykstra's behavior, 
agent Alan Meersand said Wednesday that he is ending their 13-year working 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to condone his conduct or defend it anymore," said Meersand, 
who resides in Manhattan Beach. "We all make our mistakes, but this guy is 
completely out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the way Lenny's going, he's going to self-destruct." 
</P>
<P>
 Dykstra, a Garden Grove native who helped lead the Phillies to the World 
Series last season, was involved in a publicized quarrel Dec. 22 with 
Pennsylvania Sen. Earl Baker. In recent years, Dykstra also has been 
investigated by the Commissioner's office for gambling, and was charged in 1991 
with drunk driving after an automobile accident that caused him to miss 61 
games because of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Meersand's decision comes a month after negotiating a four-year, $24.9-million 
contract extension that made Dykstra the highest-paid leadoff hitter in 
baseball history. BOB NIGHTENGALE

<P>
 Former Cal State Fullerton volleyball Coach Jim Huffman's $1.2 million 
wrongful termination suit against the school went to trial, with jurors hearing 
attorneys' opening statements and testimony from Titan women's gymnastics Coach 
Lynn Rogers in Orange County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffman claims his firing in 1992 was in retaliation "because he spoke out 
about illegalities in the CSUF athletic department and initiated successful 
(gender equity) legal proceedings, which resulted in negative publicity to the 
school and its administrators." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Kevin Gerry will argue that Huffman was let go because of 
poor performance.

THEATER REVIEW; A TIRESOME 'UNEXPECTED GUEST'; 2 LIVELY PERFORMANCES CAN'T 
ROUSE THIS HO-HUM WHODUNIT IN LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Unexpected Guest" is not one of Agatha Christie's more gripping plays. 
Despite a ready corpse, it takes a while to get going; it's a slow train 
chugging up whodunit hill. 
</P>
<P>
 The ride seems especially long at the Long Beach Playhouse, where director 
Michael David Fox keeps pulling back on the throttle. The deliberate-to-tardy 
pacing hardly complements the mystery, which has more talk and less wit than 
any of Christie's other solve-the-puzzle adventures. 
</P>
<P>
 The production, at the Playhouse's Mainstage Theatre, does get some needed 
propulsion from a couple of actors. Allen Moon doesn't make his appearance 
until the first act is almost over, but better late than never. As the 
half-brother of the murdered Richard Warwick (Rick Buckley), Moon brings a 
gleeful rambunctious quality to the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Renkin, as a Keats-loving bohemian of a police sergeant, also provides a 
welcome blast of enthusiasm. He's funny and energetic -- adjectives that rarely 
can be applied to the rest of this cast. 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of the muted mayhem are Michael Starkwedder (Gary Page), who 
just happens to stumble on the murder at the play's start, and pretty Laura 
Warwick (Natasha Witkin), a bitter wife quick to confess to the killing of her 
husband. Starkwedder, not the brainiest of unexpected guests, decides to help 
her, even with the noose hanging nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Lurking about is Julian (Ron Graham), Laura's lover, and a host of other odd 
folks who muddy the waters on our way to figuring out who the real murderer is. 
Page, Witkin and Graham are competent but not colorful enough to maintain our 
interest as the somewhat Byzantine plot develops. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, the production looks a bit budget-minded for the Long Beach 
Playhouse, which has offered some impressive stagings recently. Steven Jay 
Warner's set of the Warrick estate is passable, but it's more what you'd expect 
from a smaller community theater. We really don't get a sense of the musty 
opulence of the place, although the study leading to the foggy grounds is 
effectively moody. 
</P>
<P>
 Lonnie Alcaraz's shadowy lighting is appropriately mysterious. But Ann Curry's 
costumes, although they try to evoke the period, look a tad slapdash. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Unexpected Guest," Long Beach Playhouse Mainstage Theatre, 5021 E.

WESTSIDE WATCH: TALES FROM THE QUAKE: PARTIES AND PREMONITIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After Monday's earthquake, residents of Santa Monica's San Vicente Boulevard 
milled around outside their apartment buildings, reluctant to go inside. One 
group fired up a barbecue; another had an open-air happy hour, complete with 
Coors Lite, Seagram's, raisin muffins and Grape-Nuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was Doug Imscher. 
</P>
<P>
 An unemployed salesman, Imscher did not permit a major shaker to interrupt his 
job search. He set up shop in his car and spent the residential down-time 
writing personal notes to prospective employers. 
</P>
<P>
 So if there's anyone hiring out there, here's a man who does not lack for 
concentration. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 TOY QUEST: Monday's pre-dawn earthquake caught more than 1,000 people waiting 
in line at the Third Street Promenade for a chance to buy -- you guessed it -- 
Power Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 A store called Puzzle Zoo had replenished its supply of the action figures, 
the Christmas season's hottest, and ultimately scarcest, item. Despite the cold 
weather, bundled-up families, toddlers included, had huddled together in 
sleeping bags, lawn chairs and tents waiting for the store's scheduled 8 a.m. 
opening. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the quake, the store never did open on Monday, but one would-be 
Power Ranger customer didn't let a little shaking get in the way of a little 
toy shopping. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know this is a dumb question," the woman said during a phone call to 
Promenade executive director Ron Cano. "But are you still selling the Power 
Rangers?" 
</P>
<P>
 Cano said he replied, "Yes, it is a dumb question and the answer is no." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 INSIDE INFORMATION? Three days before the shaker, a group was handing out 
flyers in Santa Monica announcing that the Earth's "present civilization is 
about to be recycled -- spaded under -- in order that the planet might be 
refurbished." 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, after the earthquake, representatives of the group, Total 
Overcomers Anonymous came to the Times Westside office and declared, "We told 
you so." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 DOUBLE TROUBLE: Jim Davis spent many of the hours before the Pretty-Big One 
worrying about nature's caprice. But he didn't have earthquakes in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 It was blizzards in the East, he said, that kept him awake in Santa Monica. 
Davis and his wife, Liz, had a scheduled flight to return home to Albany, N.Y. 
-- unless, that is, snow would prevent them from landing at home or making a 
connecting flight in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 It was touch and go with the snow, Davis said. Then it was rock and roll with 
the earth. 
</P>
<P>
 All of a sudden, getting out of Los Angeles was the problem. Evacuated from 
their parents' home because of a gas leak, the couple tried to rearrange their 
trip at a pay phone on Montana Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The tremors they had dismissed early in the week as "kind of cute" had been 
supplanted by something major to tell their snowbound friends about. After all, 
what's a little blizzard compared to having every dish in the kitchen jump out 
of the cabinet? 
</P>
<P>
 "We could fly to New Jersey," Liz Davis told her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 His response: "Why?"

SANTA MONICA EASES RULES FOR REPAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIAN MAHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Santa Monica City Council has declared a state of emergency in the city 
and adopted two ordinances to facilitate the repair and demolition of hundreds 
of buildings damaged in Monday's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The state of emergency declaration authorizes the director of emergency 
services to seek federal and state disaster aid. City officials do not have an 
estimate on repair costs, although they are expected to be substantial given 
the 300 structures that sustained damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the damaged buildings, 83 have been deemed unfit for occupancy. The city 
Building and Safety Department has been receiving 60 requests an hour for 
inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 The emergency ordinances were adopted Tuesday night and will be in effect for 
at least 45 days. 
</P>
<P>
 One ordinance waives permit fees for renovation work and the other creates a 
one-stop permit process for restoring damaged buildings and outlines 
streamlined procedures for obtaining demolition permits. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will have a series of workshops for the public to explain our one-stop 
permit process," said Planning Director Suzanne Frick. "All our departments 
will be in one location, and permits will be issued over the counter." 
</P>
<P>
 Individual service to resolve planning, fire, parking and traffic concerns 
will be available at the Building and Safety Department. 
</P>
<P>
 One permit combining authorization for building, plumbing, electrical, 
mechanical and street repair work will be issued. 
</P>
<P>
 Zoning code requirements will be eased, but repaired and renovated structures 
must adhere to current square-footage and height and setback limitations. New 
site uses will not be permitted, although the council may reconsider that 
decision Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Repairs to structures larger than 25,000 square feet will be subject to review 
by the Planning Commission and the Architectural Review Board. 
</P>
<P>
 The Building and Safety Department will determine which structures should be 
demolished based on public safety, historical significance and repair or 
rehabilitation costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinances come just in time for 11th Street residents Jean and Sheila 
Gebman and their three children. The family pleaded with authorities Tuesday 
night to raze their neighbor's house, whose second story is jutting out 
precariously. The Gebmans have been sleeping on their front lawn in the 600 
block since the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just want this thing knocked down as soon as possible so we can get some 
rest," Sheila Gebman said.

KEEPING THE PEACE; VIOLENCE: GANG MEDIATOR JIMMIE POWELL IS RECOVERING AFTER 
BEING SHOT. AMID A VENICE TURF WAR, HE WON'T GIVE UP ON YOUTHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIAN MAHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As he contemplated the metal staples binding the gunshot wound on his forearm, 
Jimmie Powell said he remained committed to bringing peace to Venice, where a 
war between black and Latino gangs has taken 11 lives and wounded 24 since 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to keep on speaking and waving to people. This is not going to stop 
me," Powell, 32, said this week. "I'll be back out there." 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Saturday evening, Powell, a gang mediator with Project Heavy West, 
a nonprofit Venice group trying to keep youths out of trouble, was walking near 
his home at 4th and Vernon avenues when he was approached by two Latino youths 
on bicycles. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell, who is black, gave his customary wave, recognizing both of the youths. 
One of them opened fire, sending Powell scrambling behind a van. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell said he thought about negotiating as he hunkered behind the vehicle. 
But the idea disintegrated in another hail of gunfire, and he fled. 
</P>
<P>
 Hit in the right arm, he stumbled on the pavement. After the gunmen fled, 
Powell ran to his house for help. Neither he nor police know the shooter's 
motive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe I was being shot at," Powell said. "Both of these guys 
live right near me." 
</P>
<P>
 A 17-year-old whose name has not been released has been arrested and charged 
with attempted murder in the Powell shooting and murder in connection with the 
killing of Shawn Patterson, a 24-year-old nursing assistant with no gang 
affiliations, who was shot in November. The second suspect has not been found. 
</P>
<P>
 For neighborhood activists, the shooting was another sign of the danger 
mediators encounter when trying to forge peace between gangs. They point to the 
killing last week in South-Central Los Angeles of former gang member Tony 
Thomas, the founder of Hands Across Watts and architect of a gang truce there, 
who was shot to death by suspected drug dealers he apparently tried to counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 Youth counselors in Oakwood believe their job is getting harder. Chronic 
unemployment, tension with law enforcement and friction among neighbors as the 
area is gentrified have hampered their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Peacemakers like Powell, activists said, are desperately needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jimmie occupies a unique bridge between the streets and the community," said 
Lorenzo Merritt, director of Project Heavy West. "He's well-known, has a level 
head and has the trust of civic leaders (and) families." 
</P>
<P>
 After his mother died, Powell was forced to raise his younger brother, now 19, 
from the age of 13. Since graduation from Venice High School in 1979, Powell 
has held a variety of jobs, including employment as a janitor and construction 
worker, which kept him in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, he started working for the Pearl White Theater in Oakwood, a 
nonprofit drama group helping local youth. He was later hired at Project Heavy 
West to advise youths and mediate gang disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell played a critical role in delaying the onset of the gang war by holding 
a meeting in early October at Venice High School among gang members, school 
officials and mediators. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids didn't want to talk in front of the principal so I took them aside," 
Powell said. "At first they were really pointing fingers, mad-dogging each 
other, but by the end they were shaking hands. I just let them talk." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bud Jacobs, Venice High School principal, wrote a letter to Project Heavy West 
commending Powell's work. 
</P>
<P>
 An ability to empathize, listen, give timely advice and his easygoing manner 
make Powell a unique counselor, his young charges say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was running with the wrong crowd, thinking of dropping out of school when I 
went to him last year," said Demarcio Williams, a 17-year-old Venice High 
student. "He mentioned my best friend who'd been shot and killed (and) said my 
friend would want me to do good. He showed me pictures of people in jail. It 
changed me. I'm back in school and I've got a tutor. I still go over to his 
house three times a month to talk to him." 
</P>
<P>
 So do many others. 
</P>
<P>
 On a typical afternoon at Powell's tidy bungalow that he shares with two 
brothers, a parade of visitors streams by. The phone rings incessantly, cars 
pull up outside and drivers honk and wave. It is a hub of good-natured 
kibitzing in a neighborhood of barred windows, clamped steering wheels and an 
occasional siren. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell turns somber when he thinks of the 17-year-old suspected of shooting 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember he (the suspect) came to our center for counseling," Powell said. 
"He kept saying he didn't care if he got killed or not. We offered him a 
possible job but it didn't work out." 
</P>
<P>
 Powell, like Merritt, believes employment is key to resolving the region's 
gang troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to take a combination of law enforcement, social agencies and 
educational programs focusing on the young men in this community," said 
Merritt. "But nothing's going to matter if we don't prepare them for work." 
</P>
<P>
 And if there is any lesson to be learned from Powell's shooting, he says it is 
this: "I want people to see that I'm not retaliating, that even after being 
hit, I'm still trying to keep the peace."

BRIEFLY; RELIGION: HISTORY OF BLACK MORMONISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Until 1978, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints barred African 
Americans from the priesthood, although some have been included as members of 
the church since its early days in the 1830s. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the priesthood ban was lifted, blacks have helped fuel the Mormon 
Church's 10% annual growth rate, according to organizers of a Black History 
Month exhibit at the Los Angeles Mormon temple's visitor center at 10777 Santa 
Monica Blvd. in Westwood. It features photographs, artifacts, heirlooms and a 
video about black Mormons in the United States and several African countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit will be open daily from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. through Feb. 18.

WESTSIDE COMMUNITY NEWS: BEVERLY HILLS; APARTMENT PROJECT WINS DESIGN AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Jewish Federation Council and the city have won a design award from the 
Urban Land Institute for a senior citizen apartment project on Crescent Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Developed with $9.3 million in city and federal funds, the 150-unit, 
low-income complex was chosen from a field of 25 finalists, and was one of nine 
projects to receive the national award, Mayor Maxwell Salter said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The institute, an international organization of land planning and development 
professionals, bestowed the 1993 award for small-scale residential development. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jewish Federation Council sought the federal funding and operates the 
facility. The city donated $1.9 million and the land for the project, which 
includes a grocery store and parking facility.

WESTSIDE / COVER STORY; JOLTED; SOME WESTSIDE RESIDENTS ARE PONDERING A MOVE TO

 Robin Axelrod prayed, and then the earth shook. 
</P>
<P>
 Axelrod, in the early stages of labor with her first child, had just scribbled 
in the chapel prayer book at Santa Monica Hospital Medical Center on Monday 
when it started. "The walls were splitting. Things were flying," said Axelrod, 
who was moved along with other expectant mothers to a makeshift emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
 By Tuesday morning, she had little Caitlin -- and a "when-you-were-born" story 
she can't wait to share. "I'm going to tell her she's a lucky baby," Axelrod 
said. "She came into a very crazy day." 
</P>
<P>
 Try crazy week.  
</P>
<P>
 The local earthquake toll was overshadowed by deadlier destruction in the San 
Fernando Valley, but the Westside suffered far more than the severing of the 
Santa Monica Freeway, in many ways the area's umbilical cord to the rest of the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 From fallen cliff-top mansions to crumpled low-rent apartments, the Westside 
suffered widespread damage. The toll was worst in and around Santa Monica, 
where an ailing 11-year-old girl's heart gave out in the panic and many 
residents were left homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, the shock of it all prompted talk of leaving a place that seemed as 
doomed as their smashed crystal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what the hell we're going to do, but I really don't think we'll 
have kids here," said Peter Merwin, a 35-year-old architect who moved from 
Houston with his wife in April. Already discouraged by the slow economy, the 
couple are talking seriously of moving away. "If there was a job and I had 
fulfilled my rent obligations, we'd leave immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 For others, post-quake soul-searching led to the opposite conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband's from Pennsylvania and he wants to move," said one woman. "I 
said, 'Forget it.' I like excitement. I like life. I'm going to the opera 
tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 She added: "I hope it's open." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Prompting the kitchen-table debates was the biggest seismic blow to the 
Westside since the 1933 Long Beach earthquake. "We've never had condemned 
buildings like we have right now, the possible tear-downs," said Bob Gabriel, 
an insurance broker and member of the Santa Monica Historical Society who has 
lived in the city since 1946. "I've never seen the likes of it since I've been 
in Santa Monica." 
</P>
<P>
 In all, four Westside residents were reported dead -- all from heart attacks 
believed to have been brought on by the quake -- and hundreds of others were 
treated for everything from severe head injuries to broken legs and cut feet. 
Santa Monica Fire Department spokeswoman Roni Roseberg said the 11-year-old 
girl, Mahini Baloch, had a history of heart problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the Westside, building inspectors closed down dozens of cracked and 
weakened structures. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police on Wednesday closed a one-mile stretch of Olympic Boulevard 
in West Los Angeles after the six-story Barrington Building appeared to be 
collapsing. 
</P>
<P>
 Windows on the glass and concrete office building at 11665 Olympic Boulevard 
near Barrington Avenue had buckled and more than a dozen large cracks could be 
seen. Chunks of concrete and glass fell during a mild aftershock Wednesday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to get this thing torn down before it falls down on itself," Sgt. 
Stan Schott said. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 200 buildings in Santa Monica were known to have been seriously 
damaged, including two seaside landmarks -- the Pritikin Longevity Center and 
the Sea Castle apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
 A curfew darkened Main Street's busy restaurant strip Monday and several 
damaged hotels have been turning away guests. Santa Monica Place, the city's 
only shopping mall, closed for a week to survey damage. On Wednesday at least 
2,300 Santa Monica homes and businesses were still without gas. 
</P>
<P>
 Broken storefront windows invited scattered looting -- empty jewelry cases for 
rings were found strewn along a street near the Third Street Promenade. 
Showroom windows were shattered for several blocks of a popular shopping 
district along Pico Boulevard in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Metropolitan Community Church in Culver City lost much of its facade and 
part of its domed roof. The church last year was reinforced to resist 
earthquakes. "If we hadn't done that, the whole roof would have caved in," said 
pastor Nancy Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake jiggled several bungalows off their foundations in West 
Hollywood and Culver City and toppled life-size statues of the Virgin Mary in 
Santa Monica's Woodlawn Cemetery. In pricey Bel-Air, the force knocked a dozen 
half-million-dollar hilltop homes off their foundations. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Santa Monica hospitals were forced to clear damaged wings and temporarily 
halt all incoming non-emergency admissions. Staffers at Santa Monica Hospital 
slogged through flooded corridors and set up a table outdoors to track patient 
transfers. One mother delivered her baby in an administrative office. At St. 
John's, the obstetrics floor was left windowless, its outside wall crisscrossed 
by gashes. By Wednesday, the hospitals had resumed most services. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-Wilshire area, the quake triggered a fire that consumed a home 
shared by three generations of women. "We've got this floor heater with a pilot 
light in it, and a picture fell on it and it started to burn," said Minerva 
Scott, 47, who shared the Chariton Street house with her 90-year-old mother and 
14-year-old daughter. In minutes, they lost everything, although no one was 
hurt. "We tried to put it out with water from the refrigerator," Scott said, 
"but there wasn't enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Some displaced by the quake have had nowhere to turn -- among them, Nancy 
Eisner. At a makeshift Red Cross shelter at Santa Monica College on Tuesday, 
she stretched out on a green cot, a gray tabby cat in her arms, and began 
facing the fact that her heavily damaged apartment building at San Vicente 
Boulevard and 7th Street would have to be demolished. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 250 people slept at the college site Tuesday night. Another 100 or 
more spent the night at a Red Cross shelter at Fairfax High School. About 50 
families camped out Tuesday night in Pan-Pacific Park in Park La Brea and about 
100 people were still huddling in the park Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Others displaced by the quake were luckier, able to move in with friends or 
relatives. But their problems were no less daunting. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara and Steve Batista picked through the soggy debris of their flooded Sea 
Castle apartment Tuesday, recalling the horrors of a cave-in that left them 
trapped inside with their 18-month-old son. "The firemen had to dig a hole 
through the bricks and the wood to get us out," Barbara Batista said. The next 
rude surprise came later Monday, when they returned to get belongings they had 
left in the hallway. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came back with my dad, my husband's guitar (and) my camera and lenses 
were gone," she said. "I can't believe they came here to loot." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple, now staying with Barbara Batista's father in North Hollywood, have 
tried to contact federal emergency officials for aid but could not get through 
on the telephone. The two have little in savings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to teach art, but now I'm unemployed," Barbara Batista said. "I don't 
know what we're gonna do." She began to cry. 
</P>
<P>
 The tragedy has left plenty of room for neighborly generosity. An injured Joan 
Sekler helped organize fellow tenants in a rescue detail -- even as blood from 
a cut streamed down her face. In the darkness, tenants knocked on neighbors' 
doors to see if anyone needed help to get out of the apartment building at 
Lincoln and Montana avenues in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Sekler, a free-lance radio reporter, wore the same blood-spattered pajamas and 
a donated jacket when she showed up bandaged at the Red Cross shelter hours 
later. She took it all in stride. "I'm a pretty up person," she said. Her only 
complaint was of a Montana Avenue grocer who she had seen charging $35 for a 
gallon of bottled water. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Bennett's heroics were simply a matter of keeping his ear to the ground. 
When a series of minor tremors the previous week jostled the Westside, Bennett 
took them as an omen. "I thought it was coming," the Santa Monica resident 
said. Bennett was right -- and ready. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his wife, Sharon, who manage an eight-unit building in the 500 block of 
San Vicente Boulevard, stocked up on water and flashlights and set up emergency 
lights in case of a power failure. When the quake hit, the pair ushered out 
three elderly tenants and gave flashlights to others. Mike Bennett later drove 
a neighbor to the hospital to get stitches for a badly bleeding cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Damage to the building prompted all the tenants to move in with relatives. The 
Bennetts are staying on, though city "limited entry" restrictions will prevent 
them from having many visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 By Wednesday, Westside life seemed to be creeping toward normalcy. Eateries 
along Beverly Hills' glitzy Golden Triangle had again set up sidewalk tables, 
and shoppers were strolling the boutiques along Rodeo Drive. Many residents 
finally were able to take their first hot showers of the week -- just in time 
to get back to work.  
</P>
<P>
 But getting back to normal for some meant a major change of address. 
</P>
<P>
 Deborah and Paul Price didn't stick around after fleeing their Montana Avenue 
apartment. On Wednesday, the couple and their 15-month-old daughter moved into 
their new place -- in Cambria, six hours to the north. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't even tell you how much better I feel now that I am out. . . . My body 
just wouldn't stop reacting to the aftershocks," said Deborah, a financial 
planner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to start a new business and find a new place to live. Potentially it 
will be central or Northern California," she said. "Having a child, I am much 
more concerned about her welfare. But I'd like to live too."

WESTSIDE / COVER STORY; NEGOTIATING ROADWAYS NOW A TEST OF TOLERANCE, INGENUITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Now the Westside's post-quake road test begins. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic was generally light in the tentative first days after the early Monday 
morning temblor that wrecked a section of the Santa Monica Freeway (10), 
cutting the world's busiest thoroughfare in two. But no one expects the lull to 
last, least of all the engineers who must reroute the 300,000 or more cars that 
normally travel the roadway each working day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think yesterday or today will be typical, because a lot of people 
stayed home to get their houses and families in order," John Fisher, principal 
transportation engineer for the city of Los Angeles, said Tuesday. "By the end 
of this week and next week, that will be the real test." 
</P>
<P>
 Adventurous drivers such as Prof. Norman Cohen of Occidental College left as 
early as 6 a.m. Tuesday, "testing the waters" for the commute from Venice to 
his campus in Eagle Rock. 
</P>
<P>
 The tactic worked well, at least for that day. But Cohen, a historian, 
experienced a strange reaction as soon as he left Venice Boulevard and rejoined 
the freeway at La Brea Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was more bumpy than I'm used to," he said. "I was tense as hell 
during the entire (drive)." 
</P>
<P>
 Others, like attorney Sam Jason of Pacific Palisades, picked new routes. 
Avoiding the Santa Monica Freeway altogether, Jason headed east on Sunset 
Boulevard and slipped down the Hollywood Freeway (101) to his office on 
Wilshire Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "It adds a bit of adventure but it's a routine I can do without," Jason said. 
</P>
<P>
 The freeway is not totally out of commission. It was opened Wednesday for 
eastbound traffic from the Pacific Ocean to the San Diego Freeway (405), and on 
from La Brea, and for westbound travelers from Downtown to the Washington 
Boulevard off-ramp, and on from La Cienega Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 On-ramps closed to eastbound traffic include those at Overland Avenue, 
National Boulevard, La Cienega, Venice Boulevard, Fairfax Avenue and 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 On-ramps closed to westbound traffic are at Washington, Fairfax and Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 The westbound connector ramp for traffic seeking to get onto the southbound 
San Diego Freeway is also closed. 
</P>
<P>
 For months on end, motorists will be forced to take surface streets to get 
around the mess in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact may be softened by the sophisticated technology recently installed 
to increase traffic flow along a so-called "smart corridor" including the 
freeway and Olympic, Pico, Venice, Washington and Adams boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Already, city engineers are rejiggering their computers to make for longer 
green lights to move cars along those key stretches. 
</P>
<P>
 And plans are being drawn for double-turn lanes to help drivers off the 
freeway, around the bottlenecks, and back onto the elevated highway. 
</P>
<P>
 An early problem was a spate of power failures that reduced key traffic 
signals to little more than four-way stop signs. But planners hope to have all 
signals operational before anticipated big traffic flows resume. 
</P>
<P>
 Drivers seeking updated information may call Caltrans at (800) 427-ROAD.

waiting to leave their keys with the valet. Their destination wasn't a hip 
nightclub -- it was an upscale pool hall at the Hollywood Athletic Club. 
</P>
<P>
 During its 70-year history, the club has catered to stars, including John 
Wayne and Charlie Chaplin. It served at one time as home to the University of 
Judaism and a record company. 
</P>
<P>
 The upscale billiard hall was added four years ago, when British entrepreneur 
Thomas Salter leased the building and remodeled it. The hall has 41 pool 
tables, a restaurant and a private party room. Fees are $14 per hour for two 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't play pool for 25 years until I heard about the HAC," said Los 
Angeles resident Chris Corso. "I pulled up to the valet, had a cappuccino, saw 
the elegant tables and it's been home here every day for the past three years." 
</P>
<P>
 The athletic club hall is not unique. Upscale pool halls are sprouting up 
across the Westside. On the Santa Monica Promenade, for instance, two of them 
-- Yankee Doodles and Gotham Hall -- are set amid the stores and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike pool halls of yesteryear, these modern-day versions feature California 
cuisine, imported beer and wine and a light, airy atmosphere. The new trappings 
have been a hit, particularly with yuppies and the twentysomething set. 
</P>
<P>
 At Yankee Doodles on Friday, Jason Kammerer, grabbed a quick lunch and shot a 
game. "It's a a good way to relax during a bad day of work," he said. "And, you 
don't have to be good to play." 
</P>

CRIME: IN DEFENSE OF ACCUSED NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH PATROLMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Westside's story (Dec. 26) on William Nason, the Hollywood area Neighborhood 
Watch patrolman who faces an attempted murder charge, may be the most 
significant story of the new year in our crime-wracked city. 
</P>
<P>
 During my years in Neighborhood Watch, we conducted a poll of our 142 homes to 
make sure our neighbors approved and appreciated our dangerous volunteer work 
on their behalf. When I say "dangerous," there are two ways of conducting 
Neighborhood Watch. One is to just watch. The other way, the only right way, is 
to firmly accost the predator and suggest he move on and stop casing the old 
woman's balcony. But never create a physical altercation. 
</P>
<P>
 All 142 homes surveyed approved our work -- 100%. But 95% of them flunked the 
next question -- would they help? No, for various reasons they could not help. 
And they get crime because they tolerate crime. 
</P>
<P>
 On the word of one member of Neighborhood Watch, and refuted by all six others 
in the patrol that night, Nason was arrested for attempted murder. By Hollywood 
police, too busy and too undermanned to arrest criminals, but not to arrest 
model citizens out to protect their neighborhoods.  
</P>
<P>
 And Nason, the Neighborhood Watchman, a 28-yearold model citizen, had gone out 
previously on more than 300 midnight patrols without a single physical 
altercation.  
</P>
<P>
 What is the city maintaining? That a Neighborhood Watchman has no right to 
defend himself from attack by the monsters against whom he patrols, while most 
of the neighborhood sleeps and the LAPD wrings its hands over too few officers 
to enforce the law. If that is so, then Nason has no defense. Just submit to 
being stabbed -- don't fight back. 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, Neighborhood Watch must be disbanded at once. And our city's 
pitiful effort to increase "community policing" must be aborted in its tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 But if self-defense is permissible, then how much? What better judge of degree 
than the patrol person being attacked?

CLASS NOTES: GIVING YOUR PRESCHOOLER A HEAD START ON EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LAINE YARBER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Mary Laine Yarber teaches English 
at Santa Monica High School. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When I started preschool in 1966, my parents' main concern was that I not bite 
anyone. Since then, academic competition has become so fierce that parents have 
larger worries, such as whether their preschoolers have adequate reading, math 
and other skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, a growing number of parents are turning to books to learn 
more about how to give their toddlers a head start on school. I'm frequently 
asked for recommendations. Here are my six favorites: 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Preschool Handbook: Making the Most of Your Child's Education," by 
Barbara Brenner, tells you everything you need to know about how to choose a 
preschool and how to utilize its program to its fullest. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the topics addressed by the book: the history of preschool philosophies, 
preschool ages and stages, some reasons for and against preschool, how to build 
a relationship with the school and teacher, and even how to help your child 
(and perhaps yourself) through the "separation anxiety" that can strike when 
kids leave their parents for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 * Parents on the next rung up the schooling ladder will learn lots from "The 
Kindergarten Survival Handbook: The Before School Checklist and Guide for 
Parents," by Allana Elovson. 
</P>
<P>
 This book tells parents what kids need to know to be ready for kindergarten. 
Topics include social skills, movement skills, words and letters, body parts 
and clothing, feelings, money, hygiene, argument resolution and -- my favorite 
-- "Understand that in school, children are expected to do what their teachers 
ask." 
</P>
<P>
 The humorously illustrated and interestingly written paperback is available in 
Spanish under the title, "El Manual de Como Sobrevivir el Jardin de Ninos." 
</P>
<P>
 * Equally useful is "Kindergarten -- It Isn't What It Used to Be: Getting Your 
Child Ready for the Positive Experience of Education," by Susan and Mitch 
Golant. This is one of several books by the Golants that present updated 
education theory in clear, interesting language. 
</P>
<P>
 The book addresses a variety of concerns. Some examples: how to tell whether 
your child is mature enough to begin kindergarten; how to encourage an early 
love of books; choosing a kindergarten program and evaluating teachers; helping 
the child cope with school pressures and social relations, and whether to have 
your child take certain kinds of tests. 
</P>
<P>
 * I have yet to meet a parent who doesn't think his or her child is gifted. 
The truth is that few children really are. To help figure out if yours is among 
the exceptional, look into "Your Gifted Child: How to Recognize and Develop the 
Special Talents in Your Child from Birth to Age Seven," by Joan Franklin Smutny 
and Kathleen and Stephen Veenker. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, the book will teach you to recognize early signs of giftedness in 
your child and how to nurture it, as well as how to choose good books, school 
programs and other learning resources. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many parents lament the seemingly growing number of bad influences on 
children, and they wonder how to raise decent kids. You'll find some quick and 
easy-to-use answers in "If You Have Kids, Then Be a Parent!" by Jill Chapin. 
</P>
<P>
 It presents a parenting approach based on "old-fashioned common sense" and 
"exaggerated re-enforcement." You'll learn how to instill values, 
self-discipline, good behavior and conscience. The thin volume is plainly 
written and sparsely illustrated, so it's a quick and clear read. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some parents and educators are rethinking the effectiveness of giving grades 
and other kinds of rewards. The most interesting discussion I've found is Alfie 
Kohn's "Punished by Rewards: The Trouble with Gold Stars, Incentive Plans, A's, 
Praise, and Other Bribes." 
</P>
<P>
 Kohn asserts that "while manipulating people with incentives seems to work in 
the short run, it is a strategy that ultimately fails and even does lasting 
harm." The hefty hardcover offers serious and useful, if unsettling, reading. 
It ends with some practical and apparently successful strategies for teachers, 
parents, and employers.

 SHOOTING COMETS 
</P>
<P>
 Although his team beat Manual Arts last week, Westchester Coach Ed Azzam is 
more concerned about finishing with the best record in the Coastal Conference 
than where the Comets rank among the City Section powers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Comets, ranked No. 3 in the Southland by The Times, beat the Toilers, 
86-78, Jan. 12 in a game matching the top teams of the Coastal Conference. The 
Comets also beat Hamilton, 112-62, Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Westchester (17-3) used an effective pressure defense to prevent the Toilers 
from developing their inside game. They also made 21 of 24 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put pressure on everyone's guards," Azzam said. "We're all guards. If we 
don't, our little big men underneath are going to get killed. There are 
probably 40 L.A. teams who can beat us with their big men." 
</P>
<P>
 The Comets have 10 players who are 6-foot-2 or smaller who can run and score. 
The best is sophomore Danny Walker, who scored 19 points against Manual Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker, a 6-foot-1 point guard, leads the team with an 18.2 scoring average. 
He was the most valuable player in the Artesia tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's one of the best players I've ever seen," Azzam said. "He does everything 
well. He shoots the ball well, he handles the ball well. 
</P>
<P>
 "My only complaint is that I wish he would shoot the ball more. He doesn't 
score as consistently as I would like." 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Sanders (14.4 points) and Cullen Countee (13.5 points) also have lived up 
to their billing as two of the top players in the City Section. Countee, who is 
recovering from a knee injury, made the all-tournament team in the Las Vegas 
Holiday Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cullen has really been playing well," Azzam said. "He settles everyone down 
and comes up with the big shot during crucial times of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 But what makes the Comets special is their depth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have probably 10 guys who can start," Azzam said. "They don't defend as 
well as I like, but I got a lot of kids who can score, handle the ball and run 
the press. There's a lot of power coming off the bench." 
</P>
<P>
 The Comets expect to be challenged by Fairfax and Venice in the Western 
League, but their real competition might not come until the City 4-A Division 
playoffs, when they hope to play defending City champion Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
 Does Azzam think about Crenshaw? 
</P>
<P>
 "I really can't concern myself with (Crenshaw)," Azzam said. "We have to put 
ourselves in position to win our league championship convincingly. We don't 
want to play them on their home court." CARRYING THE TORCH 
</P>
<P>
 Genevieve DuBose of Hamilton High has been selected to carry the torch in 
preparation for the 1994 Winter Olympic Games in Lillehammer, Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 DuBose, who won the City girls' cross-country championships, and Humberto 
Sanchez of South Gate High, the City boys' runner-up, were selected to 
participate in the Norwegian Torch Relay on Feb. 5 in Oslo, Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty participants from 13 countries, including five U.S. torchbearers, were 
chosen to carry the flame through a selection program sponsored by Coca-Cola. 
The International Olympic Torchbearers Program marks the first time in Winter 
Games' history that runners from outside the host country will participate. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. runners are among those who will carry the torch more than 8,000 
kilometers in 75 days. The relay began Nov. 27 and concludes Feb. 12 with the 
opening ceremonies in Lillehammer. FALLING SHORT 
</P>
<P>
 Culver City was trailing Redondo by 20 points going into the fourth quarter in 
an Ocean League game Jan. 11, but pulled to within two points with eight 
seconds left. The Centaurs had the ball when playmaker Chris Ellison attempted 
to pass to Louie Baity. The ball went out of bounds and Redondo ran out the 
clock to win, 87-85. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should have beat them," Culver City Coach Jeff Perry said. "If we can play 
with that type of intensity for four quarters, we would have blown them out. We 
missed seven uncontested layups and seven free throws. That's 21 points right 
there. Plus 10 turnovers." QUICK FAX 
</P>
<P>
 Fairfax's Lanell McGrew had 21 points and seven rebounds Friday in a 67-61 
loss to Manual Arts, an indication that the 6-3 forward is starting to develop 
into the type of defensive big man the Lions need. McGrew, who played on the 
junior varsity last season, has been one of the Lions' better offensive 
players, but he has been inconsistent defensively. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are spending 10 to 15 minutes before and after practice trying to improve 
his footwork," Fairfax Coach Harvey Kitani said. "We're trying to give him more 
repetition on the various defensive fundamentals." 
</P>
<P>
 McGrew and Tomar Yachini were assigned to guard 6-5 forward David 
Rickenbacker, who scored 18 points. The Lions out-rebounded the Toilers, 31-21, 
and McGrew made nine of 13 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "We let them shoot 53% from the field," Kitani said. "They made seven 
three-point shots against us." VIKINGS CONQUERED 
</P>
<P>
 St. Bernard's girls' basketball team, the defending State Division IV-AA 
champions, lost to Alemany, 57-37, and Bishop Montgomery, 51-50, last week to 
snap a 14-game Mission League winning streak. The Vikings, who dropped from 
first to fourth in this week's Westside poll, played most of the week without 
6-foot-4 senior forward Marte Alexander, who sprained her left ankle. 
Alexander, who has signed a letter of intent to play at Arizona, had been 
averaging 16 points and nine rebounds a game. She injured her ankle in the 
fourth quarter against Alemany and did not play against Bishop Montgomery and 
Harvard-Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings relied on 6-3 forward Olympia Scott, The Times' 1993 Westside 
Player of the Year who is averaging 15.8 points a game. St. Bernard broke its 
losing streak by defeating Harvard-Westlake, 75-28. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had no excuses for losing to Alemany or Bishop Montgomery," Viking Coach 
Lori Pawinski said. "We did not play to our potential. We don't make any 
excuses for our poor play." ADD VIKING WOES 
</P>
<P>
 The St. Bernard boys' team dropped from the Westside rankings after losing two 
Mission League games. The Vikings (8-7) were beaten by Bishop Montgomery, 
71-57, Jan. 12 and to Harvard-Westlake, 76-65, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings have lost three consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot recall the last time we lost three consecutive games," Coach Jim 
McClune said. "It may have happen the last time we played in the Angelus 
League." 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1987-88 season, the Angelus League had Division I players such as 
LeRon Ellis and Tom Peabody of Mater Dei, Geoff Lear and Stephon Pace of Bishop 
Amat and brothers Rob and Jeff Willig St. Paul. TRIPLE-DOUBLE 
</P>
<P>
 Venice traveled to Palisades on Friday and defeated the Dolphins in a Coastal 
Conference game, 77-54. The Gondoliers (13-5) were led by senior center Jamila 
Locke, who scored 19 points. Teammate Yuriko Jung had 15 points, 10 rebounds 
and 10 steals to record her first triple-double. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a goal from way back but I wasn't conscious of the stats during the 
game," said Jung, a 5-foot-8 junior guard. "I was surprised." 
</P>
<P>
 Jung said the Gondoliers need to work on free-throw shooting, having fallen 
short of a team-goal of 70% accuracy, and on defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have to work together more, especially when we switch from zone to 
man-to-man coverage," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Venice will see if that preparation pays dividends when it plays 
host to Westchester at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "Next to Manual Arts, they should be the most competitive (team) in 
conference," Jung said. "They have plenty of strength with their inside 
players. It'll be a good game for us." BUILDING UP 
</P>
<P>
 Pilibos Armenian has developed into a solid small school basketball program in 
only its first year of existence. The Eagles (2-2) hope to join a league next 
season after competing as an independent this season. The school lacks a gym, 
so the team practices on an outdoor asphalt court. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Pilibos Armenian defeated Southwestern Academy, 98-46. Haig 
Avakian, a 5-foot-11 senior forward, scored 39 points and guard Sevan 
Hovsepian, a 5-9 guard, added 20. 
</P>
<P>
 "We seem to be doing well," said Coach Carlo Honanian. "And we are improving." 
</P>
<P>
 With a limited free-lance schedule, the Eagles conclude their season with 
games against Wilshire West on Feb. 4 and 8. ALAN OTA and SEAN WATERS

BEARING THE BLUNT; THERE IS NOTHING REFINED ABOUT THE MUFFS, WHOSE SOUND IS 
TOUGH AND WHOSE SINGER IS AS SUBTLE AS A B-1 BOMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, Mike Boehm covers pop music for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is nothing fancy about the Muffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles/Orange County foursome plays raw, messy mid-'60s garage-rock 
that gets jolted into the present with punk-rock aggression. Songwriter Kim 
Shattuck writes sweetly catchy melodies, then curdles her confections with 
screaming, growling interjections that are all garlic and hot peppers. 
</P>
<P>
 Shattuck doesn't worry about subtleties in her lyrics, bluntly stating what's 
on her mind, whether it's desire for a new love, regrets over an old one or 
antagonism toward someone who has tried to put her down. 
</P>
<P>
 One could theorize that the Muffs' singer-songwriter-lead guitarist is one of 
those reticent souls who find in rock music an outlet for asserting passions 
and opinions that would otherwise remain concealed. 
</P>
<P>
 Then one could sit down with Shattuck and her band mates and have that theory 
quickly trashed. 
</P>
<P>
 Shattuck fires from the lip in conversation as freely as she splatters guitar 
noise across the Muffs' only album, which was well-reviewed but not a big 
seller and failed to crack the charts. 
</P>
<P>
 Melanie Vammen, the band's rhythm guitarist and Shattuck's pal and musical 
sidekick since the mid '80s, joined in the fusillades from time to time during 
a recent interview at Vammen's house in Los Angeles. Ronnie Barnett, the 
easygoing bassist from Houston, ducked and didn't return fire when Shattuck 
sent occasional shrapnel his way, while the Muffs' new drummer, Jim La Spesa, 
hid behind a shield of self-effacing quips. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who raised Shattuck's ire during the interview were: 
</P>
<P>
 * Guitarists who flaunt flashy technique: "Eddie Van Halen, I think that's 
(expletive)." 
</P>
<P>
 * Suburban women who follow certain dictates of fashion: "Especially in Orange 
County. They're the kind who have pantyhose and long fingernails and go to 
tanning booths. All these people could keel over now and die, and I'd be 
happy." 
</P>
<P>
 * Poor Barnett, for suggesting that the band's name is not intended as a 
double-entendre: "Yeah, it is," said Shattuck, before casting aspersions on 
Barnett's manhood in a way silly enough not to really hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 The two were romantically involved until about a year ago, and they seem to 
have a friendly understanding that allows Shattuck to fling insults at her 
mild-mannered ex without his taking offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Things have been known to get a tad volatile between Shattuck and Barnett on 
stage, but Shattuck says it has nothing to do with baggage from their 3 
1/2-year romance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll always be friends. Ronnie's a good guy," she said. "But he likes to egg 
me on and see how far I'll go." 
</P>
<P>
 "She comes at me with her guitar, meaning to maim," Barnett said of the times 
when his onstage egging has born results. "I try to wrestle her off stage. But 
I never tried to hit her with my guitar." 
</P>
<P>
 Vammen ("Me, I'm the band mediator, I'm pretty mellow") says such tiffs have 
become relatively rare lately. 
</P>
<P>
 In a way, the Muffs -- which perform tonight at Our House in Costa Mesa and 
Feb. 10 at Cal State Fullerton -- owe their existence to Shattuck's 
outspokenness. 
</P>
<P>
 She and Vammen met in a vintage-clothes shop in Orange Circle. Vammen, who 
grew up in Fountain Valley, was the keyboards player in the all-female L.A. 
band, the Pandoras. Shattuck was a bass player looking for her first gig. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Your bass player sucks and is ugly,' " Shattuck recalled. "It was 
true. She looked like a fat Tatum O'Neal." 
</P>
<P>
 Vammen ignored her at first but eventually conceded that Shattuck had a point. 
Shattuck got the Pandoras bass gig, and the two became friends. As Pandoras 
leader Paula Pierce took the band away from '60s-style garage rock and toward 
heavy metal during the late '80s, Shattuck and Vammen shared gripes, then 
finally decided to start a band. 
</P>
<P>
 The Muffs debuted in January, 1991, generated a buzz in Los Angeles and, to 
their surprise, found themselves courted by Warner Bros. Records. The Muffs 
signed with the big label and spent a big-label sum to record a debut album 
with an off-the-cuff sound suitable to their style. 
</P>
<P>
 For the next one, they say, they'll work more quickly and keep the budget 
tighter. 
</P>
<P>
 The band did get to tour extensively last year, ending with an eventful 
five-week trip to Europe in which Shattuck managed to send a promoter in 
Stuttgart, Germany, to the hospital after whacking him on the head with a 
highball glass. The promoter had made the mistake of cutting short the Muffs' 
show and making menacing advances toward Shattuck's guitar amplifier. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very protective," Shattuck said, referring to her gear. "I'm glad I did 
what I did. He deserved it. He wasn't hurt very bad, because he walked to the 
hospital." Shattuck wound up paying a fine after being escorted to the local 
police station. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Shattuck says, she is in hot water with the Irvine police for having 
thrown cold water on an officer last month when he tried to stop her from 
bringing a bottle of water into UC Irvine's Crawford Hall, where the Muffs 
appeared on a punk rock bill. 
</P>

 "I'm a basically decent person," Shattuck said. "I just don't like to take 
(expletive) from people." 
</P>
<P>
 The Muffs might have war stories to tell from their first round of recording 
and touring, but they don't have a lot of money to show for it.

<P>
 La Spesa, who works in a record store in Hollywood, is the only member 
employed, but the others are contemplating getting jobs to tide them over until 
they get another chunk of Warners money to make their second album.

 "I live in my parents' house and have no money," Shattuck said. "We're going 
to have to get real jobs, and we don't want to. We're trying to live a real 
fantasy life here."

NEW PICK OF THE WEEK: JIMMY THACKERY & JOHN MOONEY "SIDEWAYS IN PARADISE" BLIND 
PIG  
</P>

<P>
 You may have heard Taj Mahal do a traditional song called "Bullfrog Blues." On 
the all-acoustic "Sideways in Paradise," the Thackery-Mooney duo introduces the 
tree-frog blues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sideways in Paradise" was taken from previously unavailable 1985 sessions the 
two players conducted poolside at a Jamaican resort. As they trade hot guitar 
licks and husky vocals, they are accompanied by an ever-present chorus of tree 
frogs, whose chirping and peeping sound more or less like a forest full of 
crickets. The frogs add to the atmosphere on "I'll Come Running Back," a 
pop-folk ballad that has a moonlit shimmer. That song and "Take Time," a 
soul-style ballad reminiscent of Otis Redding, lend an eclectic touch to an 
album devoted mainly to straight country blues. The use of mandolin on several 
tracks and the inclusion of some good, modern blues material also help the duo 
deliver its own take on a venerable form. 
</P>
<P>
 Thackery made his name in the '70s and '80s with the Nighthawks, a Washington 
electric blues band, while Mooney has been walking in the steps of Delta blues 
men since the early 1970s and sounds fully authentic and at ease in the 
acoustic slide guitar tradition. The relaxed, intimate circumstances of the 
session come across, yet the sound quality is punchy and immediate. MIKE BOEHM

CLASSIC OF THE WEEK: MICHAEL NESMITH & THE FIRST NATIONAL BAND "COMPLETE" 
PACIFIC ARTS AUDIO  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first LP I ever bought was a Monkees album. I ran down to Sears' record 
department and plunked down my $3.33 (plus tax) strictly because I'd heard a 
new Mike Nesmith song on the group's weekly TV show and simply had to have it 
that night. When Nesmith quit in 1969, I was anxious to hear what he would do 
next, even though I had no clue what direction he'd head. That debut solo 
album, "Magnetic South" (1970), was a revelation to me -- as it must have been 
for Nesmith. He sounded like a man who had traded in a straitjacket for a 
favorite old flannel shirt and a pair of blue jeans. Yes, it contained his only 
solo Top 40 single, "Joanne." But creating hits seems to have been the furthest 
thing from his mind as he made "Magnetic South" and its two successors -- 
"Loose Salute" (1971) and "Nevada Fighter" (1971), a loose trilogy brought 
together in this two-CD set. 
</P>
<P>
 Elements of the folk and country Nesmith was surrounded by as he grew up in 
Texas were prominent, but so was the rock he had embraced in his teens. And in 
covers of such standards as "Beyond the Blue Horizon" as well as in his own 
erudite numbers such as "The Crippled Lion" and "Tengo Amor," he displayed a 
gift for urbane lyrics, delightfully meandering melodies and glassy vocals 
revealing his affection for the American popular songbooks of Cole Porter and 
the Gershwins.  
</P>
<P>
 His First National Band included steel guitarist O.J. (Red) Rhodes -- the 
first steel player I ever truly enjoyed -- drummer John Ware, bassist John 
London and pianist Glen D. Hardin (Earl P. Ball on "Magnetic South"). 
</P>
<P>
 While they didn't invent country-rock, they did create an invigorating 
pre-Eagles hybrid that sounds as inspired and unforced today as it did more 
than two decades ago. RANDY LEWIS

COMEDY: O'BRIEN AND VALDEZ: FROM BREAKING GROUND TO BREAKING UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN DOGGRELL, Glenn Doggrell writes about comedy for The Times Orange 
County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim O'Brien is a gregarious and brash Irish Catholic raised in Chicago. Alex 
Valdez is a blind, sharp-dressing Latino who grew up in Santa Ana, where he 
still lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, despite growing up miles and worlds apart, the comedy team of 
O'Brien and Valdez probably does more to break down stereotypes than any 
stand-up act working today. So it comes as distressing news, just a week before 
the duo performs at Centerfield in Huntington Beach, that the team is going to 
break up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Come August of 1994, we'll be taking a hiatus," Valdez said Tuesday night. 
"It's time to explore other avenues in our careers. It's also time to get off 
the road. I'm gonna be 40 this year, and I don't want to be out on the road in 
small condos and hotel rooms any more." 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is, the split could be rescinded.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was a friendly breakup," explained Valdez, who wants to keep a hand in 
stand-up, expand into giving motivational seminars and look into a possible TV 
role. "We looked at the pros and cons, and we both agreed it was time. That's 
not to say we'll never perform again. But we know we need to take a hiatus." 
</P>
<P>
 Valdez said the seed was planted three years ago when he bucked the boozy 
trappings of life on the road and sobered up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm no longer the wild party animal I was. Do you know what I used to do? I'd 
get drunk and look for someone who would let me drive their car. And there were 
a few people who did." 
</P>
<P>
 For O'Brien, the hiatus will mean looking at possible voice-over work with his 
impressions and sound effects as well as continuing some stand-up, Valdez said, 
adding that his partner will also try TV and commercial areas. 
</P>
<P>
 But until the break, the veteran performers will continue their tandem effort 
to break down stereotypes and push for the disabled.  
</P>
<P>
 The pair reject, however, any label of being crusaders. They just want the 
world to wake up. They find it stunning that the disabled are still looked at 
and treated differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even in the '90s, people are afraid to take chances with the disabled . . . 
unless they're sitting behind a piano, where they can't hurt themselves," 
Valdez, who has been blind since age 7, once lamented to The Times after a 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just want to be funny with a unique hook," O'Brien added.  
</P>
<P>
 And though some people might feel awkward laughing at a blind person, Valdez 
addresses that concern from the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "People ask me why I don't wear sunglasses or shades," he typically tells the 
crowd. "I tell them I've never seen a deaf person wearing earmuffs." 
</P>
<P>
 With that situation defused, the pair's funny, musical and intelligent routine 
continually pokes fun at Valdez's blindness and Latino origins as well as 
O'Brien's less-than-opulent roots, including a rousing "White Trash Blues," 
featuring Valdez on guitar and his partner on harmonica. O'Brien, however, 
insists the song is not about his family, but the families he grew up with. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of O'Brien's job is to make sure Valdez doesn't fall off the stage. Most 
of Valdez's job is to make sure O'Brien doesn't take over the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 After nearly 10 years together, they both do their jobs well. They perform 
Tuesday at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 If you missed one of the top comics working the stand-up circuit when he 
played Irvine in November, Dennis Wolfberg brings his bug-eyed humor back to 
the Irvine Improv tonight through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The veteran funnyman, who stretches and accents key words as if someone's 
performing the Heimlich maneuver on him, just keeps rolling along as his fame 
grows, sort of. 
</P>
<P>
 "People recognize me on the street now," he said before the November shows. 
"Not all of them know my name, though. Some come up and say, 'Aren't you the 
guy with the eyes?' . . . Like some comedians have O-C-U-L-A-R voids." 
</P>
<P>
 But that slight annoyance aside, Wolfberg has it pretty good. He has regularly 
been selling out clubs and has signed a deal with Castle Rock Entertainment to 
do a sitcom for the Fox Network. And if he does any more late nights with 
Arsenio Hall, the show could be renamed "Arsenio and Dennis." 
</P>
<P>
 The former teacher mines his humor from personal experiences, leaving the 
observational and topic areas to others. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm an old-fashioned storyteller; it's personalized comedy. It behooves my 
audience for my life to be interesting." 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, John Bowman is headlining at the Brea Improv through Sunday, while 
Roger Rittenhouse is the closer at Standing Room Only in Fullerton through 
Sunday.

WANNA DANCE?: SOUL SHACK DOESN'T CLOSE ITS DOORS ON RAP'S ROOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Anyone attributing that infectious rhythm running through Ice Cube's chart 
maker "Check Yo Self" to the rapper himself better take a cue from the song and 
recheck his or her knowledge of the genre. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many modern-day rap artists, Ice Cube owes part of his success to those 
who pioneered the music -- not just for their perseverance in innovating a new 
sound but for creating music so incredible that today's artists apparently feel 
compelled to plunder (referred to, of course, under the more 
respectful-sounding euphemism "sampling"). 
</P>
<P>
 Credit Cube's sample to the 1982 hit "The Message" by Grandmaster Flash & the 
Furious Five. Fortunately, the famed rapper has publicly credited the source. 
</P>
<P>
 Exposing originals such as "The Message" is part of the course for deejay Beej 
and partner Gary Blitz at their latest club installation, Soul Shack. The 
Sunday night gig started two weeks ago at Club 5902 in Huntington Beach, home 
of Beej and Blitz's highly successful Disco 2000 on Thursday nights. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with early rap, Beej rotates a prime selection of rare groove vinyl 
(translated as '60s and '70s funk-heavy tracks), most commonly found on the 
Stax and Motown labels. If many of the twangier tunes evoke images of car races 
and slinky young things with too much makeup, blame it on the tunes' original 
use as soundtracks for blaxploitation flicks of the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the current deluge of old school disco -- which includes some of the 
classics Beej spins Sunday night -- at every nightclub, the fare at Soul Shack 
is decidedly fresh and too funky to sit out. Indeed, for those who initially 
danced till they dropped at D2000 but tired of it when the trend lost its charm 
to mainstream popularity, Soul Shack offers food for the soul and the feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The vigor is owed to both the rediscovery of long-lost classics alternating 
with another category: acid jazz. Like modern rap, acid jazz relies on sampling 
as well as taking inspiration from be-bop. Unlike rap or hip-hop, it's 
decidedly cool with an emphasis on tailored style. Nightclubs would be well 
advised in looking into featuring this form. 
</P>
<P>
 Beej counts on Costa Mesa-based source Jano Baird for his collection of acid 
jazz that features the likes of current acts such as Diana Brown, Brand New 
Heavies and Soul Sonics. 
</P>
<P>
 Weekly, Soul Shack will feature live bands to keep the dance crowd moving 
(last Sunday's act, Goldfish, played such funk covers as Stevie Wonder's 
"Superstition" and Wild Cherry's "Play That Funky Music"). Beej promises 
original acts in weeks to come. 
</P>
<P>
 And the all-night drink specials are a plus if the weekend just about emptied 
your wallet: A single George Washington gets you a 28-ounce pitcher of domestic 
brew, and two of them buy any well drink.

MUSIC; PETERS MARRIES LOVE AND MUSIC IN 'WIDOW' ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, Chris Pasles covers classical music and dance for The Times 
Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For Metropolitan Opera star Roberta Peters, the hard part of Lehar's "The 
Merry Widow" isn't the singing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hard part is to find the real love story that's between Danilo and Hanna 
(the Widow)," Peters said. "All the rest, you can do a lot of fluff here and 
there, but . . . to really get how she challenges him and he challenges her and 
then how they finally really do get together, that's the hard part." 
</P>
<P>
 Peters will be singing the title role for Opera Pacific, Friday through Jan. 
30 at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa. Ron Raines will 
sing Danilo. Mitchell Krieger will conduct. Dorothy Danner will be the stage 
director. Both Krieger and Danner will be working with Opera Pacific for the 
first time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never worked with (Danner) before," Peters said, "but she's got some 
great ideas. She moves me around in a wonderful way. There is a lot of movement 
and dancing and really getting to the story." 
</P>
<P>
 The familiar if complicated plot tells the story of the wealthy Balkan widow, 
Hanna Glawari, and her concealed love for Count Danilo, who is afraid to reveal 
his love for her because he doesn't want to look like just another of her many 
suitors with dollar signs in their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 For Peters, a native New Yorker who concluded a 35-year regular association 
with the Metropolitan Opera in 1985, this "Widow" production meant learning a 
new English translation. "It's not altogether different, but there are some 
different things in it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She also had to learn some new music. "There's a duet in here that's 
absolutely charming -- in the First Act between Danilo and Hanna -- that's not 
in the version I learned. It's in the original. So I'm very happy to put it in, 
and it's very good for the story." 
</P>
<P>
 Peters was 19 when she made her Met debut in 1950 as Zerlina in Mozart's "Don 
Giovanni" as a last-minute replacement. Her official debut as the formidable 
Queen of the Night in Mozart's "Die Zauberflote" had been scheduled for two 
months later. 
</P>
<P>
 During her long and distinguished career at the Met, Peters was especially 
noted for her coloratura roles requiring high, light and agile singing of 
virtuosic arias. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, one of the members of the ('Widow') cast asked me, 'So what is your 
secret of staying in so long?' It's very hard to say. There are lots of 
different reasons. First and foremost, I stayed with the correct repertoire for 
me. I didn't go into too much Puccini. I didn't do 'Toscas.' I stayed with the 
(lighter) 'Lucias,' 'Rigolettos' and 'Barbers' and didn't push my voice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have loved to do a 'Salome' -- I love that kind of (heavy Germanic) 
music -- but not in this lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other thing I had was very supportive help from my family. And I was 
well; that's very helpful. I never had any trouble with my throat -- major 
trouble, like some singers have nodes (on their vocal chords). God forbid! I 
never had nodes in my life. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I was so lucky. I had a wonderful teacher. His name is William Herman. He 
took me as a little girl from the Bronx, who didn't know a thing -- nobody in 
my family ever sang -- and threw me into this completely different world. And, 
of course, I was ready to accept it." 
</P>
<P>
 What: Franz Lehar's "The Merry Widow." 
</P>
<P>
 When: Friday and Saturday, Jan. 21 and 22, and Wednesday, Jan. 26 through Jan. 
29 at 8 p.m.; also Sunday, Jan. 23 and Jan. 30 at 2 p.m.

RAGING AGAINST INSIPID PRESENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thanks for T. Jefferson Parker's lovely piece of writing ("Gaining 
Perspective: Looking Into the Future With an Eye on the Past," Jan. 6). I am 
also peeking reluctantly from between my fingers at a 40th birthday due to 
arrive in a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Although my youth was spent in Sierra Madre, at the foot of the San Gabriel 
Mountains, Parker's lament of the lost glories of O.C. goes double for me -- I 
knew and loved both places as they were. 
</P>
<P>
 I think that it's OK to go out kicking and screaming. Not at aging, but at 
what we now settle for. The last line of Parker's column is 
slam-to-the-diaphragm accurate. 
</P>
<P>
 The consolation is that remembering the past won't age us if raging against 
the insipid present keeps us young. 
</P>
<P>
 I enjoy your columns, both light and dark.

KID STUFF: LIGHTER SIDE OF TUBERS; THE POTATO PEOPLE COME TO COSTA MESA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CORINNE FLOCKEN, Corinne Flocken is a free-lance writer who regularly covers 
Kid Stuff for the Times Orange County Edition.

<P>
 Ah, the potato. High in nutrients and dandy baked, mashed or fried, but let's 
face it: As a source for rollicking family fun, spuds are duds. 
</P>
<P>
 Or so you thought. This weekend, a Canadian touring company making its Orange 
County debut promises to reveal the lighter side of tubers in "Survive the 
Great Outdoors!," a one-hour family show featuring a handful of masked 
characters known as the Potato People. Produced by Theatre Beyond Words of 
Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, the show is recommended for preschoolers through 
senior citizens and features nonverbal theater, puppetry, masks and music. 
</P>
<P>
 The Potato People will perform Sunday, Jan. 23, at 2:30 p.m. and Monday, Jan. 
24, at 9:45 and 11:45 a.m. at the Robert B. Moore Theatre at Orange Coast 
College in Costa Mesa. (Monday's shows are intended for school audiences, but 
single tickets will be available.) 
</P>
<P>
 According to Theatre Beyond Words' managing director, David Paquet, "Survive 
the Great Outdoors!" is one of the newer shows the 15-year-old company has 
built around the Potato family, which includes bustling housewife-at-large 
Momma, bumbling but well-intentioned Poppa and their adorable sprout Nancy. 
</P>
<P>
 In this show, Poppa has been roped into taking Nancy and the neighbor kids, 
Margaret and George Beanstalk, on a camping trip (Momma wisely stays home). The 
outing throws them together with an assortment of Potato and non-Potato 
characters including the clueless Forest Ranger Ralph and several woodland 
critters. Large hand puppets, waltzing trees and "a radio-controlled skunk . . 
. about the size of a small dog" are among the comic visual effects, Paquet 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that though the actors do not speak on stage, there is an "almost 
seamless" background of original music in styles ranging from pop to classical. 
Offstage, actors and crew provide such sound effects as burps, giggles and wild 
animal calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Paquet says the lack of dialogue is one of the main reasons the Potato People 
can reach such a broad age range. "We try to tailor the contents so there is 
lots of slapstick to amuse the children, and some character insights into 
family situations that adults can enjoy. As a viewer, you can provide your own 
subtext (to the action on stage) by throwing in your particular life 
experiences. The basic story is quite clear because of the abilities of the 
artists, but everyone's interpretation of it is different." 
</P>
<P>
 To achieve their potato state, the actors wear large, white masks of 
papier-mache that cover their entire heads. Except for a pair of blank eyes, a 
lumpy nose and some nondescript hair (which Momma enhances with a few 
stylishly-placed curlers), each mask is left expressionless. 
</P>
<P>
 "Again," Paquet explained, "you get to fill in the detail for yourself. The 
masks are neutral, but when (the actors) tilts their heads or thrusts their 
chins, or the light hits them right, you swear you see the characters' 
expressions change." 
</P>
<P>
 The Potato People acts were among the first developed by Theatre Beyond Words 
and, Paquet said, they have remained the most popular, having played venues 
from the Lincoln Center in New York City to the International Children's 
Festival in Spain; they have been seen by some two million people in Canada, 
the U.S., Western Europe and Russia. The Potato People have had guest spots on 
"Sesame Street" and "The Elephant Show," a musical variety program that 
features fellow Canadian entertainers Sharon, Lois and Bram. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheduling conflicts have prevented the group from reaching Southern 
California as often as Paquet would like, although he said that is slowly 
changing. Just prior to their Costa Mesa shows, the Potato People will be 
featured at Dorsey High School in central L.A. in conjunction with L.A.'s Best, 
an outreach project for "at-risk" students co-sponsored by the mayor's office 
and the Music Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Other shows in the Theatre Beyond Words repertoire include "Suite Potato," a 
family-oriented show performed with local symphonies and, for adult audiences, 
"Night Train to Foggy Bottom," a new, movement-based fantasy that Paquet 
describes as "one man's discovery of his past." Company members also teach 
theater courses at Brock University in St. Catharines, Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he said Theatre Beyond Words will continue to experiment with new 
methods and audiences, Paquet expects the Potato People to continue as an 
important staple for the troupe. But, he added, even the venerable Potatoes are 
due for a change. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had some complaints about Momma being too perfect," he acknowledged 
with a laugh. "We're working on making her more laid back; maybe she'll spend 
more time relaxing and less time cleaning. A lot of people have been saying she 
should get out of the house and be a real estate agent or something." 
</P>
<P>
 Poppa, however, will remain the same lovable nincompoop that Paquet says has 
appealed to youngsters for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like to poke fun at authority," Paquet observed. "Basically, the stories 
are written from a child's perspective. The kids are always smart and with it, 
and the adults are usually out to lunch. The kids really love that." 
</P>

SURFING / ROCKIN' FIG & DAVE: COMPETITION GETS GNARLIER IN '94 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rick Fignetti and David Reyes, Rockin' Fig is Rick Fignetti, a Huntington 
Beach surfer/shop owner. Times staff writer David Reyes has reported on U.S. 
surf teams competing in Bali and Brazil. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So Fig, before we talk about the new competitive year for the U.S. Bud Surf 
Tour, where were you during Monday's quake? 
</P>
<P>
 Standing in the doorway with both kids under my arms. I was feeling it and 
wondering when it was going to stop. We live in a three-story building, and I 
was hoping we weren't going to get the pancake effect.  
</P>
<P>
 Any damage at the surf shop? 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, a few used surfboards got rattled out of place and some trophies I kept on 
a glass counter were displaced, but no major damage.  
</P>
<P>
 Now that we're moving back to the topic at hand, what's new for the '94 tour? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, we had 10 events last year, and we have 12 events this year. Even though 
we're in a recession, things are looking up.  
</P>
<P>
 I hear the tour added two competitions in Hawaii and one in Puerto Rico, but 
the latter was dropped. It looks like Ian Cairns, the tour's competition 
director, has been busy. 
</P>
<P>
 Yup, that means the tour has more travel money, but that also means fiercer 
competition in the water.  
</P>
<P>
 According to the tour's '94 schedule, the first contest is in the chilly 
waters off Santa Cruz on Feb. 9. Fig, you announced last year's tour; how was 
Santa Cruz? 
</P>
<P>
 It's sponsored by Billabong of Australia. Since it's smack in the middle of 
winter, Steamer Lane can be going off big time. Last year, it was very windy, 
with some 40-knot onshore winds. But the final days were just perfect, with 
sunny skies and good surf, four- to six-foot.  
</P>
<P>
 I remember it rained so bad the first few days that I was announcing with 
(former pro surfer Wayne) "Rabbit" Bartholomew in the cab of a truck. I had my 
PA system in the truck, the windshield wipers on and a football playoff game on 
the radio. I was giving updates on the game during the contest.  
</P>
<P>
 Who are some surfers we should watch for in '94? 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Machado of Cardiff is the returning champion, although he'll surf on the 
world tour this year and I don't know how many Bud Surf tour events he'll 
enter. But you also have Mister Speed and Power, Taylor Knox of Carlsbad; Chris 
Brown of Santa Barbara and a lot of younger, up-and-coming guys such as Adam 
Replogle of Santa Cruz.  
</P>
<P>
 For spectators eager to view a pro contest, after Santa Cruz the tour will 
visit Seaside in North San Diego County, March 2-6, Pismo Beach, April 20-24; 
Huntington Beach, May 11-15; Oceanside, June 8-12; Ala Moana, Hawaii, June 
21-26; Malibu, July 6-10; Lower Trestles, Sept. 12-18; San Francisco, Oct. 5-9, 
and Makaha, Hawaii, for the tour's championships, Oct. 24-29. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 25 through 28, the tour visits Virginia Beach, Va., for the East Coast 
Surfing Championships. Also, a contest will be held in California July 6-10 at 
a site to be announced later. 
</P>
<P>

 Surfari: Jim Hogan, National Scholastic Surfing Assn. coach, recently returned 
with a group of young Orange County surfers who visited Morocco, on Africa's 
northwestern coast. Sponsored in part by Bruce Hopping of Laguna Beach and the 
Kalos Kagathos Foundation, the group had consistent six-foot and bigger surf. 
Best part of the trip, said Rick Fish, 16, of Newport Beach, was big, though 
stormy, surf conditions. Worst part was the congested Marrakesh marketplace and 
exotic cuisine, which included "hideous" beef and sheep guts. "It was pretty 
nasty," Fish said. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecast: The swell's dropping, but a new storm off Siberia can give us a new 
northwest swell by early next week if it holds together, says 
Surfline/Wavetrak.

DO IT!: THE TIDE'S JUST ABOUT RIGHT FOR A LITTLE EXPLORATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, Rick Vanderknyff is a free-lance writer who regularly 
contributes to The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Low tides make for the best tide-pool exploring, temporarily exposing many of 
the creatures that live in the intertidal zone -- and winter brings the lowest 
tides of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 This weekend offers a couple of prime opportunities with low tides Saturday 
(at 12:51 p.m.) and especially Sunday (at 1:15 p.m.). The county has a number 
of good places to go tide pooling, including Little Corona del Mar, Crystal 
Cove State Beach and sections along Laguna Beach, but one place to explore and 
get a bit of an education is Dana Point's Orange County Marine Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 The institute, which specializes in educational programs about marine science 
and natural history for youths and adults, sits in Dana Point Harbor on the 
edge of a marine-life refuge. It has set up a self-guided tide-pool program for 
youngsters, with seven conservation-oriented activities described in a 
brochure, "Good Tidepooler," available from the institute for 25 cents. The 
activities described are for children ages 4 to 12. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the institute is marking some of the year's best tide pooling with 
a series of programs titled Super (minus-tide) Sundays. The next program, this 
Sunday, is sold out, but space is available on future programs, including Jan. 
30 and dates in March and April. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts from the institute will lead participants on an exploration of the 
varied sea life found just below the surface and will share tips on how to 
explore without damaging the fragile ecosystem. Reservations for the 
family-oriented program are suggested; prices are $3 for adults and $2 for 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 With just a little instruction, said spokesman Harry Helling, tide-pool 
explorers can learn to pick out some of the harder-to-see residents, including 
tide-pool sculpin (a small fish that blends into its environment, 
chameleon-like) and sea hares (a type of snail that can grow to the size of a 
basketball). 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Upper Newport Bay is one of the most-visited birding areas in Southern 
California -- in the country, perhaps -- but most of the activity is 
concentrated along Backbay Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 29, the local Sea & Sage Chapter of the National Audubon Society will 
offer a field trip to the less-visited western side of the bay, where 
University Drive meets Backbay Drive. The trip is led by Doug Toohey and Susan 
Sheakley. 
</P>
<P>
 Toohey said participants may see some unusual species of swallow seen during 
this year's bird count, held earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Non-members of Audubon, including beginning birders, are invited. No 
reservations are needed. Meet at University and Backbay drives at 8 a.m. Bring 
binoculars. There will be about a mile of walking. 
</P>
<P>
 What: Tide-pool program. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Sunday, Jan. 23, from 1 to 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Orange County Marine Institute, 35502 Del Obispo, Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereabouts: From the San Diego (5) Freeway, exit at Camino Las Ramblas and 
head south. Turn left at Del Obispo and follow it to the end. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherewithal: $3 for adults, $2 for children 12 and under.

REWIND: THE CONS ARE PROS IN FUN 'WE'RE NO ANGELS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Christmas lights are back in storage, the New Year's diet is well underway 
and you swear your umpteenth viewing of "It's a Wonderful Life" was your last. 
But one Christmas-oriented film you may have overlooked -- "We're No Angels" -- 
is fun any time of year. 
</P>
<P>
 A light comedy set on Devil's Island in 1895, it stars Humphrey Bogart as a 
forger/embezzler, Aldo Ray as a slow-witted murderer and Peter Ustinov as a 
safecracker with a penchant for manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Bogart is said to have always had a special affection for this film, and it's 
easy to see why. 
</P>
<P>
 A trio of prison escapees (Bogart, Ray and Ustinov), seeking to shed their 
prison garb, are drawn into a clothing shop, where they pose as parolee 
carpenters who volunteer to fix the shopkeeper's leaky roof. 
</P>
<P>
 Their plan: to rob the shop to pay for passage back to France on the steamship 
anchored in the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the process of hanging around the store and its adjoining home, they 
get to know the inept shopkeeper (Leo G. Carroll) and his family -- wife (Joan 
Bennett) and 18-year-old daughter (Gloria Talbott) -- all too well and have a 
change of heart. 
</P>
<P>
 The shopkeeper is drowning in a sea of red ink, and to make matters worse, the 
recently arrived ship has brought with it his tyrannical cousin Andre (Basil 
Rathbone), who plans to spend Christmas going over the books. 
</P>
<P>
 The three cons so ingratiate themselves with the family -- serving as 
unconventional guardian angels -- that they are invited to stay for Christmas 
dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Bogart has no problem rounding up items for the dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 "You guys get everything ready -- I'll go buy a turkey," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Ustinov: "Did you say buy? " 
</P>
<P>
 Bogart: "Well, in honor of the season. It may take a little while. First I 
have to steal the money." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're No Angels" has a happy ending, of course, with Ray's deadly "pet" viper 
playing a pivotal role in the proceedings. DENNIS McLELLAN

HOT LINKS: STROKES ARE STRIKING AT PELICAN HILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT, Patrick Mott is a free-lance writer who regularly contributes 
to The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Yes, it costs a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 And yes, you should save up and play it. 
</P>
<P>
 It's worth breaking into the piggy bank to play the new Links Course at 
Pelican Hill Golf Club for at least two reasons: 1) Here, you get to rip the 
ball a lot, and 2) You get to rip it around some of the most beautiful golfing 
real estate to be had anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The newer of the two courses that make up the Pelican Hill complex on the 
Newport Coast near Corona del Mar, the Links Course, unlike the younger Ocean 
Course, is broad-shouldered, wide and a siren song to the long hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's arguably even more gorgeous than the Ocean Course, which also was 
designed by Tom Fazio and has never been accused of being anything but 
spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
 But where the Ocean Course is a marvel of precision architecture that requires 
equally precise shots (fake rocks even come into play occasionally), the Links 
Course is a big canvas painted with broad strokes, and that allows for what 
might be called informed, uninhibited play. Fazio has said that in the Links 
Course he wanted to offer the golfer "a larger variety of shot-making 
opportunities." Translation: You get to hit the gorilla ball more often. 
</P>
<P>
 And you still get to do it to the accompaniment of ocean views on every hole, 
just like on the Ocean Course. Unlike the Ocean Course, however, there is a 
sense of splendid isolation on some of the holes that work their way through 
natural canyons in which most of the natural hillside vegetation has been 
undisturbed.  
</P>
<P>
 Most of the holes play along an elevated upper plateau, but there are 
elevation changes of 100 to 300 feet as well, which allow for ever-changing 
views of the Pacific and of Newport Beach to the northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 The fairways are invitingly wide for the most part and were designed, Fazio 
said, not only to accommodate long and slightly erratic tee shots but galleries 
for professional tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be possible to use every club in the bag. Because the course was built 
along the lines of the existing terrain, shots can roll into many unintended 
places, and uphill shots that -- when airborne -- appear to be long, can fall 
disappointingly short as a result of both wind and deceptive elevation. 
</P>
<P>
 The greens are splendid. Subtle for the most part, they are neither 
polished-glass fast nor unnaturally slow. Putts can be struck with authority, 
but it pays to remember where the ocean is when you assess the breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Played from the more conventional white tees (there are five tees from which 
to hit), the course is not terribly long at 6,150 yards. The first hole, for 
instance, is a temptingly short 470-yard par 5. Played from the gold 
championship tees, however, even the more accommodating par 4s become daunting, 
and the 17th hole turns into a 543-yard monster. 
</P>
<P>
 About that 17th hole: There may be no more beautiful one in all of Orange 
County. Called "Gut Check," it plays 506 yards from the white tees and offers a 
view from the middle fairway toward the green that is so gorgeous it can almost 
make you forget about the terrible trouble, in the form of a handful of bunkers 
and a steeply sloping hill, that confront the golfer on the right of the green. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't let the name of the course mislead you. "Links" is used awfully loosely 
here. The only relationship it bears to the barren, often unfriendly-looking 
courses in Britain is its proximity to the sea. Otherwise, this is a verdant 
jewel and may be worth the $105 green fee ($125 on Friday, Saturday, Sunday and 
holidays) just to stare at it. But what the heck, treat yourself -- while 
you're there, go ahead and play it, too. A Matter of Course

SPECIAL SCREENING: WAYNE WANG FINDS HUMOR OF CULTURE IN 'CHAN IS MISSING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, Mark Chalon Smith is a free-lancer who regularly writes 
about film for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Joy Luck Club" is such a leap from "Chan Is Missing" that it's hard to 
imagine they were both created by the same guy. 
</P>
<P>
 With "Joy Luck," the scrappy Wayne Wang came in from the cold of the 
movie-making fringe and entered the soft, rich embrace of Hollywood. The result 
was a multimillion-dollar testament to big studio style. 
</P>
<P>
 This recent release, based on Amy Tan's popular novel, is glossy and slick; it 
reels out like dozens of other mainstream films with large aspirations, mostly 
sentimental, and even larger budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's "Chan Is Missing," Wang's earliest feature, made on a $20,000 
grant from the American Film Institute in 1982. It's about as glossy as 
concrete, as slick as a bowl of boiled rice. But "Chan Is Missing" (screening 
Friday as part of UC Irvine's "Tragedy and Comedy" series) has humor and 
underdog gumption. 
</P>
<P>
 The black-and-white comedy also has a historical distinction: It's credited 
with being the first U.S. movie to use an all Asian American cast and technical 
crew. 
</P>
<P>
 Wang was also one of the first directors, if not the first, to believe that 
the lives of Asian Americans were interesting enough to wrap a film around. 
Wang, in sharply unpretentious ways, takes a quirky and revealing look at much 
of the diversity of the Asian American community. 
</P>
<P>
 The plot is a little goofy, as are the heroes, a couple of San Francisco 
cabbies forced by circumstance to become Chinatown sleuths. Jo (played with 
knowing ease by Wood Moy) and his young nephew, Steve (Marc Hayashi), have 
given Chan, a Taiwanese businessman, $4,000 to grease the bureaucratic path on 
their way to a taxi license. 
</P>
<P>
 When Chan vanishes, Steve, "Americanized" to the core, wants to go to the 
cops, but Jo talks him into searching on their own. As they stumble through 
their familiar neighborhood looking for clues, Jo's traditional attitudes butt 
up against Steve's hip take on things. Steve has no interest in learning about 
his culture, but Jo pulls him along anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 On that note, Wang hurls out Asian American stereotypes and cliches and then 
bats them away. Even the teaming of Jo and Steve tickles the inscrutable 
balderdash of Charlie Chan movies, with Steve serving as the "No. 1 son" to 
Jo's wiser detective. Jo even talks about the old flicks, dismissing them as 
cheap laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Wang occasionally resorts to cheap laughs himself. The gags, 
usually tied to the peculiar folks Jo and Steve encounter, can be pushy. The 
eccentricity of a cook they question, a guy wearing a "Samurai Night Fever" 
T-shirt and crooning "Fry Me to the Moon," brings a wince with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Thankfully, though, Wang's excesses are few, and they don't blight "Chan Is 
Missing," nor disrupt its ability to amuse and enlighten. 
</P>
<P>
 What: Wayne Wang's "Chan Is Missing." 
</P>
<P>
 When: Friday, Jan. 21, at 7 and 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: The UC Irvine Student Center Crystal Cove Auditorium, Campus Drive and 
Bridge Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereabouts: Take the San Diego (405) Freeway to Jamboree Road and head south 
to Campus Drive and take a left. Turn right on Bridge Road and head into the 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherewithal: $2 to $4.

KIDS ON FILM: 'IRON WILL' HAS A HEART OF GOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, Jim Washburn is a free-lance writer who contributes regularly 
to The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Disney's "Iron Will," a teen-ager embarks on a grueling dog-sled race in 
1917, from Winnipeg, Manitoba, to St. Paul, Minn. In it he is pitted against 
"the meanest stretch of land God ever put together" as well as human 
adversaries who are equally lacking in manners. (Rated PG)  
</P>
<P>
 There are some movies that make viewers want to shout and applaud. Rarer still 
are the ones that actually do make them shout and applaud. That's just the 
effect "Iron Will" had on its audience, largely children with parents, at a 
recent screening in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Though its title suggests a Schwarzenegger blow-'em-up, in this case Iron Will 
is a nickname given to Will Stoneman (Mackenzie Astin), a 17-year-old who, 
though he has witnessed the sledding death of his father, enters a torturous 
522-mile dog-sled race to win the money to save his family's farm. 
</P>
<P>
 This is one of the most Disney Disney films in years, and, as such, it doesn't 
want for simple plot devices or stereotypes. In it, cynical newspaperman Harry 
Kingsley (Kevin Spacey) trumps up the tale of Will and the race with the 
hyperbole common in 1917 to a nation needing heroes, and the film's makers have 
nearly done the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Will is about as good and pure as a character gets, as are his briefly met 
father and Native American friend Ned Dodd (August Schellenberg), who trains 
him for the race. On the darker side are villainous robber barons, vicious dogs 
and sledding rival Borg Guillarson (George Gerdes), who is one mean Swede. 
</P>
<P>
 But even with such pat delineations and the outcome nearly guaranteed, 
first-time film director Charles Haid (formerly in front of the camera on TV's 
"Hill Street Blues") has created an exciting, heart-tugging movie, crafted with 
a story-propelling surety and some moments of pure cinematic grace. 
</P>
<P>
 "Iron Will" is as decidedly un-modern as its rural 1917 setting. The closest 
thing to profanity in it is newsman Kingsley's utterance, "Holy Chicago." And, 
unlike most of the filmic fare kids see now, there are no high-tech special 
effects, ultra-violent scenes or exploding cars. Instead, there is just a boy, 
his dogs and a lot of snow. OK, plus a dog-kicking Swede and a cliff or two. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the kids questioned felt shortchanged by "Iron Will's" old-fashioned 
qualities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't need a lot of effects to make it good. It was an exciting story 
already," said Ryan Stockwell, 10, of Costa Mesa. As is often the case with 
climactic competition films, Ryan's (and other kids') favorite part was the 
end. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Will's father wasn't in the film much, a little bit of a good dad 
clearly goes a long way with children: Ryan said it made him sad when Will's 
dad's sled slid into the river. Other kids said they were disturbed by the 
scene as well, though Ryan's 6-year-old sister, Amanda, said it didn't bother 
her especially. She's made of stern stuff; I was blubbering then, and at all 
the other expected junctures of the tale.  
</P>
<P>
 "I also didn't like when that guy was so mean," declared James Winegar, 7, of 
Newport Beach, referring to Borg, who does spend a disproportionate amount of 
his screen time sneering at his rivals, brandishing knives and whipping dogs. 
Outside of that, James said, "I liked it a lot -- the dogs, the race, the whole 
thing. I saw 'Mrs. Doubtfire' and 'The Air Up There,' and I liked this the 
most. It had everything." 
</P>
<P>
 While at least one 3-year-old fell asleep during the film's hour-and-49-minute 
running time, and his 5-year-old brother grew restless until the end roused 
him, other kids found it engrossing throughout, and worthy of cheer at the 
finish line. Their parents were no less enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan and Amanda's dad, Bob Stockwell, said: "It was a good human interest 
story. It had a true ring to it. It reminds me of all the Jack London stories I 
read as a kid."

RESTAURANTS: BIG CAJUN AND PHILIPPINE TASTES COME IN SMALL VENUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON, Max Jacobson is a free-lance writer who reviews restaurants 
weekly for The Times Orange County Edition.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two newly opened pint-sized restaurants, Jack Shrimp and Manila Sunset, 
couldn't be more different. One specializes in a nifty Louisiana-style shrimp 
boil with a few surprising twists. The other is making a valiant attempt to 
introduce Filipino cuisine to central Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Killer Shrimp in Marina del Rey and Studio City, Jack Shrimp serves a 
spicy bowlful of shrimp and a giant basket of French bread with which to soak 
up the broth. The family resemblance is no coincidence -- Jack Shrimp owner 
Jack Jasper is the brother of one of the creative forces behind Killer Shrimp. 
At the Killer Shrimp restaurants, though, there's nothing on the menu but 
shrimp; at Jack Shrimp you can also get such Cajun fare as jambalaya or a 
sensationally spicy artichoke. 
</P>
<P>
 This modest cafe (it's just a few inside tables and a glass-enclosed patio 
facing Pacific Coast Highway) is actually the third for Jasper, and the one he 
hopes will be permanent. You might have seen Jasper's first place on the Balboa 
peninsula, or the second one on the Newport Beach site that now houses a 
Caribbean restaurant named Mango.  
</P>
<P>
 The concept is simple. Jack shrimp (the dish) consists of eight to 10 huge, 
plump Gulf shrimp, still in their shells, bobbing around in a rich, piquant red 
sauce that Jasper simmers from early morning to late afternoon. It's the sauce 
that gets you hooked, but Jasper hedged when I asked him for the recipe. It's 
enriched with oil and appears to contain no tomato whatsoever but lots of 
various peppers and spices. 
</P>
<P>
 Personally, I find this dish almost irresistible, spicier and more complex 
than its L.A. area counterpart. The good French bread comes from Newport's 
C'Est Si Bon bakery, thickly sliced and served in a huge basket. Jasper will 
probably come to your table to give you a little friendly advice before you dig 
in. "Let the shrimp cool," he'll tell you," and they will be a lot easier to 
peel." 
</P>
<P>
 You could start off the meal with a crunchy, lightly dressed Caesar salad, a 
patrician model that definitely looks as if it's slumming on its plastic plate. 
The Cajun artichoke is memorable. It's really just a well-steamed artichoke, 
but it's served with what Jasper calls "Cajunaise," a spicy, pink-tinted cross 
between remoulade and mayonnaise that makes a great dip. I'm also a fan of the 
jambalaya, which is made with Louisiana andouille sausage, boneless chicken 
breast, onions, green peppers and a plateful of rice. 
</P>
<P>
 Wash it all down with a bottle of ice cold Dixie beer. For dessert, there is 
an unctuous rum-flavored pecan pie from the Balboa Dessert Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Shrimp is moderately priced. Appetizers are $2 to $3.95. Main dishes are 
$9.95 to $11.95. Dessert is $3.50. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Manila Sunset in Fountain Valley is the seventh for this family-owned Filipino 
chain, and the first branch in Orange County. It's all yellow inside: chairs, 
walls, table tops. The only decorations are the odd bit of rattan here and 
there, the sort of stuff students buy at a Cost Plus when they move into their 
first apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be a tall order getting locals to embrace the exotic menu, which 
reflects the Philippines' unique blend of Chinese, Spanish and Pacific 
overtures. But price may help. Incredibly (this is probably the secret of the 
chain's success), no dish on the menu costs more than $3. 
</P>
<P>
 Ease into the Filipino menu with lumpiang Shanghai: dense, crisp, cigar-sized 
egg rolls with a gently spiced meat filling. Later on, you might want to try 
lumpiang prito , a fried vegetable roll with a rice paper skin. The filling is 
celery, garbanzo bean, bean sprouts and diced carrot. Or pancit malabon , 
stubby little rice noodles topped with boiled shrimp, chopped egg and the 
special Sunset malabon sauce, which I'd describe as bland and sweet. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicken sotonghon is a light, delicately flavored chicken soup with 
thread-thin transparent noodles made from mung bean flour. Adobo , one of the 
most popular dishes in the Philippines, is meat (generally pork or chicken, as 
here) stewed with soy and vinegar. Both the pork and chicken models are fine.  
</P>
<P>
 However, I have to express reservations about lechon kawale , which is chunks 
of fatty fried pork still attached to the porker's skin. It may be a favorite 
in the islands, where fats are at a premium, but here, the idea feels 
indulgent. Bopis is going to be an even harder sell. It's a stew made from the 
heart and spleen of pork, primal enough to make even a hardened food journalist 
take a deep breath. 
</P>
<P>
 But that brings us to the best dish here, the remarkable bibingka , a miracle 
for $2.25. It's made from galapong (wet rice flour), cheese and egg. The top is 
lightly dusted with sugar, and the dish faintly resembles a cheese souffle that 
you'd find in a back-street Paris cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 There are drinks like the outre sago at gulaman , containing tear-sized drops 
of tapioca flour and red food coloring. The best dessert is probably macapuno 
con hielo , shaved ice with palm sugar and an abundant helping of shredded 
young coconut.  
</P>
<P>
 I'm not going to guarantee that it will be to your taste, but at these prices, 
who cares? So a big malamat salamat po ("welcome," in Tagalog) to you, and see 
ya down at the cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 Manila Sunset is inexpensive. Nothing on the menu is more than $3.

ROGER RABBIT'S CREATOR REVISITS HIS IMAGINATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin could count at least one unabashed fan long 
before it opened to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Wolf, who created the ride's scatterbrained hero in his 1981 novel, "Who 
Censored Roger Rabbit?" (on which the movie "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" was 
based), got a chance to check out the attraction in October, while he was in 
town on other business. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a whole new kind of ride. The way that it's done, it's mind-boggling," 
Wolf said by phone from his home just outside Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Many writers are deeply disappointed when their works are turned into movies 
or otherwise realized, but Wolf said he has been ecstatic with Disney, both for 
the movie and for the look and feel of Toontown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love Toontown. That is as good a job of creating a tangible entity from an 
imaginary place as any I've ever seen in my life. The concept of Toontown from 
the book is realized," he said. His first walk through Toontown was "kind of an 
eerie experience. . . . It's kind of like walking through my own imagination." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for Roger Rabbit, he has said, was something he worked out over his 
kitchen table, primarily to amuse himself; now Roger is a cartoon character 
recognized around the world. He lives on in Disney-produced cartoon shorts and 
in Wolf's own books. "Roger's kind of opened a lot of doors for me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf's second novel based on the character was published in 1992, "Who 
P-P-P-Plugged Roger Rabbit?" He's at work on a third, which incorporates a real 
movie star, the late Gary Cooper, and will be published as a graphic novel 
(sort of a high-rent comic book). Plans for a movie sequel have been long 
delayed, but Wolf said he has heard that the studio has accepted a final script 
and is preparing to proceed with production. Although Disney has optioned his 
second novel, the coming movie is not based on it, and Wolf is not directly 
involved in the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would just as soon not get involved in writing screenplays," he said. "I 
get to put in my two cents' worth, and that's enough for me." RICK VANDERKNYFF

PARKER'S PLACE: A STUDY IN DISORGANIZATION; T. JEFFERSON PARKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T. Jefferson Parker is a novelist and writer who lives in Orange County. His 
column appears in OC Live! the first three Thursdays of every month. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the keen observer gets three Christmas presents that are all basically 
for the same purpose, he can't help but detect an implied message. When the 
gifts come from people very important in the observer's life, the message is 
magnified, often displayed in bright neon, and demands reflection. 
</P>
<P>
 In my case, the gifts in question were all dedicated to helping me "organize" 
my life: a "Calendar & Journal for Personal Reflection," an appointment book 
(subtitled "A Personal Record and Useful Reference") and something called an 
"Executive Planning System." They came from people who know me well. 
</P>
<P>
 My first reaction was the warmth and happiness you always feel when someone 
gives you something. The photographs in the journal are stunningly good, and 
the accompanying biblical quotes profound and spiritually lifting. The personal 
record book has gold-leafed pages and fascinating essays at the beginning of 
each month. The executive planner has information on everything from interest 
rates to international climate and is housed in leather that smells so good you 
can whiff it from a yard away. I smiled and fondled the items, happy and 
grateful. 
</P>
<P>
 My second reaction was, who needs to be more organized? If you know your 
obligations for the next two days, have gas in the car and enough cigarettes 
for the next two hours, you've pretty much got it boxed. Besides, I thought, 
I'm a pretty damned well organized guy to begin with, aren't I? 
</P>
<P>
 I toured the house to confirm my organizational skill level. The kitchen and 
dining room were neat, because I rarely cook and prefer to eat standing over 
the sink. 
</P>
<P>
 The bedroom was kind of a mess, but you're allowed to have a 
less-than-clinically clean bedroom, aren't you? The living room looked fine, 
except for the old Esquire magazines, Cabela's catalogues and scores of rocks I 
collected a year ago up near Trona and more or less dumped on the floor near 
the fireplace. Yes, November's sample election ballot was still leaned up 
against a sofa, but it had what must be a critical phone number scribbled on 
it, thus earning its space. Hmmm. 
</P>
<P>
 Confidence dwindling, I peeked into my study, a room whose brute chaos is, 
quite simply, astonishing. You don't really enter this room in the conventional 
sense; you approach it, lean like an inquiring butler toward it and devise an 
entry strategy.  
</P>
<P>
 Impatient, and eager to affirm my organizer's skills, I penetrated the room 
using the blitzing linebacker's method: a quick stutter-step, then a sprint 
into the fray, knees bent, head up, eyes alert, arms lowered to hurl obstacles 
from my path. 
</P>
<P>
 It was stuffed with a writer's tools: typewriter, computer, stacks of note 
pads, books by the hundreds. This is OK, I mused -- a worker needs a place to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also a storage place for guitars and amplifiers, golf clubs, valued 
pictures, architectural drawings for an add-on, stacks of letters, a collection 
of empty wine bottles once filled with my father's wine from up in Mendocino 
County, fishing poles, vests and tackle, towering piles of newspapers, shopping 
bags full of the past years' tax information, paintings stacked for lack of 
wall space, an enormously useless sofa piled high with blankets, pillows, a 
telephone, more newspapers, the outline for my new book. 
</P>
<P>
 It was actually impossible to sit on the sofa without first climbing over a 
coffee table invisible beneath an avalanche of more books, magazines, paper, a 
hiking canteen, a Scrabble game, and -- for purposes mysterious to me -- a box 
of Baby Fresh unscented wipes (84 count). 
</P>
<P>
 I stood amid the ruin and, inching my feet by small degrees, slowly surveyed 
the whole sorry mess. The epiphany came hard and fast: My friends and relatives 
were right -- I'm disorganized. I struggled from the room, fled upstairs to the 
relative calm of the bedroom, and, panting, tried to figure out what to do. 
</P>
<P>
 I took a nap. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon waking, I found that my problems hadn't gone away, though I'd had a 
wonderful dream about being in the military with Drew Barrymore as my 
commanding officer. 
</P>
<P>
 I took up the Personal Reference and Useful Record book and under Jan. 13 
wrote: "House a bit disorganized. Must improve surroundings." Under the same 
date in the Calendar & Journal for Personal Reflection, I noted: "Chaos of 
house equals chaos of mind -- work to be done on both fronts." Opening the 
impressive Executive Planning System to the right date, I neatly penned: "Am 
living like a common barnyard swine. Get a grip." 
</P>
<P>
 Since a task well begun is half done, I did nothing for the next few days, 
avoiding the house altogether in favor of tennis, visiting friends, doing 
errands. Then with a burst of pure animal energy, I decided to begin with the 
bedroom and pump up my organizing muscles before tackling the Augean stable of 
my study. 
</P>
<P>
 I pulled all the albums, tapes and CDs from the cabinets, intending to replace 
them alphabetically. I took my dysfunctional tape player and CD player to the 
driveway, smashed them gleefully into the asphalt, then swept up the shards. 
</P>
<P>
 One hour later, with all of that good music still strewn on the floor, I gave 
up the daunting task and went down to my favorite restaurant for a little R & 
R. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that night, morose, I viewed the Dresden of my bedroom with a tired eye, 
but managed to refile most of the music, roughly -- though not wholly -- 
alphabetized in the cabinet. Feeling only faintly victorious, I went to sleep 
with the conviction that the next day was D-day for the study. 
</P>
<P>
 I woke to a pristine winter morning, Southern California style: temperature 
mid-60s, offshore breezes sending the smog to Catalina, an atmosphere of 
optical purity. Lizards darted, quiet as shadows. Vultures glided to the north. 
I took a deep breath, smelled the wild aroma of the scrub and thanked Whomever 
once again that I was alive here at the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I achieved the study, ignored the mess and got comfortable at the writing 
desk, where I labored hard and with some reward on a story. Five hours later I 
fought my way back out and slammed the door on it all. 
</P>
<P>
 As of this writing, there has been only minimal improvement in my 
organization, but the Executive Planning System, Calendar & Journal and 
Personal Record and Useful Reference are filled with pithy remarks about my 
incremental progress. 
</P>
<P>
 I've penciled in February as the true start-up month for 1994's organizational 
overhaul, though it could well end up being March, or possibly December. 
</P>
<P>
 Entry in the Calendar & Journal for Jan. 18: "Am still mentally preparing for 
big February offensive. In meantime, book goes well and chaos seems negotiable, 
sometimes even comforting. Those who can, organize; those who can't, write."

BENTSEN THE SOUVENIR HUNTER IS AN IRREGULAR KIND OF GUY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Moscow, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen violated Russian currency laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he may be contemplating a violation of U.S. Customs regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, sort of. 
</P>
<P>
 During President Clinton's summit in Moscow last week, Bentsen visited a 
recently privatized chocolate factory and paid for a 100-ruble share in the 
company with a $20 bill -- despite a recently imposed regulation blocking 
transactions in any currency other than the ruble. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that the share was worth about 8 cents and that the secretary was 
demonstrating his faith in Russian private enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 In Beijing on Wednesday, he admired a screen placed behind the chairs where he 
sat during a meeting with Premier Li Peng. 
</P>
<P>
 During a picture-taking session at the start of the meeting, he said he had 
purchased several such screens during a previous visit to Beijing, in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I understand why you have such a big trade surplus," he said 
flatteringly. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind the balance of trade, Li suggested. Such purchases "would not be 
counted in the trade surplus because you would not go through the formalities 
of the customs." 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen seemed to contemplate the prospect of making a purchase and slipping 
back into the United States without having his baggage examined -- a courtesy 
offered to VIPs, although they are on their honor to complete a written customs 
declaration listing overseas purchases and to pay a tax on goods worth more 
than $400. 
</P>
<P>
 A grin crossed his face as he said, "Maybe . . ."

ERICA GLASER WALLACH; EVADED NAZIS, SPANISH FASCISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Erica Glaser Wallach, 71, who evaded Nazis in Germany, fascists in Spain and a 
Soviet death sentence. At the height of the Cold War, Mrs. Wallach spent five 
years in Communist prisons on fabricated espionage charges.She was released in 
1955 after the Soviets, without explanation, declared her innocent. A nurse for 
the loyalist side in the Spanish civil war, she tried to flee to France after 
fascist Francisco Franco's victory, but was placed in an internment camp. She 
was rescued by Noel Field, a member of the Disarmament Committee of the League 
of Nations. During World War II, Mrs. Wallach worked in Switzerland for the 
anti-German Resistance and, for a year after the war, for the U.S. Office of 
Strategic Services (the predecessor of the CIA) in Germany. In 1950, she 
traveled to East Berlin to obtain information about Field and his wife, who had 
been arrested, and was arrested herself. She was sentenced to death on 
espionage charges in 1952, but after Soviet leader Josef Stalin died her 
sentence was commuted to 15 years in a Siberian labor camp. Mrs. Wallach came 
to the United States in 1957 and wrote a popular book about her life, "Light at 
Midnight." Her story has also been the subject of a documentary and play. A 
second documentary is planned. In Warrenton, Va., on Dec. 22 of cancer, her son

SHOOTING SUSPECT FAILS TO RESPOND TO INDICTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The man accused of opening fire on a crowded commuter train appeared in court 
Wednesday but refused to respond to the 93-count indictment charging him with 
killing six passengers and wounding 19 others. 
</P>
<P>
 Nassau County Judge Donald Belfi entered a plea of not guilty on Colin A. 
Ferguson's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 A grand jury indictment handed up Tuesday charges Ferguson with murder, 
attempted murder, 25 counts of civil rights violations and other crimes in the 
Dec. 7 Long Island Rail Road shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson, 36, would not even say his name aloud, unlike prior appearances in 
which he addressed the court at length about purported ailments and a desire to 
change attorneys. Belfi sent Ferguson to jail to await trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Falanga, his court-appointed attorney, said he would ask to have the 
trial moved because police had charged publicly that Ferguson, of the New York 
City borough of Brooklyn, specifically targeted his attack on Nassau County. 
The county lies just outside New York City.

 Alex Trebek, modern-day Nostradamus: The 1994 "Jeopardy" desk calendar, which 
has a stumper for each day of the year, offered this quiz answer on the page 
devoted to last Monday: "In the lyrics that end, 'Ring-around-the-rosy,' this 
occurs."

 Thank you, looters: Seventeen years ago, Carol Schatz bought a Japanese-style 
house in Beverly Hills that came with two stone Buddhas in the front yard. She 
had thought of removing the figures but decided they were so heavy it wasn't 
worth the trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the quake struck, knocking one of the Buddhas down a hill and into the 
street where it struck the car of her husband, Fred. He left the statue sitting 
on the curb. "Within an hour," he said, "someone had stolen it." 
</P>

 He said he's considering moving the other Buddha to the same spot.

 When opportunity comes crashing: Robert Scott of Las Vegas had come to L.A. to 
sell Martin Luther King T-shirts on Monday. The King shirts didn't sell well,

T-shirt he printed up: "Thank God I Survived California's 6.6 Quake."

 A store at Santa Monica's mall, The Place, had previously announced that at 8 
a.m. that day, 10,000 figurines from the animated children's TV show "Mighty 
Morphin Power Rangers" would go on sale -- the first availability of the 
popular teen-age superheroes in several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Paul Mones, who arrived at 3:55 a.m. to make a buy for his son, said 
there were about 150 people standing outside the building when the quake 
struck. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked up and could see the Santa Monica Place sign swaying, hear glass 
exploding and bricks falling within 15 feet of us," Mones said. "Kids were 
screaming and there was a mad rush for the center of the street."

 Though Mones dislocated his shoulder in the wild scramble, he reflected on how 
fortunate he was: "It could have been the last toy I ever went to buy."

SCOTT HARRIS: IN STRESSFUL TIMES WE QUESTION GOD, BUT TURN TO MOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By SCOTT HARRIS

<TEXT>
<P>
 When the power was back on, when the images of devastation emerged from the TV 
screen, 7-year-old Leslie turned to his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can God let those things happen?" 
</P>
<P>
 Different people would offer different answers. One might be: "There is no 
God, kid. What more proof do you need?" But Lita is raising her children as 
Christians. She struggled to explain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him, 'God is tired from bad people. He's tired from the people killing 
each other. From kids killing parents, parents abusing kids. He wants everybody 
to change. He wants everybody to have a chance to change. So he lets those 
things happen." 
</P>
<P>
 It is accepted that He works in mysterious ways. Innocent people suffer, Lita 
told her son, to warn everybody, especially the bad people.  
</P>
<P>
 Leslie put it in His own words. 
</P>
<P>
 "God didn't want to do this, and He feels sorry," the boy explained. "But He 
had to do so the people will change a little bit."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We question God, but we turn to Mom. We wonder about the existence of one; if 
not for the other, we wouldn't exist. The image of God is of the Father, a 
bearded sage reaching to Adam on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. But it is 
Mother Nature, Mother Earth, who nurtures and provides. Dad is the 
disciplinarian. Mom kisses us to make it better. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, I don't ask Mom much about God or why the world is so unfair. But 
when the phone rang Monday morning, there was little question who was calling. 
Those instincts kick in every time. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, I told her, everything's fine. My old house danced but it didn't slide 
down the slope. Some glass broke and the power is out, I told her, but 
everything's OK. How are things down in Santa Ana? 
</P>
<P>
 "We're worried about you." This is a given from the woman who once gave 
homemade "earthquake survival kits" at Christmas. "They seem to be coming 
closer and closer." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't they though. 
</P>
<P>
 On the morning of Feb. 9, 1971, I was awakened by my father's shouts in time 
to realize that my bed was rolling across the room. The epicenter, in Sylmar, 
was almost 70 miles away, but fearful moms and dads pressured school officials 
to tear down and rebuild several schools that had been constructed before codes 
adopted after the 1933 Long Beach quake. My junior high was one. 
</P>
<P>
 For the next 16 years, though I always lived here in earthquake country, I 
never felt more than a minor tremor. Then, on Oct. 1, 1987, the roar and crash 
of the Whittier quake had me running for my life. I was almost out the front 
door when it dawned on me that it would be better to die indoors than risk 
arrest for indecent exposure. I planted myself in a doorway -- an interior 
doorway. My cat, Lou, no dummy, got between my feet and dug his claws into the 
carpet. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Mom, they're coming closer -- in interval and proximity. The Loma Prieta 
quake in '89, which scattered devastation around the Bay Area and communities 
to the south, showed us what a 7.1 temblor could do. In the last four years, we 
Southern Californians have been rocked by Upland in '90, Sierra Madre in '91, 
and Joshua Tree and the "twin temblors" of Big Bear and Landers in '92. And now 
the monster from Northridge, still alive with its aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Mom has always told us to be ready, though it took a while for the message to 
sink in with her youngest. After the Whittier quake, I hired a structural 
engineer to draw up plans for seismic reinforcement of a hillside house that 
wasn't even bolted to its foundation. It wasn't until after Sierra Madre that I 
finally hired a contractor to do the work, including installation of plywood 
panels that engineers say might have prevented the deadly disaster at the 
Northridge Meadows apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 The house has been on the market for seven months. Suddenly, the bolts and 
plywood seem like an excellent selling point. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lita is a housekeeper who has become a friend. We stood in my kitchen 
Wednesday morning, debating the relative merits of God and science, as Leslie, 
who wants "to write movies" when he grows up, watched cartoons in the living 
room. 
</P>
<P>
 Lita shrugged. Just as my mother pestered me to be ready, Leslie knows to get 
under a doorway. Still, Lita is of the mind that, no matter what, you can't be 
completely safe. You never know when the ground might open up and swallow your 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 That happened in an earthquake back in Guatemala, Lita said, when she was just 
a little girl. In her grandpa's town, an old village built entirely of adobe, 
not a single home was left standing. Entire families died. Miraculously, 
everyone in Lita's family survived. God, Lita suggests, wants us to reinforce 
our souls. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell Leslie, 'We have to really be good inside. Because whatever happens, 
we have to be ready.' "

NOW, THE FOLLOW-UP; A KEY PART OF THE POST-QUAKE STRUGGLE LIES IN WASHINGTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To his credit, President Clinton now knows firsthand what this region needs in 
order to recover from Monday's earthquake. His visit Wednesday was relatively 
brief but he saw fallen freeways, spoke with residents of the hard-hit San 
Fernando Valley, heard requests for help from local officials and even rode out 
some sizable aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he must return to Washington and follow up on his promises to ask Congress 
for an emergency appropriation of federal aid for Los Angeles and to work with 
local officials in California for waiver of a federal requirement so that a 
matching-funds figure can be lowered from 25% to 10%. He knows enough about 
California's recent economic problems to recognize that it is unrealistic for a 
state mired in recession to come up with even 25%. For its part, California's 
congressional delegation must hang together to make sure that the infusion of 
federal aid gets here as fast as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the most obvious need for U.S. aid is in helping rebuild the fallen 
freeways, Washington can also help provide emergency housing assistance. As 
Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Henry G. Cisneros said Wednesday, 
our post-quake housing crisis has yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 4,000 people are in emergency shelters after being ordered out of 
damaged houses, apartments and mobile homes. An estimated 20,000 are camping 
out in parks, driveways and automobiles, preferring to be outside while the 
aftershocks continue. 
</P>
<P>
 Many victims will need help to rebuild, repair or relocate to permanent 
housing. Most will qualify for temporary housing assistance checks provided by 
the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Homeowners and tenants qualify for 
this help, which, for up to 18 months, covers rents typical for an area. They 
can expect a check within a week of making an application. 
</P>
<P>
 To speed that process, FEMA is taking applications by telephone and expects to 
open a dozen new centers Thursday. Using a similar process after the recent 
brush fires, FEMA issued checks within two or three days of getting 
applications. That fast delivery was made possible because federal disaster 
relief workers now use hand-held computers, eliminating time-consuming 
paperwork. The new technology was just one of the many improvements made under 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA can also provide aid for small repairs and grants for such needs as 
replacing essential household items. Those grants, which are typically awarded 
to people on fixed incomes, can also be used to pay for quake-related medical 
expenses or funerals. In addition, the disaster relief agency provides 
low-interest loans, which are processed by the Small Business Administration, 
to cover the loss of uninsured residential property and personal effects. 
</P>
<P>
 When government checks arrive, newly homeless people can turn to the city 
housing department for help in finding an apartment. Housing officials have 
already begun to contact apartment owners in the hardest-hit areas to find 
vacancies. The recently recorded vacancy rate of 10% in the San Fernando Valley 
should offer a substantial source of replacement housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros also has allocated $100 million from reserve funds for 3,000 new 
subsidized rental vouchers known as Section 8 certificates for poor tenants. A 
good first step -- but just a start in the rebuilding process.

 PRESIDENT CLINTON'S FIRST YEAR: WHY THE PROMISE OF SUCCESS REMAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Today President Clinton celebrates his first anniversary as President, and on 
the whole it ought to be a happy occasion for the 47-year-old politician from 
Arkansas. Clinton came into office on a promise to do something about America's 
social and economic problems, and there's no doubt that he has been a dynamic 
bundle of nearly round-the clock activity. If effort were everything this first 
year would have been an unmitigated winner. But effort isn't everything. 
</P>
<P>
 CLINTON AND CONGRESS: People who count such things point out that Clinton has 
won 88.6% of his legislative battles, more than any President since Dwight D. 
Eisenhower, including the legendary persuader Lyndon B. Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't easy, but Clinton managed to sell Congress on a budget aimed at 
cooling off the nation's deficit spending. And the President has begun to 
deliver on his commitments to de-escalate the highly polarized debate over the 
preservation of key but increasingly threatened federal resources such as 
wetlands, ancient forests and endangered species and to ease the dispute over 
mining and grazing on federal land. 
</P>
<P>
 And early in the term, though he stumbled badly on the issue of gays in the 
military, Clinton did right by lifting the gag order on doctors at federally 
funded family-planning clinics as well as the ban on fetal tissue research, and 
by signing the Family and Medical Leave Act. 
</P>
<P>
 THE DOMESTIC FOCUS: In what may be a trademark feature, the Administration 
rarely has hesitated to take aim at social and economic issues that have 
befuddled America for years. The President, with help from his wife, Hillary 
Rodham Clinton, merits high praise for leadership in proposing long-overdue 
health care reform. On another thorny issue, Clinton's welfare task force is 
examining all the hot-button options -- time-limited benefits, mandatory work 
requirements and other so-called tough-love reforms that most Democrats would 
have found anathema a decade ago. Although no bills have yet been introduced, 
Clinton gets credit for helping to firm up the new bipartisan bottom line: No 
work, no pay. That significant and critical consensus ought to be exploited 
now. But the Administration's game plan, as we understand it, is to concentrate 
on health care reform this year and get around to welfare later in the term. 
Why? Welfare reform is politically doable, while health care reform is much 
more problematic. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton certainly deserves high marks for taking on what previous 
administrations have ducked. For instance, in an impassioned speech to black 
ministers in November, the President invoked the memory of Dr. Martin Luther 
King Jr. to challenge the black community to tackle illegitimacy, crime and 
other pervasive ills. 
</P>
<P>
 APPOINTMENTS: The President got a lamentably slow start on filling the huge 
number of vacant federal judgeships he inherited. But he has made significant 
headway and won praise for the range and caliber of his nominees. Most notable 
perhaps has been his appointment of Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the U.S. Supreme 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in other respects the appointment process remains in considerable 
disarray, and many top positions remain unfilled. Lani Guinier, Clinton's 
choice for the top civil rights post in the Justice Department, wasn't the only 
nominee done in by political misfires. Clinton's first selection for attorney 
general, Zoe Baird, ran into trouble and ultimately imploded, as did his 
second. On Tuesday retired Adm. Bobby Ray Inman withdrew as the President's 
candidate for defense secretary. The National Labor Relations Board still lacks 
a quorum as the nomination of Bill Gould remains in limbo. 
</P>
<P>
 FOREIGN POLICY: Congressional approval of the North American Free Trade 
Agreement may be Clinton's greatest policy success so far. He pulled out all 
the stops and put his prestige on the line -- as he did with our allies abroad 
in nailing down the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade after years of 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration has been steadfast in supporting Russian President Boris N. 
Yeltsin. However, that steadiness stood out against too many foreign policy 
inconsistencies and vacillations. Like other presidents, Clinton has had to 
learn valuable foreign policy lessons on the job. The lesson he learned in 
Somalia is the need to be clear about the mission of any foreign intervention 
and to not exceed that mission. The deadline he set for full U.S. withdrawal 
from Somalia should help put that no-win situation behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 Haiti and Bosnia gave Clinton a lesson that should not have been needed: 
Never, ever, make threats that the country is unwilling or incapable of 
carrying out. Vacillation over Bosnia made the President look feeble and 
without leadership skills in the face of a clear humanitarian outrage. In 
Haiti, the hasty retreat ordered for U.S. forces in response to a demonstration 
by a handful of street thugs made the United States look ridiculous and 
powerless. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Middle East, the Administration inherited a beneficial process and has 
been able to keep it going. It cannot yet claim any credit for brokering a 
breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
 The picture on Asia is promising. Clinton wisely recognizes that the United 
States can and should capitalize on the economic boom in most of Asia. But 
sticky problems remain with Japan and China. 
</P>
<P>
 THE POLITICAL CLOUD: Clinton's delaying and his contradictory answers to the 
continuing questions about his involvement in the Whitewater affair didn't help 
to shake his "Slick Willie" nickname. But, overall, he gives evidence of 
growing in the job. At the same time the national economy shows signs of life. 
A healthy economy can be a President's biggest political asset. If Clinton can 
learn from his first-year mistakes and the economy can return to its former 
healthy self, his presidency may prove to be a strong one indeed.

REDEFINING NATO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The Jan. 13 Commentary page had yes and no articles on opening NATO 
membership to Eastern European countries. However, neither addressed the 
fundamental question of the role of NATO in the total system of global 
governance. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of NATO should be the security of Europe, including the prevention 
or stopping of wars like that in (former) Yugoslavia. To emphasize the change 
in purpose, Russia should be the first to join. Russian cooperation in 
maintaining the security of Europe would preclude Russian aggression. 
</P>
<P>
 The Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe is now trying to stop the 
Armenian war. That task would be much easier if they had the military support 
of NATO. These ethnic wars will stop only when the oppression of minorities is 
stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 CSCE has adopted human rights rules to protect minorities but has no effective 
way to enforce them. NATO and CSCE should be combined into one organization to 
impose security and cooperation in Europe. There are 25 million Russians living 
in the countries surrounding Russia. CSCE-NATO, not Russia, should protect 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Not too long ago, federal military forces were used in this country to protect 
minorities against segregation. We should anticipate that NATO forces will be 
used to do the same in Europe. Instead of deciding who should join NATO, we 
must establish what system of global governance we want and change our 
institutions accordingly. 
</P>

 * It is in the interest of the United States and Western Europe that NATO 
should begin proceedings to incorporate the Central European countries of 
Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
 On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the Warsaw uprising, it is disconcerting 
to hear President Clinton waffling about membership of Poland in NATO. 
</P>
<P>
 It was virtually 50 years ago that President Roosevelt abandoned Poland and 
its neighbors to Stalin and the Soviet Union for political expediency. We are 
beginning to see a repeat of this historical ignominious treachery with the No. 
2 State Department official making Neville Chamberlain-type deals in Moscow.

 * In order to get a true perspective on what NATO will look like by the year 
2000 (Opinion, Jan. 16), I feel that we must first ask what its charter now 
represents. I assume that we are to understand that the challenges to the 
Western alliance are now the collective reshaping of Eastern Europe and its 
integration into a common security structure. And that a military alliance 
provides its members with a greater sense purpose than does an economic 
alliance. Where does this common security now focus? As Richard Perle and 
Raymond Garthoff suggest, maybe it is to enforce security concerns outside the 
immediate region or to supplement U.N. peacekeeping efforts in areas that are 
of specific political interest to its members. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of speculation, it is clear that the survival of NATO depends on 
the redefining of its charter and in its success in adjusting to the many 
demands of the post-Soviet environment. This adjustment will require NATO to 
address concerns beyond the scope of its military origins and to assume greater 
responsibility for the political and economic factors necessary to maintaining 
regional stability.

'MUST CARRY' RULE FOR CABLE TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In the pending U.S. Supreme Court action regarding the "must carry" rule for 
cable television operators, a comparison between cable providers and newspapers 
is made (Jan. 13). The argument that cable companies can invoke constitutional 
protection in their decision of whether to carry local broadcast stations is 
absurd. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's get some facts straight. Local stations, both television and FM radio, 
are granted licenses to broadcast by the FCC that mandate at least some air 
time to "community service" programming. Failure to serve this public trust can 
subject a licensee to action including fines and license revocation. 
</P>
<P>
 Cable companies, on the other hand, are de facto monopolies, and as such they 
should be treated as public utilities. Many homeowners and virtually all 
apartment and condominium dwellers have community restrictions that preclude 
their right to install an outdoor antenna to receive off-the-air television and 
FM signals. A consumer has no choice but to subscribe to the cable provider's 
station selection or to receive nothing. Cable companies, therefore, hold the 
key to the gate for all information seen and heard in the homes that they 
service. Newspapers, in distinct contrast, do not control the content of all 
printed sources of news and information in their readers' homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of this unparalleled control, cable providers must be compelled to 
provide both TV and FM service for all channels that would be readily 
receivable by outside rooftop antennas in the area they serve. Large cable 
operators can and do gerrymander their definitions of local reception areas, 
arbitrarily dropping broadcast stations that would be receivable in much of 
their service area. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent re-regulation of the cable providers has not only failed the public in 
remedying outrageous pricing practices of the industry, but does not go far 
enough in protecting the right of subscribers to see and hear the very stations 
that have the legal mandate to serve their respective communities. The Supreme 
Court should reject the cable operators' attempts to strike down the "must 
carry" rule.

PRISON CONDITIONS

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * John Garamendi's reference to prisons as "concrete palaces" (Dec. 29) as 
well as the statement " . . . when our kids have schools that are as good as 
prisons" deserves much refinement. As a firsthand point of view, I am sure your 
readers would like to know that the prison where I am currently incarcerated is 
a far cry from a concrete palace. 
</P>
<P>
 I am currently sentenced to 16 months for a computer crime, have no violence 
on my record, and in no way expected the conditions here at Folsom. There are 
no gymnasiums, no computers, or any kind of adult education whatsoever. The 
overcrowding makes it impossible to even work. The current wait is a minimum of 
four months. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, the inmates spend most of the time locked up in 5 foot by 12 foot 
cells. Showers are a privilege. The access to the yard is only two to three 
times a week, and most showers are taken outside no matter what the temperature 
is. In essence, this is a human warehouse.

<TEXT>
<P>
 * So former Vice President Dan Quayle is concerned about what he sees as 
bigotry and intolerance directed against conservative Christians (Jan. 10)! 
When I think back in horror about all of the hatred, bigotry and prejudice that 
was spewed from the podium during the 1992 Republican Convention by Pat 
Robertson, Pat Buchanan and Phyllis Schlafly, Quayle's remarks seems downright 
ludicrous.

 * Quayle isn't really taking aim at "bigotry" in defending conservative 
Christians against some mythical attack on their religious beliefs.He's using 
the cry of "bigotry" to try to chill debate -- the kind of open, unblinking 
examination of political groups' agendas that the public needs to make reasoned 
judgments. 
</P>
<P>
 It is nonsensical to suggest that simply criticizing the views and tactics of 
conservative Christians is tantamount to an attack on their religious faith.

 * President Clinton was right when he said there is too much secularism in our 
society. And now Dan Quayle is correct when he said, "Today, the only 
acceptable form of bigotry in our society is bigotry against conservative 
Christians." The writer of the article showed his/her own bias when writing 
that Quayle "also complained that fundamentalist Christians are 'taught to be 
tolerant of others,' but are often the objects of intolerance."

<P>
 The Times writer could have used the word said , instead of complained . There 
are numerous benign verbs he/she might have used. Complained comes across as a 
put-down.

PLATFORM; TO EASE THE COMMUTE, GIVE POOLERS PRECEDENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES LAVE, CHARLES LAVE is a professor of economics at UC Irvine. A 
specialist in transportation economics, he has an idea for easing the gridlock 
around quake-damaged freeways: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So far, all we've gotten is pious advice: Switch to car pools and public 
transit. That's correct in theory but ineffective in practice.Public transit 
can take up some of the load, but commuter lines were already filled at rush 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Solving the jam requires vastly reducing the number of vehicles on the road. 
The greatest unused resource is the empty seats in all those autos. But there's 
little incentive to car-pool. Your car pool would be stuck in the same traffic 
jam, and the trip would actually be longer to pick up passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 So how do we get people to combine their trips? Reward them with a faster 
commute. Here's an example for the Santa Monica Freeway, now broken by the gap 
at Fairfax. It might also have some application the jams out in Santa Clarita 
and the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Give car pools and buses exclusive use of the freeway entrances and exits 
closest to the gap. Solo drivers would have to exit earlier, wander further 
through congested neighborhoods and rejoin the freeway later than car pools. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this solution unfair to those who can't car pool? No, because they also 
benefit: For every pair of cars that becomes a car pool, there is one fewer car 
in the jam in front of the solo driver. 
</P>
<P>
 We know that car-pool incentives work in other situations. Give them a try 
here. They're cheap to implement and easy to discard if they fail.

COLUMN LEFT/ ALEXANDER COCKBURN: A BIT MORE ABOUT INMAN AND SAFIRE; A NAVY FEUD 
WITH ISRAEL AND THE POLLARD AFFAIR UNDERLIE THE STATED REASONS FOR WITHDRAWING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALEXANDER COCKBURN, Alexander Cockburn writes for the Nation and other 
publications. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In withdrawing his nomination to be secretary of defense, Bobby Inman gave one 
of the most memorable press conference since Richard Nixon told reporters they 
wouldn't have him to kick around any more back in 1962.  
</P>
<P>
 Inman is not the first man of military background to fret over his press 
clippings. Years of deference and snappy salutes are poor preparation for a 
hosing down by the Fourth Estate. 
</P>
<P>
 The press has used the deadly term rambling to describe Inman's hour-long 
performance in Austin, Tex., on Tuesday. That is a bit unfair, in that Inman 
laid out his peeves in coherent fashion. But prominent citizens are not 
supposed to dwell in obsessive detail on their press coverage. Inman, however, 
also may have been sending up smoke screens, and the journalists at the press 
conference were too thunderstruck by his performance to ask even a few simple 
questions about other reasons why he might be withdrawing. 
</P>
<P>
 On the face of it, Inman's business career since his retirement from the CIA 
in 1982 did raise questions about his judgment. Supposedly a man of laser-like 
intelligence, Inman sat for richly remunerated years on the "proxy board" of 
International Signal and Control, a firm engaged in fraudulent 
misrepresentation and whose founder, James Guerin -- a man for whom Inman 
vouched in court -- is now serving a 15-year prison term in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Inman could scarcely complain about "the new McCarthyism" in the press on this 
since, apart from articles in the British press and a column by this writer, 
the details of his relationship with ISC and Guerin were politely avoided in 
the press. 
</P>
<P>
 The meatiest portion of Inman's remarks concerned columnist William Safire, 
whom Inman charged with nourishing a vendetta against him since the late 1970s. 
Inman attributed part of Safire's animus to an action Inman took as William 
Casey's deputy at the CIA. In the wake of the 1981 Israeli bombing raid on 
Iraq's nuclear reactor at Tuwaitha, Inman reviewed the targeting data requested 
by Israel from the United States in preparation for the raid. Inman found that 
intelligence information far exceeding the requirements of the raid -- for 
example, data about Pakistan and Libya -- had been furnished by U.S. 
intelligence, and he forthwith decreed that a 250-mile limit be imposed on 
satellite and kindred information provided to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 At his Tuesday press conference, Inman claimed that Israeli Gen. Ariel Sharon 
had complained to his American friends about Inman's restriction. Safire's 
admiring relationship with Sharon is a matter of record in his own columns. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a sequel that Inman did not explore. The Tuwaitha raid was led by 
Col. Avi Sella, who was later dispatched to the United States as controller of 
Jonathan Pollard, the spy who worked at the Naval Intelligence Service and 
provided Israel with precisely the satellite intelligence being withheld under 
Inman's orders. In his Dec. 23 column in the New York Times, about which Inman 
made complaint and which seems to have contributed powerfully to his decision 
to stand down, Safire specifically accused Inman of contributing to the 
"excessive sentencing" of Pollard. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, the tensions between Inman and Safire speak to a larger 
enduring tension nourished by U.S. Navy men against Israeli governments and 
their claque here for such episodes as the bombing of the U.S. ship Liberty 
during Israel's Six-Day War and Pollard's espionage. 
</P>
<P>
 Now for the miniseries that the admiral can rough out in his retirement: 
connivance in high places; the Dole-Safire deal; the battle between Safire and 
Washington Post editor Bob Woodward to control the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton crowd should never have picked a military man with a career 
background in spookery. At least the country has been spared a man who claimed 
in Austin with a straight face that he joined the elite Bohemian Club "because 
I love the exposure to people who are talented in the arts." To Our

PERSPECTIVE ON MARRIAGE; SOME WOMEN NURTURE MISERY; WE MISUSE THE WORD TO CALL 
LORENA BOBBITT A VICTIM. THIS SORT OF RELATIONSHIP IS A MUTUAL EFFORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SABINE REICHEL, Sabine Reichel is the author of What Did You Do in the War, 
Daddy?: Growing Up German (Hill and Wang). She is working on a book about 
women. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No matter how much we try to cover it up, the truth is this: The relationship 
between men and women is dark, irrational and turbulent, defined by ambivalence 
and laced with underlying hatred. Unexpressed violence is a part of this 
archaic and basically primitive relationship. Sex and its seductive and urgent 
powers are not about fairness, niceness and equality -- the homicide squad can 
tell you that. Living with men without getting beaten up or put down is about 
survival tactics, about smarts, about the power of intelligent judgments, about 
self-reliance and -- most of all -- about responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorena Bobbitt was abused, no doubt, and yet she stuck around. When she 
realized that she had married an abusive roughneck, she sought a restraining 
order but failed to show up to complete the paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
 The degree to which many women tolerate outrageous acts by men, be it physical 
violence, verbal abuse or just plain bad behavior, is staggering. 
</P>
<P>
 Ignoring the obvious warning signs, women marry violent alcoholics (they are 
sure they'll cure him with "love") and are surprised when they are repeatedly 
beaten or raped. Is it hope or stupidity that numbs women's perception? As long 
as women write sentimental love letters to serial killers in prison, pine away 
for Mike Tyson, marry Donald Trump and have willing sex with Joey Buttafuoco, 
the future looks grim. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole issue of sexual harassment, date rape and so on is really also just 
a symbol for the unresolvable conflicts between men and women. It is loaded 
with hypocrisy, convenient female-underdog fairy tales and, above all, rage and 
confusion. I believe women have run out of excuses for their own inept, 
irresponsible behavior. The term "victim" has been misused until it has lost 
its punch, which is unfortunate for the real victims. Lorena Bobbitt is not one 
of them. 
</P>
<P>
 We are indeed responsible for whom we marry, whom we allow to influence and 
inspire us, share our beds, our fears and intimate thoughts. The times when 
parents sold their daughters for a couple of cows are over. Most women can pick 
whom they want, be what they want, do what they want when and how they want it. 
If they wind up with a jerk, a woman-hater, a philandering Mama's boy or a 
sadistic two-timer, it's because that's what they chose; it's their own fault. 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, there is a resemblance between Mrs. Buttafuoco and Mrs. Bobbitt. 
Both married heels and losers and both knew it. While Mrs. Buttafuoco turned to 
heroic masochism by taking Amy Fisher's "bullet of love" and sticking to her 
sleazy husband, Mrs. Bobbitt turned to sadistic retaliation and took a knife. 
If one looks at the many wives who tried to rid themselves of husbands through 
violence and murder, what comes to mind is that they deserved each other fully: 
Men and women are partners in crime and they torture each other with a 
gender-specific arsenal of weapons that cut, slice, wound and scar. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bobbitts are a sordid, unsavory couple, the kind I can't stand but see too 
often, who lived in a sadomasochistic marriage both consented to. These wives 
are the mentally lazy, disinterested women who are trapped and bored and angry, 
not because they are victims but because they prefer having a guy around to 
living at their own risk. It is often not fear for their lives but fear of 
living that turns women into the creators of their own misery. 
</P>
<P>
 Life with men, married or unmarried, can obviously be hellish, messy and 
challenging, so don't get married or don't live together unless you are mature 
and can use your brains and judgment. Forget about inflicting "penis penalty" 
in the style of Lorena Bobbitt. Women must strike back at unworthy men where it 
really hurts: with education, self-confidence and independence. 
</P>
<P>
 We are as far from male-female friendship, equality and understanding as we've 
ever been, and the mere act of marriage can't turn that around. Maybe 
conventional marriage means having unwanted sex sometimes as much as having 
unwanted conversations, unwanted confrontations -- in short, unwanted company. 
It's no fun and it's not right but it's what happens when two sexes live under 
one roof. Nobody married needs the extra agony of going to sleep and not 
knowing which parts might be missing the next morning, tossed along the 
roadside. In a lot of marriages, the knowledge that something important is 
already missing is painful enough.

CLINTON MARCHES TO HIS OWN DRUMMER; PRESIDENCY: FAILURE TO MEET EXPECTATIONS 
MEANS HE'S DOING A FAIR, TYPICALLY MIDDLING JOB. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS K. BAKER, Ross K. Baker is a professor of political science at Rutgers 
University. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pity the poor ideologues, activists and those with a hard-edged political 
philosophy, for they are condemned to eternal disappointment with the people 
they help to propel into the White House. Influential beyond their numbers at 
the beginning of the presidential primary season, when their modest voting 
strength is magnified in low-turnout elections, their influence fades in the 
fall, and by Inauguration Day they have become a disposal problem for 
presidents who are seeking the nation's center of political gravity. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a plight shared in the past by right-to-life groups and the 
ultraconservative Heritage Foundation; this year, by gay-rights activists, the 
ultraliberal Americans for Democratic Action and the ultracentrist Democratic 
Leadership Council. Presidents abhor doctrinal purity as nature abhors a vacuum 
-- none more so than Bill Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 The gravitational field of the Oval Office exerts a strong pull on every 
president's ideological compass. For Richard Nixon, the product of a highly 
conservative Southern California milieu, the lure of the White House was so 
strong that as vice president he eagerly helped grease the skids under 
right-wing hero Sen. Joseph McCarthy. But winning the presidency wasn't enough. 
Nixon was determined to be writ large in history; thus his apostasy on the 
first sacred tenet of postwar conservative philosophy when he pursued and 
secured ties with Communist China. 
</P>
<P>
 The naive faith that political ideology can survive the crucible of expediency 
has been sorely tested in the first year of Bill Clinton's presidency. Just 
when you think he is comfortably bedded down in some nice philosophical niche, 
he leaps out of it and materializes in some other pigeonhole, but only long 
enough to catch his breath before bounding clear out the window.  
</P>
<P>
 How do you map his avant-garde fanfare on gays in the military and his 
ultimate landing in Sam Nunn's don't-ask-don't-tell halfway house? His 
health-care reform proposal has both wings of his party flapping. His 
championing of NAFTA found him standing side-by-side with the National Assn. of 
Manufacturers and the ultraconservative Rep. Newt Gingrich. His advocacy of the 
Brady handgun bill was applauded by liberals. He is outspoken on civil rights, 
but has allowed the civil-rights division of the Department of Justice to go 
leaderless. He chooses a surgeon general who raises the possibility of 
legalizing street drugs. He goes into the most Stygian lair of the Cold War, 
the National Security Agency, for his next defense secretary. He has appointed 
more women to high posts than any other president, yet appears to hold them to 
more exacting standards than he does men. 
</P>
<P>
 But is Bill Clinton's ideological crazy-quilt really all that unusual? He may 
differ slightly in degree from his predecessors, but not at all in kind, 
because there is one paramount truth about the presidency and it is this: The 
job transcends the idiosyncrasies of the individual. So great are its 
institutional imperatives, so overwhelming the symbolic burden of representing 
the needs and interests of all Americans, that presidents of whatever 
ideological stripe come to resemble each other more than they resemble their 
political fraternity brothers.  
</P>
<P>
 Seats in the House and Senate and chairs in governors' mansions can be 
comfortably occupied by zealots; extremism in the Oval Office is a rarity. Even 
Ronald Reagan, the man most often cited as the exception to the rule, trimmed 
his sails considerably once in office. Ask David Stockman, Reagan's first 
budget director, who charged in his memoirs that his boss blew the opportunity 
of a lifetime to dismantle the welfare state. When the solvency of the Social 
Security System was imperiled in 1982, Reagan bailed it out with the enthusiasm 
of a New Dealer -- which he once was. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Clinton is closer to other modern presidents in his ideological 
indeterminacy. The "New Democrat" label that he sported in the 1992 primaries 
and his association with the middle-of-the-road Democratic Leadership Council 
enabled him to set himself apart from his rivals who ended up splitting the 
liberal vote. Not everyone was taken in by the centrist facade. The Democrats' 
1972 candidate, George McGovern, characterized Clinton as a liberal Trojan 
horse who would take the country sharply leftward once in office. Both the DLC 
group and the McGovernites have had their expectations thwarted by the 
bewilderingly protean quality of Clinton's politics. Just as one party faction 
prepares to bear him off on their shoulders in triumph, they find themselves 
searching instead for the tar and feathers. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's philosophical eclecticism does not mean that he is without any 
guiding principles. It means, rather, that where he comes out on any given 
issue cannot be inferred automatically from some body of political dogma. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing's for sure: You'll never hear anybody around this White House 
proclaiming, "Let Clinton be Clinton."

MORNING BRIEFING: MAYBE GUY FROM COMMERCIAL CAN AUCTION OFF OLYMPIC BEER

 Every day at exactly 1 p.m., an employee of the Lillehammer Olympic Organizing

main street and summons a crowd clanging a cowbell.

<P>
 Up for auction is a countdown T-shirt, one for each day left until the Games.

 "This is a historic day," auctioneer Morten Svensen shouts from his stool.

 That is the same thing the auctioneers have said every day since the auctions

numbers like 100, draw astonishing bids. The highest was $3,700; the average is 
$320.

 Add Olympics: German brewers are being urged to provide free beer to the 
country's competitors at the Winter Olympics because the Germans' favorite 
drink costs too much in Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 "German brewers, support our Olympic team. Free beer for Lillehammer," Bild, 
the country's biggest newspaper, said in a front-page article. 
</P>
<P>
 Bild complained that Lillehammer bars would be charging between 14 and 25 
marks ($8 and $14) for half a liter of beer -- between three and five times 
more than in Germany.

 Trivia time: Who was UCLA's first consensus All-American in basketball? 
</P>
<P>
 Precocious Chris: If Chris Webber makes the NBA All-Star game, he will become 
the youngest player ever in the midseason contest. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaquille O'Neal, who was 13 days shy of his 21st birthday when he played last 
year, is the youngest. Webber would be three days younger if he plays on Feb. 
13. 
</P>
<P>
 Polar Bear: Somebody should tell Ted Sakovich that the Chicago Bears refers to 
the animal, not a state of undress. 
</P>
<P>
 There he was on one of the coldest days of the year, trotting around Calumet 
City, Ill., clad only in underpants, gym shoes and a headband with the word 
"Bears." A wind-chill of 38 degrees below zero turned his bare skin red. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't even feel it," he said as he completed the two-block run and 
returned to the comfort of the Rose & Crown tavern. His mistake was to have bet 
on the Bears, wagering they would finish the season .500 or better. The team 
lost its last four games, finishing 7-9. 
</P>
<P>
 The other way: Unlike Michael Jordan, who made his fortune and retired from 
pro basketball, Don Calhoun made his fortune and got a job shooting hoops. 
</P>
<P>
 Since winning $1 million by sinking a 75-foot shot at a Chicago Bulls' game 
promotion last April, Calhoun has quit his $5-an-hour job and joined the Harlem 
Globetrotters -- as a shooting guard. 
</P>
<P>
 New sport? Golfer Fred Couples attended a Dallas Stars hockey game and tried 
his hand at a slap shot in the Reunion Arena shooting cage. He recorded the

coach Dennis Rodman." SHAV GLICK

BOX OFFICE DROP LESS THAN FIRST FEARED; MOVIES: DESPITE A 20% DROP IN U.S. 
MOVIEGOING RECEIPTS AFTER THE EARTHQUAKE AND THE EAST COAST COLD WAVE, 
RETAILERS ARE OPTIMISTIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Southern California's earthquake and a brutal cold wave gripping the Eastern 
half of the country served up a one-two punch this week on the movie industry, 
but the economic impact was less than feared. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the nation's box-office grosses on Tuesday totaled $5.4 million, a 
plunge of about 20% from a routine Tuesday, according to John Krier, owner of 
Exhibitor Relations Co., a firm that tracks box office. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Los Angeles, which accounts for 5% to 8% of the nation's movie box 
office, business in quake-affected areas on Monday and Tuesday plunged "100%," 
said Marcy Polier, president of Entertainment Data Inc. In surrounding 
counties, box-office attendance was off about 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 In the sprawling San Fernando Valley, where Monday's 6.6 temblor shook apart 
buildings, roads and lives, an initial dusk-to-dawn curfew coupled with a 
nerve-rattled populace virtually wiped out moviegoing both Monday and Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand the Valley is pretty much shut down," said Dick Cook, president 
of distribution for Disney. "Many theaters are closed and those that aren't, 
people have their minds set on things other than going to the movies." A number 
of San Fernando Valley theaters shut down on Tuesday. But officials at some 
theater chains said they hoped to reopen on Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the downturn, TriStar Pictures' "Philadelphia," the Tom Hanks-Denzel 
Washington courtroom drama about AIDS, brought in a healthy $2 million on 
Monday and Tuesday. The midweek totals brought the film's grosses to $15.8 
million, making it the nation's top money maker, after only five days of wide 
release. 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Friedman, president of worldwide advertising at Warner Bros., which has 
"The Pelican Brief" and "Grumpy Old Men" in release, reported that "Business is 
good, but we don't know if it would be better. . . . One is to assume that the 
bitter cold is affecting evening business and, clearly, the earthquake hurt 
business in Southern California but, by and large, it's pretty good. We're not 
disappointed at all." 
</P>
<P>
 A minimal amount of damage was caused when a pipe burst in the 1,000-seat El 
Capitan Theatre in the heart of Hollywood, causing water to leak into the 
lobby. Officials at Disney, which restored the theater at a reported cost of $6 
million, said some of the building's facade also fell into the street. City 
building inspectors examined the structure and said it was safe for occupancy, 
but Disney officials said it would remain closed until Friday so that its own 
inspectors could make sure the site was OK. 
</P>
<P>
 At AMC Theatres, assistant divisions operations manager Nora Dashwood said 
that on the day of the earthquake, all AMC Los Angeles-area theaters were 
closed and remained closed on Tuesday. But the Century City 14 and Burbank 14 
were open by Wednesday. By Friday, other locations in Santa Monica and Burbank 
should be open. 
</P>
<P>
 With Los Angeles County as the exception, however, Dashwood said theater 
attendance throughout the rest of the Western United States was normal. 
</P>
<P>
 In the East, where dozens of deaths have been blamed on the cold snap that 
began Sunday, weather conditions hampered moviegoing as record low temperatures 
closed schools, businesses, road and airports. Thousands of people were without 
electricity and drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
 The Plaza Theatre in Burlington, Wis., was one of hundreds of theaters closing 
down or curtailing their schedules due to the extreme cold. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrie Loeks, co-chairman of New York-based Loews Theaters, said the weather 
forced closure of several of the circuit's 900 screens, primarily in the 
Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
 "We actually have theaters that can't open in the Washington and Baltimore 
areas due to frozen pipes and rolling electric brownouts," Loeks said, 
estimating the chain's business was down by 10% to 15% overall. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been mixed results," she said. "In some areas of the Northeast where the 
kids are out of school and the weather's bad, but bearable, it may have helped 
business . . . but the overall drop is not all that bad considering the 
terrible weather." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Olson, president of Marcus Theaters in Milwaukee, said school closures 
have helped matinee and evening business, despite the cold weather. 
</P>
<P>
 "On balance, we may be having a better week," Olson said. "Mom and Dad may be 
getting cabin fever and they're going out." 
</P>
<P>
 "In Chicago, it was too cold for kids to stay out and wait for the bus," said 
one movie exhibitor. "In New York and Washington, D.C., there was heavy ice 
coverage. Yet, even with all these, a lot of people went to the movies -- even 
in their ski boots."

SUNDANCE'S GROWING PAINS; MOVIES: AS THE UTAH FESTIVAL GETS MORE POPULAR, IT IS 
STRUGGLING TO FIND THE PROPER BALANCE OF INDEPENDENT FILMMAKERS AND INDUSTRY 
DEAL-MAKERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Every year, as more and more people try to squeeze into it, the Sundance Film 
Festival becomes increasingly reminiscent of that tiny automobile that held an 
infinite number of circus clowns. This year, though, the festival is 
threatening to do what that little car never did, and that is burst at the 
seams. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening tonight with a Salt Lake City screening of the Mike Newell-directed 
"Four Weddings and a Funeral" and continuing through Jan. 30 in nearby Park 
City, this vibrant showcase for the best of American independent film has been 
selling tickets at a rate that staggers even its organizers. 
</P>
<P>
 Selling out this year for the first time ever are all four categories of Park 
City passes, and this despite the full-time use of a 500-seat auxiliary theater 
(the festival's biggest) at the Library Center that added 22,000 seats to the 
number available. "The demand has far outstripped the supply," says weary 
festival director Geoffrey Gilmore, who noted as well that when tickets for 
local residents went on sale at Salt Lake City, the line was three-hours-plus 
in length. "We've reached the point where it's gotten to be more than painful." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only painful, but also tricky for the festival to maintain its feisty, 
free-spirited reputation, to preserve a balance between such potentially 
conflicting constituencies as struggling independent filmmakers and the 
deal-hungry denizens of Hollywood who traditionally come along for the ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly no concession to box-office viability is noticeable in the 32 films 
(16 dramatic, 16 documentary) competing for the festival's various juried 
prizes. Frequently first or second films by largely unknown directors, as a 
group the competitors have a tone that Gilmore characterized as "unconventional 
and experimental." Only two, "Fresh," written and directed by Boaz Yakin 
(Miramax) and the black-and-white "Suture" (Goldwyn) have distribution deals in 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 Where the festival's increasing popularity is reflected, however, is in the 
films that have elected to have their world premieres at Park City in 
out-of-competition slots. Not only do no fewer than nine of these films have 
distributors, but four of them will also go out with major studio labels 
attached, including the Winona Ryder-Ethan Hawke movie "Reality Bites" from 
Universal, "Threesome" from TriStar and the Coen Brothers' "The Hudsucker 
Proxy," starring as mainstream a personality as Paul Newman. 
</P>
<P>
 That film does have a legitimate independent pedigree, the Coens' "Blood 
Simple" having won an award at an earlier festival. Similarly credentialed is 
Matty Rich's "The Inkwell," to be distributed by Disney. Rich, who turned heads 
at Sundance with his gritty "Straight Out of Brooklyn," has set his latest and 
considerably softer film, "The Inkwell," in new territory, the upwardly mobile 
African American enclave that vacations in Martha's Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
 Other notable films with distributors include the Eric Stoltz/Mary-Louise 
Parker starring romance "Naked in New York" and a pair of lively British films. 
"Four Weddings," the opening night film, is a stylish and witty lunatic farce 
about two people (Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell) who can't seem to decide if 
they're made for each other or not, while "Backbeat" breezily relates the story 
of the Beatles.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the smartest film at the festival, showing out of competition because 
it premiered elsewhere and is Canadian in the bargain, is a singular work about 
quite a different kind of musician. "Thirty-two Short Films About Glenn Gould" 
deals with the eccentric classical pianist in a way that is both challenging 
and accessible, restless and subtle. Continually inventive in its ability to 
visualize music, this look at an ironic perfectionist is close to perfection 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally worthy, and also showing out of competition, are a pair of the 
remarkable Asian films that made a splash at Cannes, Tian Zhuangzhuang's moving 
and controversial "The Blue Kite" from China and Tran Anh Hung's elegantly 
beautiful "The Scent of Green Papaya," the first Vietnamese film submitted for 
Oscar consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 What attracts all these films to Sundance is a continuing increase in two of 
the festival's constituencies. One is the press, with more than 200 film 
journalists worldwide set to show up and outlets like Premiere magazine, which 
used to content itself with covering the festival once it ended, starting the 
race weeks ago.  
</P>
<P>
 Also on the rise are the buzz people, the industryites who come up to get a 
jump on the next new thing. This year, all for the first time, the venerable 
Directors Guild of America will be hosting an "invitation-only party" for young 
directors, cellular phones will be available for rental and an Executive 
Business Center, complete with fax and a message center "answered by real 
people," will set up shop. All the comforts of home. 
</P>
<P>
 Though slightly dazed by what it has wrought, the Sundance organizers are 
attempting to cope. In addition to that new theater, a new shuttle system is 
being inaugurated to move people more efficiently and the lively closing night 
awards ceremony has been moved to a larger location.

THE UP AND DOWN WORLD OF L.A. ART MUSEUMS; ART: DONATIONS OF ARTWORKS ARE ON 
THE RISE, BUT BOTH LACMA AND MOCA ARE COPING WITH DROPS IN MEMBERSHIP AND 
ATTENDANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 As the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Museum of Contemporary Art 
close the books on 1993 and get on with the new year, they find themselves in 
an equivocal position in terms of their relationship to the public. On one 
hand, the museums are toting up a generous array of art gifts. But on the other 
hand, access to both institutions has been restricted, probably contributing to 
losses of attendance and membership. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 art gifts, valued at a total of about $15 million at LACMA and around 
$10 million at MOCA, can be explained in part by a revision in the federal 
income tax law that encourages collectors to donate art rather than sell it. 
The change reverts to the time-honored system of allowing deductions of the 
appreciated value of gifts of art, rather than merely the purchase price, as 
provided in the Tax Reform Act of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 LACMA's most spectacular art gift in 1993 came from Lucille Ellis Simon, who 
completed her donation of "Swineherd, Brittany," an 1888 landscape by Paul 
Gauguin. (It's common practice for donors to spread particularly valuable gifts 
over several years, for tax purposes.) The museum declined to disclose the 
value of the Gauguin, whose major works have brought up to $24 million at 
auction. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other important donations to LACMA are Julian and Joanne Ganz's partial 
gift of Fitz Hugh Lane's 19th-Century painting "Boston Harbor" and Max 
Palevsky's donation of 42 pieces of Arts and Crafts furniture and accessories. 
Two ancient Iranian objects, a drinking horn and a Sassanian bowl decorated 
with a royal portrait, were donated anonymously. 
</P>
<P>
 At MOCA, by far the most valuable gift received in 1993 was artist Sam 
Francis' donation of 10 of his paintings, according to chief curator Paul 
Schimmel. Collectors also were generous to the museum, Schimmel said, noting 
David Melnick's gift of Ellsworth Kelly's 1974 sculpture "Curve IV" and Stuart 
and Judy Spence's donation of works by Douglas Huebler, Sophie Calleand Erika 
Rothenberg, among many other gifts. One important trend in the museum's 
burgeoning collection is the addition of room-size installations, Schimmel 
said. Five large, multi-part works -- by Renee Green, Andrea Zittel, Roni Horn, 
Bruce Nauman and Gerhard Merz -- were among last year's gifts to MOCA. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the issue of tax-deductible art gifts appears to have been 
stabilized, questions remain about public access to the two museums. 
</P>
<P>
 Reacting to a $2-million loss of county funding in 1992, LACMA initiated a 
schedule of rotating gallery closures on weekdays. Last year, after an 
additional county budget cut of $1.6 million, museum officials closed the 
entire museum on Tuesdays in addition to Mondays. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The direct effect of the closures on attendance and membership is unknown 
because many factors contribute to fluctuations. But the museum's membership 
has fallen from a high of 90,002 in 1988-89 to 68,731 in 1992-93. Annual 
attendance has dropped from 1.6 million in 1991-92 (when "Splendors of Mexico" 
attracted large crowds) to 1 million in 1992-93. The museum estimates 
attendance for the fiscal year ending June of this year will be 855,000. 
</P>
<P>
 All of LACMA's galleries will be open during the exhibition "Picasso and the 
Weeping Women," scheduled for Feb. 18-May 1. But the former six-days-a-week, 
full-gallery schedule will not be reinstated until the county provides money to 
do so, according to LACMA press officer Sarah Gallop. The museum saves a total 
of about $600,000 a year by reducing its operations, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Talks about the museum's funding from the county are under way, but nothing 
has been resolved, according to Robert F. Maguire, president of LACMA's board 
of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile at MOCA, the museum's popular Temporary Contemporary facility in 
Little Tokyo has been closed since June, 1992, to accommodate the construction 
of First Street North, a planned mixed-use, public/private development on city 
land surrounding the Temporary Contemporary. The museum was expected to remain 
closed for 18 months to two years while excavation and initial construction 
took place, but almost 20 months have passed and the project has yet to win 
final City Council approval, much less break ground. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, which includes a plan to consolidate city offices scattered 
throughout downtown, has been delayed by a stale economy and a change in 
administration, which prompted the City Council to explore whether buying and 
renovating an existing building would be less costly than erecting the new 
structure. But a study ultimately found that the new construction would be less 
expensive than using available, conveniently located buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 City Administrative Officer Keith Comrie recommended approval of First Street 
North and the City Council's Planning and Land Use Management Committee on Dec. 
7 voted a unanimous endorsement, subject to financing. The Budget and Finance 
Committee is expected to vote on the project Tuesday. If approved, the project 
would then go to the full Council for a final decision. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the meantime, a proposal has been made to the city to consider the Los 
Angeles Times building as an alternative to the First Street North Project. The 
Times building was not among the structures included in the study. 
</P>
<P>
 Developer Michael Barker said he expects First Street North to proceed because 
he has a contract with the city and "the economic advantages are very 
compelling." But museum officials and City Councilman Joel Wachs, who serves as 
a MOCA trustee, won't hazard a guess on the future of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would love to see this matter resolved one way or the other," Wachs said, 
echoing the frustration of MOCA officials who have watched First Street North 
get mired in controversy while two-thirds of their exhibition space remains 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 MOCA's membership fell from a high of 25,000 in 1986 (when the museum's Grand 
Avenue building opened) to 13,000 in 1991, but it has remained at that figure 
for the last three years, even with the closure of the Temporary Contemporary. 
Attendance has fallen from 350,000 in 1991 (when both the TC and the Grand 
Avenue facilities were open) to 300,000 in 1993. Los Angeles' economy and civil 
unrest likely have contributed to the loss, according to Kathleen Bartels, 
MOCA's director of administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Current plans call for re-opening the TC this fall if the development is not 
approved and for delaying the opening until next spring if the plan goes 
forward. The spring opening would coincide with the debut of a major conceptual 
art exhibition, "1965-1975: Reconsidering the Object of Art," said MOCA 
Director Richard Koshalek.  
</P>
<P>
 MOCA officials have been accused of closing the TC prematurely to save money 
-- about $500,000 a year -- but they deny that charge. "We believed that First 
Street North was about ready to begin. Based on the scenario at the time, it 
would have been ridiculous for us to try to keep the TC open," said Bartels, 
noting that the museum's utilities had been cut off. 
</P>
<P>
 Developer Barker agrees that the museum acted in good faith. He plans to help 
the museum construct a temporary entrance on Alameda or First Street if the 
project is approved but construction is delayed. Excavation will take place 
next to the Central Avenue door, but that entrance will be restored, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If First Street North becomes a reality, the Temporary Contemporary and the 
Japanese American National Museum will be major cultural components of the 
project, Barker said. In accordance with the city's Percent for Art program, 
which requires that 1% of construction costs for public projects be spent on 
art, each museum will receive about $1.5 million, he said. LACMA AND MOCA: More 
Gifts, Fewer Fans 
</P>
<P>
 Although federal tax laws have helped create a good atmosphere for donations 
of art to the L.A. County Museum of Art and the Museum of Contemporary Art, 
reduced operations ad hours have probably translated into losses of attendance 
and membership at both institutions. Some figures on gains and losses over the

 Todd Jacobson, a full-time lawyer and part-time punk rocker from Fullerton, 
has started a new label, Lethal Records, that will tap into the fertile 
grass-roots Orange County alternative-rock scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobson, 29, said he started Lethal on a do-it-yourself basis last year, 
issuing a punk-metal CD compilation called "Orange Crunch" and distributing a 
self-financed CD by the Huntington Beach band Ragabash. Now he has added a 
full-time manager and marketer, John Geldbach, who formerly worked as 
merchandising manager for SST Records. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobson, who has his own legal practice, said he hopes to put out 14 singles 
and six albums during 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 A Ragabash single has just been released, and a single by the Cadillac 
Tramps/Adolescents spinoff band Rule 62 is due next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many good bands down here were getting overlooked by the L.A. scene," 
Jacobson said. "We do get tapes from (bands from other parts of the country), 
but we'll keep a Southern California and Orange County slant, predominantly." 
</P>
<P>
 Also signed to the label is the Orange County band Eighth Cranial Nerve. Local 
punk group Guttermouth also is close to signing with Lethal, Jacobson said. And 
he said he has had talks with HR, the former Bad Brains singer, about putting 
out a single on Lethal -- a move that would give the fledgling label some 
exposure on the national independent scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobson does his own rocking in the band Boar's Head. "Having no musical 
talent, I'm relegated to singing duties," he said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 MAKING UP RULES: Rule 62 is led by Brian Coakley, whose primary gig is playing 
guitar and writing songs for the Cadillac Tramps. Coakley, who has proven 
himself a promising lead singer in performances of the Tramps' ballad "The 
River," is the singer and main songwriter in Rule 62. 
</P>
<P>
 A gig last Saturday at Club Mesa found Coakley pursuing that vein fruitfully 
on a couple of soulful slower numbers; harder-edged songs had some of the 
Yardbirds-go-punk feel that comes out in Cadillac Tramps. 
</P>
<P>
 The other members of Rule 62 are: lead guitarist Frank Agnew, an 
ex-Adolescent; Agnew's wife, Libby, on bass; and Chris Webb of One Hit Wonder 
on drums. The other Cadillac Tramps guitarist, Jonny Wickersham, played with 
the band until recently and appears on the upcoming single. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Agnew explains that the band's name is taken from the handbook of a 
12-step recovery program, in which Rule 62 is "Don't take yourself too 
seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 The band's plans call for a trip to Chicago next month to record at the studio 
of Steve Albini, the producer best known for his work on Nirvana's album, "In 
Utero." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 ACTIVIDADES EXTRACURRICULARES: Coakley isn't the only Cadillac Tramp who has 
been moonlighting with the intention of not taking himself too seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tramps' singer, Mike (Gabby) Gaborno, and bassist Warren Renfrow have been 
playing gigs in a punk-comedy band called Manic Hispanic that is gathering a 
strong following in local clubs. Steve Soto of Joyride plays guitar in the 
all-Latino band. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining Gaborno on vocals are Steve Acevedo and Sonny Lujon. Two members of 
the Grabbers, guitarist Maurice Torres and drummer Ruben Rivera, have also been 
playing with Manic Hispanic. But Soto said commitments to their main band will 
keep them from playing on an upcoming five-show tour of western Canada, 
arranged by a promoter who previously has booked Canadian tours by the Cadillac 
Tramps and Joyride. 
</P>
<P>
 Manic Hispanic's repertoire consists solely of "punk covers in Spanglish," 
according to Soto. For example, the Adolescents' classic, "Amoeba," has been 
reinterpreted as "Amigo." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really silly, but it's fun," Soto said. "It's mostly old English punk 
stuff," including songs by the Buzzcocks, the Damned, the Clash, Wire and Sham 
69, all rendered with manic humor by Gaborno. 
</P>
<P>
 The band began last February when Joyride had to cancel a gig at Linda's Doll 
Hut in Anaheim after its drummer, Sandy Hanson, became ill. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't want to let Linda down, so I said, 'I'll put together something so 
you don't have an empty spot' " on the schedule, Soto recalled. "Gabby and I 
had been talking about doing it, so we threw it together in a day. We've played 
seven or eight shows, and they just keep getting bigger and bigger," including 
a recent sellout at the Electric Circus in Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Manic Hispanic is talking to Doctor Dream Records about doing an album, 
Soto said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Me and Gabby already have decided we'd kill ourselves if we got big doing 
this, after all the time we put into our own (primary) bands," Soto said. 
</P>
<P>
 A new recruit for the upcoming tour is Soto's Joyride band mate, guitarist 
Greg Antista.  
</P>
<P>
 "Greg's Italian, but he swears he's got an eighth Mexican in him somewhere," 
Soto said. Manic Hispanic plays Jan. 28 at Club Mesa in Costa Mesa.

 KING OF THE . . . VIDEO?: Dick Dale will be shooting live footage for his 
first-ever video at the Coach House on Saturday, but not during his actual 
performance at the club that night. 
</P>
<P>
 The video's producer, Terry Power, said the shooting time is noon. Fans are 
invited to take part and can call Power Films at (213) 653-7665 for 
information. Without trying to offend surf-rock lovers of a certain age, the 
producers are letting it be known that they are looking for younger Dick Dale 
fans for the crowd shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale, 56, has been trying to break his excellent comeback album, "Tribal 
Thunder," in the alternative-rock market, and the video for the punk-influenced 
song, "Nitro," is part of that strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a sort of nonstop, action-packed, on-the-edge type of video, 
where Dick is playing in a (concert) performance, as well as other locations, 
possibly in the desert and on a Hollywood street," said Power, who has produced 
videos for Hammer, NWA, Blues Traveler and Robin Zander, among others.  
</P>
<P>
 "We want to definitely shoot the crowd. We want the young audience there." 
</P>
<P>
 Dale also says that David Haynes, a drummer who lives in Orange, has replaced 
"Super Dave" Maneely in his backing duo. Bassist Ron Eglit remains at his 
longtime post. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 MORE MUSICAL CHAIRS: Local blues man James Harman also reports lineup changes: 
guitarist Ted Morgan and drummer Efrem Cooke, who appeared on Harman's 1993 
album, "Two Sides to Every Story," have left for Austin, Tex., to start a band 
of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman has recruited two San Diego players to replace them: veteran drummer 
Michael Cherry, and 18-year-old guitarist Robby (Sugar Boy) Eason. Jeff Turmes 
remains on bass as the new lineup works on "Cards on the Table," the next James 
Harman Band album. They play Jan. 28 at Linda's Doll Hut in Anaheim and Jan. 29 
at Heritage Brewing Co. in Dana Point.

QUAKE VIEWERSHIP MIXED AMONG AFFILIATES; TELEVISION: KNBC TOOK AN EARLY MORNING 
LEAD BUT KABC AND KCBS WON IN THE AFTERNOON AND PRIME-TIME HOURS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Although KNBC-TV Channel 4 drew what is believed to be an unprecedented share 
of the TV audience in the first 15 minutes following Monday's earthquake, 
longtime news leader KABC-TV Channel 7 was the highest-watched station for most 
of the day, according to figures released by the A. C. Nielsen Co. 
</P>
<P>
 KNBC, which says it was first to report on the earthquake with Joe Rico's 
dispatch from its newsroom 2 minutes after the 4:31 a.m. temblor, drew a 27.5 
rating and 88% of the total television audience in its initial quarter-hour of 
coverage.With each local rating point being equivalent to 50,064 households, it 
means about 1,776,700 households were tuned in. 
</P>
<P>
 KNBC continued to draw the biggest audience between 4:30-7:45 a.m. At 8 a.m., 
KNBC and KABC-TV tied with a 14.6 rating. 
</P>
<P>
 From noon-8 p.m., KABC was dominant, winning the first two hours and all of 
3:15-8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Among stations covering the earthquake in prime time, KCBS-TV Channel 2 won 
8-9 p.m., before KABC regained the lead, attracting the most viewers between 9 
p.m. and midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 But KCOP-TV Channel 13, the only station with prime-time entertainment 
programming, was the overall ratings leader without any quake coverage between 
8-10 p.m., broadcasting episodes of "Baywatch" and "Star Trek: The Next 
Generation." 
</P>
<P>
 As is the case with catastrophic news events, viewership jumped dramatically 
over Monday's normal levels. From 4:30-4:45 a.m., the percentage of Southland 
households with TV sets jumped from 3.8 to 31.1, an increase of 718%. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime-time viewership level was 61.9%, down from the 67% during the first day 
of coverage of the October wildfires; the 71% for April 30, 1992, the first 
full day of the civil unrest in Los Angeles and the 64.9% during for the 
previous Monday's regular programming.

COVER STORY; NO ROOM TO GROW; AS FAMILIES ARE FORCED TO CROWD INTO FILTHY 
LIVING SPACES, HEALTH AND FIRE OFFICIALS FEAR THE DANGERS OF CLOSE QUARTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It is a squalid place to raise a family. 
</P>
<P>
 For months, every time the upstairs neighbor flushed his toilet, water 
trickled through the rotted bathroom ceiling. Hot water for baths had to be 
heated on the kitchen stove recently after the gas was shut off. 
</P>
<P>
 This one-bedroom hovel in the heart of Long Beach is home to Irma Gutierrez, 
Tranquilino Mendoza and their family. The couple's three children sleep with 
Gutierrez or on bunks next to her bed. Mendoza and an uncle settle for couches 
in the living room. 
</P>
<P>
 The family, which relies on welfare and income from the parents' part-time 
jobs, would like a better place but can't afford it. So Gutierrez keeps the 
apartment as clean as possible, setting sticky traps to catch the cockroaches 
that scurry through the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 Such living conditions are all too common among poor families in Long Beach 
and other Southeast cities. Unable to afford better housing, many are cramming 
into garages and back-yard sheds without plumbing, motel rooms without heat and 
tiny apartments where rats are as common as kitchen silverware. Health 
officials warn that germs and disease thrive in crowded dwellings, while 
firefighters worry about other hazards, including loose wiring and gas leaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is reaching unprecedented proportions partly because of the 
continuing influx of poor residents, many of them immigrants, to the area. Yet 
cash-strapped cities are hamstrung for solutions, lacking enough affordable 
housing to meet the demand and enough health inspectors to crack down on errant 
landlords. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't anticipate dramatic changes in the plight of the low-income renter in 
the near future," said Dennis Rockway, senior counsel for the Legal Aid 
Foundation of Long Beach. Signs of the crowded conditions are abundant in poor 
neighborhoods and run-down pockets of many cities. Along alleys in west Long 
Beach, cables stretch from power poles to garage doors where someone has tapped 
into the electrical current. In South Gate, old cars line the narrow streets 
because garages are occupied. Fences in Lynwood are draped with laundry from 
residents living in garages and enclosed patios. 
</P>
<P>
 Health and building officials must deal with the squalor daily. A Long Beach 
health inspector recently visited a bug-infested apartment where a bucket was 
put in place of plumbing under the sink. Children slept a few feet away in the 
living room. At the next stop, a young woman told him a mouse dropped through 
planks in a cracked bathroom ceiling into a bathtub while she was bathing. 
</P>
<P>
 But one incident still defies belief. County building inspectors, working in 
Hawaiian Gardens a couple of years ago, discovered several people living in an 
apartment-complex pool that had been drained, boarded up and rented out by the 
building's tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of those stories you come across that makes you say, 'Now I've seen 
it all,' " said Carl Holm, the city's director of community development. "They 
got them out of there as fast as possible."  
</P>
<P>
 Officials expect the crowding problem to get worse, as the number of poor 
families continues to grow in Long Beach and the Southeast. Between 1980 and 
1990, the number of people in area cities living below the poverty level jumped 
by 51,800, or 10.4%, the census shows. Nearly one of every four new residents 
in the area lives in poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the poorest, most crowded cities -- including Lynwood, South Gate, 
Maywood and Bell Gardens -- also lost housing during the decade, the census 
shows. Officials attribute the losses to redevelopment and the Century Freeway 
construction, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
 Government housing programs have been overwhelmed by the demand. In Long 
Beach, a waiting list for federal rent assistance already has 13,500 people, 
and city officials have stopped taking applications. Large families who hope to 
get financial help renting three- or four-bedroom apartments there can expect 
to wait up to five years, said Diane McNeel, manager of the city's Housing 
Services Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is worse than the statistics show because large numbers of 
undocumented immigrants live in illegal dwellings such as garages, experts say. 
According to one recent study, based on interviews with local city officials 
and housing documents, the census missed nearly 258,000 people and nearly 2,000 
illegal dwellings in the area. Census officials concede they undercounted 
residents and dwellings, but by a smaller margin. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowded, deplorable living conditions raise a number of safety concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials say families in cramped quarters tend to overload electrical 
outlets, and that many run-down residences have exposed wires. Some families 
also use charcoal barbecues to keep warm, exposing themselves to deadly carbon 
monoxide gas. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners complain that crowded neighborhoods create parking problems and 
bring more crime. Parking is so tight in South Gate that residents have 
expressed concern that emergency vehicles will be unable to get through streets 
at night. South Gate City Manager Todd Argow said he also is concerned that the 
extra residents reduce water pressure needed to fight fires. In neighboring 
Walnut Park, residents say guns have been used to decide parking disputes. 
Community leaders there have launched a campaign against people living in 
garages, reporting the addresses of suspected violators to county officials. 
</P>
<P>
 In Long Beach, residents complain to council members about people loitering 
outside apartment buildings at all hours. Some constituents are leaving the 
city altogether, said Councilman Alan S. Lowenthal, whose district includes a 
number of poor, crowded neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are angry that it's not the community they used to know," Lowenthal 
said. "They're not willing to hang in there and deal with the changes. We don't 
want people to run from their neighborhoods. It's very frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 Health inspectors say crowded, unsanitary residences are breeding grounds for 
contagious diseases such as tuberculosis, influenza and typhus. 
</P>
<P>
 Irma Gutierrez's children suffered through a recent two-month bout of coughing 
and vomiting, which she thinks was related to germs in the damp bathroom air. A 
doctor told her the children had the flu. 
</P>
<P>
 Her landlord recently repaired the bathroom ceiling after receiving warnings 
from the city health department and the city prosecutor's office. A follow-up 
health inspection earlier this month found several hazards throughout the 
apartment building, including a gas line in one unit that was secured to a 
kitchen stove with masking tape. 
</P>
<P>
 "To live in the United States in these conditions is not right," said 
Gutierrez, 44, a native of Mexico. "What do I gain from getting upset?" 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez's landlord, Marcel Jordan, said he is making repairs. But he and 
other landlords say tenants contribute to the problem by renting places too 
small for their families and failing to pay rent on time. 
</P>
<P>
 Wear and tear on walls, carpeting and plumbing is costly and sends property 
values down, making it difficult to sell buildings, the landlords claim. But 
some say they accept the extra tenants because they do not want their 
apartments to sit vacant. "If you have six or seven people living in a unit, it 
is going to be destroyed in no time," Jordan said. "It comes to the point where 
you become callous." 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan said the gas for water heaters was shut off in the apartment building 
for a few days because he could not pay the gas bill on time. He said most of 
the tenants, including Gutierrez, had not paid their rent on time. Some of his 
tenants are three months behind on the rent, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Disaster describes (the situation) for landlords in Long Beach," said Milton 
Funk, a member of the Southeast Assn. of Realtors, who owns property in several 
area cities. "The quality of the tenants has dropped dramatically. They're slow 
to pay, (or don't) pay, and that certainly affects your pocketbook." 
</P>
<P>
 Many families say they have no choice but to live in small apartments or to 
move in with other families because rent consumes such a large share of their 
income. Better housing is often too expensive, with upfront costs running 
$1,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Miguel and Matilda Batres wedge their nine-member household into a tiny room 
at the Tiki Motel in Huntington Park because they cannot afford to pay first 
and last month's rent and a security deposit required for many apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 The family, which relies on welfare and food stamps, has lived at the Tiki 
four years. Six children sleep in a queen-sized bed with their parents, on bunk 
beds or on the floor. The family's 69-year-old grandmother, Guadalupe Martinez, 
sleeps on a vinyl love seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryan Corales, the Tiki's office manager, said families typically stay about a 
year. While acknowledging the rooms are small, Corales said they are clean and 
well-maintained. The only requirement to move in is a $100 cleaning deposit, 
which tenants can pay in installments. "It's more like an apartment than a 
hotel," said Corales, noting that a plumber is also on call to handle problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the $608 the Batres receive in welfare each month, they spend $500 to rent 
their motel room. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the 1990 Census, nearly half of the lower-income households in 
Huntington Park and Bell Gardens use more than 30% of their income for shelter, 
meaning they meet the federal guideline for households in need of assistance or 
lower rent. Nearly one-third of the lower-income households in Long Beach 
exceed the threshold. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least the Batres' have a place to themselves. Many families are forced 
to double and triple up in tight quarters, and some live with strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Just blocks from the Batres' motel room, Braulia Rosales pays $200 a month so 
she, her daughter and granddaughter can share an apartment with seven people. 
Rosales rents one of the two bedrooms. Other tenants sleep in a walk-in closet 
that has been converted into a room, and in the living room behind a makeshift 
wall of blankets strung over a laundry line. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't use the living room, only the bathroom and the kitchen," said 
Rosales, 43, standing amid a playpen, cot and bookshelves in her room. "I had 
to store my things in a garage because there is not enough room here." 
</P>
<P>
 While dissatisfied with their living conditions, and the amount they must 
spend on rent, Rosales and others say they are thankful at least to have their 
families together under one roof. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather be in here than on some crazy street where we have to build a 
house with whatever we can find," said Frank Gonzales, 30, who pays $450 a 
month so his family of four can live in a room at the Tiki Motel. 
</P>
<P>
 Illegal immigrants such as Rosales and Gonzales are often afraid of law 
enforcement authorities and unaware of the agencies and laws that can help 
them, experts say.  
</P>
<P>
 In Long Beach's growing Cambodian community, newcomers are often reluctant to 
seek help from anyone, including those from their homeland, because of shame 
over their living conditions, said Sokennedy Pen of the Long Beach-based 
Cambodian Assn. of America. Day-to-day living itself can be a futile 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have not been exposed to running water, electricity (or) street signs," 
Pen said of the new immigrants. "They are still struggling at bare survival." 
</P>
<P>
 If tenants report problems, they often cannot expect immediate help because 
officials are so overwhelmed. Long Beach has just five health inspectors to 
police more than 8,000 licensed apartments, motels and hotels, said Steve Le 
Cheminant, a housing inspection supervisor with the city's Department of Health 
and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
 The department makes annual inspections of residential properties that have 
more than five units. Although inspectors try to resolve cases within 60 days, 
the process is often prolonged for six months or more by landlords who refuse 
to cooperate. Those who do not make repairs can face a maximum $1,000 fine and 
six months in jail. Even when health inspectors do their job, it can have the 
unintended result of getting tenants evicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Landlords counter that they must evict tenants when health, safety or building 
codes are violated. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of cities are trying to address the crowding problem through 
inspection laws. Long Beach requires garage inspections in the congested 
downtown area when residential properties are sold. Santa Fe Springs inspects 
rental units annually or when they are sold or tenants move. Hawaiian Gardens 
and Whittier have also taken steps to protect people who live in garages, 
requiring landlords to pay costs to relocate tenants when illegal conversions 
are discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 But housing advocates say that attempts to legislate the problem away are 
futile, partly because such efforts could end up putting people on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 The advocates call for more low-cost housing and government programs that help 
families buy homes or fix up their rental units. But experts predict that 
progress will be slow because of the lingering recession, which has cut into 
funding for public programs and slowed the pace of construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Poor people need the same decent housing that all people need," said Rockway 
of the Legal Aid Foundation of Long Beach. "Living in a motel room or a garage 
is better than being homeless, but it's not good enough for my family or 
anybody else's family." Increase in Poverty

LIFE & TIMES / WENDY MILLER: A SECRET IS KEPT IN SEARCH FOR THE PAST 
</P>

 When disasters such as earthquakes and fires lay waste to our homes and our 
lives, we realize what really matters: people, and the things that bind us to 
people. Pictures of the grandparents, poems from kindergarten, a late aunt's 
pearls -- the mementos and heirlooms that give us a sense of purpose, belonging 
and continuity. 
</P>
<P>
 Without them we feel robbed of our rightful place in our own history. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a feeling that must be familiar to many Native Americans, especially 
those, like local descendants of the Chumash, who have seen many of their 
artifacts -- especially their cave paintings and rock art -- looted by souvenir 
hunters and dealers, and destroyed by vandals. 
</P>
<P>
 In this week's cover story, Jeff Meyers writes about the stolen past of the 
Chumash and what preservationists, Native Americans and the federal government 
are doing to preserve the artifacts that remain on public land. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process of researching this story, Meyers visited several sites where 
Chumash paintings and drawings can be found. 
</P>
<P>
 The best-preserved of those paintings, he found, have remained pristine, in 
large part, by being difficult to find. 
</P>
<P>
 One, in particular, was a little too difficult to find. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyers was guided to a secret cave in Los Padres National Forest by retired 
forester Herm Zittel. Meyers was so blown away by what he found -- a red condor 
painted on the cave's ceiling hundreds of years ago -- that he bragged about it 
around the office. Before he knew it, a hike was organized. 
</P>
<P>
 Confident of his ability to find the cave without Zittel's help, Meyers led a 
dozen co-workers into the county's mountainous backcountry last Sunday. 
Spending the better part of the afternoon marching single file over rugged 
terrain, the group reached the secret site -- and couldn't locate the cave. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hike was more rigorous than I'd remembered, so I felt bad when it didn't 
pay off with this incredible condor," Meyers said. "We were pretty exhausted. 
There was talk of mutiny. I kind of felt like the leader of the Donner Party." 
</P>
<P>
 Skeptics among the hikers wondered if the condor hadn't been a figment of 
Meyers' imagination, but it does exist -- and we have the photos to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyers called Zittel to find out where he went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me we were probably within 100 yards of the cave," Meyers said. "I've 
vowed to return once more and find it." 
</P>
<P>
 He may have to make this hike alone.

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LONG BEACH; NAVY WILL RESUME HOSPITAL HEARINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EMILY ADAMS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Under pressure from a coalition of local cities, the Navy has decided to 
reopen hearings on reuse of the U.S. Naval Hospital in Long Beach, which is 
closing in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Six cities, calling themselves the Southeast Area Military Facility Reuse 
Alliance of Cities, have opposed Long Beach's plan to turn the site into a 
major shopping center, claiming that another mall would destroy surrounding 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The alliance, led by Lakewood officials who fear that a new shopping center 
would lure customers from the nearby Lakewood Center Mall, has spent thousands 
of city dollars lobbying the Navy to turn down the Long Beach plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, the cities received a letter from Fred Sterns, assistant 
Navy secretary, detailing the Navy's plans to reopen the process for 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
 During this time, the Navy will hold a series of public meetings, soliciting 
ideas on how to use the hospital site, Sterns said. 
</P>
<P>
 The alliance, which includes Lakewood, Buena Park, Cypress, Hawaiian Gardens, 
Artesia and Garden Grove, claimed a partial victory in the Navy's announcement. 
The group has argued that a new mall could eliminate 6,000 to 9,000 retail jobs 
in the region. EMILY ADAMS

CITY HALL JOURNAL: COMPTON; CITY COUNCIL DECIDES TO BUY TROUBLED HOTEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city moved a step closer to selling the troubled Compton Ramada Hotel when 
the City Council decided to purchase the hotel from the Community Redevelopment 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The paper transaction will allow officials to place money from the sale in 
city coffers, rather than limiting the proceeds primarily to redevelopment 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Following a brief, sparsely attended public hearing last week, council members 
agreed unanimously to purchase the hotel for $5,037,743, which equals the 
amount the Redevelopment Agency borrowed from the city for upkeep of the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has been managing the hotel since beginning foreclosure proceedings 
more than two years ago against a delinquent developer who never made a payment 
on more than $5 million in city-backed loans. The 288-room hotel and attached 
convention center have suffered low occupancy rates and managerial upheavals 
since opening in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 While the city previously estimated the hotel and convention center's worth at 
$35 million to $40 million, most city officials say it's doubtful they will be 
able to sell for that amount, due to a depressed real estate market. EMILY

 Mayor Pro Tem Ken Cleveland has a problem -- one with a little red light on 
top. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the video camera used to broadcast City Council meetings on cable 
television.Cleveland says he's fed up with political hopefuls and incumbents 
who play to the camera during election season, making lengthy speeches, 
dragging council meetings into the early morning. He wants the camera shut off 
until campaigns are over. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're all playing to the TV," Cleveland said. "They come to the meetings to 
do their political thing. They don't care if we're there until 2 a.m. listening 
to everyone. They make their speeches, then leave." 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland is not up for reelection, but Mayor Bob Stone and Councilmen Bill 
Pendleton and John Ansdell are. And they all voted against Cleveland's recent 
proposal that televised broadcasts of the meetings be halted until after the 
April 12th election. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Pendleton said Cleveland has a good point. "That podium is used by 
people with no scruples to promote themselves," Pendleton said. But he voted 
against the proposal because "if it had passed, it might have looked like we 
were trying to hide something." 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland said he wasn't surprised by the 4-1 vote. "Everyone wants their time 
on TV," he said. EMILY ADAMS

COUNTRY ROUNDUP: BOOT SCOOTIN' SENIORS LEARN THE LOWDOWN ON LINE DANCING; A 
HUSBAND-AND-WIFE TEACHING TEAM HAS MODIFIED SOME OF THE HARDER DANCE STEPS TO 
MAKE THEM EASIER TO MASTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When this column first appeared back in October, a reader in Camarillo wrote 
to ask my help in finding a place in her neighborhood where she and fellow 
"boot scootin' seniors of Leisure Village" could take country-Western line 
dance lessons and not get tangled up on a small floor with younger people. 
</P>
<P>
 These 60-plus seniors described themselves as active. But many folks -- 
regardless of age -- don't cotton to dancing where it's dark, smoky or rowdy. 
That's why I've been pointing you to the community centers and similar venues 
where lots of line dance and couples classes for ages 18 and older are being 
offered. And if older folks prefer to stick with just their peers, many senior 
centers now also sponsor these classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that a lot of the senior citizens come out for medical reasons," said 
Dora Lee, an instructor whose students are mostly seniors. "The aerobic 
exercise improves their circulation and they get to socialize." 
</P>
<P>
 Dora and Terry, her husband of 10 years, began teaching line dancing on a 
volunteer basis at the Oxnard Moose Lodge in March. And twice a month, they 
visit Lemonwood Mobile Home Park in Ventura, where they average about a dozen 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lees have adapted some line dance moves for their older students with 
balance or body-support problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "For example, in 'Swingin,' the first dance I taught at Lemonwood, there's a 
grapevine step to the left with a half turn and then a hitch. That means 
they're putting weight back on one leg. So I taught them instead of hitching to 
bring the right leg down to balance on the floor so they don't get tired. And a 
lot of them couldn't make the half turn. So we do it a quarter and another 
quarter turn. I've eliminated balancing on one foot and tough pivots," Dora 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although frailer students needed the adaptive moves to start with, Dora said 
many have now gained strength and balance to do the original, more challenging 
steps. 
</P>
<P>
 She is encouraged by her students' success. But for someone who's been at it 
less than a year, Dora Lee is the one who deserves to feel proud. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time I ever got up on the dance floor for a line dance lesson was 
at the Crazy Bull last February," she recalled. "I've always loved to dance. 
And not really having a partner -- because Terry's in the chair -- I still want 
to be on the dance floor." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee's husband, who has been confined to a wheelchair since a trucking accident 
in 1967, was in the hospital for ongoing medical problems in February. An avid 
country music fan since childhood, he wasn't familiar with line dancing. "While 
he was in the hospital, I showed him what I learned," Dora said. "Later, he 
went to the club with me and got very supportive. 
</P>

CENTURY FREEWAY GETS HIGH MARKS IN FIRST QUAKE TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL GOTTESMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The infant Century Freeway apparently has passed its first tremor test with 
flying colors, Caltrans officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A preliminary inspection of the 3-month-old freeway found no stress cracks or 
other damage after Monday's magnitude 6.6 earthquake. The freeway, also known 
as the 105, sports some of the county's highest overpasses. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans engineers said they were not surprised that the 17.3-mile roadway 
between Norwalk and El Segundo withstood the earthquake, while portions of the 
Santa Monica Freeway (10) buckled and an Antelope Valley Freeway (14) overpass 
collapsed onto the Golden State Freeway (5). 
</P>
<P>
 "We've learned from every earthquake we've had in California, and we've 
changed the design standards each time," said Caltrans district director Jerry 
B. Baxter. "The Century was built using the most modern standards, and 
obviously, they worked."  
</P>
<P>
 Baxter said the key factor is that additional steel bars were used to 
reinforce concrete columns supporting the Century Freeway's 12 lanes and 
numerous overpasses, on-ramps and off-ramps. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans began requiring steel reinforcement in freeway bridges and overpasses 
following the 1971 Sylmar quake, which toppled freeway overpasses. The agency 
is in the middle of a $1.5-billion reinforcement program designed to shore up 
bridges and overpasses with steel encasing. 
</P>
<P>
 Columns supporting the bridges and overpasses along the Santa Monica Freeway 
-- including the three that buckled and partially collapsed Monday morning -- 
were scheduled to be retrofitted this spring, Baxter said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least we knew (the Century Freeway columns) didn't need to be 
strengthened," Baxter said. "They are about as strong as they come, and were 
built with every safety feature we know of." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Baxter said, the Century is probably more seismically safe than many 
homes in the communities it traverses.  
</P>
<P>
 "People might be afraid to go back on the freeways," he said. "But most of 
them are living in homes that were built . . . when earthquake standards were 
virtually unheard of. If I were them, I'd rather be on the (Century) freeway 
when the next one hits." 
</P>
<P>
 The $2.2-billion highway opened in October, with computerized traffic monitors 
and closed-circuit television cameras to alert officials to accidents. The 
freeway was built to serve as another east-west route for commuters, but Baxter 
predicts it will become a primary thoroughfare as drivers seek detours around 
the closed sections of the Santa Monica Freeway.

AFTER THE SHAKING; SOUTHEAST CITIES RATTLED BY QUAKE BUT SPARED HEAVY DAMAGE

 Pat Fitzgerald had planned to close his surf shop in downtown Whittier at the 
end of the month. Business wasn't all that good, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Monday, a 6.6-magnitude earthquake pushed up Fitzgerald's closing date. 
The temblor buckled an exterior brick wall at Fitzgerald's store and shattered 
the front windows. And when he arrived to inspect the damage, he found the shop 
had been looted. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just my luck," Fitzgerald said as workers removed the few surfboards and 
skating gear that remained. He had moved his shop from Monrovia to Whittier 
after the Sierra Madre quake two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 While quake damage was perhaps most visible in Whittier, the temblor made its 
mark on other cities in the Southeast and Long Beach areas. 
</P>
<P>
 In Downey, the quake set off a sprinkler system that flooded the Robinsons-May 
store in the Stonewood Center, said Larry Norton, mall general manager. The 
store was cleaned and reopened Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Compton, a post office branch at 701 Santa Fe Ave. lost power and was 
closed Tuesday. A spokesman said mail delivery was suspended and customers were 
directed to other branches. The post office reopened Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Scattered power outages were reported in residential neighborhoods in Lakewood 
and Compton, but power had been restored in most areas by late Tuesday, utility 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and fire crews throughout the area responded to hundreds of reports of 
broken pipes, leaking gas and minor fires. Hospitals tried to cope with the 
overflow of patients from other facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Long Beach scrambled 
to find beds for 89 patients who were transferred from a quake-ravaged 
veteran's hospital in Sepulveda. Long Beach Memorial Medical Center admitted 
two children from a pediatrics intensive care ward at Northridge Hospital 
Medical Center, which was severely damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital emergency rooms were also jammed with patients, including mothers 
frightened into early labor and others cut and bruised by flying glass and 
falling objects. A paramedic was treated at St. Mary Medical Center after his 
arm was crushed by elevator doors at the Long Beach Naval Station, a 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Public schools were closed Monday for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. 
Although they were open Tuesday, some parents chose to keep their children at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in Norwalk-La Mirada, Lynwood and Montebello school districts said 
some classrooms were sparsely attended. 
</P>
<P>
 Compton officials said only 25% of the district's 28,000 students went to 
school Tuesday. They attributed the low attendance to erroneous news reports 
that classes had been canceled. "We sent substitute teachers to schools, and 
they were being sent back because there were no students," district spokeswoman 
Arianna Barrios said. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after the quake, cities deployed teams of building inspectors to examine 
structures most prone to damage. 
</P>
<P>
 In Long Beach, inspectors found only three buildings with superficial cracks, 
said Eugene Zeller, superintendent of building and safety. Nevertheless, the 
city is pressing ahead with its earthquake safety program, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program targets 565 structures that lack reinforced masonry and others 
prone to collapse. Of that number, 437 have been strengthened since 1991, 
leaving 128 buildings that must still be reinforced within the next year, said 
Ken Kayashtha, a civil engineer overseeing the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The buildings are the survivors of the 1933 Long Beach earthquake that shook 
apart many unreinforced structures and killed 115 people. The disaster prompted 
state officials to begin upgrading California's building codes. As a result, 
buildings constructed since 1934 have been more resistant to quake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 In Whittier, city administrators and public works crews discovered a crumbling 
brick wall and a loose facade in the heart of the Uptown district, which is the 
downtown area. But storefronts had been spared heavy damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Considering what they had in San Fernando, we fared better than OK," City 
Manager Tom Mauk said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the city learned its lesson after a 5.9-magnitude quake rolled through 
town on Oct. 1, 1987, and caused about $90 million in damage. It destroyed 34 
buildings and damaged 23 others. About half of the historic downtown district 
had to be razed. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 17 structures have been reinforced since 1988, when the city adopted 
an ordinance that gave property owners seven years to make buildings 
quake-resistant. 
</P>
<P>
 Businessman Lane Langford said many merchants took advantage of low-interest 
loans to prepare for future devastation. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, Langford reinforced his own one-story building, which houses 
the Bookland bookstore on Greenleaf Avenue. But Langford said he was was still 
frightened early Monday when he felt his house in Whittier bucking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt it was more fierce than the one in 1987. I was worried," Langford 
said. "I fully expected to go to Uptown Whittier and see my whole life 
destroyed."  
</P>
<P>
 Langford saw hundreds of scattered books, but there were no cracks in the 
walls. "I really felt like I wanted to start crying with relief," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 4 p.m., a dozen hours after the first quake struck, Whittier business 
owners were still replacing broken panes of glass on their storefronts when a 
5.5-magnitude aftershock hit. Rattled merchants and customers rushed into the 
street.

 Pedro Hernandez, co-owner of the Uptown Mexican Cafe, said he had no qualms 
about staying in Whittier, however.

 "Anywhere you go, you don't know when earthquakes are going to happen," said 
Hernandez, who had to replace the front window. "We have to continue to 
rebuild."

NIGHT LIFE: THE SLAM ALICE STORY: A TALE OF FUNNY LYRICS AND LOTS OF BEER; 
SENDUPS OF HIT SONGS SPICE THE INTENSE, GRUNGY AND SORT OF MELODIC TUNES TURNED 
OUT BY THE THREE SUDS-GUZZLING ROCKERS.

<P>
 I don't know what she did, but Alice must have done something to deserve all 
this. 
</P>
<P>
 First, there was Alice Cooper who turned out to be a very strange man. Then 
there was Alice Donut, a loud thrash band from the Bay Area. Then things got 
really gnarly with Alice In Chains from Seattle, and most recently, from 
Ventura, there's Slam Alice. The local version is about as serious as a 
one-star comedy when it comes to the whole rock 'n' roll thing. 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, they were named for a donkey named Alice. They don't get enough 
girls, even Alices, so they tend to concentrate on beer, of which they can 
consume vast quantities. They've had more than their fair share of Gigs From 
Hell, including one where someone threw a full bottle of beer at former Kiss 
guitarist Ace Frehley. At least no one got shot -- that was another gig. 
</P>
<P>
 Slam Alice is Jack Rickman on guitar, Fred Dixon on bass, and the new guy is 
Chris Lytle on drums. Generally, you can't take these guys anywhere, but the 
Midnight Hour will have a go at it on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Slam Alice plays intense, grungy yet melodic (sort of) songs with some very 
funny lyrics. Of course, they're so loud you probably couldn't understand the 
words anyway, so there's probably no need to take notes. They have songs about 
important stuff like Taco Bell or all those Winger/Warrant/Poison poser bands, 
"Deadly Spitting Cobras;" and they put that reptile into warp drive on a brutal 
rendition of "Puff the Magic Dragon." 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting around the band's practice site, the members, between scenes of those 
Bundys on the tube, talked about beer, music and more beer. 
</P>
<P>
 All right, so who's to blame for all this? 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon: He is. (Pointing at Rickman) We started about four years ago. I knew 
two chords; now I know three. We just got Chris a month ago because we needed a 
(woman) magnet; you know, a young, longhair hippie dude to attract some 
(women). 
</P>
<P>
 Lytle: Didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon: Hey, you're on the bubble, dude. 
</P>
<P>
 Girls hate you guys? 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon: Yeah, we realize we're fat and we're never going to get any (women). 
You'll either dig our music or just laugh at us. We did have our first dancer 
the other night, though -- some drunk guy. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you guys at least get free beer? 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon: Yeah, we always get beer at least until they cut us off. 
</P>
<P>
 Rickman: Beer is better than money because when you have money, you just buy 
beer, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon: Every musician says they can drink a lot of beer, but we have the 
bellies to prove it. We can outdrink all of them. We drink beer and dream about 
(women). 
</P>
<P>
 So what's up with this Ace Frehley incident? 
</P>
<P>
 Rickman: He was my idol and we were going to open for him at the Ventura 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon: But he wouldn't talk to anybody -- he was too good for us. Backstage, 
like two minutes before we were supposed to go on, Frehley goes running up the 
stairs and someone threw a beer bottle at him. Naturally, I denied it all the 
way. His manager said 'Bottom line: If they play, we don't.' So they kicked us 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 Rickman: Frehley was old. I hate his guts. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you remember the first Slam Alice gig? 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon: Yeah, it was in October '91 at Gorman State Park. We were up there 
riding motorcycles, and since we had all our stuff, we decided to play. It was 
pitch black, so we turned on some headlights and hooked up to a generator. 
</P>
<P>
 Rickman: We only knew four songs and we kept making up the lyrics and we 
played the same songs over and over. We probably couldn't do that again -- too 
many rangers now. 
</P>
<P>
 Any other weird gigs? 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon: They're all weird. It seems like we always end up playing with Rooster 
Ra and everybody leaves before we come on. 
</P>
<P>
 Rickman: Well, there was that one gig in Ojai where my guitar got shot. We 
were playing at this party with Chris' other band, Reality Sandwich, when 
everyone started slamming. Next thing, a fight started, and when I heard 
gunfire, I left my guitar on stage and got the hell away from there. Somebody 
shot my guitar and I had to send it back to Kentucky to get a new neck. That 
one cost about $800. 
</P>
<P>
 So do you know more than four songs now? 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon: That we really know? Hmmm, I guess we have 40 or 50 songs. Jack writes 
them and I tell him if they suck or not. 
</P>
<P>
 Rickman: I hate everything he likes. There's not one tape in this whole house 
that I'd want to listen to. I just want to write good songs, learn to play 
them, then get a gig. Actually, I'm just doing this so I can get out of the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 Your cover of "Puff the Magic Dragon" is hilarious. Any other classic songs 
you guys brutalize? 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon: Sure. We do "YMCA" and "My Girl," which becomes "My Beer." 
</P>
<P>
 And your "Sixteen Candles" song is not the doo-wop classic? 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon: No, that one's our Seattle rip-off song so we could get signed, but we 
gave up when we realized how fat we really were. 
</P>
<P>
 So how does a local band get signed? 
</P>
<P>
 Rickman: They don't. 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon: We've got a distribution deal with Noiseosaurus, which is this guy 
named Darren Kossinski from the East End who's gonna produce and market a tape 
for us. We met this guy at one of our gigs. 
</P>
<P>
 So you guys do have fans? 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon: We have a fan. 
</P>
<P>
 Is the local scene happening? 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon: Well, we miss Charlie's and all that Watney's Ale. The Midnight Hour is 
pretty cool, and we wouldn't mind playing the Ventura Theatre again. The local 
bands here, from all the genres of rock, are as good or better than anywhere 
else. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's Slam Alice's genre? 
</P>
<P>
 Rickman: Old Black Sabbath meets the Ramones. 
</P>
<P>
 If you guys could have a dream gig who would it be with? 
</P>
<P>
 Lytle: Soundgarden. 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon: Soundgarden? The Ramones. 
</P>
<P>
 Rickman: I hate the Ramones. Black Sabbath. 
</P>
<P>
 How 'bout those Dodgers? 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon: The Dodgers are gonna take it this year. I mean, who do they have to 
beat? The Colorado Rockies? The San Diego Padres? The Giants without Will 
Clark? No problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Rickman: I've lived here all my life and I've been a Cardinals fan since I was 
this high. 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon: Yeah, and you went to Buena, too. My school, Ventura High, has beaten 
them four years in a row in football. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you guys have day jobs? 
</P>
<P>
 Rickman: I work at the Price Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Lytle: This is my life. 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon: I'm going to the Police Academy next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Rickman: A cop? Can you believe this guy? 
</P>
<P>
 So what's next for Slam Alice? 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon: It's a weekly thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Rickman: I'll keep going until mama says I can't go out and play anymore.

CHEVRON AGREES TO RESTORE HILL LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PSYCHE PASCUAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chevron oil officials have agreed to restore the hills above the city with 
native grasses and plants before abandoning old oil wells in an unincorporated 
area just outside city limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevron's agreement was included in its application to grade 27 acres of land 
while searching for sites of abandoned oil wells, according to an environmental 
study to the county Regional Planning Commission.The application and an 
environmental report will be considered at the commission's Feb. 16 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, county planning officials put a halt to Chevron's grading near 
Hadley Street and Satinwood Drive after Whittier officials complained that 
substantial soil had been bulldozed and moved without a permit. City officials 
hope to acquire the land and the surrounding area for future park space.  
</P>
<P>
 Although state law requires developers to acquire grading permits when 
building, it was not required when abandoning old wells, city officials said. 
The environmental study also calls for Chevron to install an extensive drainage 
system to prevent landslides during grading. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittier officials have also asked that Chevron provide a biologist and an 
archeologist to oversee the grading, city Planning Director Elvin Porter said. 
The commission hearing will be at 9 a.m. in Room 150 of the Hall of Records, 
320 W. Temple St., Los Angeles. PSYCHE PASCUAL

SOUNDS: JAZZ STALWART HITS HIGH NOTES OF MUSICAL SUCCESS AT LONG LAST; JOE 
HENDERSON HAS LONG BEEN A CULT FIGURE AMONG MUSICIANS. NOW, AT 56, HE IS 
FINALLY RECEIVING WIDER ACCLAIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the past several years, the jazz marketing machinery has placed a premium 
on youth, sometimes promoting undercooked players with more time than talent on 
their side. 
</P>
<P>
 And, then, there is the story of Joe Henderson, straight out of the 
better-late-than-never file. 
</P>
<P>
 The warm and witty tenor saxophonist, now 56, has been a powerful figure and 
cult favorite among musicians and aficionados since he began making solo albums 
for the Blue Note label in the mid-1960s. After a stint with Blood, Sweat and 
Tears in the late '60s, he settled into a creatively fertile but humbler public 
profile. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in the last two years, Henderson has burst on the scene with the 
intensity of an overnight sensation. His last two albums for the Verve label, 
"Lush Life: The Music of Billy Strayhorn" and "So Near, So Far (Musings for 
Miles)," have shot to the top of the jazz charts and helped earn him high 
placement in the magazine polls. 
</P>
<P>
 For an unprecedented two years in a row, Henderson has won the "triple crown" 
award in Down Beat magazine -- Best Artist, Best Tenor Saxophonist and Best 
Album plaudits. A four-CD archival collection, "The Blue Note Years," was also 
just released, providing vital background material for consumers who think of 
Henderson as a "new" sensation. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the sudden explosion of attention? The strength of his recent albums has a 
lot to do with the success, and the fact that Henderson's style has had an 
identifiable impact on the current crop of young neo-hard-bop musicians on the 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
 But it may also be that this player, who decades ago was lavished with 
talent-deserving-wider-recognition accolades, has finally received his 
long-overdue just desserts. Could it be that there is justice after all in the 
jazz world? 
</P>
<P>
 Last weekend, Henderson -- who has lived in San Francisco since the early '70s 
-- was in Boston as a featured guest at the 21st annual conference of the 
International Assn. of Jazz Educators. He was slated to concertize with the 
all-star band from his "So Near, So Far" band -- guitarist John Scofield, 
bassist Dave Holland and drummer Al Foster. After Boston, the road-worn player 
was on his way to New York City to play a recording date with young trumpeter 
Roy Hargrove. 
</P>
<P>
 This Sunday, Henderson makes his way to Ojai's Wheeler Hot Springs, his first 
appearance in the area, and it promises to be perhaps the most significant show 
yet in Wheeler's ongoing jazz concert series. 
</P>
<P>
 Henderson spoke from his hotel in Boston. In conversation, as in his 
improvisation, Henderson finds the most interesting path between two points, 
often taking tangential routes around a given subject. 
</P>
<P>
 Are you accustomed to being mobile and portable by now, traveling all the 
time? 
</P>
<P>
 The last year and a half has really changed. After a while, you kind of settle 
into a kind of a style. I figured, well, I'm usually working five or six months 
out of the year and the rest of the time, I'm just around San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 But then over the last year and a half, that plan that I just fell into over 
time got really disrupted, with all of these calls. They were great calls. Wow. 
I just wonder where they'd been all of this time. I didn't just start doing 
this, you know. You can look at me and tell that. 
</P>
<P>
 This would have been nice if it had come down about 30 years ago. But things 
never happen when they're supposed to happen, so you just have to go along with 
it when it's there. I'm just trying to do the best I can to keep up with 
everything. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as I get to places like this conference, this is great. This is worth 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 You really never made "commercial" jazz records, did you? 
</P>
<P>
 I picked up the dice there once or twice when everybody was doing that. And I 
come from that kind of a spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm born right out of the loins of rock 'n' roll. Before that, it was rhythm 
and blues. That's where it all started for me, but that was a long time ago. 
These were some of the first sounds that went into my ears. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, I was within earshot of my brother's fantastic record collection, 
probably when I was about 7 years old. "Jazz at the Phil." It was Bird (Charlie 
Parker), Prez (Lester Young), Ben Webster, all these great players who were 
with the Phil that started going into my ears. That seems to be what I liked. 
</P>
<P>
 Even from that age? 
</P>
<P>
 Right. I didn't know what the hell I was doing at that time, but I knew that 
there was something there that was all right. I was trying to find my way 
around the saxophone on my own. By the time I got a little bit of mastery over 
these sounds that I was hearing, that got me so cranked up there, I don't think 
I've looked back since that point. 
</P>
<P>
 I got a chance to see some of these players when I was in my hometown of Lima, 
Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 You came of age as a solo artist during the '60s, when you were with Blue 
Note. Was that a real high point in terms of a collective movement? 
</P>
<P>
 It was, because it was pushing back those boundaries and the borders that the 
be-bop and its tradition had placed there. Here comes these be-boppers in the 
'60s saying, "Well, we're not going to exactly do away with that." Let's just 
change this around a little bit here and there. You got the help of geniuses 
like Ornette (Coleman) and Eric (Dolphy) and 'Trane (John Coltrane) there, and 
you get something that's pretty heavy there. 
</P>
<P>
 That stopped somewhere as we entered into the '70s. That sounds kind of down, 
but as I think back on it, as we got into the '80s, I don't really remember too 
much from the '70s. That's how powerful the '60s were for me. The '70s just 
kind of came and went. 
</P>
<P>
 Was it a kind of transition period for you? 
</P>
<P>
 I guess. I just don't remember that there was anything that went down in the 
'70s that I can remember right now as I'm talking to you. I don't remember any 
tunes that are still wandering around in my brain. You know that tune "the song 
has ended, but the melody lingers on?" 
</P>
<P>
 Do you feel like everything has come to fruition for you in the last couple of 
years? 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of things have. There have been more gigs and that kind of thing, and 
the remunerative part of that equation has gotten to the point to where it 
could have been -- should have been -- all of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 You're talking to a pretty pleased person here, but I've still got work to do 
here. I'm still practicing like I always did. I'm trying to put melodies 
together, record dates, music projects. My brain is just buzzing as a result of 
this late recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 I've been too busy all this time just doing what I'm doing. I don't even have 
time to appreciate that. Right now, I'm busy writing these melodies out.

COMMUNITY NEWS: WHITTIER; 'STAR SHIP' PROJECT AWAITS FINAL TOUCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN POPE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bernard and Roberta Campbell's neighbors have seen some unusual decorations 
over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1985 Halloween season there was Snoopy in a British Sopwith fighter, 
aiming for the Red Baron's German plane above their Whittier home. At Christmas 
in 1987, there was Norman Rockwell's painting, "Winter Scene," re-created in 
the Campbells' front yard, where passersby posed in the sled and toboggan for 
photographs. 
</P>
<P>
 And two years later, a dancing robot, spaceship and two "Martians" stood 
before a green cloud on the roof to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Orson 
Welles' broadcast, "The War of the Worlds." 
</P>
<P>
 Now Bernard Campbell, a 62-year-old artisan and former Hughes Aircraft worker, 
is looking for a home for his latest creation: a gray, drivable craft of wood, 
aluminum, steel and plastic he calls the Star Ship. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell began the project in 1988, planning to give the finished ship to a 
youth organization. He worked about 15 to 20 hours a week for nearly two years, 
he said, before a heart attack and subsequent surgery forced him to stop before 
the final touches could be added. He said he hopes to donate the ship to a 
youth group that can complete the project and use it for recreation. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell fashioned the ship around a three-wheel scooter and a boat hull. 
Three simulated rocket engines, with red, glowing lights and a vacuum cleaner 
engine for sound add to the effect. A two-cylinder scooter engine powers the 
craft, although the vehicle still needs to be licensed for street driving. 
Headlights, turn signals, interior panels and some additional lights and 
gadgets still need to be added, he said, and will probably cost between $100 
and $200. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell said he will answer written requests from any youth organization or 
club interested in obtaining the Star Ship. His address: 18015 Arroyo Drive, 
Whittier 90604.

MEDIA; FINANCIAL PAPER CLOSING IN ON BOTTOM LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG KRIKORIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The smart money wasn't on William O'Neil, a smooth-talking stock market guru, 
when he launched his own newspaper 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neil wasn't just starting a newsletter. He was launching a national business 
daily. And he was publishing it in West Los Angeles, about as far from 
Manhattan's financial markets as one can get. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody thought we were nuts," he recalls. "Very few people thought we 
would make it." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, O'Neil's publication, Investor's Business Daily, ranks among the 
nation's fastest-growing newspapers. Although small compared to the 
1.82-million circulation Wall Street Journal, the paper continues to gain 
subscribers. Its circulation, now 177,000, is 22,000 higher than at the start 
of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are growing 500 to 1,000 (subscribers) a week," O'Neil said. He predicts 
the paper can reach its break-even point -- a circulation of 235,000 -- by the 
end of next year. 
</P>
<P>
 A break-even proposition might not seem so terrific to those who have banked 
on O'Neil's stock tips for years. He has spent more than three decades as a 
financial analyst and investor and has a huge following through his paper, 
seminars and best-selling book. 
</P>
<P>
 But publishing is a struggle today. Even for the giants. Of the 20 largest 
newspapers in the country, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations, only 
four posted readership gains -- in all cases modest -- during the first six 
months of 1993 compared to the same period in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Said newspaper analyst John Morton: "Apparently, they have appealed to a 
market." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neil began publishing his newspaper -- then called Investors Daily -- in 
March, 1984, finishing the first year with a circulation of 25,000. After 
working out advertising and distribution bugs, the paper settled in for the 
long haul, refining its product with new investment features. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a financial research company, the newspaper began running stories and 
charts that gave experienced investors and beginners more analysis than they 
might otherwise receive in other daily publications. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most popular features has been the earnings-per-share ranking that 
tells readers how companies have compared in profitability over the past five 
years. The so-called EPS rankings run from 1 to 99 -- the number reflecting 
what percentage of companies the stock in question has outperformed. A company 
with a 70 ranking, for example, has outpaced 70% of all companies listed within 
the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
 There also are a number of standing features on national issues, the economy 
and investors, and a section dubbed Leaders and Success.

 Gauging the newspaper's performance, however, remains difficult, even for 
those who are in the business of analyzing the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Morton, an analyst with Washington-based Lynch, Jones and Ryan, says that 
despite the steady circulation gains posted by Investor's Business Daily, the 
fact that it has not reached a break-even point must be taken into account. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until they start making money, I am not sure you can say they have a carved 
out a niche, or at least a profitable one," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Morton added that Investor's Business Daily -- like papers such as USA 
Today and large metropolitan dailies -- seems to have eaten into the Wall 
Street Journal's huge readership by stressing more consumer-oriented coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been kind of a truism in the newspaper business that if a market is 
already well-served by a paper, it is difficult for a new one to come along and 
displace it or even make much of an inroad," Morton said. "Generally to do 
anything, you have to become more of a specialized publication. You can't come 
in otherwise and expect to do something against a Goliath," like the Wall 
Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on its circulation gains, Morton says, Investor's Business Daily has 
learned that lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper's executives acknowledge what many analysts have long observed: 
The Wall Street Journal may be the best written and edited newspaper in the 
country. But they are competing hard to lure Journal readers. This month, they 
say, Investor's Business Daily will increase its editorial staff of 40 writers 
and editors by 20% to 25%. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 In the long term, the newspaper is betting it will benefit as Southern 
California -- bolstered in part by links to fast-growing Pacific Rim countries 
-- becomes an increasingly important economic center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think the world is tilting this way (and) New York will become less and 
less important as a city," said Wes Mann, who joined the paper at its inception 
as a reporter and now is its editor. "It is the financial center, yes, and the 
publishing center of the country. But we don't think it is unnatural to have a 
financial publication outside of New York." Paying Dividends

<P>
 Investor's Business Daily has made major circulation gains in the past decade. 
It's betting that it can compete with the Wall Street Journal.

COMMUNITY NEWS: WHITTIER; INITIAL GROUP AT INMATE BOOT CAMP GRADUATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seven youthful offenders have graduated from a rigorous boot camp in Whittier 
after four months of strict military-style living that included marching 
drills, pushups, flag-raisings and substance-abuse counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 The young men, who walked through the barbed-wire gates of the Fred C. Nelles 
School last week, volunteered for the program in exchange for shortened 
sentences, and will meet with parole officers at least once a week for the next 
six months. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're off to a real good start," said Capt. Michael Naquin, who heads the 
program. "They grew up while they were here and made some strides in maturity." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents, officials with the California Youth Authority and Gov. Pete Wilson 
attended a graduation ceremony Friday. The LEAD program, which stands for 
leadership, esteem, ability and discipline -- is the second of two boot camps 
set up by the Youth Authority within a year. The other is near Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 All the cadets at Nelles, aged 16 to 21, are in custody for parole violations 
or because of drug, burglary or other nonviolent offenses. Many are former gang 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven graduates were among an initial class of 15 who began the program in 
September. Seven cadets were required to take more training. Another was 
transferred back to the general population at Nelles because he was unwilling 
to follow the rules, Naquin said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SIGNAL HILL; 3 CHARGED IN DUMPING OF TOXIC RAINWATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three officers of a crude-oil cleaning and storage facility here have been 
charged with dumping toxic rainwater onto city streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office filed a 38-count felony and misdemeanor 
complaint against Petroleum Recycling Corp., President Richard Davis McAuley, 
compliance officer Ronald R. Daerr and plant manager Mark James Vigeant. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police investigator Jim Peterson, the three men were responsible 
for dumping about 200,000 gallons of tainted rainwater last January into a 
drain on property adjacent to the company's East 29th Street facility. The 
water flowed onto a city street, into a storm drain and ultimately into Marine 
Stadium and Alamitos Bay, Peterson said. The water contained benzene and 
dichloromethane, which have been identified as carcinogens. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're baffled by all of this," said McAuley. "We had received a storm-water 
discharge permit. We tested the water and it was clean." The officials each 
posted $25,000 bail after they were arrested Friday. They are scheduled to be 
arraigned Jan. 28 in Long Beach Municipal Court. The allegations involve 
violations of the California Water Code, Health and Safety Code, Fish and Game 
Code, and municipal codes.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CERRITOS; FINANCIAL FIGURES FOR PERFORMING ARTS CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts finished its first year as the 
nation's third top grossing theater with 3,000 seats or less, according to 
figures compiled by an industry publication.  
</P>
<P>
 The Cerritos theater, which featured such celebrities as Frank Sinatra, 
Whitney Houston and Kenny Rogers last year, grossed $5.4 million for 140 
performances.Attendance was 207,840, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Westbury Music Fair in New York was in first place, grossing nearly $9.5 
million for 188 shows that drew 415,533 people. Valley Forge Music Fair in 
Pennsylvania was second, with a $6.6-million gross for 145 shows and an 
attendance of 329,468. 
</P>
<P>
 The rankings were published in the Dec. 31 issue of Performance, a weekly 
magazine for the arts industry. The only other venue in California to make the 
top 10 list in this category was the Pantages Theater in Los Angeles, which 
ranked fifth. The theater's 46 shows brought in $3.6 million and drew 75,215 
people.

COMMUNITY NEWS: THE REGION; 2 SCHOOLS NOMINATED FOR NATIONAL AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two local elementary schools have been nominated by the California State 
Department of Education for a national award given to outstanding schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Kettering Elementary in Long Beach and Gardenhill Elementary in La Mirada are 
among six elementary schools in Los Angeles County and 40 statewide to be 
chosen last month as candidates for the Blue Ribbon Schools Award, sponsored by 
the U.S. Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 The two schools became eligible for the award by earning state honors as 
California Distinguished Schools. Schools are judged for the Blue Ribbon award 
on a number of criteria, including strong curriculum, test scores, parent 
participation and other awards the schools have won. Particular emphasis was 
placed on math and science programs, said Pat McCabe, a spokesman for the 
California Department of Education.

COMMUNITY NEWS: COMPTON; MEMORIAL VIGIL PLANNED TO HONOR 2 SLAIN OFFICERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A candlelight march and vigil has been planned to mark the anniversary of the 
slaying of two Compton police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Organized by Police Department officials, the march is scheduled for Feb. 22 
in memory of officers Kevin Michael Burrell and James Wayne MacDonald, who were 
shot on that date last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Burrell, 29, and MacDonald, 22, are the only Compton officers in the city's 
history to be slain on duty. Each man was shot in the head shortly before 
midnight, following a routine traffic stop. A San Pedro man, Regis Thomas, was 
arrested in connection with the killings and remains in custody, awaiting trial 
for murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers plan to begin the vigil about sundown at the police station on 
Willowbrook Avenue, Police Chief Hourie Taylor said. Marchers will pass by the 
home of Burrell's parents, then continue to the intersection of Rosecrans and 
Dwight avenues, where the two men were gunned down.

MELODRAMA HITS RIGHT NOTE WITH ITS VERSION OF 'HAMLET'; MOORPARK TROUPE'S 
MUSICAL VERSION STICKS FAIRLY CLOSE TO SHAKESPEARE'S -- BUT DOES TAKE SOME 
AMUSING LIBERTIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TODD EVERETT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Something may be rotten in the state of Denmark, but everything's OK in 
Moorpark, where the Magnificent Moorpark Melodrama & Vaudeville Co. is 
presenting its production of something called "Hamlet . . . the Musical?" 
</P>
<P>
 You don't need to be a Shakespeare scholar to appreciate this "Hamlet," 
although those familiar with the play -- maybe through Mel Gibson's recent film 
version -- might appreciate some of the (if this is the word) nuances. 
</P>
<P>
 Nuances are few, though, in a play that turns two of Shakespeare's minor male 
characters into a pair of coquettish mall rats named Rosie Krantz and Gilda 
Stern ("This is a happenin' castle ya got heah"), and Horatio into a 
heavy-metal head who makes his entrance playing air guitar and singing the main 
riff to Deep Purple's "Smoke on the Water." 
</P>
<P>
 Monk Ferris' script sticks fairly close to Shakespeare's, touching most of the 
high plot points and well-known soliloquies, and even increasing the number of 
deaths in the last scene. The Melodrama production's director and 
choreographer, Joy Enright, has added a couple of contemporary references 
("Saturday Night Live" jokes, mainly) and the show opens with the chorus 
singing Cole Porter's "Brush Up Your Shakespeare." 
</P>
<P>
 While much of the acting here won't worry the nearby California Shakespeare 
Company, most is adequate to the production and some is surprisingly good -- 
Will Shupe II, who plays Hamlet, has evidently never before acted Shakespeare 
but could, and Jonathan Graff, who plays the evil Claudius, has a fairly 
extensive background in The Real Thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Other particularly notable performances are Kristin Prewitt and Erin Appling 
as Rosie and Gilda, Elaine Raleigh as Gertrude's mother, Abigail Jones as 
Ophelia, and Mark Tortorici and James Harlow in various roles. 
</P>
<P>
 The songs are serviceable, if not exactly memorable, and the cast handles 
Enright's choreography with enthusiasm. Cheryl Talbot is musical director and 
pianist. 
</P>
<P>
 So, if the lack of singing and dancing has kept you away from Shakespeare's 
"Hamlet," the Moorpark Melodrama's may be the alternative you've been looking 
for. Details

</P>

THEATER REVIEW; 'COME BLOW YOUR HORN' IS STRAIGHT-AHEAD FUNNY; THE EARLY '60S 
ETHNIC STEREOTYPING AND SEXUAL PRANKSTERISM ARE OUTMODED, BUT SOME ELEMENTS 
FORESHADOW LATER SIMON WORKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Neil Simon's first full-length stage comedy, "Come Blow Your Horn," is also 
one of his straight-ahead funniest -- there's no soggy pathos slowing things 
down here. It's also instructive, blueprinting themes that he'd follow from 
then on and even previewing a couple of popular characters from his most 
popular show. The current production of Dinner Theatre at Ottavio's in 
Camarillo is giving audiences a couple of hours of solid laughter -- and a meal 
-- for their $25. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Baker, 32, is a swinging bachelor-about-town (New York City, of course) 
in the swinging, pre-Beatles '60s. As the play opens, he's trying to juggle 
dates and business as his younger brother, Buddy, knocks at the door. Fed up 
with the pressures of living at home, Buddy wants to move in with Alan. 
</P>
<P>
 Buddy, unlike smooth and handsome Alan, is nebbishy, shy, bespectacled and 
aspires to be a writer -- he's not the last of Simon's surrogate characters in 
his own plays. But Alan's always been Buddy's mentor and now takes his brother 
in, offering him the phone number of a spare girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Buddy is nervous about this new step into life, but excited at the prospect. 
All is going well until the men's parents show up, one at a time. High jinks -- 
and much frustration -- ensue. 
</P>
<P>
 At the very least, "Come Blow Your Horn" demonstrates why you should never 
give your parents your home address. 
</P>
<P>
 In this brightly paced production, director Paul Marquie doesn't shrink from 
exaggerating ethnic stereotypes, which may cause a bit of discomfort in some 
quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 That noted, Gary Romm and Arlene Weisenberg are very funny as Buddy and his 
mother, with Wayne Collier only a bit more subtle as the Baker boys' father. On 
the other hand, George Reese is so WASPish as Alan Baker that you might wonder 
if he was adopted. Alan is also the only member of the family without some hint 
of a New York accent. (The 1962 movie version was very strangely cast, with 
Frank Sinatra as the 30ish Alan and Tony Bill as Buddy). 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Weaver and Natalie Holcomb are featured as two of the women in Alan's 
life: Weaver as the sweet, ditzy and accommodating Peggy Evans (who can't tell 
the difference between Vermont and New Hampshire), and Holcomb as the more 
sensible one whom Alan respects -- but not enough to marry. Laura Tennenhouse 
appears briefly in a surprise role. 
</P>
<P>
 By '90s standards, Alan is something of a sleaze, procuring prostitutes for a 
potential business client and promising Peggy an audition with a movie producer 
as an excuse to whisk her away to a weekend tryst at a skiing lodge. It was, 
indeed, another era. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon fans should listen carefully for mentions (though not appearances) of 
Peggy's acting teacher, one Felix Unger, and of a character whose name at one 
point is more than a little reminiscent of "Oscar Madison." Both names, of 
course, would appear as different characters in Simon's "The Odd Couple."

WORDS & IMAGES: FINDING MARKETS FOR SHORT STORIES, POEMS; WRITERS GROUPS 
PROVIDE SOURCES OF INFORMATION FOR THOSE SERIOUS ABOUT GETTING PUBLISHED.

 Too often, cynical old-timers tell short story writers and poets that there 
are no markets for their work. A study of books, magazines and the many 
newsletters provided by writers organizations that publish marketing 
information puts the lie to such negative posturing. The monetary rewards may 
be thin, but there are ways for serious writers, or writers serious about 
getting published to place their poems and short stories. Heed this call for 
submissions from two local magazines and go in search of others. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai-based Little Horse Press is seeking poetry on any topic for the 1994 
edition of its annual publication Rivertalk. They will accept up to five poems 
and are also soliciting black and white photographs for cover and inside art. 
The deadline is Feb. 15. Call 646-7801 for details. 
</P>
<P>
 Verve Magazine is planning its spring 1994 issue and encourages submissions of 
poetry and short fiction up to 1,000 words on the theme Metamorphosis. 
Manuscripts must be postmarked prior to March 1. Send a SASE for detailed 
guidelines to editor Ron Reicheck, Verve, P.O. Box 3205, Simi Valley, 93093.

 Debra Frasier, the illustrator of "On the Day You Were Born" and "The Animal 
Who Drank Up Sound" will autograph her new book "We Got Here Together" from 3 
to 5 p.m. Saturday at Adventures for Kids, 3457 Telegraph Road, Ventura. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Gold Coast Fiction Writers' first meeting in the new year will focus on 
critiquing manuscripts. The group will gather Tuesday for discussion and dinner 
at 6 p.m. and the program will begin at 7:30 p.m. in Carrows Restaurant, 
Seaward Avenue and Harbor Boulevard, Ventura. Guests are welcome. The 
non-member fee is $4. Call 498-0968 or 683-6340.

 Publishing can be a Byzantine maze. Who gets published and which books sell is 
often unpredictable. But writers should know how the publishing business works 
before they even begin to work on a manuscript. Joan Prestine, the author of 19 
books, now under contract to a major publisher for a new series of books, will 
conduct seminars on getting published and self-publishing on Jan. 29 for 
Ventura College Community Services, 4667 Telegraph Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Book Publishing Options scheduled from 9 a.m. to noon will focus on topics 
that sell, book proposals, packaging and how to choose a publisher. The How to 
Self-Publish workshop follows from 1 to 4 p.m. and deals with creating a book 
from manuscript, editing, illustrating, printing to promotion and distribution. 
The seminars are $35 each. To register by phone, call 654-6459.

ENTERTAINMENT; IT'S 'ROMANCE/ROMANCE' IN LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 New York swooned over "Romance/Romance" in 1988, when the musical leaped from 
the tiny off-off-Broadway Actor's Outlet to Broadway's Helen Hayes Theatre. 
Bums, as the Brits say, filled seats, and Tony nominations weren't far behind. 
</P>
<P>
 So, why has it taken five years for the show, which opened last week at Long 
Beach's International City Theatre, to reach the Los Angeles area? 
</P>
<P>
 Author-lyricist Barry Harman thinks it was because of the demands of the 
leading role, originally filled by Scott ("Quantum Leap") Bakula. "There aren't 
a lot of Scott Bakulas out there," Harman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Composer Keith Herrmann thinks it was because of the negative -- no, damning 
-- reviews "R/R" received when it first reached the West Coast at San Diego's 
Old Globe Theatre in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Herrmann, talking by telephone from his Morristown, N.J., office, speculated 
that Los Angeles producers were deterred at that point from proceeding with 
another production. "Whatever the case," he says, "it didn't happen." 
</P>
<P>
 It is an oddity. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider that the musical was nominated for five Tonys, including best 
musical, best book, best score and best lead actor (Bakula) and actress (Alison 
Fraser). Consider next that the august competition included Andrew Lloyd 
Webber's "Phantom of the Opera," Stephen Sondheim's "Into the Woods" and 
Mbongeni Ngema's and Hugh Masekela's "Sarafina!" Then consider that all the 
others enjoyed modest to epic Los Angeles-area runs. 
</P>
<P>
 One can understand the astonishment of International City Theatre's resident 
director caryn morse when she discovered that "Romance/Romance" had never been 
staged here. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting next to Harman in the living room of the Los Angeles hillside home of 
Harman's relatives, morse recalled that when she and the theater's artistic 
director, Shashin Desai, were assembling the upcoming season schedule in 
October, "It didn't take long to decide on this title. We said, 'Let's do it!' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 The show's attraction on paper, at least, is obvious. Harman splits the piece 
into two distinct but referential halves: the first, "The Little Comedy," based 
on the Arthur Schnitzler fin de siecle Viennese story of the same title; the 
second, "Summer Share," freely adapted to the '80s from "Pain de Menage" by 
Parisian boulevard theater playwright Jules Renard 
</P>
<P>
 The lovers in "Little Comedy" are idle rich deceivers of the first rank, 
posing as poverty-stricken for the other's amusement. "Summer Share" imagines 
what happens when two married couples live in a Hamptons summer house and the 
temptation for cheating becomes nearly overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Romance/Romance" at International City Theatre, Long Beach City College, 
Clark and Harvey Way, Long Beach. Through Feb. 20. Plays Friday and Saturday, 8 
p.m.; Sunday, 2 and 7 p.m.. $16. (310) 420-4128, (310) 420-4051, (714)

 LYNWOOD CONNECTION 
</P>
<P>
 There's a Lynwood High connection on the Harbor College women's basketball 
team, which is ranked No. 3 in the state by the JC Athletic Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lady Seahawks have three former Knight players on their roster, including 
starting sophomore guards LaTasha Burnett and JoAnne Williams, who are among 
the leading scorers in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Going into last week's play, the 5-foot-5 Burnett was first in the state in 
scoring with a 26.1-point average. The 5-6 Williams was seventh at 20.6. 
Burnett was sixth in rebounds (12.5) and fifth in assists (7.2). 
</P>
<P>
 Williams should move up on the list after scoring 102 points in three games, 
including a career-high 42 in her team's 90-74 win over Long Beach. Williams 
improved her scoring average to 22.4 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The other Lynwood player on the Harbor roster is freshman Teresa Wiseman, a 
6-2 center. The Seahawks also have another area player on the team in sophomore 
Kim Fraser, a 5-6 guard, who played at Compton High. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most important Southeast connection is Coach Louie Nelson, a prep 
standout at Compton before continuing his playing career at Washington and in 
the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach State women's basketball team has added former Lynwood standout 
Ja'net Davis to its roster. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, regarded as one of the top prep players in Southern California as a 
senior, was Southern Section Division I player of the year as a junior at 
Inglewood Morningside High and was a first team All-Division I selection as a 
senior at Lynwood. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-4 sophomore took the long road to Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 She originally planned to attend Kansas but was ineligible to play for the 
Jayhawks because of the NCAA's Proposition 48 academic restrictions. She 
decided to attend Kilgore Junior College in Texas for a semester. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis transferred to Long Beach State last January and became eligible to play 
in December. 
</P>
<P>
 But Davis is off to a slow start, averaging only 4.8 points and 2.9 rebounds 
in sporadic playing time. NEW BEGINNINGS 
</P>
<P>
 Nine players from the Cerritos College football team have signed national 
letters of intent to play at NCAA Division I-A or I-AA programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Topping the list are cornerback Mario Bradley, who has signed with USC, and 
offensive tackle Matt Hicks and center Eugene Seminavage, who have signed with 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Other signings include: wide receiver Craig Allen with Purdue; quarterback 
Larry Haney with Northeast Louisiana; middle linebacker Mark Medlin with Texas 
El Paso; outside linebacker Aaron Plante with Nevada; offensive guard Alex 
Toyos with Boise State and wide receiver Bobby Richardson with East Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 Haney completed 153 of 263 passes for 1,813 yards and 14 touchdowns and his 
top receiver was Allen with 28 catches for 500 yards and seven TDs. His passing 
total was second highest in school history. 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons, who had one of their best seasons in years at 7-3-1, finished 
with a 35-24 loss to Riverside in the Orange County Bowl at Orange Coast 
College in December. BACK HOME 
</P>
<P>
 After its most lopsided Big West Conference loss of the season, the Long Beach 
State men's basketball team will return home for a conference game against UC 
Santa Barbara at 7:30 p.m. Saturday at the Gold Mine Gym. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers (8-4, 3-2 in conference play) will try to rebound from a 92-69 loss 
Monday to Pacific. Santa Barbara is 6-8 and 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach has been led recently by junior center and forward Terrance 
O'Kelley, who scored a career-high 25 points against Pacific. Two other top 
players for the 49ers are forward Jeff Atkinson and freshman swingman James 
Cotton, a former St. John Bosco standout who has stepped into the team's 
starting lineup. RIDING A TITLE WAVE 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA champion Long Beach State women's volleyball team will be honored 
with a rally next to the University Bookstore at 12:30 p.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers won the title last month by defeating Penn State, 15-13, 12-15, 
15-11, 16-14, at Madison, Wis. The 49ers also won the title in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach was led by senior Danielle Scott, who was named national player of 
the year, and All-American first-team selection Nichelle Burton. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Wednesday's ceremony, the team will be honored at the Long 
Beach-Memphis State men's basketball game Feb. 21 at the Anaheim Arena. BRIEFLY 
</P>
<P>
 Registration is under way for the 13th annual Long Beach Marathon on Feb. 6, 
which will start in front of Long Beach Convention Center Plaza and follow the 
city's shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be seven events, starting with race-walking at 7:30 a.m. The 
marathon starts at 8. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost is $30 for the marathon, $20 for the half-marathon, $125 for the 
five-person relay and $15 for the health walk. Entries should be postmarked by 
Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Prize money will be awarded to the top finishers in the men's, women's and 
wheelchair marathon divisions. Information: Bob Fernald at (310) 494-7089. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach State baseball team, coming off one of the best seasons in 
history, has been ranked in the top 25 in two preseason polls. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers, who finished 46-19 last season, are ranked No. 14 by Collegiate 
Baseball magazine and No. 21 by Baseball America. Long Beach won the Big West 
Conference last season and was third at the College World Series in Omaha, Neb.

REWIND; 'WE'RE NO ANGELS' IS AN ENDURING FILM FOR ALL SEASONS; DESPITE ITS YULE 
SETTING, THE HUMPHREY BOGART-PETER USTINOV MOVIE IS ENJOYABLE THE YEAR AROUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Christmas lights are back in storage, the New Year's diet is well under 
way and you swear your umpteenth viewing of "It's a Wonderful Life" is your 
last. But one Christmas-oriented film you may have overlooked -- "We're No 
Angels" -- is fun any time of year. 
</P>
<P>
 A light comedy set on Devil's Island in 1895, it stars Humphrey Bogart as a 
forger/embezzler, Aldo Ray as a slow-witted murderer, and Peter Ustinov as a 
safecracker with a penchant for manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Bogart is said to have always had a special affection for this film, and it's 
easy to see why. 
</P>
<P>
 A trio of prison escapees (Bogart, Ray and Ustinov), seeking to shed their 
prison garb, are drawn into a clothing shop, where they pose as parolee 
carpenters who volunteer to fix the shopkeeper's leaky roof. 
</P>
<P>
 Their plan: to rob the shop in order to pay for passage back to France on the 
steamship anchored in the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the process of hanging around the store and its adjoining home, they 
get to know the inept shopkeeper (Leo G. Carroll) and his family -- wife (Joan 
Bennett) and 18-year-old daughter (Gloria Talbott) -- all too well and have a 
change of heart. 
</P>
<P>
 The shopkeeper is drowning in a sea of red ink, and to make matters worse, the 
recently arrived ship in the harbor has brought with it his tyrannical cousin 
Andre (Basil Rathbone), who plans to spend Christmas going over the books. 
</P>
<P>
 The three cons so ingratiate themselves with the family -- serving as 
unconventional guardian angels -- that they are invited to stay for Christmas 
dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Bogart has no problem rounding up items for the dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 "You guys get everything ready -- I'll go buy a turkey," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Ustinov: "Did you say buy? " 
</P>
<P>
 Bogart: "Well, in honor of the season. It may take a little while. First I 
have to steal the money." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're No Angels," of course, has a happy ending, with Ray's deadly "pet" 
viper playing a pivotal role in the proceedings. DENNIS McLELLAN

REEL LIFE / FILM & VIDEO FILE; CAMARILLO: THE CINEMATIC CAPITAL OF VENTURA 
COUNTY; CITY COUNCIL OKS 11-SCREEN THEATER COMPLEX, WHICH WILL JOIN TWO ALREADY 
APPROVED PROJECTS. BUT ARE LOCAL RESIDENTS SUCH CINEPHILES? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Camarillo is poised to become the cinematic center of Ventura County after the 
City Council approved a 2,629-seat movie theater complex last week. The 
decision comes after two other mega-movie houses won earlier approval. 
</P>
<P>
 United Artists, the most recent winner in the Camarillo theater derby, plans 
to build an 11-screen movie house on the city's east side. Mann Theaters and 
Edwards Theaters both got the approval to build 12-screen theaters in the past 
10 months. 
</P>
<P>
 If construction of all three proceeds, Camarillo would have far and away the 
highest proportion of theater space in the county -- one seat for every six 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Are Camarillo residents such cinephiles? 
</P>
<P>
 Probably not. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure the marketing studies that prompted these three to locate here 
anticipated that they would draw from all over Ventura County," Camarillo City 
Manager Bill Little said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Little, construction now depends on financing and, as far as he 
knows, at least two of the companies have the money to break ground.

 This is koala week in Ventura County as two screens feature films made Down 
Under. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ojai Film Society is showing "The Last Days of Chez Nous," an Australian 
film directed by Gillian Armstrong ("My Brilliant Career"), about a successful 
writer whose family life has begun to crumble around her. 
</P>
<P>
 The story is set in a sprawling house in Sydney, where the writer, Beth, lives 
with her husband, her teen-age daughter and a young male boarder. 
</P>
<P>
 When Beth's high-spirited sister, Vicki, played by Kerry Fox ("An Angel at My 
Table"), who has been living abroad, arrives for a visit after the breakup of a 
tempestuous love affair, the tensions and passions that have been brewing 
within the family are finally unleashed. 
</P>
<P>
 The film screens at 4:30 p.m. Sunday at the Ojai Playhouse, 145 E. Ojai Ave. 
Admission is $6. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To continue this week's Australian theme, here is the second installment in 
the Down Under weekend. The adventure film series at the Oxnard Civic 
Auditorium is featuring "Amazing Australia." 
</P>
<P>
 Billed as a "look at the rugged character of the Aussie people," the picture 
by documentarian Grant Foster visits the Sydney harbor and other notable spots. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie will be shown at 2:30 p.m. Sunday. The auditorium is at 800 Hobson 
Way. Admission is $6.50. 
</P>

EDUCATION:; UNION ASKS ALTERNATIVES TO LAYOFFS BE EXAMINED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 District employees abhor that shots were fired at the school board meeting on 
the evening of Dec. 14. It was a despicable act that worked against the best 
interests of the children, staff and community of the Compton Unified School 
District. And the shots undermined the efforts of employee associations and 
other organizations to peacefully address our very serious concerns to the 
school system's state-appointed administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 Even a cursory look at the latest proposal to lay off 111 employees shows it 
to be ill-conceived and far from the mark. These employees, known as the 
classified staff, include custodians, teacher aides, bus drivers, clerks and 
cafeteria workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Classified staff -- both in and out of the classroom -- have been hit hard by 
two previous layoffs. A significant number of instructional aides have been cut 
from the classrooms. Large numbers of employees have had their work year 
reduced. And the construction and repair department has been severely slashed. 
</P>
<P>
 Further cuts of the magnitude proposed will cripple the district's ability to 
function on a day-to-day basis and that will directly harm children's 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, because classified employees, by and large, reside in or near 
Compton, these layoffs will have a devastating effect on the community, 
including the families of many local students. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of dollars have been spent on high-priced 
consultants and outside audits. None of this would be so bad except that these 
consultants and auditors have not done what they're being paid to do. And that 
is to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to reconstruct the Compton 
school district. 
</P>
<P>
 While these consultants propose layoffs, they are unable to show how these 
layoffs will bring about financial solvency, or say when the cuts will end. 
</P>
<P>
 The consultants also want employees to absorb a walloping 8-10% pay cut in 
February or March. Again, when asked how employees making $14,000 to $25,000 
per year are going to absorb an 8-10% income loss, no one has an answer. With 
layoffs and/or pay cuts looming, the wonder is that the spirit and dedication 
of the employees hasn't collapsed entirely. Amazingly, most workers are 
completely dedicated to the well-being of Compton's children. 
</P>
<P>
 The California School Employees Assn., which represents most of the district's 
classified employees, has already suggested some alternatives that accomplish 
many of the same financial objectives that the district's consultants have 
outlined. The alternatives include ideas like furlough days, which have been 
successful in many other districts. These alternatives are far less onerous to 
employees than layoffs and pay cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Compton Mayor Omar Bradley has offered financial assistance to 
the school district. This proposal should be fully explored. The district also 
needs to do more to cut expenses in key areas, such as legal expenses, which 
consumed $828,000 last year, and vandalism, which cost $2.16 million. Employees 
are still waiting for a real chance to work with district administrators on 
plans to cut costs.  
</P>
<P>
 The association and district employees hope that the recently selected new 
state administrator, Dr. Jerome Harris, will find answers to these very 
difficult questions. We pledge to work with Dr. Harris to find those answers. 
We recognize that nothing less than the educational, social and economic health 
of Compton's children are at risk.

EARTHWATCH: DRIVING BECOMES A NATURAL GAS; AVAILABILITY OF THE CLEANER, CHEAPER 
FUEL GROWS. REBATES AND TAX BREAKS MAKE CONVERTING VEHICLES AFFORDABLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD KAHLENBERG, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Operated by Southern California Gas Co., Ventura County's first and only 
stationselling low-pollution, low-cost compressed natural gas as fuel for cars 
and trucks is now open 24 hours a day in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the official ribbon-cutting is scheduled for next month, Edna Ray is 
already a customer. Executive director of the county's office of the American 
Lung Assn., Ray fills up her Dodge van, which has been converted to burn 
natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray's organization bought the van in November. She had been particularly eager 
to begin doing her bit to fight local smog by using natural gas, which causes 
less than half the smog of gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to practice what we preach," she told her staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray and her staff became customers at the gas company's new station at Patton 
Court the minute it became operative this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Interviewed last week during a swing by the site, Ray said, "If I'm in the 
area I always gas up. It's cheaper and very easy to put in." Indeed, aside from 
costing her about 60 cents a gallon, gas fuel doesn't spill or smell up hands 
like gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
 And Ray gets the same mileage as with gasoline: 28 miles per gallon. The van 
is equipped with a switch that allows her to use either natural gas or regular 
unleaded gasoline. She had been told to expect some sluggishness when driving 
on natural gas, "but there's no difference," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The distinction in price, by the way, is because the California Public 
Utilities Commission mandated that whatever the oil companies' wholesale price 
of gasoline is on any day of the year, the gas company's wholesale price for an 
equivalent amount of natural gas must be 26 cents less. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray is anticipating another boon as a result of having switched to cleaner 
fuel. Not only does it not fill the air with gunk, it doesn't coat the innards 
of her engine with deposits, either. She's been told the van might run nearly 
500,000 miles before it needs overhauling or replacement. 
</P>
<P>
 Until this month, an ordinary motorist couldn't just walk into an American car 
dealership in the county and order a car, light truck or van equipped to use 
compressed natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
 Some foreign manufacturers expect to begin a program of ready availability in 
the U. S. by the end of this year, but Detroit's Big Three have jumped out 
ahead of the pack for once. Starting this month, you can call a local Ford, GM 
or Chrysler dealership and say you want the latest models -- such as Caprice, 
Corsica, Ram, Voyager and Taurus -- with a factory-installed natural gas 
option. 
</P>
<P>
 In case you're worried that they're going to soak you for being 
environmentally friendly, be aware that you're entitled by law to a package of 
rebates and tax breaks that can leave you paying almost nothing extra for 
switching to natural gas. Ask the dealer about reducing what would otherwise be 
about $4,000 in extra charges to nearly zip. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the gas company station Ray uses, other facilities will be 
popping up in our county and nearby for those who want to drive throughout the 
state without polluting it. This month, MacValley Oil Co. in Oxnard will open a 
natural gas station. MacValley is affiliated with Fleet Star Inc., a Texas firm 
that plans to open natural gas stations in Taft, Fresno, Bakersfield and 
Stockton this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The gas company publishes a map showing all the natural gas stations between 
San Diego and Sacramento. Until recently they were only every 50 miles or so. 
In 1994, many intervening stations are being built. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: For information on the new, low-pollution, low-cost natural gas 
stations in Ventura County, call Marcia Secord at Southern California Gas Co., 
385-4802, or Mark Matye at MacValley Oil Co., 485-6900. 
</P>
<P>
 * COST: To compare prices and availability of popular models of American-made 
cars, vans or trucks equipped to use this fuel, you can, as of this month, call 
an authorized dealer in the county. The following dealers are particularly 
knowledgeable about natural gas models: Kevin Todey Chevrolet, William L. 
Morris Chevrolet, Crown Dodge, Westoaks Plymouth, Harbor Plymouth or Bob Beaty 
Ford. Be sure to ask about the rebates and tax breaks that can make these 
environmentally friendly vehicles cost no more than an ordinary gasoline-using 
model.

FOR THE KIDS; HOW BIG, HOW LONG, HOW TALL: YOU MAKE THE CALL; THE SANTA BARBARA 
ZOO INVITES VISITORS TO GET UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL WITH THE ANIMALS BY GUESSING 
THEIR WEIGHTS.

 The Santa Barbara Zoo will have a contest for visitors Saturday that puts new 
meaning into the term wild guess.  
</P>
<P>
 Zoo-goers can try their luck at guessing the length of the Burmese python, or 
they can estimate the weight of an Asian elephant. Or they can eyeball the 
Baringo giraffe and calculate its height. 
</P>
<P>
 The contest, called "How Big . . . How Long . . . How Tall," isn't limited 
just to kids. It's not that easy. (Here's a clue about the hefty snake: It 
weighs 200 pounds and takes eight handlers to maneuver.) 
</P>
<P>
 The zoo staff will be doing the weighing and measuring from 2 to 3 p.m., with 
the numbers announced after that. It should be quite a sight. The California 
Highway Patrol offered its truck scales for the elephant weigh-in, and the 
humongous animals have been trained during the past month to stand on the 
scales, according to Craig Issod, the zoo's marketing and public relations 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea behind the contest (there will be prizes for the winners) is to give 
kids some information about the animals in a fun way. The zoo will also have 
some other amazing animal facts on display for the event. And an added bonus on 
the contest day: One child will be admitted free with each paying adult. 
</P>
<P>
 If you haven't been to the zoo in the last year, you'll be pleased with some 
of the changes. First of all, the whole entrance is new. As you come in, you 
cross a bridge over Swan Lake, which is now home to the majestic black-necked 
swans. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll find a new patio area here with tables and chairs, and a new restaurant 
called the Ridley Tree House, which has indoor seating and a greater selection 
of food than the old snack bar. The zoo has also added a new gift shop in this 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 On the animal front, the zoo has added a pair of golden lion tamarins, and 
beautiful gold-colored monkeys that come from the Brazilian rain forest, where 
their numbers have diminished to only 450. Among the new animals born at the 
zoo are two two-toed sloths and a male anteater. 
</P>
<P>
 The playground at the top of the hill has been overhauled. Most impressive is 
the renovated sea lion pool, which now has a huge underwater viewing window. 
It's even equipped with some stairs for a slightly handicapped sea lion. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 You know the story about Goldilocks and the Three Bears? Well, you haven't 
heard the whole story. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundred Hats Youth Theater in Santa Paula has put a new, witty spin on the old 
tale in its latest effort, "The Trial of Goldi Locks," which opens Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The original production, written by director Terry Brenner-Farrell, explores 
what happened to Goldi after she returns home from her run-in with the three 
bears. In this version, poor Goldi goes on trial for breaking and entering, 
trespassing and vandalism, as she learns she must pay the consequences for her 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 The cast for the production are kids, 10 to 14 years old. The youth theater is 
part of the Santa Paula Theater Center, 125 S. 7th St., where the play will run 
weekends through Jan. 30. Friday performances are at 7:30 p.m., Saturdays at 11 
a.m. and 2:30 p.m., and Sundays at 2:30 p.m. Tickets are $4, $3.50 for children 
12 and younger. For information, call 525-4645. 
</P>

 Puppeteer Jim Gamble is bringing his circus to town. Gamble and his small, 
two-foot-tall circus will be performing at the Conejo Valley Adult School, 1025 
Old Farm Road, Thousand Oaks, on Friday. Performance times are 10 and 11:30 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a quick-paced marionette show that includes a colorful entourage of 
clowns and animals -- even a fierce man-eating lion. Tickets are $5 in advance, 
or $6 at the door. For information, call 493-4348. 
</P>

 Sunday is a free day at the Carnegie Art Museum in Oxnard. The museum, 424 S. 
C St., designates one Sunday each month especially for families. (Also, the 
gallery attendant on Sunday speaks Spanish.) The next free day is Feb. 27.

FASHION; YOUTH SCOUR THRIFT STORES IN SEARCH OF THE RIGHT LOOK; MANY AVOID 
LABELS SUCH AS 'GRUNGE.' ESPECIALLY POPULAR ARE UNIFORM SHIRTS WITH OLD COMPANY 
LOGOS AND NAME LABELS.

 Among the racks of faded jeans and rhinestone gowns at The Thrift Factory on 
Ventura's Main Street, teen-agers move intently. Hangers squeak on metal as the 
teens check through the motley hoard, searching for the right look . They 
pause, glance and move on, set on what they want and not ready to compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 As fashion analysts, we tried to figure out, in the space of a week, what the 
look is, and why the kids want it. We met nearly 20 young people who buy 
offbeat clothing, and asked those questions. They spoke more of the quest than 
the goal. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, they didn't like having the look named. It was them , they said -- 
their personal expression, that's all -- it's what they're comfortable with. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not what fashion analysts are comfortable with. We like to generalize 
and offer conclusions, so that we appear to have a handle on things. It's what 
we do. 
</P>
<P>
 So, sometimes we offered them phrases, like dressing down , and '70s , and 
grunge . 
</P>
<P>
 Instantly, everyone distanced him-or herself from the declasse' grunge look. 
Purists, they explained the term is specific to plaid flannel shirts and Doc 
Martens boots; or T-shirts, Converse shoes, white socks and shaved necks. 
</P>
<P>
 These anti-fashion seekers had something different in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "At Moorpark (College), everyone wears, like, Mervyn's clothes," said Tony 
Ross, 18, of Simi Valley, who would stand out in such a crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "All my friends wear preppy stuff. They say I dress like a clown," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As he spoke, Ross wore a Yankees ball cap, a '50s button-down plaid shirt over 
a large frayed sweat shirt, even larger nondescript trousers and ancient Puma 
sneakers. (Neatly trimmed hair, no jewelry, no tattoos.) 
</P>
<P>
 In high school, he wore his hair long and white, but he's growing it out to 
its natural black. 
</P>
<P>
 An art major with a 3.3 grade point average, Ross is steadfast in dressing 
down. He makes an exception only to attend weddings -- when he wears a 
"respectable" three-piece '70s polyester suit. 
</P>
<P>
 He makes regular thrift-shop rounds to get the look he wants, and especially 
prizes used uniform shirts with the owner's name patch still attached. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a plethora of shirts like that," he said. "My favorite is my 'Calvin' 
one from American Airlines." 
</P>
<P>
 Also into uniform collecting is Missy Gibbs, 15, of Ventura. We met her 
recently wearing a huge Wonder Bread jacket with a "Bob" patch on the chest, a 
fitted white thermal shirt, and extra-large frayed jeans. 
</P>
<P>
 Like all of the teens we met, she had a freshly laundered look, little makeup, 
no body piercing. Her only jewelry was an Elvis button. She wears the shirts, 
not as a statement -- she just likes them. 
</P>
<P>
 "My friend Scott is supposed to get me a Roto Rooter shirt," she said happily. 
"His folks own it." 
</P>
<P>
 Names seem to be especially prized; not slogans, real names. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's those old T-shirts that say weird things; old companies that you never 
heard of, like Bennie's Bait Shop," said Andrea Kerr of Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosie Jones, 16, of Ventura, wore a T-shirt with "Rainbow" printed across the 
front. The tie-dye colors she had added muted the remainder of the logo. She 
makes her own beaded earrings and shares clothing with her friends in a 
"communal" process. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris and Roxy Seymour of Ventura, both in multicolored shirts and threadbare 
jeans, pointed out their boots were other than the trendy Doc Martens. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are from the actual Army," said Chris, 14, indicating his footwear. 
</P>
<P>
 His 16-year-old sister, who wore layers of shirts, homemade necklaces, an 
embroidered vest and poems painted on her boots, said it's good to have 
contrasts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like baroque stuff -- and outfits from your grandmother's day, like the 
'20s, with combat boots," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "By society's rules it may not work; but if you can make it work for you, 
everything just flows. Then, it's cool. It's like not having a prejudice on 
yourself -- I'll always be able to care about myself even if the next day I'm a 
different person." 
</P>
<P>
 So, what did they have in common? Well, none of them wanted to be an engineer. 
Several mentioned art majors, film or literature. One, dress designing! 
</P>
<P>
 They seemed to have a certain intensity, strong opinions -- maybe even 
self-determination. 
</P>
<P>
 And, the uniforms . . . . Real clothes with a real past. Good fabrics, one 
said. You can't afford silk or wool except second-hand. Old, loose clothing 
avoids the come-on look of most girls' clothes, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems inconsistent -- when at first it all looked like costumes. But it 
works for us; it flows. Just give it a minute while you think it over. If it 
works for you, then . . . it's cool. 
</P>

COVER STORY: THIEVES OF TIME; THE LOOTING OF CULTURAL ARTIFACTS ANGERS CHUMASH 
DESCENDANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MEYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Retracing the route of her Chumash ancestors, Ernestine DeSoto-McGovran hiked 
to an enchanted forest grotto in Ventura County's hostile wilderness. There, on 
the ceiling of a small sandstone cave, virtually hidden by alder and fir, she 
found an abstract image of a condor, the shamanistic symbol for magical vision 
and flight. 
</P>
<P>
 Painted deep red against a black background, the condor was probably drawn by 
a Chumash holy man before the time of Columbus. For DeSoto-McGovran, its 
presence was a stirring reminder of her long-gone religious past. Visiting the 
cave, she said, "was like being inside the Sistine Chapel." 
</P>
<P>
 DeSoto-McGovran's reverence was accompanied by a sense of relief. At other 
sites in the county, according to archeologists and government officials, 
similar Chumash rock art has been chiseled from the sandstone, smeared with 
graffiti or used as a target during paint-ball practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Desecration of their sacred objects understandably outrages the estimated 
5,000 Chumash descendants living in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, but it 
hardly surprises them. They and many modern historians believe that Chumash 
culture has been ripped off and trashed since the Spanish began colonizing 
California more than 200 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 A gentle stone-age civilization, the Chumash inhabited this area for at least 
11,000 years before being devastated by a harsh mission system and European 
diseases, experts say. In 1782, when the San Buenaventura Mission opened its 
doors, the Chumash population was 20,000; in 1834, when the mission was 
secularized, only 3,000 were left. No full-blooded Chumash survive today. 
</P>
<P>
 Disregard for Chumash culture has continued well into this century: Looters 
have plundered Chumash artifacts, developers have paved over Chumash villages, 
and farmers have bulldozed burial grounds, unearthing bones and skulls that 
souvenir hunters reportedly have taken home. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an insult to us," said DeSoto-McGovran, a 55-year-old Ventura 
resident whose grandmother was a full-blooded Chumash. "Maybe people would 
understand how I feel if I tore through a Civil War cemetery and removed their 
relatives' bones." 
</P>
<P>
 Mad as hell about their stolen past, Native Americans such as the Chumash are 
finally getting some of it back. After years of political prodding by 
activists, Congress in 1990 passed the Native American Graves Protection and 
Repatriation Act, which requires that American museums return to 350 federally 
recognized tribes sacred objects and skeletal remains. They have until the end 
of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's about time the museums realized that what they have is sensitive to us 
and should be back in the ground," said Richard Angulo of the California Indian 
Council. MANY ARTIFACTS IN EUROPE 
</P>
<P>
 The looting of Native American antiquities -- here and in the rest of the 
country -- began in earnest after the Civil War, when Europeans began 
collecting Americana. For the next few decades, museums and wealthy private 
collectors in Europe and the United States devoured Native American artifacts. 
Even today, experts say, the best collections are in European museums. 
</P>
<P>
 The best Chumash collections are in Paris and Moscow, said Charles Johnson, 
associate director of the Ventura County Museum of History and Art. There is 
little doubt that those museums were supplied by the Rev. Stephen Bowers, the 
most notorious looter in county annals who "sold artifacts by the pound" in the 
late 1800s, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1906, Congress made it illegal for anyone without legitimate academic 
credentials to remove artifacts from public land, but looters operating in the 
vast wilderness are hard to catch, especially since budget cuts have crippled 
policing staffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1979 federal Archeological Resources Protection Act was supposed to crack 
down on looters -- threatening $250,000 fines and jail time for convicted 
offenders. But according to authorities, the law's complexity has often 
deterred federal officials from prosecuting. And juries have been reluctant to 
convict people accused of violating the act. 
</P>
<P>
 "Juries can't relate to artifacts as they do to gold and silver," said Jack 
Fitzgerald, National Park Service chief ranger at Channel Islands National 
Park. "Personal beliefs of a jury make it hard to prosecute an archeological 
case." 
</P>
<P>
 And unless the culprit is caught at the scene, making a case isn't always 
easy. "Once you disassociate an artifact from its location, it's very difficult 
to prove exactly where it came from," said National Park Service archeologist 
Don Morris. 
</P>
<P>
 Archeologists have been recording Ventura's Chumash sites since 1909. Besides 
rock paintings, they have found other evidence of an artistic legacy -- 
sandstone milling bowls, woven storage baskets coated with asphaltum, digging 
sticks, whistles and hairpins fashioned from deer and fish bone, abalone beads, 
and projectile points chipped from fused shale and obsidian. 
</P>
<P>
 Although archeologists project that hundreds of sites remain to be found, many 
hundreds already have been recorded. Many are in the Los Padres National 
Forest, on state and national parkland in the Santa Monica Mountains, and on 
the Channel Islands. By law, the recorded sites are secret -- and even exempt 
from the Freedom of Information Act. 
</P>
<P>
 But, like Indiana Jones wanna-bes, looters have tracked down many of these 
secret places. Of the county's 1,300 recorded sites containing Chumash 
artifacts, archeologists estimate that as many as half have been looted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Almost all are certainly damaged," said archeologist Clay Singer. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 30 years ago in the county, clusters of arrowheads still could be found 
lying in fields and alongside hiking trails. In the early 1960s, a Simi Valley 
family reportedly stumbled onto a cache of bows, arrows and spears in a China 
Flat cave and took them home for their private collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Surface finds are rare these days -- the best artifacts are found underground. 
So today's professional looters -- called "thieves of time" by author Tony 
Hillerman -- come armed with picks and shovels and a working knowledge of 
archeology. Excavating known sites or making discoveries on their own, they not 
only rob the Chumash of their past, but they also destroy the archeological 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 While scientists carefully sift through layers of history, looters churn up 
the earth, blending centuries into scrambled sludge. At an undisturbed site, 
carbon deposits can be dated to pinpoint the time frame in which the artifacts 
were used; animal bones and plant remains help explain diet; pollen grains 
provide information about climate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The greatest importance of artifacts is their context and how they relate to 
other artifacts and the landscape," said state archeologist Mike Sampson. "How 
artifacts fit in can tell a more complete story of the culture of the people 
who lived there." 
</P>
<P>
 According to experts, professional looters sell the pillaged artifacts to 
private collectors through a wide-spread black market, while amateurs probably 
keep the stolen artifacts for their mantle. 
</P>
<P>
 "People will raid the town dump for old glass bottles, so it's not surprising 
they're doing illegal excavation looking for artifacts," Morris said. "There's 
a lot of money to be made." SITES UNDER SURVEILLANCE 
</P>
<P>
 A recent issue of Antique Trader magazine lists Native American pottery for 
sale by private collectors at prices ranging from a few hundred dollars to 
several thousand. Woven baskets sell for as much as $1,400. Even arrowhead 
collections can go for $500. Auctioned artifacts are usually higher quality and 
bring higher prices: a prehistoric pot from the Southwest sold recently at a 
New York auction for $90,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Foiling looters has become a high priority on public lands. 
</P>
<P>
 To check sites on the Channel Islands, the park service is doing aerial 
surveillance. Other agencies are considering TV cameras and electronic 
equipment like motion detectors. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Los Padres National Forest, the U.S. Forest Service recently began a 
site-monitoring program called Partners in Preservation. Volunteers -- who have 
to work a minimum of 150 hours a year -- receive 10 hours of classroom 
training, 10 to 20 hours of fieldwork and a confidential map showing the 
location of the secret sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two sites are being monitored in the county. Within a quarter of a mile 
of each other, they are being watched by Betty and Herman Zittel, retired 
forest service employees living in Carpinteria. Once a month, the Zittels put 
on their blue Partners in Preservation T-shirts and spend a few hours in the 
Los Padres, checking the status of pictographs. They hope to get enough 
volunteers so the sites can be visited weekly. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a site has been vandalized with paint, it's important to catch it quickly 
so the stuff can be wiped off before setting," said Herman Zittel, a former 
forester. 
</P>
<P>
 If all else fails, keepers of the rock art can always follow the example of 
Santa Barbara's Painted Cave and install iron bars across the entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rock paintings are very sacred to us," says Ernestine DeSoto-McGovran, who is 
fighting now to keep a developer from building on a Chumash village site in 
Santa Barbara. "In my people's travels through here, these paintings are our 
journals, these stones our tablets conveying what was in our hearts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seeing it is to imagine what it was like to be Chumash."

MUSEUMS PLAN TO RETURN BURIAL RELICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MEYERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even though local Chumash are not recognized as a tribe by the federal 
government, they will probably get their ancestors' remains returned to them 
under provisions of the 1990 Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation 
Act. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as the Chumash file legitimate claims, "We're going to treat them like 
(recognized) groups," says Southwest Museum Executive Director Tom Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Regaining their ancestors' skeletons is a satisfying prospect, say local 
Chumash, but it also creates a problem: Where do they reinter the remains? 
</P>
<P>
 "Who's going to give us the ground to bury them?" asks Richard Angulo of 
Thousand Oaks, chairman of the California Indian Council/Chumash. "We're trying 
to get private landowners to donate land." 
</P>
<P>
 The graves protection act also requires museums to return funerary and burial 
objects. After doing inventories -- hundreds of thousands of objects in some 
cases -- museums had to send summaries of their collections to Native American 
tribes in November. The Southwest Museum, which is considering relocating to 
Ventura, mailed a list of its extensive collection to 660 tribal groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a considerable investment in time and an expensive process," Wilson 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years from now, when tribes pick the artifacts they want returned, museums 
such as the Southwest are expected to lose many important pieces, but "there 
seems to be a lot of room for negotiation," Wilson says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Museum of History and Art doesn't expect much of a dent in 
its notable Chumash collection because it has no human remains nor many burial 
objects, Executive Director Ed Robings says. 
</P>
<P>
 The act also prohibits the sale of religious and funerary objects without 
accompanying documentation proving the objects came from private land. While 
this restriction was intended to deter looting on public lands and to undermine 
the black market, it has had a chilling impact on legitimate antiquities 
dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless there is very, very good documentation, most dealers no longer deal in 
those artifacts because we don't want any trouble," says Ramona Morris, a 
Northern California antiquities dealer and board member of the Antique Tribal 
Art Dealers Assn. JEFF MEYERS

JAUNTS; HIKE REVEALS THE MAGIC OF THE WILD AFTER DARK; EVENING NATURE WALKS IN 
WILDWOOD PARK IN THOUSAND OAKS ARE A FAVORITE WITH FAMILIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 By 6 p.m. darkness has settled in Wildwood Park in Thousand Oaks. Only the 
outline of the trees and canyon rim can be seen against the night sky. But for 
Peter Rice, it's the best time to take a hike. 
</P>
<P>
 Hike in the dark? Why? 
</P>
<P>
 "There's sweet music out here at night," Rice says as he leads another "night 
awareness" hike into the park. Rice, a naturalist for the Conejo Recreation and 
Park District, has been leading the night hikes for about eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 First, it should be made clear, this is not a hike in the dark with 
flashlights. Rice is something of a purist when it comes to the night-time. 
This is a two-mile walk in total darkness -- a lesson in using our night 
vision, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Amazingly, the going is not that tough once the eyes adjust. In fact, the 
hikes are popular with families, because Rice spices them with vivid Chumash 
Indian stories and tales about the constellations. 
</P>
<P>
 From the parking lot, he leads the group down the Moonridge Trail into the 
park. The sound of water in a stream below the trail wafts up from the canyon 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, Rice stops at a horehound bush and lets the group feel and 
smell the fuzzy leaves. The herb is an ancient remedy for sore throats, and he 
lets them sample some modern-day horehound candy. 
</P>
<P>
 He talks about the animals that live in Wildwood Park, once the home of 
Chumash Indians. Occasionally, he halts the procession to listen for animals 
like the coyote, or to imitate the hoot of the owl. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a slew of stories that appeal to kids, like the Native American tale 
about how the fawn got its spots. Stopping under a nearly pitch-black canopy of 
oak trees he relates another myth, this one about some cruel old women who find 
themselves transformed into owls because they refused a starving man some food. 
Strangely, an owl hoots nearby just as he finishes the tale. 
</P>
<P>
 In this totally dark setting, Rice lets hikers turn on flashlights briefly to 
climb down steps and cross a bridge. (The no-light rule isn't absolute; anyone 
who feels uncomfortable can use a flashlight, but darkness is preferred.) 
</P>
<P>
 Rice does the hikes in his spare time. By day, he works as an installer for 
General Telephone Co. 
</P>
<P>
 For children, the highlight of the two-hour trek in Wildwood Park comes near 
the end when Rice takes the stage for what he calls a light show. He pulls a 
bunch of doodads -- balls, rubber insects and snakes -- from his pack that glow 
in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
 He also passes out glow-in-the-dark stars. The procession makes for an eerie 
sight at the end as kids and parents -- their faces glowing with stick-on stars 
-- trek back to the parking lot. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Two-mile "night awareness" hikes, led by a naturalist with the Conejo 
Recreation and Park District, in 1,700-acre Wildwood Park in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: The entrance to Wildwood Park is at the end of Avenida De Los Arboles 
where it intersects Big Sky Drive. (Take the Lynn Road exit off the Ventura 
Freeway.) 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Night awareness hikes are held each month. The next one is Saturday, 
Feb. 12, from 6 to 8 p.m. (Full moon hikes in the park are scheduled Jan. 27 
from 6 to 8:30 p.m., and Jan. 29, 8 to 10:30 p.m.) 
</P>
<P>
 * COST: $3 per person. 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: For reservations, call 494-8301. (If the weather is questionable, call 
this number before the hike to check for cancellation.) The night awareness 
hikes are recommended for families. Bring water and a flashlight, although the 
hike is mostly in the dark without lights. Wear warm clothing, even gloves.

MUSIC; TAO JONZ, LOCAL CLUB HEROES, MAY GO NORTH; SAN FRANCISCO MAY BE THE NEXT 
STOP FOR THIS CLASSIFICATION-DEFYING QUARTET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Life isn't fair. If it was, all the L. A. teams wouldn't keep losing, Reagan 
would best be remembered for General Electric Theatre and no one would have 
gotten an earthquake for their birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 Music, life's weird soundtrack, is doubly unfair. Crummy music abounds and 
good bands go away with alarming regularity. On the local level, another in 
that endless series of "Why ain't they rich?" bands is Santa Barbara's Tao 
Jonz. 
</P>
<P>
 Other bands may be more fun, but no local band is better than Tao Jonz. They 
combine a little reggae, a little ska, a little rock, a little blues, and they 
end up sounding just like, well, Tao Jonz. The quartet has a tape and two CDs 
of original material. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jeez, I can't really describe our music except to say it's original," bass 
player and lead singer Doug Jaffe said. "We have about 70 originals and have 
never -- not once -- done a cover song." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Jaffe, the other Jonz boys are singer/guitarist Jimmy Werking, "The 
Working Man," with a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from UC Santa Barbara. 
Stosh (just Stosh) hits the drums, while Johnny Atmosphere creates a lot of it 
when he plays keyboards. The group has been playing in S. B. since 1989. 
Unfortunately, that may be almost long enough. 
</P>
<P>
 The band, having conquered State Street, may be on the verge of expanding its 
horizons, and perhaps meeting a lot of Giants fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've played in L. A. a couple of times, but afterward, it never seemed to be 
such a good idea," the bass player said. "San Francisco seems like the place to 
be. They seem to like us up there and we might move around March." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara has been home to Jaffe and Werking since they left Fort Collins, 
Colo., where they met. 
</P>
<P>
 "Around 1985 or 1986, we had an all-original band called Rhythm & Views," 
Jaffe said. "We were cool, but we only played about eight months when Jimmy 
left for UCSB. I went to Venice to try to be like Jim Morrison and became a 
drunk. Venice is great for that. We got together again around 1989 and formed 
Tao Jonz." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, everyone has a plan that will not work. Does Tao Jonz? At their gigs, 
both of their CDs were on sale -- cheap, real cheap. The band ended up giving a 
lot of them away. OK, now name one show where you got anything free besides a 
headache. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must've given thousands of CDs away," Jaffe said. "We'd sell a few for 
five bucks, two bucks, whatever. We have always felt that getting our music out 
there was most important. Right now, we're out of CDs." 
</P>
<P>
 They'll never run out of clever songs. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Locey, who writes regularly on rock 'n' roll, has survived the mosh pit 
and the local music scene for many years. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Tao Jonz. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Beach Shack, 500 Anacapa St., Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Friday night, 9-ish.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; 4 PLACES WHERE THE FOOD CAN BE COUNTED ON TO HIT THE SPOT; 
THE OFFERINGS RANGE FROM VIETNAMESE-STYLE SHRIMP TO SUSHI TO NEW ENGLAND 
LOBSTER TO CAESAR SALAD.

 Some of us will go miles, drive for hours, brave snow, sleet and hail to 
satisfy the cravings of our palates. Well, perhaps not snow and sleet. 
</P>
<P>
 And, anyhow, we don't get much of any of that around these parts. 
</P>
<P>
 Myself, when I feel one of these gustatory demands coming on, I notice that 
they always seem to demand a particular type of food -- frequently seafood -- 
and most often a particular dish at a particular place. So I've developed a 
sort of mental map of certain places around the county toward which my humble 
six-cylinder steed seems almost to turn automatically when it hears me snort, 
sensing that, behind the wheel, I am already salivating. 
</P>
<P>
 One Sunday afternoon, for instance, I realized that I just had to taste, that 
very second, the contrasting flavors so defining in Vietnamese cuisine. My 
tongue seemed to long for the mixture of sweet and sour, spices and salt, which 
I knew I'd find at a certain modest storefront restaurant in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 And so we were off to Tea Sympathy, where My Linh Le and Kai Le dish out their 
garlic-roasted shrimp ($6.25). The shellfish itself is always firm, not 
overcooked, and slightly salted. Their tart in a white coffee sauce ($6) always 
seems to have just a burnt trace and is crusty on the edges, very chocolaty 
without being too much so, and rich in the middle, but not too sweet. 
</P>
<P>
 Every once in a while, overcome perhaps by a feeling of virtue in dining, I 
feel this strong urge for a Caesar salad, although until recently I could 
easily ignore even a good Caesar, and didn't care at all for anchovies. Which 
is why I find it just a bit weird to be heading to Cocoa's Place, in a corner 
of a Ventura shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 Cocoa's is a combination bakery, cafe, candy store. A patisserie, they like to 
call it. And, although the service can be nearly nonexistent, it's still a 
worthwhile stop for lovers of Caesar salad ($6.95). Theirs is a crisp romaine, 
done, I think, with soybean oil, and salt and pepper, chopped anchovies, 
garlic, vinegar, sugar, eggs and paprika, Parmesan cheese and croutons. 
</P>
<P>
 Have I mentioned that one of my most frequent, strongest cravings is for 
sushi? 
</P>
<P>
 It is a craving that draws me to Juro'Cho, down on Seaward Avenue a block from 
the water in Ventura, run by husband and wife George and Tomi Lee and his 
mother, Maggie. The funny thing is that, although I like the sushi in this tiny 
neighborhood spot, the two dishes I like most have nothing to do with rice, or 
with seaweed. 
</P>
<P>
 My favorite dish at Juro'Cho is usually a special on the blackboard. It is the 
yellowtail collar ($6.95). Only two from each fish, they are quite rich, cooked 
gently on the grill in a covered pan, with the house teriyaki sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Second on the list of Japanese delights is the hot and cold sashimi ($6). The 
piece of raw bluefin tuna, moist and succulent, sits on the grill for just a 
few moments, to be seared, and then Maggie lathers it with a sauce of sweet 
Saki and soy and perhaps rice vinegar -- and then puts it in front of you -- 
with just a touch of an almost-Mexican salsa sprinkled on top. In your mouth is 
the aroma of the slightly charred fish, the sauce and the salsa -- superb. 
</P>
<P>
 Not too far away, upstairs at Ventura Harbor Village, with views out over the 
harbor and the ocean, sits Tucks Point. Tucks is where I go in Ventura when I 
have a yen for lobster. You can get fresh New England lobster ($20.95 to 
$26.95) here, and it's excellent. But perhaps easier on the wallet is the New 
England grilled lobster roll ($12.95). It comes in that old East Coast standby 
-- Sunshine rolls, overflowing with chunks of lobster and good mayonnaise. 
</P>
<P>
 And if you're really ravenous, go on to the fried oysters ($12.95), large and 
juicy and plump and heavily breaded in fresh oil. Details

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; CLINTON LISTS COUNTY AS DISASTER AREA; 
EMERGENCY: THE REGION IS ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL AID. LOSSES RISE TO $1 BILLION, 
MAINLY BECAUSE OF NEWLY DISCOVERED DAMAGE IN SIMI VALLEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARYL KELLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton declared Ventura County a federal disaster area Wednesday 
after countywide estimates of earthquake losses rose to $1 billion, mostly 
because of newly discovered damage in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We told him we also have devastation in Ventura County," said Rep. Elton 
Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), who led a delegation that questioned Clinton at a 
Burbank Airport meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the east end of Simi Valley, we literally have thousands of pieces of 
property with major structural damage," Gallegly said. "That area is less than 
seven miles from the epicenter." 
</P>
<P>
 The congressman joined Ventura County Supervisor Vicky Howard -- another Simi 
Valley resident -- in raising damage estimates to at least $1 billion, 
including $250 million in Fillmore, several hundred million in Simi Valley and 
smaller losses in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going up by the minute," Howard said. "At first blush we looked around 
and said, 'We came through this pretty well.' But as the hours and days passed, 
we discovered that there is much more damage than we first thought." 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments: 
</P>
<P>
 * Caltech scientists said aftershocks from the quake are migrating toward 
Ventura County. The epicenters of two strong aftershocks Wednesday afternoon 
were six miles northeast of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 * Estimates of damaged houses rose to 5,000 in Simi Valley, including 250 to 
500 that are uninhabitable. In Fillmore, more than 300 houses and mobile homes 
were declared uninhabitable. 
</P>
<P>
 * Schools remained closed until next week in Simi Valley, while Fillmore 
schools reopen today. 
</P>
<P>
 * About 800 people were staying at shelters in Simi Valley and Fillmore, and 
another shelter opened in Piru. 
</P>
<P>
 * Water service was restored to about 8,000 eastern Simi Valley residents, but 
a new break in a main line threatened that service late Wednesday. A strong 
aftershock broke a second line, leaving residents in the Moorpark College area 
without water. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltech seismologist Egill Hauksson said the aftershock sequence, with the two 
magnitude 5 quakes of Wednesday afternoon, has become "very energetic" and 
"slightly above the normal." 
</P>
<P>
 An analysis of the more than 1,000 aftershocks indicated that they have 
migrated about five miles northwest from the Northridge epicenter of Monday's 
main shock, toward Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hauksson cautioned that it is too early in the aftershock sequence to 
reach conclusions about its future course. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County disaster declaration came two days after the deadly 
magnitude 6.6 Northridge temblor struck the San Fernando Valley. Clinton 
declared Los Angeles County a disaster area within hours of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 As a federal disaster area, Ventura County agencies are eligible for a variety 
of federal aid. Residents qualify for rental assistance and low-interest 
reconstruction loans. Businesses can apply for low-interest loans or grants. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton promised that $4 million would be available to local officials in 
Ventura County by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they plan to open two federal emergency offices: at St. Francis 
of Assisi Catholic Church in Fillmore and at the Sycamore Drive Community 
Center in Simi Valley. They are expected to be operating by noon today. The 
officials who attended the Clinton meeting -- Gallegly, Howard, Supervisor John 
K. Flynn and Sheriff Larry Carpenter -- took with them the $1-billion estimate, 
dramatically higher than the figure of $400 million from a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly said damage in Simi Valley is three or four times higher than the 
$200 million estimated Tuesday. And county emergency officials said they 
thought Gallegly's figures may turn out to be low. 
</P>
<P>
 With just half of Fillmore surveyed by building inspectors and only a small 
fraction of Simi Valley inspected, official county damage estimates totaled 
$500 million in the two cities, or about $250 million each. 
</P>
<P>
 Wendy Haddock, assistant director of emergency services in the Sheriff's 
Department, said partial surveys show that about 5,000 Simi Valley homes have 
been damaged, and up to 500 will be "red-tagged" as uninhabitable. About 200 
businesses sustained moderate to extensive damage, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city of Simi is hit so severely they haven't even had time to assess 
their damage," Haddock said. "Five thousand homes -- my God, it's frightening. 
They are still trying to get the critical services up and running again." 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley's attention was focused primarily on the hard-hit east end, where 
8,000 residents were without water until Wednesday afternoon and electrical 
power and natural gas service was spotty. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of Simi Valley, along with water users in two-thirds of the county, 
were advised to conserve because their supplies depend on giant pipelines that 
were damaged in the quake. The water system, serving communities as far west as 
Oxnard, is operating at less than half of normal pressure and is not expected 
to have full pressure and supplies for a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi residents also were asked to continue to boil drinking water -- and 
restaurants were required to do so -- because of impurities. 
</P>
<P>
 After a magnitude 5.1 aftershock rained down plaster at some of its facilities 
Wednesday afternoon, the Simi school district closed its 27 schools until next 
week. Three east-end schools are severely damaged: Simi High School, Valley 
View Junior High and Township Elementary. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Simi Valley's other public buildings with major damage was the East 
County Courthouse. Cases were transferred to Ventura on Wednesday. Although the 
courthouse can be repaired, Howard was not sure the same is true for the county 
library in Simi Valley, where an internal wall collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 The second floor of the Simi Valley Police Station is also uninhabitable, as 
is a six-story Farmers Insurance office building. 
</P>
<P>
 In Fillmore, 600 to 1,000 homes have been damaged and 163 have been 
"red-tagged" as too dangerous to enter until repaired. Of those, 128 are mobile 
homes. Another 156 houses have been declared uninhabitable but limited access 
is allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Of an estimated 60 damaged Fillmore businesses, 25 have been found to have 
sustained major damage and another 15 moderate to minor damage, Haddock said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fillmore City Council today will consider a new ordinance to require 
strengthening of old buildings so they would not be a threat to life during 
earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 All utilities have been restored in Fillmore, but repairs on two main water 
lines were continuing. Inspectors were also checking to see if the city's 
million-gallon water tank can be repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 In nearby Piru, 100 to 200 houses and 14 of the community's 15 stores were 
damaged, Haddock said. Thousand Oaks also suffered substantial damage, 
including a fallen roof at the main library, but the city had no damage 
estimates, Haddock said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks City Council, at a meeting Tuesday evening, expressed dismay 
that the architect and contractor of the library allowed sheet metal to be used 
as the library ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're already in a lawsuit with the roofing contractor" for a leaking roof, 
Councilwoman Judy Lazar said. "I don't think I ever would have set foot in that 
building if I knew a piece of sheet metal could have fallen down off the 
ceiling and sheared off my head." 
</P>
<P>
 The council asked residents not to bring 100,000 checked-out books back to the 
library until further notice, promising that no overdue fees would be charged. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours at the city's Newbury Park branch library have been extended. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, about 800 people spent Tuesday night at three American Red Cross 
shelters, two in Fillmore and one in Simi Valley. Another shelter opened 
Wednesday in Piru. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect our shelter population is going to be increasing," said Brian 
Bolton, director of the Red Cross's Ventura County chapter. He said some 
displaced residents, traumatized by the quake, have been sleeping in yards and 
cars rather than risk spending the night indoors. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're forecasting rain this weekend, which may encourage people to go to 
the shelters," Bolton said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the Red Cross expects shelters to remain open another seven to 10 
days. In addition to a place to sleep, the shelters provide food, water, 
toilets, showers and counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials said the county's bridges and freeway overpasses fared well 
during the quake. But the temblor did cause settling at two overcrossings on 
California 118. 
</P>
<P>
 Road crews were scheduled to patch about 10 spots along California 126 between 
Fillmore and Interstate 5 where the earthquake caused settling and bumpy spots. 
And utility crews are still working to repair a gaping 20-by-20-foot hole in 
California 126 where a gas main ruptured under the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink announced Wednesday that it will resume commuter train service today 
from Moorpark and Simi Valley to downtown Los Angeles. One or two cars will be 
added to each of the 10 daily trains to handle an expected increase in 
passengers. 
</P>

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; HUNDREDS IN SIMI VALLEY WAIT FOR INSPECTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Their big stucco houses and modest mobile homes knocked crooked by Monday's 
massive earthquake, hundreds of Simi Valley residents were still sleeping in 
tents, shelters or relatives' homes on Wednesday while waiting for the building 
inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
 As rippling aftershocks Wednesday afternoon shoved some structures even 
farther off their foundations, a platoon of city and volunteer inspectors 
fanned out across Simi Valley to see which buildings were safe to use. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet despite the dangers some homes posed to residents Wednesday, building 
inspectors first checked hospitals, schools and government buildings to make 
sure they were safe, then business districts and housing tracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Ensuring the safety of government buildings first was critical "so that we can 
then provide those services that are needed in the community as quickly as 
possible," Deputy City Manager Laura Herron said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaddis Farmer, a city building official, said Simi Valley would do everything 
it could to avoid condemning residences. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thousand Oaks, officials had already slapped "Unsafe to Enter" signs on 
four residences on the east side. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Branagan, city building and safety director, said the houses had slid 
off their foundations along Erbes Road, but that all could be repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also posted warnings on houses with fractured chimneys where, 
Branagan said, "If you're standing out in the yard, you could get crunched." 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley's hard-hit east end, most of the 13 families on Golf Meadows 
Court had moved their furniture onto lawns and themselves into tents where they 
still lived Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Afraid to sleep in houses that were left waterless, powerless and leaning at 
two-degree angles, they ventured inside only to telephone other landlords in 
search of new places to live. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Devastating," said Gary Kaye, a 39-year-old Hughes Aircraft engineer 
surveying the inch-wide cracks that ran the height of his cathedral ceiling 
living room. "We came within inches of our lives, I believe." 
</P>
<P>
 When the quake hit at 4:31 a.m., most of his neighbors were shaken from their 
beds, some trapped briefly by fallen furniture or jammed doors. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaye's neighbors, Paul and Haruko Norihiro, found nearly every wall in their 
house fractured, the entire frame shaken cockeyed by the tremors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a frightening experience," said Paul Norihiro, a Japanese-American who 
had his leg amputated in 1950 after catching tuberculosis in the Nisei 
concentration camp at Manzanar. "I had a hard time, my armoire fell down and I 
couldn't get through." 
</P>
<P>
 Without insurance, he is trying to move what is left of his belongings out by 
the weekend and hoping for a federal emergency loan to repair the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors Jim and Lynne Rock had already shifted their furniture out of the 
first floor and into a U-Haul for storage until they find a house to rent. 
</P>
<P>
 Their entire house sways and rocks on its twisted frame when they walk 
upstairs, so they are afraid to move anything out of the second floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they live in the neighborhood's tent village, reading at night by floor 
lamps plugged into the generator in neighbor Jim Rice's plumbing truck. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake ripped gas lines open all along the block, but Rice and friends were 
able to cap or switch off the lines within 15 minutes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If he had not, Rice said, "There would have been explosions." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Gregory Stratton said the block was one of the worst-hit in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 But equally hard-hit were trailer parks at the east and west ends of Simi 
Valley, where the quake and aftershocks rocked most homes off their moorings 
and severed their water supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 14 of the 100 mobile homes at the Trade Winds Mobile Home Park were left 
inhabitable. By Wednesday, most of their elderly owners had gone to stay with 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not even had anyone looking in, no city officials," Lee Foster said. 
"No one's been in to check on us." 
</P>
<P>
 Police have patrolled the neighborhood regularly since the quake, Foster said, 
but by 1 p.m. Wednesday no building inspectors had arrived to see the homes 
that had slumped off their jacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the 221-unit Friendly Village mobile home park on Tierra Rejada 
Road met Wednesday to find out whether they would be able to recover their 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like they dropped a bomb on us," said 90-year-old Val Smith, a 
resident of the park since 1974 as he sat in front of his damaged home, 
surrounded by trailers resting precariously on their foundations with windows 
blown out and walls collapsed. "In all my years, and there are a lot of them, 
I've never seen anything like this." 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 of the park's 300 residents have been staying at a nearby Red Cross 
shelter, according to Herschel Gray, manager of the park. Of the park's 221 
homes, 189 are no longer livable. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been pretty tough on these people," Gray said. "Most of them are 
elderly, and a lot of them are going to have trouble paying for their repairs." 
</P>
<P>
 Gray said residents have been unable to get answers so far about federal 
relief aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure there's a list a mile long of people who need help, so we're going 
to be patient," Kennedy said. "This too shall pass." 
</P>
<P>
 On Glenhurst Court, homeowners have been meeting at the center of the block in 
a motor home for coffee and water. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really incredible the kind of cooperation we've had here," said motor 
home owner Cindy Goldberg, who made 10 pots of coffee for the block just after 
the earthquake hit. "A lot of these people are strangers to us and yet we've 
come together, sharing food and water, tents, everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Because most are reluctant to enter their homes, Cecil Boyuls has opened his 
to the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly everyone from the dozen residences on the block have been using Boyuls' 
shower, because his home sustained little damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been pretty unusual, having people coming in and out of here," Boyuls 
said. "But this has been really hard on our neighborhood. A lot of people don't 
realize that there's a lot of damage here." 
</P>
<P>
 In Tim Scalise's residence, large cracks separate nearly every wall. He says 
he doesn't know if he should even be inside because no one has come out to 
inspect the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've called every number and we've gotten nowhere," Scalise said. "We're 
continuing to camp out in our yard, but at some point we need to know, is this 
safe or isn't it?"

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; MERCHANTS PUSH FOR ACCESS TO DAMAGED STORES 
</P>

 Downplaying the aftershocks rolling through Fillmore's rubble-strewn Central 
Avenue, merchants from the historic downtown district met with city officials 
to ask the same question, "When can we reopen?" 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore officials, tired from almost three days of nonstop work since the 6.6 
quake caused an estimated $250 million in damage, tried to calm the business 
owners' rising anger over restrictions on entering their damaged buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "On Monday and Tuesday we were heroes and now we're the bad guys," said Pat 
Askren, the city's fire chief. A frustrated businessman yelled at Askren during 
a emergency meeting called Wednesday to explain safety concerns to business 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "That guy just yelled at me and said we're putting him out of business," 
Askren said. "We're just trying to make sure no one gets killed. Yeah, I'm 
angry too. I lost things in my home, but who are you gonna yell at, God?" 
</P>
<P>
 Some business owners complained to public officials about being prevented from 
retrieving their most essential business documents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The responsibility for that falls on my shoulders," said Steve Stewart, a 
building inspector from Santa Paula managing Fillmore's building inspection 
effort. "We're interested in making sure no one gets maimed or killed." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At another emergency City Council meeting held Tuesday night, members 
considered adopting, for the first time, minimal seismic building codes for the 
town's unreinforced masonry buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Business owners said they are worried that any newly required reinforcements 
would make rebuilding prohibitively expensive for the brick and masonry 
buildings constructed around the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is the new code going to mean?" asked Gary Creagle, a former mayor whose 
gun shop on Central Avenue was seriously damaged in the quake. "Is it going to 
cost a couple of hundred thousand dollars to bring them up to code? I might be 
able to afford it, but other businesses can't. I just want a straight answer 
about what the new code means." 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-1980s, the City Council rejected adopting seismic safety codes for 
the unreinforced masonry buildings along Central Avenue for fear it would drive 
businesses away. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were opposed to passing the codes because we thought they were too 
onerous," City Councilman Roger Campbell said. But the earthquake damage, he 
said, has provided an opportunity with the imminent infusion of Federal 
Emergency Management Agency disaster funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're talking about is requiring basically every business person to pay 
for this very expensive process," Campbell said. "Even though I still don't 
like the idea, now might be the time when we could get FEMA money to help pay 
the cost." 
</P>
<P>
 The city planning staff recommended that the city adopt seismic safety 
standards immediately. The damage from the quake, said City Manager Roy Payne, 
should be enough to show the council the need for a standard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some of this damage today because in the past we weren't willing to 
adopt a standard," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council decided to hold off on a final decision until an emergency City 
Council meeting scheduled for Thursday evening. At Tuesday night's meeting, 
council members decided to waive all fees for permits required during the 
rebuilding process, but that decision didn't seem to placate frustrated 
business owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would at least like to go inside the building," said Sam Sunner, owner of 
the Central Avenue Market. The force of the quake collapsed portions of the 
market's brick walls into the store and onto the street. He estimates that the 
$500,000 he recently invested in refurbishing the building over the last three 
years will be lost.  
</P>
<P>
 Sunner spent part of Wednesday waiting for answers from a city building 
inspector about when he could go inside his building.  
</P>
<P>
 "I understand what the city is saying, but we need to get materials (from) 
inside the store," he said. An inspector told him that would not be possible 
until repairs make the building safe for limited entry. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 other merchants from Fillmore's downtown gathered at Wednesday 
morning's meeting, as city officials tried to devise a plan to allow some of 
them to enter their businesses to access damage and retrieve valuables. 
</P>
<P>
 City leaders abandoned the plan after Wednesday afternoon's magnitude 5.1 
aftershock further damaged Fillmore buildings.  
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Richard Diaz said Ventura County sheriff's deputies so far had not 
arrested anyone for entering damaged buildings without permission. But after 
the 5.1 aftershock, he said, deputies will now enforce all limitations on 
structure deemed off-limits. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they are still wrestling with the issue of what to do 
about buildings that seem beyond repair. 
</P>
<P>
 Two historic buildings in Fillmore's downtown, the recently restored Fillmore 
Theater and the Masonic Building, suffered major damage and may have to be 
demolished, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 While city leaders want to move as quickly as possible to clear the downtown 
area of potential hazards, they also want to preserve the character of their 
historic downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once they're gone, they're gone," Campbell said. "I want to make sure we look 
at all the alternatives, and I don't just want a building inspector or other 
non-elected official to make the final decision."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; SOME COMFORT FOUND IN NUMBERS; SAFETY: THOSE 
FORCED OUT OF THEIR HOUSES TURN TO SHELTERS FOR MEALS, BEDS AND TO COMPARE WAR 
STORIES WITH OTHERS.

 As daylight faded over Fillmore, the Red Cross shelter at San Cayetano 
Elementary School was overflowing with weary, jittery residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of tiny green cots were set up in neat rows to accommodate the 280 
earthquake victims wandering into the school's cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Natividad Flores and her family had found a comfortable place to 
rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to be here," said Flores, who left behind her severely damaged 
Sespe Place house to stay at the shelter. "It feels safer here. It's good to 
have so many people around. If we get through this, we'll all get through it 
together. And if we go down, we'll go down together." 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the temblor, strangers and longtime neighbors have come 
together in an unprecedented union at the city's largest emergency shelter, set 
up on Mountain View Road shortly after the shaking began Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Exchanging war stories and a few laughs, the residents have found comfort and 
condolences amid the school's shaken but sturdy walls. 
</P>
<P>
 At least for a few more days, Flores, her husband and three children -- and 
dozens of others -- will call a shelter home. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's good food, blankets and a roof," Manuel Flores said. "You can't ask 
for anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday night, the residents who had sought refuge at the shelter began 
settling in for a long stay. After swarms of large aftershocks shook them from 
their slumber the night before, they were anxious for sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before 9 p.m., the group started winding down. While most stayed 
inside the school, others simply refused to be under a roof. They set up camp 
on a nearby field. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anything falls on us it will be a star," said Jaime Serna, who was camping 
out with his wife and two daughters. "I've got two little kids to worry about. 
I don't want to be inside." 
</P>
<P>
 But Marjorie and Bob Stephens, whose home at the El Dorado Mobile Home Estates 
was severely damaged in the quake, said they preferred to stay with the group. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fascinating," Marjorie Stephens said. "You can really see how different 
people react to things." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the youngsters, who spent time drawing with crayons or watching 
children's movies rented by Red Cross staff, seemed oblivious to the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a half-dozen teen-age boys -- most of them friends from Fillmore 
High School -- tried to outdo each other with their tales of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything fell down in my house," bragged Raul Hernandez, 14, who lives on 
the city's east side. "You couldn't walk." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, well my roof almost fell down . . . and the doghouse fell down on my 
dog," said Anthony Camarillo, 13, prompting his friends to break into a chorus 
of giggles. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the quake seemed like an amusement park ride to some of the boys at 
the shelter, the adults were tormented by the events of the past few days. 
</P>
<P>
 Early Wednesday, the group was awakened when one of the adults had a 
nightmare. Later, another woman had to be taken to the hospital after suffering 
chest pains. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercedes Luis Jazoc, whose home was destroyed in the quake, said she had had 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "My head aches," she said. "I want it to end." 
</P>
<P>
 Marjorie Stephens said she was trying to make the best of the situation. She 
said she was touched by the concern displayed toward the quake victims at the 
shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who escaped the tremor with little damage have been stopping by with 
boxes of clothes and food. McDonald's supplied the shelter with food, and Red 
Cross staff went out of their way to make sure the victims were comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a great learning experience," Marjorie Stephens said. "So many 
times we get caught up in our own lives and it takes something like this to 
bring us together. I'm going to change the way I do things. I'm going to go out 
of my way to help more people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it's a good thing that happened to us. It shook us out of our 
lethargy." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 The Mountain View Road shelter in Fillmore is expected to be moved today to 
another location, because more quake victims probably will seek refuge over the 
weekend if expected rain materializes. People seeking shelter should call the 
Red Cross at 339-2234 to learn the new location.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; SOME COMFORT FOUND IN NUMBERS; REFUGE: FOR THE 
SECOND NIGHT, ABOUT 70 SIMI VALLEY RESIDENTS SEEK RELIEF IN THE RED CROSS 
FACILITY AT ROYAL HIGH SCHOOL.

 Still shaken from Monday's earthquake, Simi Valley residents Venetta and 
Herman McIlwin spent Tuesday sorting through broken belongings and bolting 
bookshelves to walls as they tried to reorder their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 But as darkness fell and the aftershocks continued, the McIlwins took their 
two small children and left the privacy of their home on the hard-hit east end 
of town. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second night, the McIlwins and about 70 other Simi Valley residents 
sought refuge in the perceived safety of the Red Cross Emergency Shelter in the 
Royal High School gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just aren't ready to go back yet," Venetta McIlwin said. "My daughter 
won't even go into the house." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those at the shelter were there because their homes were 
uninhabitable. Others came because their gas and water were shut off, flocking 
to the center for meals, water and comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary and Fred Homsy decided to go to the shelter instead of staying with their 
son, who also lives in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "My son called and said, 'Come on over,' and I said 'no way,' " Mary Homsy, 
78, said. "He just built a Jacuzzi and when those aftershocks hit I don't want 
to end up under water." 
</P>
<P>
 Shelter-seekers did not seem to mind waiting in line for cold pizza and warm 
sodas, or curling up on narrow cots lining the gymnasium floor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone is already under a lot of stress, and then this happens, it can 
feel like the end of the world," said Robert Ortiz, a therapist with the 
county's Health Care Agency who spent two days at the shelter. "A hot cup of 
coffee and a good night's sleep can do wonders." 
</P>
<P>
 As cheerful high school students made sandwiches and coffee through the night, 
a volunteer fed and watered pet dogs and cats, and a nurse kept tabs on an 
elderly man with diabetes and a young boy who was suffering a mild asthmatic 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 In a makeshift shelter office, shelter manager Lisa Lawrence answered the 
endlessly ringing phone, ordered medication for an ill shelter-seeker and 
talked to a distressed mother about her 9-year-old daughter's odd behavior 
since the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The mother said her daughter kept disappearing at the shelter and would show 
up again in tears, refusing to say where she had been or what the problem was. 
Lawrence told her to bring the girl to her for a talk about what might be 
troubling her. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just crazy around here, but we're glad we can offer these services," 
Lawrence said. "We've got people all over the place who didn't go to work who 
are popping up to volunteer." 
</P>
<P>
 Even some shelter-seekers got into the act. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt guilty just sitting around," said Jennifer Faulconer, 17. "So I just 
started helping out." 
</P>
<P>
 Others, such as Delores Pacheco, were just beginning to come to grips with the 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to come here, but I spent the day at the house trying to clean 
up and it really got me down," said Pacheco, 43. "Then I came here and I 
realized I hadn't had anything to eat or drink for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Pacheco's neighbor, Denni Duskin, came to the shelter with her five children. 
Duskin, 37, said she was waiting for a building inspector to examine the 
crumbled fireplace in her two-story house in the Oak Tree neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hoping they say, 'It looks terrible, but its all OK,' " Duskin said. 
"Then we'll just patch it up and make it look good again." 
</P>
<P>
 As Sylvia Milian, 28, pushed together a long row of cots, she said all her 
belongings were destroyed in the house on Tapo Street where she lives with 13 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're moving out of here before this can happen again," said Milian, who 
works as a medical assistant. "We moved here to start a new life after we lost 
everything in a fire in Chicago and now we have to start all over again." 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting on a cot nearby, Frances Echterling, 60, and Christine Fridd, 35, 
talked about the damage to their home. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the earthquake damaged their house, their garage burst into 
flames when a gas line ruptured. Fearful that flying embers would allow the 
blaze to spread, firefighters flooded the house with water. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unbearable," Echterling said. "There are holes in the roof and I don't 
even know if it's safe to go in and I can't even begin to think about what it's 
going to cost to get everything fixed." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The pair lives on Echterling's wages as a supermarket demonstrator and on 
Fridd's disability income for back injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Still smelling of smoke, Echterling sat on a green canvas cot and offered her 
daughter a foil-covered turkey sandwich. 
</P>
<P>
 "You really need to eat," Echterling said. But Fridd just sat, looking sad and 
worried.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's my cat, Baby," Fridd said. "She disappeared and we can't find her 
anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 A volunteer tried to cheer her up. "My cats were gone for two days before we 
found them," he said. "So don't worry, Baby will come back."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; NOT ONLY OIL IS TAINTING WATERWAY; WASTE: 
TREATED SEWAGE WITH ADDED CHLORINE POURS INTO THE SANTA CLARA RIVER, ALREADY 
FOULED BY MONDAY'S OIL SPILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Santa Clara River, already assaulted with 168,000 gallons of crude oil 
from a pipeline ruptured in Monday's earthquake, was furthered imperiled when 
sewage treated with chlorine poured into the river, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 About 6 million gallons of treated sewage from the Valencia treatment plant 
with added chlorine has poured down storm drains into the Santa Clara River and 
into Ventura County almost to Piru since Monday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chlorine, which is added to waste water to kill bacteria, is toxic to wildlife 
and is usually removed before the treated sewage is released into the river. 
The earthquake may have damaged a system that removes the chlorine before it is 
discharged. 
</P>
<P>
 However, officials said they also purposefully left the chlorine in the water 
to guard against any possible health and safety problems to humans because the 
waste water was not as highly treated as it usually is. The concentration of 
chlorine in the river does not pose a danger to humans, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't dechlorinate because we were operating in an emergency situation," 
said Jim Stahl, assistant general manager for the Sanitation Districts of Los 
Angeles County, which runs the Valencia plant. "We wanted to err on the side of 
human safety." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, earthen berms built by workers on Tuesday were holding, restricting 
the oil spill to a 12-mile stretch of the river just east of Piru, said Mary 
Gale, spokeswoman with the California Department of Fish and Game's Office of 
Oil Spill Prevention and Response.  
</P>
<P>
 But forecasts of up to one-half inch of rain this weekend threatened to spread 
the spill farther downstream, Gale said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would carry the oil beyond the berms and affect a greater stretch of the 
river," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 By Wednesday, workers had vacuumed up about one-third of the oil, but the 
cleanup effort was expected to continue for weeks or months as contaminated 
soil is removed. Wildlife officials will write a plan to restore the damaged 
habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 The spill contaminated a stretch of the river that supports at least two 
endangered species, the tiny songbird least Bell's vireo and the unarmoured 
threespined stickleback, a fish that dates from prehistoric times. 
</P>
<P>
 The first of the oiled wildlife began appearing Wednesday, but rescue workers 
stayed on the shorelines to avoid contact with the oil and chlorine, Gale said. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the animals get cold and stressed, they will come to higher ground where 
the rescue workers can reach them," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Wildlife officials had no count Wednesday of the number of birds that were 
affected. But International Bird Rescue of Berkeley, whose workers only 
recently returned home after the Christmas Day oil spill at McGrath Lake, was 
called to the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Fish and Game's mobile bird-cleaning trailer returned to the Ventura County 
animal shelter at the Camarillo Airport to begin cleaning and rehabilitating 
the animals. No birds had yet been brought to the shelter Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 An oil spill in the same area in 1991 killed 186 birds. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Arco Oil, the parent company of pipeline owner Four Corners 
Pipeline Co., said company efforts were focused on the cleanup and they had not 
yet had time to determine why that particular section of the 130-mile pipeline 
ruptured during the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 He estimated it would be a full month before restoration of service of the 
10-inch pipeline that carries crude oil from Kern County to oil refineries in 
the Long Beach and Los Angeles areas. Spills Into the Santa Clara River 
</P>
<P>
 Oil from a ruptured pipeline in Valencia traveled through storm drains and 
into the Santa Clara River, where it flowed downstream and almost to Piru. 
Waste water with added chlorine was discharged into the river at the Valencia 
plant.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; SIMI VALLEY WARNED TO SAVE WATER OR RUN DRY; 
CONSERVATION: RESIDENTS TOLD NOT TO DOUSE LAWNS OR CARS. SERVICE FLUCTUATES 
AMID ANOTHER MAJOR PIPELINE BREAK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As round-the-clock crews continued to patch Simi Valley's earthquake-ruptured 
water pipes, city officials stressed the need for conservation to stretch 
limited water supplies to as many houses as possible.  
</P>
<P>
 Early Wednesday morning, city workers papered the town with flyers urging 
residents not to water lawns or wash cars. And City Manager Lin Koester ordered 
the water shut off at the city's three golf courses. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley's water service fluctuated widely on Wednesday. By midafternoon, 
city crews managed to restore low-pressure water service to all but a few of 
the 8,000 residents without water in city's eastern end. 
</P>
<P>
 But within hours, another major pipeline break disrupted water service across 
large areas of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Wednesday evening, Mayor Gregory Stratton said, water normally supplied 
from Los Angeles County had been cut off and supplies from Bard Reservoir are 
not able to reach many households because of breaks in the line or incautious 
use of water. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's water district services about two-thirds of Simi Valley's 120,000 
residents. The others are supplied by the Southern California Water Co. 
</P>
<P>
 A health advisory will remain in effect today warning Simi Valley residents to 
boil water before drinking it. Residents unable to cook because of gas 
shut-offs should add a few drops of unscented household bleach to their water, 
officials said. Add eight drops per gallon of water if the water is clear from 
the tap. If the water runs cloudy, use 16 drops. Allow the water to stand for 
30 minutes before drinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Koester said about half of the city's estimated 15 water pumps were working, 
allowing delivery of about half the normal amount of water to the city. He said 
the pump failures may cause water to flow in fits and starts. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very serious problem. We're still finding breaks in the system," 
Koester said. 
</P>
<P>
 City workers will give out free drinking water, five gallons per household, at 
Santa Susana Park, Ralph's market in Wood Ranch, the city's Metrolink station, 
Royal High School and all elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Cross will also continue to offer bottled water at its emergency 
shelter at Royal High School. 
</P>
<P>
 And Southern California Water will fill containers for residents from a fire 
hydrant at Heywood Street and Bridget Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing we want to say is we appreciate everybody's understanding and 
patience during this difficult time," said Charlotte St. John, a spokeswoman 
for Southern California Water. "We hope people will continue to be patient as 
we work out the remaining glitches and get things back to normal." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's water delivery system falls at the end of a series of pipelines 
that bring all of Simi Valley's water from a Granada Hills filtration plant run 
by the Metropolitan Water District. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant, which was shut down after it was damaged during the quake, should 
be reopened by Thursday, spokesman Bob Gomperz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've replaced a sheared section of pipeline and, if all goes well, we'll 
have the plant up and running soon," Gomperz said. 
</P>
<P>
 As water begins to flow through the pipes for the first time since the 
earthquake, new leaks may be discovered, Gomperz said. "We've got extra crews 
standing by to try to take care of leakage problems." 
</P>
<P>
 The Calleguas Municipal Water District, which links Metropolitan and the city 
water districts, was continuing to patch its pipelines, said advanced planning 
administrator Eric Bergh. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing a lot of work now," Bergh said. "But we're not going to know the 
full extent of the problems until we have the normal flow of water back in the 
lines."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; AFTERSHOCKS TO KEEP SIMI SCHOOLS SHUT; 
EDUCATION: A 5.1 TREMOR DAMAGES BUILDINGS SCHEDULED TO REOPEN. CLASSES RESUME 
IN CONEJO VALLEY UNIFIED DISTRICT.

 Schools in Simi Valley will not reopen this week because a powerful aftershock 
Wednesday caused new damage to some buildings already hard hit by Monday's 6.6 
temblor, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Principals at various schools found newly fallen chunks of stucco and plaster 
after the 1:12 p.m. aftershock, which registered 5.1 on the Richter scale, 
Supt. Mary Beth Wolford said. The most serious damage is at schools in the 
city's east end, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just making people very jittery and nervous," said Wolford, adding that 
employees in the administrative offices dove for cover when the shaking began. 
"Things were banging and falling. I don't want to take any chances with the 
safety of students and staff." 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore school officials planned to reopen today after inspections showed no 
major structural damage, officials said. A checkup after Wednesday's aftershock 
revealed no new problems, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley officials had planned today to open at least 14 buildings among 
the least damaged of the district's 27 schools. Those schools now are expected 
to start up again Monday, Wolford said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we were just pushing too hard, too fast," Wolford said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other schools east of Sycamore Drive could take slightly longer to fix 
up for the students' return, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students from the three most heavily damaged schools -- Simi Valley High, 
Valley View Junior High and Township Elementary -- must wait at least until 
Friday to learn if they will have to double up at other schools, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 If that happens, a school would house one student population and faculty in 
the morning and another in the afternoon, Wolford said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Fillmore, Supt. David Haney said there will not be gas service at the 
schools right away because of a few broken lines. He added that he hoped the 
mild weather would continue until heat is restored. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fillmore district also had to replace many broken light fixtures and clean 
up the mess from rattled classrooms before students could return today, Haney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably the worst problem for us is that things are really trashed," Haney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile in Thousand Oaks, officials of Conejo Valley Unified District said 
Wednesday that the first day back to classes was fairly smooth despite some 
logistical difficulties in delivering bottled water to every building. 
</P>
<P>
 One of two trucks delivering water to the district's intermediate and high 
schools got trapped on the Ventura Freeway, Assistant Supt. Sarah Hart said. As 
a result, the water did not arrive until almost 10 a.m., Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then at 11 o'clock, they announced we weren't on the boil-water alert 
anymore," Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because tap water was deemed safe to drink without boiling, school officials 
will not be forced to supply students with bottled water today, Hart said.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; SO FAR, SO GOOD FOR COMMUTERS -- BUT THE WORST 
IS YET TO COME; TRAFFIC: DRIVERS HAVE FACED FEW TIE-UPS, BUT MORE FREEWAY JAMS 
ARE EXPECTED. 'MONDAY IS GOING TO BE JUDGMENT DAY' ON TIGHT ROADWAYS, OFFICIALS 
SAY.

 Ventura County commuters found only a few scattered traffic jams on their way 
into Los Angeles on Wednesday, transportation officials said, but more 
extensive freeway logjams were predicted for today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took the 101 in this morning and it moved fairly well," said Caltrans 
spokesman Russell Snyder, who commutes from Westlake Village to downtown Los 
Angeles. "Traffic was lighter than normal today, but we expect that the traffic 
is going to get heavier as the week goes on and more people head back into 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Travis, manager of transit programs for the Ventura County Transportation 
Commission, agreed that the worst was probably still to come and that officials 
and commuters would probably not know until next week how tight the roadways 
will be because of earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Monday is going to be judgment day as far as how alternative plans are 
functioning and how our limited roadways are working," Travis said. 
</P>
<P>
 One benefit to commuters is today's expected restoration of Metrolink commuter 
rail service from Moorpark and Simi Valley into the San Fernando Valley and Los 
Angeles for the first time since Monday's quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink spokesman Peter Hidalgo said extra cars were being added to the 
four-car trains in anticipation of increased ridership. 
</P>
<P>
 Hidalgo said Metrolink and Transportation Commission officials were also 
trying to schedule trains to run as far west as Camarillo or Oxnard, and would 
know by Friday whether such service will be provided. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seriously looking at Camarillo as a viable option with a slighter 
possibility of going out to Oxnard," he said. "If it is all a go, we probably 
would not see any kind of service until next week sometime." 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder said commuters should think seriously about taking Metrolink trains, 
ride-sharing or otherwise revising their daily commute because of the limited 
availability of roadways since the quake-related closure of the Golden State 
and Simi Valley freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink trains bound for Union Station in Los Angeles were scheduled to 
leave Moorpark this morning at 5:15 a.m., 5:55 a.m., 6:46 a.m., 7:25 a.m. and 
2:50 p.m., Travis said. The same trains depart from Simi Valley about 13 
minutes later, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trains to Simi Valley and Moorpark will leave Union Station at 1:05 p.m., 4:25 
p.m., 5 p.m., 5:40 p.m. and 6:23 p.m., Travis said, and the ride takes about 70 
minutes. Those who miss the final westbound train can catch an intercity Amtrak 
train that leaves Union Station at 8:05 p.m. but requires a separate ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ventura County freeways are all open, one was briefly closed about 2 
p.m. Wednesday after drivers reported cracks in the Sunset Hills Boulevard 
overpass that runs over California 23 in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Permanent closure of the overpass or freeway could have cut off one of the 
main access points for Ventura County residents to the Ventura Freeway and Los 
Angeles, but Caltrans inspector Dave Tiberi was called to the scene and ruled 
that the overpass was safe.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; REFUGEES FROM TEMBLORS THRONG REGION'S HOTELS; 
ESCAPE: MANAGERS REPORT A SECOND WAVE OF GUESTS WHO ARE FEARFUL OF AFTERSHOCKS 
AND DESPERATE FOR BASIC COMFORTS. SOME INNS OFFER SPECIAL RATES.

 Hotels in western Ventura County are doing a brisk business as residents in 
hard-hit areas of the San Fernando Valley and elsewhere seek refuge from the 
hassles of post-quake life. 
</P>
<P>
 The first wave of earthquake victims began piling into hotels along the 
Ventura Freeway within hours of Monday's quake. They drove north to escape 
battered homes left in shambles of broken glass and overturned furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, hotel managers say they are seeing a second wave of people fearful of the 
aftershocks and desperate for basic comforts: a hot shower, a cooked meal, a 
soft bed, a light switch that works. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they call, they say, 'Do you have electricity? Do you have water? OK, 
we're coming,'said Rod Houck, general manager of the Pierpont Inn, where about 
60 quake refugees were fed a free dinner of spaghetti and salad Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "They walk in and see no pictures are off the wall, that everything is intact. 
They have a big sense of relief," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Houck said the Ventura hotel still has about 50 guests from the San Fernando 
Valley who leave the hotel early each morning to work on their homes, then 
straggle back after dark. 
</P>
<P>
 Other hotels in Ventura, Oxnard and Camarillo are also running at or near 
capacity; some are offering special earthquake rates. Business travelers and 
tourists who have canceled their reservations are quickly being replaced by 
quake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, natural disasters tend to be good for hotels," said Steve 
Troyer, general manager for the Country Inn in Ventura, which is about 80% 
full. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Lavender of the Ventura Visitors & Convention Bureau, which monitors 
occupancy rates, said: "Each hotel I spoke with said they're taking 
reservations all day. The phones have not stopped ringing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I imagine we'll be seeing more of the San Fernando Valley people as the days 
go on," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Financial Plaza Hilton in Oxnard, rooms have been booked full all week, 
although some will be available starting today. The hotel has been offering a 
special earthquake rate of $59, down from $89 per room. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to make people feel comfortable," said Kay Morter, the hotel's 
general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 What with conventioneers, a movie company filming in Fillmore and residents 
from the San Fernando Valley, the Holiday Inn in Ventura is nearly full with 
weekend reservations  
</P>
<P>
 The Courtyard by Marriott in Camarillo also has been full since Monday and was 
expected to be at capacity again Wednesday tonight. Rooms that the hotel 
typically rents for $64 are being offered for $49. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Valette, administrator of the 130-room hotel, said more than 50 people 
were referred to other hotels after calling the Marriott Wednesday looking for 
lodging. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Anne Leff, 50, said she checked into the Marriott on Monday with her four dogs 
and rabbit after the chimney collapsed, large cracks appeared in the stucco and 
the gas line ruptured in her two-story Northridge home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got bagels, I've got Cheerios, I've got egg bread, cookies and soda -- 
whatever I could take out of the house," she said. "All you really need is a 
place to put your head down and hot water and a place to brush your teeth." 
</P>
<P>
 Also staying at the Marriott were Northridge residents Caroline Gomez, 17, and 
her 86-year-old grandmother, Gertrude Gomez. 
</P>
<P>
 "The aftershocks are scaring me, plus we don't have any water or electricity," 
Caroline said. "There's electricity and water here." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking relaxed in the lobby of the Holiday Inn, Simi Valley resident Melanie 
Seiflein said she checked into the hotel Tuesday morning after spending the 
night in her car because she was afraid to re-enter her townhome on Birch Glen 
Avenue. Before leaving Ventura to return home Wednesday, she planned to stock 
up on water, fuel and cans of food. 
</P>
<P>
 "I needed to get away from the insanity," she said. "I just needed some 
peace."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; MASSIVE RELIEF EFFORT PUTS RED CROSS TEAMS TO 
THE TEST; AFTERMATH: MORE THAN 200 VOLUNTEERS SPREAD OUT TO SET UP SHELTERS AND 
PROVIDE SUPPLIES AND COUNSELING. THE AGENCY EXPECTS TO SPEND UP TO $750,000.

 Ventura County Red Cross volunteers are no rookies to disasters, but the 
relief efforts after Monday's earthquake are putting them to the test.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Our projection right now is that this could be the largest disaster we've 
worked on," said Brian Bolton, director of the Ventura County chapter of the 
American Red Cross. "But we've kind of lost track now that we've gone from 
floods to fires to earthquakes." 
</P>
<P>
 In the last three days, 219 trained Red Cross volunteers have provided relief 
to victims of the Northridge earthquake by setting up shelters, delivering food 
and water, and counseling those who have lost their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency has spent $40,000 so far and expects to spend up to $750,000, which 
would be more than has been spent on previous county disasters, Bolton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got disaster action teams throughout the county. Most have a minimum 50 
hours of training," said Mike Goth, director of the disaster response effort 
here. "When we've had a catastrophic event, they start acting." 
</P>
<P>
 When Goth arrived at the chapter's Ventura office at 6 a.m. Monday, several 
trained volunteers were already there. Immediately, they started calling law 
enforcement agencies to determine the damage and dispatching personnel to 
affected areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was real obvious the most damaged areas were Simi and Fillmore. By early 
in the day we had requests from those cities for shelters," Goth said. By 
midmorning, the shelters were up and volunteers were trying to get fresh water 
and food for the earthquake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our focus has been delivering service, making sure people are being taken 
care of," Bolton said. "It's testing us; there's no question about that." 
</P>
<P>
 Now that victims' immediate emergency needs have been met, he said, the Red 
Cross will move on to the next phase of its relief effort -- helping people get 
their lives back on track. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Red Cross teams surveyed damaged homes. By Friday, coordinators 
hope to have two service centers opened where case workers will meet with 
individuals and families and issue vouchers for food and clothing, which will 
be written to local stores of the recipients' choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "The voucher allows them to get exactly what they need," Bolton said. "It 
gives them a sense of control and empowerment." 
</P>
<P>
 Voucher money comes entirely from donations to the American Red Cross, which 
is not a government-funded agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Melinda Fernandez, the chapter's financial manager, said she anticipates a 
surge of donations over the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
 "This county always comes through," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The chapter is not actively seeking volunteers to aid in this relief effort, 
because it cannot have untrained people working at a disaster site, Bolton 
said. But it does need registered nurses, licensed vocational nurses and mental 
health professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the chapter is encouraging people to sign up for future Red Cross 
training sessions. Since the earthquake, 75 people have signed up, Bolton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people think a volunteer is someone who has lots of free time, (but) 90% 
of our volunteers work and do this in addition to their occupations," Bolton 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard residents Betty and Joe Jimenez have worked more disasters than they 
can remember. Both are members of the Red Cross National Disaster Team and have 
worked such disasters as the Loma Prieta earthquake and Hurricane Hugo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I go at least twice a year," Betty Bolton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Why would someone give up his or her hard-earned vacation time to travel to a 
faraway disaster? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's gratification, the feeling of helping somebody," Joe Bolton said.

THOUSAND OAKS OFFERS A DEAL FOR DEVELOPING SITE; GROWTH: COUNCIL WILLING TO 
EASE DESIGN STANDARDS. IT SEEKS $12 MILLION FOR FORMER CITY HALL TO FUND THE 
NEW ARTS PLAZA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks City Council, in need of $12 million to help fund the Civic 
Arts Plaza, has agreed to relax design standards on a key piece of city-owned 
property in order to woo wealthy developers. 
</P>
<P>
 Developers eyeing the "For Sale" sign on the former City Hall at 401 Hillcrest 
Drive will now be able to count on a grab bag of incentives allowing them to 
build residential, commercial or corporate structures on the steeply sloped 
parcel. 
</P>
<P>
 Buildings on the site can exceed the city's height limit of 35 feet, cut into 
the angled hillside, and bump out some of the lot's wizened oak trees. 
Developers also will be allowed to construct a parking garage and tear down the 
existing buildings, which were gutted several years ago to remove asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council approved the guidelines in concept Tuesday night and directed 
staff to draft documents detailing a development plan for the 30-acre lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "You give a little to get a little," said David Carpenter, a member of the 
citizens committee that came up with the guidelines and presented them to the 
council. "If you relax the development standards . . . someone might come up 
with a fantastic plan that would blow our socks off." 
</P>
<P>
 The council is counting on $12 million from the sale of the property to finish 
paying construction bills on the Civic Arts Plaza, which is due to open for 
government business in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing that the economic downturn has rendered that asking price 
unrealistic, the council on Tuesday agreed to hold on to the property for up to 
a decade, until the real estate market rebounds. In the interim, the City 
Council will try to lease the site to generate some quick cash. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can have a balance: a great project and some revenue for the city," 
Councilman Frank Schillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the council waits for deep-pocketed buyers, Finance Director Robert 
Biery is studying the city's options for financing the last eight or nine 
months of construction at the Civic Arts Plaza. The council will vote soon on 
whether to take out loans, issue bonds or shift funds from other municipal 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, however, the discussion focused on the best use of the Hillcrest 
Drive property, widely considered one of the most sensitive and visible ridges 
in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council agreed to focus its search on developers interested in 
building corporate headquarters, educational facilities, a restaurant, 
condominiums, an art gallery, a sports complex, a hotel and conference center, 
a museum or a cinema. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the right flexibility (in development standards), we might be able to 
coax someone out of the woodwork," Carpenter said. "If someone can bring us an 
imaginative plan for this site, they deserve to get cut some slack." 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 3 to 2 to accept the citizens committee guidelines for 
relaxed standards on the parcel. Mayor Elois Zeanah and Councilwoman Jaime 
Zukowski dissented, arguing that developers should not be permitted to breach 
city norms on such a prominent site. 
</P>
<P>
 On the same divided vote, the council agreed to study the possibility of 
purchasing Fireworks Hill, the 27-acre parcel adjacent to the former City Hall. 
Named after the annual Fourth of July celebrations there, Fireworks Hill is now 
zoned for commercial use. 
</P>
<P>
 Every council member has expressed a desire to preserve Fireworks Hill as open 
space, but Zeanah said she preferred to change the zoning to "protected 
ridgeline" rather than purchase the property outright.

SUIT CLAIMS PLUMBING FIRM DUPED CUSTOMERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura County heating and plumbing firm was named Wednesday in a civil 
complaint alleging that company technicians deliberately broke equipment inside 
customers' homes to increase service call rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit also alleges that John Mills Industries, doing business as "George 
Brazil 24-Hour Service Since 1955," engaged in false advertising by 
representing to customers that it maintained eight offices locally when it only 
operates one. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint further alleges unlawful business practices, including an 
allegation that service technicians were taught how to break heating and 
air-conditioning units and were urged to misdiagnose problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner John Mills of Camarillo, who already has been served with a court 
summons, declined to comment on the allegations Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mills "misrepresented that parts or repairs were needed, that defendants 
maliciously damaged customers' property and that they simulated and created 
problems so that they could sell repairs," the suit states. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel bad for all these customers that are losing money," said Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Michael D. Schwartz, who will prosecute the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor is asking a Superior Court judge to grant a preliminary 
injunction forbidding the company from continuing such practices. A hearing is 
scheduled for Feb. 10.

HE DOES WINDOWS; BUSINESS BOOMS FOR NORTHRIDGE GLASS INSTALLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 These are crazy days for Bob Dunn, the glass man of Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 His two crews have been replacing bedroom windows, sliding glass doors, 
picture windows, storefront windows -- windows, windows, windows -- from 7 in 
the morning until 8 at night. He cannot keep up with the messages on his 
answering machine. He is suddenly one of the most popular people in town. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunn owns Bullseye Glass & Mirror in Northridge. Really. That's the name. 
Bullseye, as in epicenter. As in broken glass everywhere. So who ya gonna call? 
</P>
<P>
 Bullseye. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the earthquake, on an average day, I might install six or seven 
windows," said Dunn. "I hardly had any calls on Monday. I think people were 
just trying to clean up. They were putting plywood up. On Tuesday, they all 
went, 'Oh, wow, we've got to get our windows fixed.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Dunn, whose business is small compared to some of the big glass companies in 
the San Fernando Valley, got more than 100 calls on Tuesday -- some of them 
from property managers reporting 10, 20, 50 broken windows. His three workers 
are installing about 40 windows a day. More calls streamed in Wednesday. And 
each day, he has fallen a little more behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've dealt with windstorms, with the riots, with fires, with all kinds of 
emergencies," he said. "But this is 100 times worse than all of them." 
</P>
<P>
 And through it all, Dunn has learned something about how people are coping 
with the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are taking it in stride," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 He plays back the answering machine. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need six or seven windows," a man says matter-of-factly. "Uh, we have some 
broken windows," says another. "I have a window broke in the living room. I 
hope you're not too busy." "Call us back or just come over. We have a couple of 
windows and a glass door we need fixed before the rain comes." "Hi, will you 
have a chance to possibly fix a window today, or tomorrow, or, uh, Friday?" 
</P>
<P>
 Almost to the person, the voices are calm, soft, as if they hate to impose on 
Bob Dunn's busy life. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunn is empathetic. Half of the glass in his shop shattered at 4:31 Monday 
morning. He is thankful that two crates of sheet glass that arrived on Friday 
had not yet been unpacked and thus were unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
 His own home suffered more than $10,000 in structural damage from the 
earthquake. Sections of the ceiling collapsed. The chimney is leaning 
awkwardly. The patio gazebo was shaken to the ground. And yes, there is broken 
glass. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dunn has not had time to work on his own place, or even to watch 
television coverage of the earthquake damage. He has been too busy. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his calls on Wednesday was to King's Burger on Reseda Boulevard. 
Inside, the quake's damage was still evident despite two days of cleanup: 
congealed, slippery grease had splashed onto the floor from the deep-fryers. 
The salad bar had toppled over. And there were, of course, the broken windows. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunn walked straight to the boarded-up window frames, measured them and gave 
brothers Peter and George Kalivas his estimate: $966. That's $7 per square foot 
for quarter-inch tempered glass, installed.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We can get to it in four or five days, Dunn said. The brothers Kalivas 
shrugged. Gotta have windows.  
</P>
<P>
 Dunn is not surprised that entire glass-sheathed buildings -- flash-cube 
buildings -- can survive an earthquake, while other windows come crashing down. 
It's in the engineering. Or maybe the broken glass wasn't tempered, he says. 
Tsk tsk. Or the entire structure was wrenched, twisting the window from its 
frame. Of course, there is another possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it's just fate," Dunn shrugs.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; CLINTON OFFERS WELCOME DIVERSION; VISIT: THOUGH 
WITHOUT WATER AND POWER, HUNDREDS LEAVE THEIR DEBRIS-STREWN HOMES TO SEE THE 
PRESIDENT. 'IT'S A SANITY CHECK,' SAYS ONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Mary Lisa Orth had not had a shower in three days and did not know when she 
would see water run out of her bathroom faucets again. But she left her Granada 
Hills home -- where "everything that can fall did" -- to come to the nearby 
intersection of Rinaldi Street and Balboa Boulevard in hopes of just a glimpse 
of President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sanity check," she said after pointing out to her 10-year-old twin 
boys the Secret Service agents who now stalked the streets. "How long can you 
pick up broken things? You need to get out of your house." 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,000 people -- many whose homes were a shambles, some still devoid of 
electricity, gas and water -- lined all sides of the intersection that rattled 
with aftershocks even as they waited for a glimpse of the President. They 
brought their children and dogs, binoculars and cameras -- when they could. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should have brought the camera," said Joyce White, whose house slid off 
its foundation, "except we don't have one that works." 
</P>
<P>
 For their efforts, most got no more than a glimpse of the President. A few got 
a handshake. The chosen got words of sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
 Office manager Darlene Horsley, standing on Balboa Boulevard, said Clinton 
"put his hand on my shoulder and told me about the freezing weather back in 
Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Pena, a College of the Canyons student whose family lives in Granada 
Hills, said the President told him: " 'God bless you' and that he felt for us 
and that help was on its way." As the President moved on, Pena was still 
boasting about his brief encounter and telling everyone how he shook Clinton's 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply being part of the crowd was a pleasant distraction, some said, because 
it allowed them to leave behind their nagging problems of damage and 
destruction for half an hour.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to have our own stuff to deal with for the next month," said 
Joyce White, who came with her mother and daughter. "But -- whether you like 
him or not -- he's the President." 
</P>
<P>
 Others wanted what Fred Rennwald described as "a glimmer of hope." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have earthquake insurance. Most people I know don't," said Rennwald, 
whose house moved six inches off its foundation and lost windows, showers and 
toilet tanks. "This is something where he can show people what he can do." 
</P>
<P>
 For many, there was a sense that this was a historic moment -- a presidential 
motorcade down an otherwise ordinary middle-class street that just happened to 
have suffered an extraordinary occurrence.  
</P>
<P>
 As Nikki Martin strode quickly along Rinaldi Street toward Balboa Boulevard, 
she dangled a camera by its strap in one hand and clutched the leash to her 
tiny Shih Tzu, Gizmo, in the other.  
</P>
<P>
 "I figured I should get a picture of this," said Martin, 20, whose home is 
filled with broken furniture. "I got pictures of everything else -- our home, 
the 118 Freeway." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton initially passed through the throngs along Rinaldi en route to a 
scheduled meeting on Balboa with a group of residents whose homes were damaged 
by the quake and a gas main explosion. Afterward, his limousine drove back 
along Rinaldi and -- to the delight of pleading onlookers -- made an 
unscheduled stop. At the Balboa meeting, Clinton spent about half an hour 
shaking hands with residents who had been pre-screened by Secret Service agents 
and meeting with the road crews working on the ravaged boulevard to thank them 
for their hard work and dedication. 
</P>
<P>
 One man standing outside his earthquake-damaged home told the President: "No 
water, no electricity, I haven't had a shower in three days." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Rosenfield, a benefits consultant from Granada Hills who was among those 
screened, said the visit "seemed to boost us a bit. The whole inside of our 
house is trashed, even my grandmother's china," Rosenfield lamented, doubting 
that any federal subsidies or loans could restore his sense of equanimity and 
the mementos lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Some onlookers were even solicitous of the President's safety. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Before he even got to the Balboa and Rinaldi intersections, he made a stop at 
the juncture of the San Diego and Simi Valley freeways. While he idled at an 
underpass on Hayvenhurst Avenue to shake hands, resident Dorothy McKeel 
worried.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he should be standing under that underpass considering all the 
aftershocks we've been getting," said McKeel of Sylmar.  
</P>
<P>
 At Balboa and Rinaldi, residents confined to the sidewalks by police and 
National Guardsmen strained for a glimpse of Clinton chatting with residents a 
block to the north.  
</P>
<P>
 "He likes this stuff," said Alden Chase watching with binoculars. "He's just 
hanging out with people." 
</P>
<P>
 Then the President made his unscheduled stop. The crowd screamed with delight 
as he got out of the limousine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bill! Bill! Over here!" shouted one plaintive young woman. As people on the 
north side of Rinaldi tried to run to the other side, Guardsmen barked at them 
to stay put and a few momentarily pointed rifles at the crowd.  
</P>
<P>
 Even the rest of Clinton's entourage had a fan club. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, Dee Dee! We love you! Keep up the good work!" shouted George 
Constantinopoulos as Dee Dee Meyers, Clinton's press secretary, walking behind 
the President, turned and grinned shyly at her admirer. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the highlight of my life!" said 14-year-old Gunit Bedi, a freshman at 
Chatsworth High School, as she dissolved into tears after shaking Clinton's 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone in the Valley was left with warm feelings after Clinton's tour. 
About 2,500 people had gathered at the Northridge Meadows apartment complex, 
where 16 first-floor residents perished Monday, in the mistaken belief that the 
President would visit there. They were sorely disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the heart of the catastrophe, right here," said Scott Bui, 20, who 
survived when the complex collapsed. "You have 16 people dead in my apartment 
building. I'm very disappointed that he did not at least show up. I'm just 
disgusted." After Clinton finally left the crowd on Rinaldi, people began to 
disperse. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Lisa Orth's neighbor, Sandra Keck, who had accompanied her, noticed the 
river of muddy water from a broken main running along the curb of the street. 
Both would be returning to homes without water. 
</P>
<P>
 "Take your last look at running water," Keck said.

<P>
 Wednesday morning, some of the children who'd spent their second night in a 
Reseda park were sneezing and coughing, their colds made worse by 
sleeplessness. 
</P>
<P>
 Their parents, waiting for free food and water, asked Councilwoman Laura Chick 
for help. "My little boy is sick with a cold," said one mother. Others told 
Chick similar stories as she walked down the line of refugees. They had camped 
in the park adjacent to the West Valley Municipal Center after being forced 
from their San Fernando Valley apartment houses by Monday's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 They asked for aspirin, cough medicine and other simple, over-the-counter 
medicines. A woman with a cold said she was allergic to aspirin. "I can only 
take Tylenol," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 I tagged along, recording what they said in my notebook, but wondered to 
myself, why don't they go to the drugstore? They've got cars. Aspirin is cheap. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as I listened to the tension in their voices and looked at the lines in 
their weary faces, I thought I understood. They were paralyzed by the week's 
events. So they stayed in the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Or as Councilwoman Chick said a few minutes later, "We are so used to life 
going on that when Mother Nature gets the upper hand, we are in a daze." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They were in such a daze, Chick said, they could not get themselves together 
to go to a drugstore, much less navigate their way through the procedures 
needed for admittance to a hospital emergency ward. 
</P>
<P>
 In normal times, Chick told me, these were people who coped with the 
mechanisms of life, with store clerks, hospital admitting desks and government 
bureaucrats. They are working-class men and women, white and Latino, who, for 
the most part, lived in the comparatively inexpensive apartments that line the 
Valley's main boulevards and many of its side streets until they were forced 
onto the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick turned to two staff members following her as she walked along the line. 
Get Tylenol here, she snapped. Get cough medicine. We need medical personnel in 
the park, not the hospitals. Why can't we get military medical staff here? 
</P>
<P>
 "I am absolutely determined," she said, "to get medical help out here." 
</P>
<P>
 Chick, whose own home was badly damaged by the quake, is a small, impatient 
person who seems perpetually wound up for action. She showed her impatience in 
the last election. An aide to City Councilwoman Joy Picus, Chick decided she'd 
like to serve on the council. But instead of waiting patiently for her veteran 
boss to retire from the council, Chick violated City Hall tradition, ran 
against Picus and beat her. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the lack of medical care in the park encampments illustrated a 
weakness in the city relief system. 
</P>
<P>
 It's based on the theory that victims will go to shelters and hospitals for 
housing, food and medical aid. "This is not what most people do," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In shock from the earthquake, they have sought safety and security from those 
they know. "I'm staying with my friends," a woman said, "over there in the 
green tent." 
</P>
<P>
 The people had complaints about businesses and bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
 One victim told Chick that she hasn't been able to connect with the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency. "I try to get through," she said, "but I lose them 
on the line." Chick said FEMA representatives would be on the scene in a few 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman said a nearby convenience store was charging $5 a bottle for water, 
and the same for flashlight batteries. Two others in the line told their 
stories of price-gouging merchants. Chick had an aide take down their names and 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The park we stood in was an example of bringing services to the people, 
instead of making them travel to some distant relief spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with Chick, the Shell Oil Co. put up a large relief tent and stocked 
it from the warehouses used by its service station convenience stores. 
</P>
<P>
 By late Wednesday, more than 2,000 victims were given food, bottled water, 
cleaning products, paper goods and other necessities. 
</P>
<P>
 National Guard troops and Los Angeles police stood by, keeping order, to avoid 
a repeat of the panic rushing of a food distribution center at another park the 
day before. 
</P>
<P>
 These people were like the pioneers who, in settling the frontier more than a 
century ago, created communities based on family, friends and neighbors. It's 
an old American tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 The grass-roots relief system being created in Laura Chick's West Valley 
district is part of that tradition. The city should do whatever is necessary to 
see that these hard-working, hard-hit people can regain their self reliance.

HOSPITALS HOLD UP, BUT SERVICES SHUT DOWN; RESPONSE: BUILDINGS WITHSTAND 
SHAKING, BUT VITAL INTERIOR SYSTEMS FOR WATER AND OXYGEN FAIL. THREE KEY 
FACILITIES IN THE VALLEY WERE EVACUATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 This time, the calamity for quake-stricken hospitals was not buckling walls 
and falling roofs as it was in 1971 when 50 people died in the Sylmar 
earthquake in the collapse of two medical facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 But in terms of lost hospital beds, Monday's earthquake was just as 
devastating: The county's hospitals lost as many as 2,500 beds, at least 
temporarily, at a time of critical need. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of filling up with injured people, key hospitals in the hardest-hit 
areas were being emptied. Seriously ill patients who had been admitted before 
the earthquake -- many of them elderly, frail people struck down in the flu 
epidemic -- were sent by helicopter, bus or ambulance to hospitals miles away, 
adding to the stress of an already thinly stretched rescue system. 
</P>
<P>
 Other hospitals were able to absorb the evacuated patients, but not without 
sorely testing Los Angeles County's hospital system. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike 1971, when the major problem was the collapse of hospitals, the problem 
this time was that while the buildings held structurally, their mechanical 
systems went into meltdown. Water mains burst, lines carrying oxygen into 
hospitals broke, elevators went out along with power supplies, auxiliary 
generators failed or were able to provide only limited benefit.  
</P>
<P>
 At three major hospitals, nearly 1,000 beds were lost when problems developed 
and hospital administrators were forced to move all their patients to other 
medical facilities. The three are the 439-bed Veterans Affairs Medical Center 
in Sepulveda, 257-bed Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills and the 
county's Olive View-UCLA Medical Center, with 377 beds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As of Wednesday, only Olive View had reopened and was accepting patients, 
although on a limited scale. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hospital Council of Southern California said Wednesday that only 300 
critical care beds are available in the county. "If we have any significant 
number of new injuries, those beds will quickly fill up and we will have to 
begin transferring patients out of the county," said David Langness, a 
spokesman for the hospital association. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen hospitals in the county had problems serious enough to force the 
closing of floors, wings or entire buildings. In all, hospital failures caused 
719 patients to be transferred out of affected hospitals and into safer ones. 
No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 "We pulled off a major evacuation with hundreds of people in such serious 
condition that they could not get out of bed," said Langness. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say that if the earthquake had happened later in the day, when parking 
structures and freeways were filled with shoppers and commuters, injuries would 
have soared and the failure of the hospitals would have been critical. 
</P>
<P>
 "One can say we were extremely fortunate," said Bill Iwan, a professor of 
engineering at Caltech and president of the California Seismic Safety 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Iwan said seismic safety experts are happy that there was not a replay of 
1971, when 47 people died as a result of the collapse of the Veterans 
Administration Hospital in San Fernando and three more died at the county's 
Olive View Medical Center when structures fell. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the failure of mechanical systems that led to the complete or 
partial evacuations of many hospitals was alarming. 
</P>
<P>
 "A number of hospitals didn't remain functional. That is a serious concern," 
Iwan said. "A hospital has to be able to function, to be able to take the 
injured. Those are critically important facilities in the community, as 
important as police and fire stations." 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Burt Margolin (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the Assembly Health 
Committee and a longtime resident of the San Fernando Valley added: "We managed 
to handle it this time, but we can't afford to have our hospital system 
contract at a time of crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, current earthquake standards are too weak," Margolin said after 
getting reports on the hospital situation. 
</P>
<P>
 State laws imposing stricter earthquake standards on hospitals began being 
passed in California after the 1971 Sylmar quake.  
</P>
<P>
 Margolin complained that they are too focused on the structural integrity of 
the buildings. "You want hospitals intact, but you also want their mechanical 
systems working so they can stay open," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But about 20 years ago hospitals contended they could not afford to meet the 
newer, tougher standards. One estimate was that it would cost $21 billion to 
earthquake-proof all of the state's hospitals. So hospital lobbyists persuaded 
the Legislature to exclude older hospitals and include only new hospitals or 
new construction in the law. 
</P>
<P>
 The Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development, which is in charge of 
enforcing earthquake codes on hospitals, estimates that only about 20% of the 
state's hospitals are substantially in compliance with the tougher standards of 
the 1973 Hospital Facilities Seismic Safety Act and subsequent laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspectors for the state regulation agency said they believe that the tougher 
standards make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Van Mourik, an area construction adviser for the state agency, said he 
could tell by the extent of damage which hospital buildings had been allowed to 
operate under the old laws and which had to conform to the stricter standards. 
The older buildings suffered much greater damage, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Mourik was a member of one of 12 teams of safety inspectors who fanned out 
through Los Angeles County on Wednesday to inspect hospitals to determine their 
readiness. At one point he passed under heavy pipes feeding into Valley 
Presbyterian Hospital and pointed up to them with pride, noted that they had 
held up. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's one of ours. It stood up," said Van Mourick, referring to the fact 
that he and other inspectors for the state agency had overseen the 
construction. "Now, if we could only get them to all do it this way, we would 
be in good shape." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Van Mourick and two other inspectors who worked with him decided that 
only two of three wings at Valley Presbyterian could accept patients. A third 
wing, built in 1958, was given a temporary restriction, pending further 
engineering studies of possible structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Olive View, the veterans hospital and Holy Cross each suffered major 
structural damage in 1971. Holy Cross and Veterans Affairs had to be completely 
rebuilt, while Olive View was forced to rebuild a major part of its hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 At Olive View, administrators said, the current problems were caused by water 
damage, temporary disruption of the lines that pipe oxygen into the hospital, 
and a malfunction with the auxiliary generator.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; QUAKE DROPS NEW WORK ON DEMOLITION COMPANY; 
RECOVERY: ANAHEIM FIRM HAS WORKERS ON THE JOB ROUND THE CLOCK TEARING DOWN AND 
REMOVING RUBBLE CAUSED BY TEMBLOR. IT HAS CREWS AT FIVE FREEWAY OVERPASSES.

<P>
 What Mother Nature starts, Roger Stull's company finishes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Earthquakes are our forte," said Stull, president and majority owner of 
Penhall International, an Anaheim-based demolition company. "And right now 
we're very busy." 
</P>
<P>
 Using track loaders, cutting torches and giant jack-hammer-like excavators, 
Stull's employees are working around the clock to tear down and remove the tons 
of concrete rubble caused by this week's temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Penhall is working on five fractured freeway overpasses, several hospitals and 
parking garages, and will soon clear the wreckage of the downed Jumbotron 
scoreboard at Anaheim stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to such work, Penhall is one of the nation's leaders, largely 
because it is one of the few that has experience working under earthquake 
conditions. In the past, the state called upon Penhall to remove debris left in 
the wake of the Sylmar and San Francisco earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 State transportation officials say speedy demolition of damaged freeways is 
essential to getting California's car-crazy public back on the road. Penhall, 
they said, is an integral part of that objective. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everyone recognizes that this a major priority because of the way it 
impacts California's economy," Caltrans spokesman Joe Shaw said. "We'll be 
working 24 hours a day, seven days a week to get this done." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said Penhall is one of four companies under contract with the state for 
the freeway demolition. The others are: C. A. Rasmussen of Simi Valley, C. C. 
Myers of Rancho Cordova and Granite Construction Co. of Watsonville. He did not 
know how much the companies were being paid for the work, but Penhall said it 
was charging the state $25 to $300 per hour for each piece of equipment and its 
operator. Each work site has about 12 workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Leroy B. Penhall founded a cement and masonry company in 1957 in Anaheim. 
Later, he branched out into concrete breaking, grooving and grinding as the 
need for such services arose in the fast-growing Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1975, the company was sold to Stull, who continued to expand the company's 
services, including earthquake cleanups. Last year, the company brought in $76 
million in revenue, the most in the United States for a demolition company, 
Stull said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, it was clear from the people who gathered to watch the 
demolition of the Santa Monica Freeway's Fairfax Avenue overpass that Penhall's 
work is desperately needed -- even if it isn't necessarily appreciated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care who's doing the work as long they get all this concrete out of 
the way," said Sammy Rollins, 42, who lives in the area and uses Fairfax Avenue 
to get to work. "It's an inconvenience." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Washington, 35, of Culver City said he came down to the Santa Monica 
Freeway work site to figure out how he could bypass the problem on his way to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I drive Downtown all the time and this could be a major hassle," he said. "I 
hope they fix it soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day, Penhall workers became unintentional media stars as nearly 
a dozen television news cameras documented their cleanup progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what we do," site supervisor Scott Campbell said, unimpressed by all 
the attention. "We just try to do it as quickly and safely as we can." 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell said the work is carefully choreographed to guard against injuries 
and cleanup complications.  
</P>
<P>
 "We'll want to eat through the concrete, break it apart," he said. "We don't 
want it to collapse. We hate that word." 
</P>
<P>
 As Campbell spoke, his crew methodically tore down, scooped up, and hauled 
away the rubble. Machines that are several stories tall punch through the 
dangling concrete, knocking it to the ground. Bulldozers pick up the heap and 
load long tractor-trailers that haul it to nearby dumps. Some of the concrete 
is ground up and used as base material for new cement mixtures. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been through this several times," Campbell said. "The circumstances are 
unfortunate, but the work has to be done. These are major freeway arteries that 
have to be cleared."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; LIBRARIANS READ THE WRITING ON THE FLOOR; 
CLEANUP: HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS -- MAYBE MILLIONS -- OF BOOKS FELL. AND SOMEONE 
HAS TO PICK THEM UP.

<P>
 Let's say, like most of us, you had a few books fly off the shelves during the 
earthquake. Now imagine what it's like to be Gloria Werner, with more than 1 
million volumes on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Werner is university librarian at UCLA, where there are more than 6 million 
books stored in 13 buildings on campus -- so many that she doesn't really know 
how bad the situation is deep in the stacks. 
</P>
<P>
 She just knows it's bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always a few books misshelved, but when we came into the University 
Research Library on Monday, they were piled three feet high on the top floor," 
she said. "It was just a disaster zone." 
</P>
<P>
 In numerous Los Angeles-area libraries, Monday's earthquake brought books 
raining down from the shelves. In older buildings, some of the shelves were 
twisted out of shape.  
</P>
<P>
 At UCLA, only a third of the books at the research library hit the deck, but a 
third of the research library's holdings is nothing to sneeze at. That's about 
600,000 volumes in need of reshelving. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the physics, engineering and math sciences libraries, all in 
buildings that have yet to be reopened because of possible structural damage.  
</P>
<P>
 "We think over 70% of their collections hit the floor," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 After three days of frantic sorting and shelving, three library buildings were 
opened Wednesday, and Werner said she hopes that all but physics, engineering 
and math sciences will be ready for business next week. Staff, faculty and 
student volunteers helped do the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Closer to the epicenter, the library at Cal State Northridge suffered broken 
windows, a collapsed roof and possible destruction of a robotic book retrieval 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 With the building closed to all until late Wednesday, it was too early to say 
just how badly the library was hit. 
</P>
<P>
 At Santa Monica College, head librarian Mona Martin found herself knee-deep in 
books and magazines Monday morning, with about 70% of her 100,000-volume 
collection on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 A call for help on the college radio station attracted 60 volunteers to the 
college library Wednesday. The volunteers were busily picking books up off the 
floor and stacking them so librarians could return them to the shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Santa Monica Public Library, about 350,000 books hit the floor. Efforts 
to restack them were frustrated by the discovery of possible structural damage 
to the main library building. 
</P>
<P>
 In Beverly Hills, library director Michael Steinfeld showed off pictures of 
aisles awash in novels and newspapers on the day of the quake -- then pointed 
to the neat aisles where librarians were busy checking that all was in order. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just hopeless," he said. "I thought we'd never open again," he said. 
"But the staff has been fantastic and the building already looks a lot better."

MICHAEL J. FOX TOLD TO PAY $104,386 DAMAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Superior Court jury awarded $104,386 in damages to a woman who 
bought a Studio City home from actor Michael J. Fox and then sued the movie 
star for landscaping and repair costs, the woman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Michele Ader said in a telephone interview that the jury ordered Fox to pay 
the damages after finding he breached a contract covering sale of the house.The 
same jury found that Fox had not committed fraud or negligent 
misrepresentation. 
</P>
<P>
 Drew Pomerance, an attorney representing Ader, had asked the jury to award his 
client more than $325,000 -- nearly half the $750,000 selling price of the home 
-- to replace 14 cypress trees and other landscaping and to repair a damaged 
pool, a leaky roof and a potential problem with the home's foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for Fox could not be reached for comment after business hours. 
However, one of them, Martin Snyder, told the Associated Press that although he 
disagreed with the verdict, "obviously, the jury felt that some of the repairs 
had not been attended to." 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder said he would consult with Fox to decide whether to ask a judge to 
reduce the award. 
</P>
<P>
 Ader said that in addition to the damage award, the actor will be responsible 
for her legal fees, which she estimated at $150,000.

LIBRARY TO HONOR NIXON'S INAUGURAL; POLITICS: PLANS WILL BE UNVEILED FOR THINK 
TANK FOCUSING ON EX-PRESIDENT'S PRINCIPLES IN FOREIGN POLICY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shortly before noon today, 25 years after he stood on the steps of the 
nation's capital and swore to uphold the Constitution, former President Richard 
Milhous Nixon will stand in the shadow of his boyhood home and celebrate the 
part of his past that was glorious. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid much fanfare and surrounded by memorabilia from his inauguration as the 
nation's 37th President, Nixon will hear accolades about foreign policy 
achievements, be hailed as the sage from whom world leaders now seek advice, 
and pose for a commemorative photograph with his former colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 And in tribute to Nixon -- the only American President who resigned after 
being disgraced by political scandal -- the Richard Nixon Library and 
Birthplace will mark the 25th anniversary of his inauguration with the 
unveiling of plans for the Center for Peace and Freedom. The think tank will be 
dedicated to Nixon's principles of "enlightened national interest in foreign 
policy and pragmatic idealism in domestic affairs." 
</P>
<P>
 Or as one library official said Wednesday, the center will use Nixon's 
"hard-headed, pragmatic, realistic focus on what can be accomplished, rather 
than what we hope to be accomplished" as a model for making policy on foreign 
and domestic issues. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,000 invited guests are expected to attend the event, which is closed 
to the public but will be broadcast later in the day by C-SPAN. 
</P>
<P>
 A fund-raising drive for the library and new policy center, which is scheduled 
to open in 1997, was boosted with the announcement Wednesday that the Annenberg 
Foundation will make a $5-million challenge grant. As of Wednesday, the "Legacy 
for Peace" campaign had raised $13.5 million of its $25-million goal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Annenberg Foundation is named for former Ambassador Walter H. Annenberg, 
who announced during a White House ceremony in December that the foundation 
would donate $500 million for U.S. schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the $25 million to be raised, $20 million will be used to fund an 
endowment, with some of the income used to defray the operating costs of the 
Nixon library, as well as programming at the policy center. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although officials say the library is financially sound, federal tax documents 
filed by the facility in November showed it had lost $1.5 million during two 
years of operation. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the only presidential library in the nation to operate without federal 
funds. In 1974, Congress refused to give Nixon the papers and tape recordings 
from his presidency, making the library ineligible to become part of the 
National Archives system until the law is amended. 
</P>
<P>
 Headquartered in Yorba Linda, the new policy center will establish eight 
endowed chairs -- six in the area of foreign policy and two focusing on 
domestic issues -- reflecting the primary focus that the Nixon Administration 
paid to foreign relations. 
</P>
<P>
 It is in the area of foreign policy that Nixon achieved his greatest success, 
Nixon observers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody would want to hear what he has to say (on domestic issues)," said 
Stephen E. Ambrose, a Nixon biographer and history professor at the University 
of New Orleans. "It was not an interest of his and certainly not a strength."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; HARD-HIT SANTA CLARITANS SCRAMBLE FOR 
ESSENTIALS; LOSSES: FOOD, WATER AND REPAIR GOODS ARE IN SHORT SUPPLY. CITY 
SUFFERS AN ESTIMATED $80 MILLION IN DAMAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Although stores and other businesses slowly began to reopen, residents of 
Santa Clarita still had trouble Wednesday finding essentials such as food, 
water and repair goods, including water heaters needed for their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials estimated that the rebuilding will take months, if not years, 
to complete. Damage in the city was estimated at $80 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every fire guy and sheriff's guy is saying it. 'This was the hardest-hit 
area' in the Los Angeles County territories patrolled by the two agencies," 
Santa Clarita spokeswoman Gail Foy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita City Hall, which suffered extensive interior damage, has been 
evacuated twice -- after Monday's quake and Wednesday after strong aftershocks. 
The city government has been operating an emergency command center from under a 
large tent in the adjoining parking lot. The future of the building is 
uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 City workers staffing telephone hot lines said the number of calls from 
residents was up Wednesday. "The shock is wearing off. People are beginning to 
expect more from us," Foy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency workers in the Santa Clarita Valley area, home to 160,000 people, 
still had no estimate on the number of injuries, although they did confirm that 
one man in his 60s died of a heart attack on the day of the quake. The area's 
major hospital, Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial, was open only to treat minor 
injuries, with major cases being sent to Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center, 
a city official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, federal officials announced that they plan to open a disaster 
assistance center at 1 p.m. today at Canyon Country Park, 17651 Soledad Canyon 
Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake shattered glass and cracked and crumbled building facades 
throughout the city, particularly in older areas of Newhall. Many makeshift 
wooden carports collapsed onto cars, although city officials said they knew of 
no residential or commercial buildings that had completely failed. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's large mobile home park communities were hard hit, with countless 
homes jerked off their foundations. At least eight mobile homes at the 
Greenbrier Estates Park were gutted by flames when the quake ruptured a natural 
gas connection. 
</P>
<P>
 Substantial areas of the city, particularly around Valencia, remained without 
water. Although residents elsewhere around the Santa Clarita Valley continued 
to have water service, they were warned to boil tap supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 All but about 1,500 customers in the city had electricity restored as of 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said it could be three to five days before all natural gas service 
is restored, mainly because Southern California Gas Co. workers will have to go 
house to house turning on gas meters that residents had shut off after the 
quake to avoid fires. 
</P>
<P>
 The commute for Santa Clarita Valley residents, and their neighbors to the 
north in the Antelope Valley, continued to be a major headache as they pondered 
how to cope with the crippled interchange of the Golden State and Antelope 
Valley freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's one of the things in the long term we're most worried about. It could 
have an enormous economic impact on the area," Foy said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even before two strong afternoon aftershocks shook the region Wednesday, many 
fearful residents had been sleeping outside in cars or tents, even though their 
houses were structurally sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "What if we fell asleep inside? We might die," said 16-year-old Florentino 
Garcia of Newhall, who spent the night in a car with his 14-year-old cousin. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the water problems, city officials worked with Los Angeles County 
to bring in five large truckloads Wednesday, distributing an estimated 30,000 
1.5-liter bottles to residents at five locations. Inmates from the county jail 
in Castaic were dispatched to dole out the water. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Guard sent two 5,000-gallon trucks to the valley. Most of the 
bottled water was snapped up within hours, and city officials were trying to 
arrange another five truckloads for today. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unbelievable," said Assistant City Manager Ken Pulskamp. "We got five 
semi-trucks. We're going through a semi-truck an hour. It's like we're pouring 
it into the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Through it all, residents appeared to remain in relatively good cheer, and 
many told of neighbors sharing needed items or otherwise helping each other.  
</P>
<P>
 Suzanna Tabjdi of Valencia said a neighbor, one of the few willing to stay in 
her kitchen for any length of time, cooked chicken fajitas for others Tuesday 
night and Tabjdi told of sharing a lamp with her neighbor, Lisa Gomez. 
</P>
<P>
 "We spent the night in the van. We don't want to go into the house," said 
Gomez, who was talking of leaving California.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; CSUN PRESIDENT HOPES TO REOPEN CAMPUS FEB. 7; 
EDUCATION: OFFICIALS MUST FIND ENOUGH SAFE CLASSROOMS BEFORE COURSES RESUME. 
THE UNIVERSITY AT QUAKE'S EPICENTER SUFFERED TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN 
DAMAGE. 
</P>

<P>
 Cal State Northridge President Blenda J. Wilson said Wednesday that she hopes 
the campus, which suffered tens of millions of dollars in earthquake damage, 
can reopen Feb. 7, a week after the scheduled start of the spring semester. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just need the earth to stop shaking," Wilson said during an interview in a 
canvas field tent that is serving as the school's administrative headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Wilson's plan to reopen the campus three weeks after Monday's 
devastating Northridge earthquake depends on a host of favorable circumstances, 
such as finding a large enough number of safe classrooms to accommodate classes 
for the school's more than 26,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still don't know how many classes will be available, but every available 
space will be used -- dorms, conference rooms, athletics, the Student Union," 
Wilson said. "If that's not enough, we'll rent offices. We'll find the space." 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake is the latest setback for Wilson, who came to Northridge in 
1992 from the University of Michigan at Dearborn. Since her arrival, the campus 
has been racked by drastic budget cutbacks and political and racial unrest. 
</P>
<P>
 She said her first thought after the quake was: "We'll never be able to 
recruit anybody to come to Cal State Northridge." 
</P>
<P>
 It is still unknown how long rebuilding will take and, more important, whether 
government agencies have the money to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of structural engineers have been surveying school buildings, including 
those that appear to have sustained the most damage: the school's 2-year-old, 
$15-million science complex, the seven-story Sierra Tower and the South Library 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 Scores of other buildings have broken windows, broken fixtures and wall 
cracks. And there is still no final assessment of the safety of several large 
buildings that appear to be stable, including the faculty office building and 
the Student Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said video crews are recording the damage to back up requests for state 
and federal aid to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 Asbestos cleanup crews have been working around the clock to remove the 
material from the school's engineering building. That part of the cleanup is 
costing $15,000 a day and is expected to continue through next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Hazardous-materials crews from the campus and the Los Angeles County Fire 
Department on Wednesday worked to clean up chemical and biological materials 
stored in the school's new science complex that were spilled during the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Campus labs have about every kind of material, from the very hazardous to the 
very safe, said Gerald P. Munoz, a county hazardous-materials specialist who 
was at the campus. "The chemicals are the worst, but luckily they don't keep 
very big quantities." 
</P>
<P>
 A fire on Monday burned the second and third floors of Science Building 2, and 
the quake appeared to have seriously damaged the outdoor walkways connecting 
the four buildings in the science complex. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The South Library building, which also contains the school's mainframe 
computers and the bulk of its electronic records, survived the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 But aftershocks and an electrical fire that burned Wednesday have left the 
building's future in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorraine Newlon, the school's director of admissions and records, said none of 
the electronic information was lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a backup system that had recorded all of the information on Saturday 
night," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 All but about 6,000 students had completed registration for the spring 
semester, Newlon said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest will be registered at Northridge with the help of computers at the 
Cal State Fresno campus, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once campus officials determine which rooms are safe, students will be mailed 
schedules showing where they are to report for class. Cal State Damage 
</P>

 Despite damage estimates in the tens of millions of dollars, campus officials 
hope to begin the spring semester Feb. 7, only a week later than scheduled.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; ASBESTOS IN DEBRIS CAN POSE HEALTH HAZARD, 
OFFICIALS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Health authorities are warning residents to avoid handling loose asbestos, 
which they may encounter in quake-damaged homes and offices or in sweeping 
building rubble from sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 Asbestos, which can cause lung cancer and other ailments, was widely used in a 
variety of building materials, including roofing and floor tile, pipe covering, 
and thermal and acoustical insulation.Although it is usually found in older 
structures, asbestos materials were installed in some buildings as late as the 
1980s. When torn or broken, these materials release tiny lung-scarring fibers

 Officials urged residents to use a certified laboratory to test suspect 
materials, and to retain a licensed abatement contractor if asbestos removal is 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
 If immediate cleanup of loose asbestos is required, residents should gently 
wet the material to hold down dust and carefully wrap or double bag it in 
plastic bags. Asbestos debris may only be disposed of in an approved landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 Those seeking advice on handling materials suspected of containing asbestos 
may call the Health/Hazardous Materials Division of the Los Angeles County Fire 
Department at (213) 890-4317, or the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District at (909) 396-2336 or 396-2327. Referrals to licensed asbestos 
contractors may be obtained from the National Asbestos Council, (310) 594 6316.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; LAND OF THE LIMPING -- QUAKE TAKES TOLL ON FEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLA CONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Throughout Los Angeles, there are hundreds, probably thousands, of them. Just 
look down and you'll see them -- the most common victims of the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Feet crushed by falling furniture. Feet slashed by shattered window glass or 
broken china. Feet fractured from panicky, pre-dawn leaps out of bed. By far, 
the lowest appendages were the most vulnerable body parts when the land 
underneath trembled. 
</P>
<P>
 Hour after hour -- all day and all night Monday as well as Tuesday -- men, 
women and children hobbled into emergency rooms leaning on friends and family 
members. In most cases, they hobbled out again with a pair of crutches and 
their foot swathed in sterile white gauze, joining the walking -- make that 
limping -- wounded of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Angelenos learned the hard way the rule of thumb in case of earthquake: 
Always keep shoes or slippers at the foot of the bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Those with slashed tendons or shattered ankle bones will be disabled for 
weeks, maybe months. Among them are Gunner Johnson, 33, of Hollywood, who 
suffered a severed tendon in a toe when an antique china cabinet fell on him. 
</P>
<P>
 Shellie Blackson, 23, of the Pico-Fairfax area, stepped on broken glass and 
split her foot open as she scrambled out of bed in the dark. As blood gushed, a 
friend remembered his first-aid training and fashioned a makeshift tourniquet, 
then rushed her to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Lucia, 29, of Canyon Country was trying to find a flashlight when she 
sliced her foot on broken glass. "I didn't feel anything until I got to my 
neighbor's house and turned around and saw a trail of blood behind me," Lucia 
said as she waited for her foot to be sewn up at Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial 
Hospital in Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 In most cases, the sprained ankles and torn tendons are minor and can be 
treated quickly. In some more serious cases of foot and leg injuries, surgeons 
are so busy that patients are being told to come back in a few days. Johnson 
and Blackson needed tendon operations, but they had to make do with a temporary 
repair job of stitches and crutches. 
</P>
<P>
 Even on Tuesday, the wounded kept limping in by the hundreds. 
</P>
<P>
 Some did not seek aid Monday but when their feet or ankles swelled, they 
sought help Tuesday and found emergency rooms clogged with others just like 
them. At Northridge Hospital Medical Center, several hundred patients were 
undergoing triage in a parking lot and waiting hours for their wounds to be 
examined and sutured. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the hours after the quake, the first patients who rushed into the emergency 
room at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center had suffered alarming problems such as 
heart attacks, said nurse Paul Johnson. But many of the 200 or so patients who 
followed during the initial 12 hours suffered lacerations on their feet and 
legs or sprained ankles, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The busiest health care workers were those equipped with needle and thread or 
manning the X-ray machines. 
</P>
<P>
 An emergency room doctor wearing tennis shoes kept dashing out to the waiting 
room at Cedars-Sinai repeating the same diagnosis: "Good news! It's not 
broken." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Record, 24, of Los Angeles was relieved to hear that. Her sprained ankle 
was sort of a silly injury, Record said, describing how she jumped up as the 
quake rocked her home, slipped on a comforter and slid across the wood floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was sheer panic," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that a leg or hip fracture can become critical if the victim is 
young or old. One victim of a leg fracture was 23 days old. 
</P>
<P>
 "Especially in an elderly patient, a broken bone compounded by this 
extraordinary excitement has to be viewed as a life-threatening event," said 
Ron Wise, a spokesman at Cedars-Sinai.

DRIVING; LIST SHOWS THIEVES LOVE GM VEHICLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An auto popularity poll has General Motors vehicles as its Top 10 cars. 
Unfortunately, it's a list of wheels favored by car thieves. 
</P>
<P>
 Top of the hit parade -- compiled by CCC Information Services of Chicago -- is 
the 1984 Olds Cutlass Supreme, followed by the 1986 Chevy Camaro. Three younger 
Cutlasses made the tally, with a 1985 Buick Regal in 10th spot. 
</P>
<P>
 There isn't a Mercedes or Lexus in the first unhappy 100. The highest-ranking 
import is a 1988 Honda Accord LX in 12th place. Nine of Texas' Top 10 are 
Chevrolet trucks. California's auto yeggs prefer Honda Preludes. And 75% of all 
stolen cars were built in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 Darren DiMaria of CCC has it figured out. 
</P>
<P>
 Few cars are taken by joy riders and carjackers. Thieving for export is a 
micro business. But as cars age, parts get scarcer and more expensive. And as 
GM sells more cars than anybody else, more GM cars are pinched for parts. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's also the interchangeability of parts," DiMaria says. "A fender from 
an '84 Cutlass fits the next three years of Cutlass. A Cutlass Supreme is the 
same car as the Buick Regal and Pontiac Grand Prix so fenders, wheels, engines, 
seats, the whole nine yards are interchangeable." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't buy an alarm for your 1985 Chevrolet Celebrity. It ranked the least 
desirable of 100 vehicles. PAUL DEAN

NOT YOUR BASIC PRETTY PICTURES; BOOKS: WITH A STUBBORN COMMITMENT TO PUBLISH 
ONLY WHAT INTERESTS HIM, JACK WOODY IS CARVING A NICHE WITH CAREFULLY CRAFTED 
COLLECTIONS OF THE EROTIC AND EXOTIC. AND THEY ARE SELLING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL HAEDERLE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When he was a boy, Jack Woody stumbled across a treasure trove of old 
photographs and movie stills that had been passed down from his grandmother, 
1930s film star Helen Twelvetrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Leafing through the sumptuously bound albums, the precocious youngster was 
consumed with curiosity about the glamorous actress who had taken an overdose 
when he was only a toddler. He found snapshots of her on an ocean liner with 
Ruth Etting and camping in the Sierras with Veronica Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was left to my own devices, as far as imagining what it was all about," he 
muses. "You're not sure what's real and what's not." 
</P>
<P>
 It was then, sorting through what he remembers as "a kind of Pandora's box," 
that Woody learned to dream. 
</P>
<P>
 As the head of his own Twin Palms Publishers, Woody, 38, is still preoccupied 
with dreams -- dark, disturbing dreams played out in the more than 50 volumes 
of photographs he has published in the last dozen years. 
</P>
<P>
 Bookstore habitues find a Woody-published book instantly recognizable. 
</P>
<P>
 It might be the work of a photographer such as Joel-Peter Witkin, who is both 
celebrated and reviled for his portraits of severed body parts and masked 
transsexuals, or a collection of post-mortem photographs taken during the late 
19th and early 20th centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Woody has also published the likes of Robert Mapplethorpe, Duane Michals and 
Herb Ritts, whose use of nudity and homoerotic images have generated 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the photographic style varies, each volume is suffused with Woody's 
own aesthetic sense, reflecting the fact that he does virtually all the design, 
editing and production himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The books share a spare, elegant design that sometimes borders on the severe, 
usually featuring black-and-white reproductions rendered in expensive gravure 
prints. Text, even by a Susan Sontag or Stephen Spender, is always subordinate 
to image. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm interested in issues of religion and sexuality," Woody says. "I'm 
interested in dealing with things other people almost would find offensive. I'm 
trying to say to them, 'Maybe you should reconsider. Maybe you should see 
differently.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Woody professes to have no taboos regarding the content of his books, save 
one: no landscapes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Landscapes don't interest me," he says. "I can't stand Ansel Adams. I can't 
stand Eliot Porter. I'm really interested in people. Portraits are my favorite 
form of photography." 
</P>
<P>
 Accordingly, he's made it his business to publish some of the most influential 
portrait photographers of the era. 
</P>
<P>
 Some early (and commercially successful) books Woody published were 
collections by Ritts and Bruce Weber, who went on to become household names for 
their magazine and advertising photography. 
</P>
<P>
 He also published mid-1980s work by Mapplethorpe and Witkin, then relative 
unknowns. In those days, Woody recalls, no one would show up for a Mapplethorpe 
book signing. 
</P>
<P>
 Woody has also assembled photographs taken by artists from other genres, 
including Allen Ginsberg's Beat-era pictures and Dennis Hopper's images from 
the 1960s counterculture. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Woody brought out director Gus Van Sant's "108 Portraits," a 
collection of large-format Polaroid pictures of actors, directors, writers and 
other artists. Posed against a wall without makeup or special lighting, these 
well-known faces begin in a strange way to resemble one another. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Sant, who shot the portraits over a four-year period, says he brought his 
collection to Woody after seeing his books. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's good -- he's got a really great eye," Van Sant says. "He's a 
perfectionist at what he does." 
</P>
<P>
 With a stubborn commitment to publish only what interests him, Woody has 
earned critical acclaim and garnered design awards while watching his 
publishing venture grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the acclaim, Woody is not tempted to join the publishing 
establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 As he writes in his latest catalogue, "In design and content we have settled 
on the periphery of American publishing -- our books condemned as pornography 
or celebrated as classics. Obsolete gravure processes and often controversial 
content let us remain as we intended, outside looking in." 
</P>
<P>
 Woody has been on the outside looking in for most of his life, yet in person 
he doesn't fit the image of the bad boy of the book-publishing industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyish-looking and sandy-haired in his sky-blue baseball cap, gray sweat shirt 
and faded jeans, Woody's all-American look belies his sense of alienation. 
</P>
<P>
 He is the oldest of four children. His father was a wildlife biologist and his 
mother a reading teacher. After moving around the West, the family settled in 
Albuquerque, N.M., where Woody attended high school in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 They lived in Paradise Hills, a west-side neighborhood that was geographically 
isolated from the rest of the city. A voracious reader from childhood, Woody 
found few kindred spirits in his overcrowded high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to refer to it as the killing fields," he says. "I couldn't get out of 
there fast enough." 
</P>
<P>
 He did well academically, but found his teachers mediocre and it became his 
calling in life to goad them whenever possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ended up being yearbook editor because the woman who ran it didn't want me 
to do it," he says matter-of-factly. 
</P>
<P>
 In a characteristically contrary move, he ran the school's first yearbook 
cover without a logo or title, featuring instead a photograph of the Sandia 
Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got taken to the principal's office for it, I believe," he marvels. 
</P>
<P>
 After he graduated in 1972, Woody hung around Albuquerque for a year or two, 
taking a few classes at the University of New Mexico before hitchhiking to Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 For a while he worked in a Hollywood Boulevard bookstore that was frequented 
by stars who maintained charge accounts there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orson Welles would come in, and Peter Finch," Woody says. "I had the art 
department. It was kind of the end of an era -- the last vestige of old-style 
shopping on Hollywood Boulevard." 
</P>
<P>
 He later worked at the Nicholas Wilder gallery. And along the way he met 
artists and writers and acquired a taste for expensive, well-made books. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, he published his first book, "October." The leather-bound volume 
combined a daily journal by Christopher Isherwood with drawings by artist Don 
Bachardy. 
</P>
<P>
 Bitten by the publishing bug, Woody founded Twelvetrees Press as a 
not-for-profit corporation in 1983 and Twin Palms Publishers as a for-profit 
business in 1987. The Twelvetrees imprint currently is dormant. 
</P>
<P>
 Woody says people advised him against publishing photography books and warned 
that he'd have to relocate to New York. He ignored the advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do have a very contrary attitude -- that things don't have to be the way 
people say they are," Woody allows. 
</P>
<P>
 He ran the business out of his home in Pasadena for several years before 
buying a small commercial building in 1987. He moved to Santa Fe in March, 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 With his companion and business partner, Thomas Long, Woody bought a 
90-year-old house in downtown Santa Fe to serve as an office. They furnished it 
with tables and chairs inspired by the 19th-Century English arts and crafts 
movement. There is no sign out front. 
</P>
<P>
 The staff consists of Woody, Long and two employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a lean and mean operation," Woody says. "That's one of the reasons we 
can afford to do the books we do. We have the luxury of being able to spend 
more money and make the book as nice as we can." 
</P>
<P>
 For coffee-table books, they are surprisingly affordable, ranging from $35 to 
$65. 
</P>
<P>
 Woody, who works mostly at home, spreading prints out on the floor of his 
living room, has no business cards or other trappings of power. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike its small-scale counterparts, Twin Palms has no distribution deal with 
a major publisher; instead, it sells directly to bookstores and individuals (it 
sends out 20,000 catalogues a year). 
</P>
<P>
 For whatever reason, Twin Palms books have found an audience, Woody says. 
"Often they're the most dog-eared, beaten-up books in the bookstore, because so 
many people look at them." 
</P>
<P>
 He believes that may be because he practices "old-fashioned publishing," where 
the product clearly reflects an editor's personal likes and dislikes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to do things I think are interesting, and we don't really worry if we 
make money," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Woody recently began publishing what he informally refers to as his "photo 
noire" series -- smaller, more affordable books that adhere to a general theme. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them is Diane Keaton's "Mr. Salesman," a witty collection of stills from 
industrial training movies made in the 1940s and 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 Another title in the series is "Ranch," by little-known photographer Michael 
Light. Set on one of the last traditional California ranches, it documents the 
brute realities of the cattle business. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a dream come true for me," says Light, who sent his work to Woody 
right out of graduate school. "I sent it to him absolutely cold turkey, knowing 
that he liked black-and-white books." 
</P>
<P>
 It was some time before Light met Woody. He was surprised by his youth and 
informality. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was expecting somebody who was 55, overweight and in a tweed jacket," Light 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most moving of the new small books is "Faces," by New York 
photographer Nancy Burson. Her sensitive photographs of children with 
craniofacial disorders evoke shock and compassion at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 Woody says he doesn't shy away from using photographs with strong themes 
because he doesn't want to censor himself. Yet he concedes, "Maybe for some of 
these books their time isn't now." 
</P>
<P>
 Amazingly, he's avoided most of the backlash against artists like 
Mapplethorpe, although, he says, "We get letters with those little religious 
booklets sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though his success as a designer has others clamoring for his services, 
Woody says he's content to continue publishing three or four books a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I look at these books, I'm constantly disappointed. They don't look like 
I wanted. I move on to the next in the hope it'll get better."

IN TOUCH WITH YOUR INNER SEISMOMETER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARI ROAN, TIMES HEALTH WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Do you feel that? Well, do you?" the woman demanded of her friend as the two 
sat, watching their children, inside a stuffy Red Cross post-earthquake shelter 
in San Fernando Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel all the aftershocks," the woman said, somewhat proudly, as her silent 
friend looked at the floor and strained to see the aftershock that she 
obviously wasn't feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is, you may indeed feel dozens of aftershocks from Monday's 6.6 
Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 And you may imagine a great many others. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts have no simple explanation for why people seem to feel a sense of 
imbalance long after the earthquakes and aftershocks are over. For some, the 
sensation is similar to seasickness. Others think they are feeling tremors when 
even the seismometers at Caltech are quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 One guess may be that people are more sensitive to movement after an 
earthquake. For example, maybe you never realized before just how your house 
vibrates when your three children and five neighborhood kids charge through it 
after school, slamming doors and banging walls. 
</P>
<P>
 "After a big experience, it really tunes you in to small movement," says Dr. 
Clough Shelton, a neurotologist at the House Ear Institute in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Clough says he knows of no inner-ear disturbance or physiological reason 
people would feel shaking after the quakes have stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a nice French phrase -- mal debarquement -- for the sensation people 
often experience when they disembark from a boat but still feel like they're 
riding the waves. 
</P>
<P>
 But this isn't that, Shelton says. 
</P>
<P>
 " Mal debarquement is from a persistent, rhythmic stimulation of the inner 
ear. It's a hallucination of motion when no motion is present," he says. "But 
an earthquake is so irregular and so short, I think it's more that people are 
just more tuned-in to small movement." 
</P>
<P>
 The sensation may indeed be psychological, says Robert Butterworth, a Los 
Angeles psychologist who spent Tuesday counseling traumatized victims of the 
earthquake at Red Cross shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure we are being hyper-vigilant," he says. "We have developed this 
little probe -- it's like another sense -- and it's sensitive to any kind of 
earth movement. Now that we have that sense awakened, it may stay 'on' for a 
little while longer." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Peter Swerdlick, a Sherman Oaks psychiatrist says he believes the 
sensation comes from memory; people are simply re-experiencing the shaking 
feeling through their memories. 
</P>
<P>
 "This experience is now stored permanently in our memory banks," he says. 
"Anything in the future that produces unsteadiness in any situation is going to 
reproduce, in many people, the feeling of tremendous fear and anxiety and 
trigger a flashback. People can actually feel the sensation again. It reopens 
the memory bank."

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: FORGET THE EARTHQUAKE AND AFTERSHOCKS. WHAT ABOUT THE

<TEXT>
<P>
 QUAKE QUERIES: Once Angelenos recovered somewhat from the shock and 
aftershocks of Monday's earthquake, residents immediately began calling their 
local police departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Some wanted to know where to find help or where to offer it. Others had 
matters of a different nature on their mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've simply been flooded with calls about the (Great Western) Forum," said 
Inglewood Police Sgt. John Bell. "People have been calling to find out why no 
one is answering the telephone." 
</P>
<P>
 The Forum, by the way, suffered no major damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell them I don't know why the Forum isn't answering their phone, and then 
they want to know why I don't know," Bell said with a sigh. "It's kind of tough 
to be patient." 
</P>
<P>
 One reason it's hard for Bell to make Forum chit-chat: He lost his Simi Valley 
home in the quake. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 CALLER KINDNESS: Southern California Edison in Torrance has good things to say 
about the callers on the line.

 With 30,000 residents lacking power at least until midafternoon Monday, 
spokesman Ted Porter was expecting the usual complaints following an outage. An 
outcry along the lines of "I know the CEO, and he's going to hear about this" 
is common, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't get that in this case," he said. "No one really demanded service 
immediately. They would just say: 'Fine, thank you, keep up the good work.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The quake, he added, "really brought out the best in people." 
</P>
<P>
 REEL LIFE: Like many other San Pedro residents, Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr. 
and his wife, Deann, found themselves airborne in bed Monday morning when the 
earthquake hit.  
</P>
<P>
 "I grabbed Deann and I grabbed a flashlight from the night stand and we ran to 
the doorway," Svorinich said.  
</P>
<P>
 What he saw in the living room, however, was scarier than being jolted awake. 
Bookshelf doors were swinging open, books were hurtling out and objects were 
flying around the room. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked like a scene from 'The Exorcist,' " he said.

 PENINSULA POLITICOS: Until now, Palos Verdes Peninsula politics have been 
humdrum. 
</P>
<P>
 Vocal? Yes. Of interest off the hill? Probably not. 
</P>
<P>
 Since September, there's been a spurt of interest in sending a peninsula 
resident to Washington by unseating Rep. Jane Harman (D-Marina del Rey), whose 
district stretches from Marina del Rey to San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, former Palos Verdes Estates Councilman Ron Florance said that he 
will enter the Republican primary in June. 
</P>
<P>
 So will Rancho Palos Verdes Councilwoman Susan Brooks and physician Irwin 
Savodnik. Savodnik works in Torrance but lives in Rancho Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
 Not quite a coincidence, political observers say. The peninsula is heavily 
Republican in the 36th District, which is split almost equally between the two 
parties in voter registration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, the incumbent (in the district) is a Republican," said Adrian Tatum, 
a spokesman for the Palos Verdes Peninsula Democratic Club. "Not too many 
Republicans would challenge the incumbent. Jane is the first Democrat in a 
long, long time. So there's a feeling that they need to get the seat back." 
</P>
<P>
 The peninsula may yet get another resident candidate, but she's not a 
Republican. Harman is negotiating to buy a house in Rolling Hills. 
</P>

 BILLIARD BLUES: Pool halls may once have been havens for sharks, but now 
owners are pitching their places to upscale professionals, families and the MTV 
set. 
</P>
<P>
 In Torrance, for example, plans are afoot to convert the Velvet Turtle into a 
National Sports Grill & Bar, which in other locations attracts a yuppie crowd 
to its pool tables. 
</P>
<P>
 That may be the trend, but not in Manhattan Beach. City planners still think 
that booze and billiards don't mix near residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the Planning Commission turned down plans to convert a former 
liquor store at 4005 Highland Ave. into Manhattan Beach Breakers, which would 
feature 14 pool tables, two game areas and one big-screen TV, plus an adjoining 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners objected to plans to serve liquor and keep the pool hall open 
until 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners of the pool hall, however, deny their establishment will attract the 
wrong element. They plan to appeal to the City Council. QUOTE OF THE WEEK

SOUTH BAY AVERTS MAJOR QUAKE DAMAGE -- BUT NOT ITS DRAMA; AFTERMATH: TEMBLOR 
OCCURRED WHILE A BIRTH WAS IN PROCESS AT TORRANCE MEMORIAL. 'WHILE SOME PEOPLE 
DIED, WE WERE GIVING BIRTH,' FATHER SAYS.

<P>
 While South Bay residents and businesses had their share of injuries, broken 
windows and power failures because of Monday's mighty earthquake, the 
devastation that crumpled buildings and freeways passed the area over. 
</P>
<P>
 Drama, however, did not. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment when the earth began trembling across the South Bay, Wendy 
Gonzales was giving birth at Torrance Memorial Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were really rolling," said Gonzales, 37, of Torrance. "A lot of things 
were falling. . . . I thought the building was going to collapse." 
</P>
<P>
 But Gonzales persevered, her husband, Eddie, at her side to reassure her, and 
Courtney Gonzales was officially born at 4:45 a.m. Monday, 14 minutes after the 
quake began at 4:31 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have any drugs whatsoever. I wish I did," Wendy Gonzales said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Gonzales was still reeling from the morning's events: "It hasn't hit me 
yet, what happened," he said Monday afternoon. "It's amazing, that something 
like this could happen. While some people died, we were giving life to a 
child." 
</P>
<P>
 Hospitals in the South Bay treated at least 153 people Monday and Tuesday for 
injuries caused by the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Two men died after suffering heart problems that are thought to have been 
quake-related. Their names had not been released Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 One victim, a 56-year-old Inglewood man, was taken to Centinela Hospital 
Medical Center at 5:10 a.m. Monday and died at 5:42 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 A Gardena man, 73, arrived at Memorial Hospital of Gardena at 6:02 a.m. Monday 
and died at 8:50 a.m. Most of those who flocked to area hospitals suffered 
injuries such as fractures, sprains and cuts, according to officials at 10 
South Bay hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 For many South Bay residents, the quake was mainly a source of inconvenience, 
as power, gas and water lines broke.  
</P>
<P>
 About 70,000 Southern California Edison customers lost power in the South Bay, 
but service was restored within minutes to about 40,000 households and 
businesses, said spokesman Ted Porter. Another 24,000 got power by 2 p.m., and 
service was fully restored about 6 p.m., he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents probably saw flares from the refineries lighting the pre-dawn sky. 
Company spokesmen said fuel lines were shut down as a precaution after the 
quake, and gas fumes were burned to relieve pressure on the lines. The fumes 
cause less pollution when burned, said Texaco spokeswoman Barbara Kornylo.  
</P>
<P>
 Burning took place at the Ultramar, Texaco and Unocal Los Angeles refineries, 
all in Wilmington. All three had power failures that stopped their operations 
temporarily after the quake.  
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake wreaked the most harm to the Redondo Beach King Harbor Marina, 
which suffered about $4 million in damage. A sand-filled roadway leading to the 
docks liquefied and heaved under the pressure of the quake, damaging cars and 
about six boats. Damage also was reported to streets and a parking lot at the 
harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Port of Los Angeles, the quake damaged two berths. A fissure developed 
in the asphalt at American President Lines Terminal at Berth 126 and another 
was discovered across the West Basin at Berth 146-147, said spokeswoman Julia 
Nagano. No damage to ships was reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Other damage to the port was minor, Nagano said.  
</P>
<P>
 At the Hawthorne Plaza, a 30-foot bridge connecting two parking garages 
collapsed during the quake, but no one was hurt, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The parking structure and the bridge had been closed for some time, the 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The former City Hall building in San Pedro, which is scheduled for a 
$14-million renovation in December, creaked and groaned, and the plaster fell 
down in spots, but the building withstood the quake, officials said. Libraries 
in Inglewood, Westchester, Harbor City, Wilmington and San Pedro were closed 
after the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the minimal damage in the South Bay, many residents have sought to 
join the quake recovery effort -- Harbor area Councilman Rudy Svorinich said 
his office has received numerous calls from people offering their help. 
</P>
<P>
 "While the Harbor area received negligible damage, but for the grace of God we 
might have been in the same situation," Svorinich said. "We are very empathetic 
with people in other parts of the city who have lost loved ones and are 
suffering right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Svorinich's office is working with the San Pedro branch of the American Red 
Cross and is accepting monetary donations on its behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 Donations may be made to The American Red Cross, L.A. Earthquake, 1499 W. 1st 
St., San Pedro, 90732, or they may be mailed to Svorinich's Harbor District 
office at old San Pedro City Hall at 638 S. Beacon St., Suite 200, San Pedro, 
90731.

REDONDO DRAWS LINE IN THE SAND OVER COUNTY PLEA FOR FUNDS; BEACHES: SOUTH BAY 
CITIES ASKED TO BOOST CONTRIBUTIONS FOR LIFEGUARDS, OTHER SERVICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Redondo Beach balked this week at a request from Los Angeles County for more 
money to help pay for lifeguards and groomers on public beaches there, and 
Manhattan Beach delayed its decision on the request. 
</P>
<P>
 The county Beaches and Harbors Department, which hires lifeguards for the 
beaches owned by the state, cities or county, is facing a $400,000 budget 
shortfall and requested an increase in funding from South Bay beach cities and 
the city of Avalon. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's 105 lifeguards watch over swimmers year-round on 31 miles of 
beaches, including those in the South Bay. City officials have said that many 
people other than city residents use the beaches, and that the county should 
pay for the services. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Hermosa Beach City Council reluctantly agreed recently to contribute 
$107,000 a year to help pay for the services, county officials were hopeful 
that Manhattan Beach and Redondo Beach would follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Redondo Beach council voted Tuesday against boosting its contribution from 
$140,000 to $200,000 a year. City officials there want assurance that all beach 
cities will pay their share, City Manager Bill Kirchhoff said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Manhattan Beach City Council, which had been scheduled to vote on the 
issue Tuesday, postponed a decision for two weeks to research the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Johnson, a spokesman for the Beaches and Harbors Department, said the 
county cannot guarantee it will keep the lifeguards at Redondo Beach unless the 
city increases its contribution. The county, which pays $603,000 annually for 
services there, has a month-to-month contract with the city, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the county's contract with the state, lifeguards will patrol the 
Manhattan Beach shoreline through June 30.  
</P>
<P>
 The county pays about $1.8 million annually to operate Manhattan Beach, one of 
the county's busiest beaches. The city contributes about $220,000 a year, which 
it collects from parking meters. County officials asked for an additional 
$200,000.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not in favor of giving the county money at this time," said Mayor Steve 
Napolitano, "and maybe never."  
</P>
<P>
 Manhattan Beach City Manager Bill Smith, saying nearly 5 million people 
visited the beach in 1992, added that since the influx brings the city little 
financial gain, the county should shoulder the burden. He recommended the 
council make a one-time contribution of $100,000, however, to demonstrate the 
city's goodwill. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Manhattan Beach) is not any kind of a gold mine," Smith said. "We don't have 
any hotels on the beach." 
</P>
<P>
 Avalon officials are expected to act on the matter Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 The issue of lifeguard funding ignited last summer when the county, facing its 
biggest fiscal crisis, announced it could no longer afford to provide guards 
and maintenance crews at beaches it owns. 
</P>
<P>
 Fees for prking and concession stands, and advertising on beach trash cans and 
lifeguard vehicles offset only a portion of the costs, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 They threatened to cut off service to city-owned Hermosa Beach if the council 
fails to contribute $200,000. City officials said the city pays nearly $300,000 
a year in beach-related costs, but agreed to pay for restroom maintenance and 
to allow the county to expand advertising along the beach, moves that are 
expected to generate $107,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 After the agreement was reached, the County Board of Supervisors voted to 
continue services at Hermosa Beach through June. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councils in Manhattan Beach and Redondo Beach fear the county will demand 
more money as soon as additional city contributions are approved. They say they 
will feel better about increasing contributions after the county develops a 
long-term plan for the beaches.  
</P>
<P>
 The county's policy guidelines on lifeguards and beach maintenance crews are 
expected to be completed next month.

LEAK AT ABANDONED OIL WELL SEEN AS THREAT TO BAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELE FUETSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An abandoned oil well in Hermosa Beach is leaking as much as 100 gallons of 
crude oil a week, and Terry Tamminen of Santa Monica Baykeeper, an 
environmental watchdog group, is trying to get it capped. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the next 90 days," Tamminen said, "we're going to have storms that are 
going to wash that oil into a storm drain and into the bay." 
</P>
<P>
 Local and state officials agree that the well needs capping to keep the black, 
sticky crude from oozing out of the ground and finding its way into the marine 
world. The oil, they say, is being vacuumed up weekly until a permanent 
solution is found. 
</P>
<P>
 That is not enough for Tamminen, who founded Baykeeper. He wants the well, on 
a vacant lot at Cypress Avenue and 6th Street, capped at once, and he took his 
crusade to the Hermosa Beach City Council last week.  
</P>
<P>
 "The bay," he said, "is one of the few shallow, protected areas along the 
Southern California coast where fish can breathe and other marine 
microorganisms can regenerate." 
</P>
<P>
 There is an abundance of plant life, such as giant kelp, in the bay, Tamminen 
said. "So, if you contaminate these fragile, shallow areas, you're basically 
breaking the lower food chain." 
</P>
<P>
 City and state officials say they are not responsible for the leaking well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oil wells," said Michael A. Schubach, Hermosa Beach planning director and 
interim building director, "are essentially a responsibility of the state 
Division of Oil and Gas." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman John Bowler said the city is "kind of between the devil and the 
deep blue sea for the moment." 
</P>
<P>
 If it assumes too much responsibility, Bowler said, Hermosa Beach could end up 
paying to have the well capped and could become legally responsible for the 
property on which it is located. 
</P>
<P>
 Pamela Morris, spokeswoman for the state Department of Conservation and its 
oil and gas division, said the state is trying to work out a cooperative 
solution to the problem with the owner of the lot and the well, Stinnett Oil 
Co., a small, private firm in Temecula. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really an issue for the operator," Morris said of the leaking well. 
Stinnett officials did not return telephone calls from The Times, but Morris 
said the firm has been extremely cooperative. 
</P>
<P>
 According to state records, Morris said, the well was drilled in 1930, 
acquired by Stinnett in 1972 and abandoned five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 When wells are abandoned, they are supposed to be securely capped under the 
supervision of the state. Sometimes, however, underground pipes or caps 
corrode, allowing oil to seep out. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Tamminen said, the area must be dug up to expose the shaft down to the 
point of the leak, where a new cap must be installed. 
</P>
<P>
 Tamminen says it could cost up to $100,000 to cap the well. State officials 
disagree that it will cost that much. 
</P>
<P>
 At one time, Councilman Bowler said, hundreds of oil wells were drilled in 
Hermosa Beach, but they began closing down in the 1950s. The councilman says 
this is the first time well leakage he knows of. 
</P>
<P>
 The leak apparently began more than a month ago, and may have been caused by 
early rains raising the water table and pushing the oil toward the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 A berm was built around the base of the rig to contain the leaking oil in a 
small pond, Tamminen said, but heavy rains could easily make the pond overflow. 
</P>
<P>
 Tamminen, who lives on a boat in the bay and zealously patrols the land 
looking for probable points of pollution, succeeded in persuading the City 
Council that the well presents at least one kind of danger. 
</P>
<P>
 The city quickly made plans to erect a fence around the lot after Tamminen 
explained how oil collects at the base of the rig. It gets up to three feet 
deep, enough to drown a curious child, he said.

CENTURY FREEWAY GETS HIGH MARKS IN FIRST QUAKE TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL GOTTESMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The infant Century Freeway apparently has passed its first tremor test with 
flying colors, Caltrans officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A preliminary inspection of the 3-month-old freeway found no stress cracks or 
other damage after Monday's magnitude 6.6 earthquake. The 105 Freeway has some 
of the county's highest overpasses. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans engineers said they were not surprised that the 17.3-mile roadway 
between Norwalk and El Segundo withstood the earthquake, while portions of the 
Santa Monica Freeway (10) buckled and an Antelope Valley Freeway (14) overpass 
collapsed onto the Golden State Freeway (5). 
</P>
<P>
 "We've learned from every earthquake we've had in California, and we've 
changed the design standards each time," said Caltrans district director Jerry 
B. Baxter. "The Century was built using the most modern standards, and 
obviously, they worked."  
</P>
<P>
 Baxter said the key factor is that additional steel bars were used to 
reinforce concrete columns supporting the Century Freeway's 12 lanes and 
numerous overpasses, on-ramps and off-ramps. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans began requiring steel reinforcement in freeway bridges and overpasses 
following the 1971 Sylmar quake, which toppled freeway overpasses. The agency 
is in the middle of a $1.5-billion reinforcement program designed to shore up 
bridges and overpasses with steel encasing. 
</P>
<P>
 Columns supporting the bridges and overpasses along the Santa Monica Freeway 
-- including the three that buckled and partially collapsed Monday morning -- 
were scheduled to be retrofitted this spring, Baxter said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least we knew (the Century Freeway columns) didn't need to be 
strengthened," Baxter said. "They are about as strong as they come, and were 
built with every safety feature we know of." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Baxter said, the Century is probably more seismically safe than many 
homes in the communities it traverses.  
</P>
<P>
 "People might be afraid to go back on the freeways," he said. "But most of 
them are living in homes that were built . . . when earthquake standards were 
virtually unheard of. If I were them, I'd rather be on the (Century) freeway 
when the next one hits." 
</P>
<P>
 The $2.2-billion highway opened in October and was built to serve as another 
east-west route for commuters, but Baxter predicts it will become a primary 
thoroughfare as drivers seek detours.

SOUTHBAY / COMMUNITY NEWS: REGION; COLLEGES TEACH ENGLISH SKILLS TO FIRM 
STAFFERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the Crown Sterling Suites, a 350-room hotel in El Segundo, some 
housekeepers start their day twice a week not by cleaning rooms but by learning 
English. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 employees assemble in the hotel banquet room for a course designed by 
El Camino College near Torrance, learning how to say everything from "good 
morning" to how to direct guests to local attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 Hotel officials arranged for the classes after receiving complaints from 
patrons that some hotel employees, many of whom are Latino, could not answer 
questions or understand requests, said Shar Franklin, general manager of the 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past two years, both El Camino and Cal State Dominguez Hills in Carson 
have created programs to teach English at area businesses. Among their first 
clients were Deutsch Metal Components in Gardena and International Rectifier in 
El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
 Debra Jonas, who heads Cal State's American Language and Culture Program, said 
businesses' need for the program has increased as the South Bay's Asian and 
Latino communities have increased. 
</P>
<P>
 The on-site courses are a source of revenue for cash-strapped campuses, said 
Laura Franklin of El Camino College, which charges $125 per hour for language 
instruction. Profits go to the school's general fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Crown Sterling, which has spent about $12,000 on English-language 
training in the past year, said the classes give employees self-confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Housekeepers routinely greet guests in English now, Franklin said.

SOUTHBAY / COMMUNITY NEWS: REDONDO BEACH; FREE WORKSHOP OFFERED FOR AIDS 
ADVICE, TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 People who are considering an HIV test may attend a workshop Saturday in 
Redondo Beach that will provide advice and an opportunity to be tested. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, titled "Should I Be Tested?" is the first in a series of 
workshops on testing organized by Women at Risk, a nonprofit group providing 
services for women whose condition has been diagnosed as AIDS or who have the 
human immunodeficiency virus that causes it.The workshop, funded by the Beach 
Cities Health District, is open to women and men. Ann Copeland of Hermosa 
Beach, executive director of Women at Risk, said that many people hesitate to 
get tested, even if they know they are at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are afraid that they are not going to be able to cope with a positive 
diagnosis," Copeland said. "But if people don't test, it's also risking other 
people's lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Panelists will include psychologist Alima Sherman and AIDS expert Dr. Gail 
Simpson, assistant clinical professor of medicine at Harbor/UCLA Medical 
Center. Stewart Sokol, director of HIV and AIDS program services at South Bay 
Free Clinic, will talk about the virus and its prevention, and several 
HIV-positive women will discuss their experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 The free workshop is scheduled from 9 to 11:30 a.m. at South Bay Hospital, 514 
N. Prospect Ave. Arrangements have been made for free, anonymous testing after 
the workshop at South Bay Free Clinic in Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Workshop reservations may be made, anonymously, if desired, at (310) 374-3426 
or (310) 204-1046.

SOUTHBAY / COMMUNITY NEWS: LENNOX; SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT UP FOR NATIONAL AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Supt. Ken Moffett of the Lennox School District, recently named California 
superintendent of the year, is one of four finalists for the 1994 national 
superintendent of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Moffett flew to Washington recently for a final round of interviews. The 
results will be announced at the American Assn. of School Administrators 
national convention next month. 
</P>
<P>
 In his 30 years as an administrator, Moffett has tried to make sure the 
schools he oversees adapt to an ever-changing population of children. 
</P>
<P>
 When he started as superintendent, the district had about 3,000 students -- an 
equal number of whom were white, black and Latino. Today, the core of the 
district's 8,800 students are Latino, and many are foreign-born, homeless or 
from single-parent families, Moffett told EDCAL, an education publication. 
</P>
<P>
 Moffett built up a bilingual staff, and as a result, more than 90% of Lennox's 
students are bilingual by eighth grade. Also, nine of 10 first-graders read at 
grade level, and more than 90% are promoted to second grade. 
</P>
<P>
 Another problem Moffett helped solve was airplane noise. 
</P>
<P>
 The district lies in the flight path to Los Angeles International Airport, and 
for years jet noise was an obstacle to learning. The district finally replaced 
the school's windows. 
</P>
<P>
 "After years of joking about jet noise," Moffett said, "Our new motto is 
'Lennox School District -- on the flight path to success." 
</P>
<P>
 The other finalists are from Utah, Illinois and Michigan.

SOUTHBAY / COMMUNITY NEWS: TORRANCE; LIBRARY BOOKS MAY BE RENEWED BY PHONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time, Torrance Library patrons may renew books by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrons may call the library on a touch-tone phone and use a new automated 
computer system to find a book's due day, renew it and determine if any overdue 
fines are owed. 
</P>
<P>
 The library expects hundreds of calls a week, said Norm Reeder, library 
programs administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 The system, which serves the city's six libraries, was funded with a $20,000 
donation from the nonprofit Friends of the Library.  
</P>
<P>
 In several months, the system will call patrons automatically when materials 
are overdue or requested books have arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Such calls will save the library about $6,500 a year in mailing costs, Reeder 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The number to renew books is (310) 618-2785 or 2786.

RESIDENTS ON LAND USE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Palos Verdes Peninsula Land Conservancy will survey area residents on 
whether the last pieces of undeveloped land on the peninsula should be 
developed or left open. 
</P>
<P>
 In conducting the survey, the nonprofit group is taking a cue from Laguna 
Beach citizens groups, which blocked residential development on vacant land. 
</P>
<P>
 They hired consultant Paul Freeman, who conducted a similar survey in Laguna 
three years ago that showed strong support for preserving part of Laguna Canyon 
by buying the land from the Irvine Co. Voters then approved a city ballot 
measure to buy the land with government funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palos Verdes Peninsula survey will be done by telephone beginning 
Saturday.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Martin Hernandez once dreamed of a life as a professional baseball player, but 
a gunshot took that away. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez, 19, a promising left-handed pitcher, was paralyzed after a drive-by 
shooting in front of Leuzinger High School in Lawndale last January.But now he 
will be able to compete in a wheelchair basketball league through a specially 
designed chair given to him Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 John Box, president of the Anaheim-based manufacturer Colours in Motion, 
donated the $1,700 chair in a ceremony at the Audrey and Sydney Irmas Youth 
Center on South Vermont Avenue, which operated by the sheriff's deputies of the 
Lennox Station. County Sheriff Sherman Block presided at the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to thank everybody that's out there that supported me when I was 
going through all this," Hernandez said.  
</P>
<P>
 Now in his second semester at El Camino College, Hernandez graduated from high 
school with honors in May, four months after being shot. He is a member of the 
Explorer Academy, which allows youths to work as volunteers at Sheriff's 
Department stations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Martin is an inspiration to the entire post," said Lennox Deputy Val Aquilar, 
Explorer post adviser. "The rest of the kids just look up to him in awe of all 
that he's accomplished."

SOUTHBAY / COMMUNITY NEWS: SAN PEDRO; POLICEMAN POSTS BAIL IN SEXUAL ASSAULT 
CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles police officer has posted $100,000 bail pending a Feb. 1 hearing 
on charges that he tried to force a woman at gunpoint into his car to sexually 
assault her. 
</P>
<P>
 At his arraignment last week, Raymond Gerber Jr., 42, a patrol officer in the 
Harbor Division, pleaded innocent to three felony charges stemming from the 
Jan. 9 incident. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12-year Police Department veteran was arrested at his home Jan. 13 on 
suspicion of attacking a 33-year-old woman in the 200 block of West 7th Street 
in San Pedro, said Suzanne Childs, spokeswoman for the district attorney's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Police traced Gerber through the woman's description of her assailant's car. 
The assailant was not wearing a police uniform nor driving a patrol car. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerber is charged with one count each of kidnaping for sexual purposes with a 
special allegation that he used a firearm in the commission of the crime; 
assault with intent to commit oral copulation with the allegation that he used 
a firearm; and assault with a firearm.

SOUTHBAY / COMMUNITY NEWS: HAWTHORNE; FUNERAL FOR MINISTER SHOT IN HIS DRIVEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Funeral services will be held Friday for a Hawthorne minister who was shot and 
killed in the driveway of his home by a gunman who stole his wallet. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Armando Marin Batres, 41, minister at the Spanish-language services of 
the Church of Christ in Hawthorne, was standing in front of his house on 
Jefferson Avenue at 133rd Street just before midnight Saturday when a gunman 
demanded his wallet, said Hawthorne Police Lt. John Beerling. 
</P>
<P>
 After a struggle, the gunman shot Marin and fled, Beerling said. Marin was 
taken to Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Marin had been waiting for his two teen-age daughters to bring them the garage 
door opener, according to Jorge Gonzalez, a family friend and member of the 
congregation. Marin's son, David Armando, 16, was with him at the time of the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, police stopped a man driving a vehicle that matched the one in the 
shooting. The police exchanged gunfire with the suspect, who escaped, Beerling 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marin, an emigre from El Salvador, joined the Church of Christ congregation in 
April after the church recruited him from Ft. Worth, Tex., where he preached to 
a Spanish-speaking congregation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a man of God," Gonzalez said. "He did just tremendous work. He 
always gave the idea that no one was better than anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Marin was new to the congregation, he became popular among the 
church's 140 members, especially the 55 who are Spanish-speaking.  
</P>
<P>
 "He was not a bully-pulpit kind of guy, but he was very emphatic and 
expressive," said Chris Graham, the church's minister. "He was a very dynamic 
speaker. He had just done so much in a short period." 
</P>
<P>
 Church members are trying to raise money for his family, Gonzalez said. "They 
are absolutely devastated." 
</P>
<P>
 Marin is survived by his wife, Daysi; son, David, and daughters, Daysi and 
Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
 The funeral will be at 7 p.m. at Douglass & Dunaway Mortuary at 4286 W. 
Broadway in Hawthorne.

AN UNEASY PEACE; SMALL DEFENSE CONTRACTORS HAVE A TOUGH TIME COMPETING WITH THE 
BIG GUNS FOR GOVERNMENT DOLLARS IN A BRAVE NEW WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In cramped quarters almost hidden in a Torrance industrial park, Polar Power 
Inc. has slugged it out for years against the big guns of aerospace, hoping to 
land the elusive military contract. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been no easy task. Mounds of paperwork are stacked on President Arthur D. 
Sams' desk, and he spends hours on the phone trying to convince military 
officials that his company's generators are the best available for submarines 
and aircraft.  
</P>
<P>
 So when the Clinton Administration launched a grant program last summer to 
help defense contractors convert their technology to civilian use, Polar Power 
jumped at the chance. The company teamed up with Martin Marietta Corp. to seek 
a grant for production of an electric generator to charge batteries in 
low-emission vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant would have allowed Sams to give his 15 employees long-delayed raises 
and add as many as 20 workers to the payroll. Most important, it would have 
been a giant leap into the commercial marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 But the big guns, Sams says, came out ahead again. After Martin Marietta won 
the $1.1-million grant, the defense giant chose another company to supply the 
generator parts.  
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is, everyone says that it will be the small businesses that 
will create jobs," Sams said. "But it is hard to compete with the big guys, 
with their bid and proposal machines." 
</P>
<P>
 When the winners were announced late last year, President Clinton hailed the 
program, called the Technology Reinvestment Project, as a way to stimulate 
innovation that would lead to new jobs.  
</P>
<P>
 But in the South Bay, the federal program has come under fire for giving most 
of the grants to giants like TRW, Hughes Aircraft, Northrop and Allied Signal 
Aerospace, while bypassing smaller firms.  
</P>
<P>
 The Technology Reinvestment Project "is not going to be the answer," said 
Rohit Shukla, director of aerospace and high-technology business for Los 
Angeles County Economic Development Corp., a nonprofit group that promotes 
business growth. "It is a boondoggle of a program." 
</P>
<P>
 But advocates say many complaints about the program come from companies whose 
names were not among the winners. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't pork; it's merit," said John Chernesky, executive director of the 
California Manufacturing Technology Center at El Camino College, which won a 
$1.5-million grant to help small- and medium-sized businesses convert to 
commercial markets and improve their production. "It was based on the ability 
to provide and deliver a product in a timely and efficient manner," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In many cases, grants went to projects proposed by dozens of companies, large 
and small, or to research institutions such as UCLA and Cal State Long Beach. 
Such efforts, while led by big aerospace firms, often involve smaller 
companies, Chernesky said. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the technology center helped Ace Clearwater Enterprises, a 
Torrance defense contractor with 170 employees, perfect techniques to increase 
its production of aircraft components for Boeing. 
</P>
<P>
 And some small businesses won grants on their own. Hi-Shear Technology won 
$800,000 to develop a lightweight, more powerful version of the Jaws of Life, a 
device paramedics use to cut open cars when rescuing accident victims. Called 
the Live-Shear, it will be developed with the Torrance Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Spencer, a member of Hi-Shear's product design team, came up with the 
idea for Live-Shear after watching a television episode of "Rescue 911." Within 
days, the company was adapting the pyrotechnics used to create missile and 
military aircraft components. The result: a tool that rips through a car's 
metal frame in milliseconds. 
</P>
<P>
 The 110-employee company has shifted to such products in the wake of defense 
cutbacks. It has lost about a third of its work force in the past three years 
and a large chunk of its factory space is vacant so budgets are tight. 
</P>
<P>
 When traveling to meet potential customers, Spencer and designer Walt Smith 
always took the Continental Airlines "old-timer's" special, which offers 
reduced air fares for those 55 and older. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can be more efficient, lower cost, and more flexible in executing the 
product (than a larger company)," said Don Novotny, Hi-Shear's vice president 
for business development. 
</P>
<P>
 Large military contractors, however, have more money to spend to get the 
grants.  
</P>
<P>
 Northrop applied for two dozen grants for projects ranging from a lightweight 
electric vehicle to a sophisticated monitoring system to measure toxic 
emissions. It won for two projects: It is part of the team working with TRW on 
developing a precision laser for manufacturing, and another team will assist 
UCLA in a transportation engineering program. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, about $415 million has been awarded nationwide, with another $50 
million to be announced later this month. Applicants had to prove they could 
finance at least half of their projects, and the government would generally 
pick up the tab for the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant winners include four South Bay proposals to finance $54.5 million in 
projects. In addition, $16.8 million in projects led by companies and nonprofit 
institutions elsewhere will utilize the work of four South Bay companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The projects are being developed in an area hard hit by cuts in military 
spending. Since 1989, the South Bay has lost about 63,100 jobs, many in 
defense-related areas such as the manufacture of missiles, space vehicles, 
instruments and electronic components. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, South Bay firms collected about one-fifth of grant money awarded to 
projects in the state. But some aerospace experts doubt that will make up for 
the loss of jobs because it remains uncertain how viable many of the new 
ventures will be or how long the companies will continue them after federal 
funds run out.  
</P>
<P>
 Northrop, for example, probably will not pursue many of the proposals that 
didn't win federal grants, said spokesman Terry Clawson. 
</P>
<P>
 "The company's philosophy is, 'We're only going to explore (defense 
conversion) when it makes sense economically and when we can partner with 
experts in the field," Clawson said. 
</P>
<P>
 At some of the South Bay's other large aerospace firms, executives said they 
have made inroads in conversion efforts, independent of the government program. 
</P>
<P>
 At TRW, for example, military aircraft sensors have been adapted to detect an 
accident and inflate auto air bags.  
</P>
<P>
 Hughes Aircraft created a DirecTv subsidiary that is investing almost $600 
million to launch a satellite television service scheduled to start in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes' strategy has been to create subsidiaries with managers who have 
extensive commercial experience. DirecTv includes former executives from ESPN, 
NBC and the Disney Channel. 
</P>
<P>
 "We placed people in a totally different environment, with full autonomy," 
Currie said. "You have to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 But smaller companies find it difficult to compete. Dyna-Cam Industries in 
Redondo Beach spent $30,000 trying to get a $3-million grant to modify an 
aircraft engine for use in trucks and buses to help reduce emissions. It was 
turned down. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were a perfect example of a company for that program," said Dennis Palmer, 
former sales representative for engine manufacturer Detroit Diesel. He and his 
sister, Patricia Wilks, operate the company from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we had no idea that instead (federal officials) would just go ahead and 
fund their billion-dollar brothers." 
</P>
<P>
 Dyna-Cam's grant proposal was backed by about $400,000 in matching funds from 
private investors, some of their vendors and the state's Office of Competitive 
Technology, which has a program to help small businesses meet the federal 
program requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer and Wilks said they planned to use the grant to hire as many as 300 
employees. Because of lower salaries and less overhead, smaller firms like 
theirs would be able to hire more employees than larger companies, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Money to us means that jobs will materialize directly out of it," said Wilks, 
formerly a schoolteacher and an office manager for North American Rockwell. 
</P>
<P>
 Dyna-Cam's venture was not a total loss. Its production plans for a cleaner 
engine earned it a $500,000 grant from the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District. And a private investment group recently pledged another $500,000. The 
funding will allow the company to proceed with a scaled-down engine project. 
</P>
<P>
 Torrance-based Polar Power Inc. intends to go ahead with its product as well. 
Sams hopes to find private firms to finance the development of the generator 
components for hybrid vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 His company, he said, is better suited to keep down the cost of the generator 
components. Wages are lower at Polar Power than at larger companies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Quality-control manager Ana Fisette moved to Polar Power after she was laid 
off from Fairchild Industries in Manhattan Beach in 1991. At Fairchild, her 
annual salary was $40,664. At Polar Power, it is $24,680. 
</P>
<P>
 She said her family would have lost its home had she not taken the job. "We 
really haven't adjusted to it," she said. "That's a drastic cut. But I'm 
starting to accept the fact now." Hours are longer at Polar Power, but there is 
greater flexibility in her new job. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have 50 different processes to make sure a part is fine," Fisette 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such bureaucracy, Sams said, makes the larger firms less efficient. That makes 
it all the more perplexing why they got the bulk of the awards, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a small company or a commercial company, you learn how to make your 
dollars stretch," Sams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Directors of the federal program said they knew small businesses would have 
trouble competing for the grants. So $20 million has been set aside for a 
separate grant program for them. The winners have yet to be announced. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is more to be done to urge them into the program and we're going to do 
that . . . " said Lee Buchanan of the Advanced Research Projects Agency, which 
is spearheading the federal program.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, there are benefits to giving the grants to larger companies, supporters 
of the federal program said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These companies are motivated by government contracts. It's all they've known 
all of their lives," said Steve Jarvis, director of the state's Office of 
Competitive Technology. The government grants are an incentive for companies to 
apply their technology beyond Pentagon projects and take a look at other 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an experiment," Jarvis said. "You might not be able to do a lot with the 
money, but at least it will stimulate some new ideas." Defense Conversion Grant 
Winners South Bay companies have won four Technology Reinvestment Project 
grants from the federal government to help finance $54.5 million in projects. 
The grants to help defense contractors convert technology to civilian use 
include:  
</P>
<P>
 * Hi-Shear Technology Corp. of Torrance, for a $1.5-million project to develop 
a lightweight, more powerful Jaws of Life, which firefighters use to cut open 
cars to rescue accident victims.  
</P>
<P>
 * Magnavox Electronics Systems Co. of Torrance, along with U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers and Caterpillar Inc. in Peoria, Ill., for a $17.7-million project to 
develop satellite guidance systems for construction projects such as highways 
and dams. 
</P>
<P>
 * TRW Space and Electronics Group in Redondo Beach, along with Northrop Corp. 
-- which has plants in Hawthorne and El Segundo -- and 23 other partners, for a 
$33.8-million project to develop laser machine tools for drilling, welding and 
cutting on assembly lines. 
</P>
<P>
 * California Manufacturing Technology Center in Torrance, along with El Camino 
College and the state Trade and Commerce Agency, for a $1.5-million program to 
help defense contractors shift to commercial products. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies or nonprofit institutions outside the South Bay will lead $16.8 
million in projects that include local firms. They are:

POLITICS: RESIDENCY ISSUE IN ROLLING HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Susan Brooks has once again raised the non-issue of living in the gated 
community of Rolling Hills. (South Bay Edition, Jan. 7) It may be of some 
interest where a candidate lives, but I don't believe it to be anybody's 
business but the mortgage holder. 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly, this unreal, insulated community is the home of Robert Virtue, an 
announced key campaign adviser to Brooks, a congressional hopeful. I dare say, 
he will live a scant quarter of an unreal mile from Congresswoman Jane Harman. 
It would seem that Brooks wants to have it both ways, to stigmatize the 
residents of Rolling Hills as unreal elitists, yet to employ and seek support 
from the residents.  
</P>
<P>
 I would not penalize Brooks in the voting booth on the basis of where she 
chooses to live. However, her misassessment of this issue as being key in the 
upcoming campaign might indicate that sour grapes is the most she has to offer.

FOOTBALL: BANNING FAN OFFERS SUPPORT FOR COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I recently read in your newspaper some vocal opinions (Dec. 23) regarding the 
status of Banning High School's football program. It appears the Banning 
Booster Club is intent upon changing their head football coach and is using the 
media to vent their frustrations. 
</P>
<P>
 I realize football at Banning High is taken very seriously, but aren't some of 
the statements and concerns of these supporters a little extreme and 
overzealous? I thought the proper term for these young men was student athlete. 
It appears the "student" aspect of sports has been lost among some supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, football is a positive activity for these young men. It builds 
self-esteem, confidence and a sense of teamwork, all important qualities for 
young people to possess. 
</P>
<P>
 It appears Coach Ed Paculba's only mistake is that he has posted a 12-10 
record in two seasons at Banning. If his only "crime" is not winning more games 
than the booster club wants, there would appear to be no court in the land 
which would find him guilty of some heinous act. Nowhere do we hear charges of 
the coach abusing his players or teaching them unethical tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, kids may have changed, but the old adage our parents and grandparents 
taught us should still stand, "It's not if you win or lose, it's how you play 
the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Let's hope the boosters are as vociferous in voicing their concerns about a 
mediocre teacher as they are about a coach with a winning record.

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: SEAFOOD BRINGS WAVES OF DINERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL KRIKORIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For seven years, the Wilmington restaurant known as Irene's struggled along 
serving the usual Mexican tacos, burritos and combination plates. Then chef and 
owner Irene Martinez switched to a seafood menu, and business has been good 
ever since. It's easy to understand why. In terms of quality and quantity, 
Irene's is a fine choice for shrimp, oysters, abalone and lobster. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez learned to cook while growing up in Mexico. As the eldest of eight 
children, she assumed responsibility for her family's kitchen at the age of 15, 
when her mother died.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1966 she moved to California and took a factory job. The tamales she 
occasionally brought her co-workers earned such a reputation that the catering 
truck started buying them. But it wasn't until 13 years later that she saved 
enough to open Irene's on Pacific Coast Highway -- a small, brightly decorated 
establishment still run entirely by the Martinez family. Through a window, 
diners can see Irene scurrying about the cramped kitchen, preparing her 
specialties. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most popular order here is the caldo de siete mares ($9), a thin 
fish broth flavored with onions and cilantro and absolutely loaded with seven 
varieties of seafood: shrimp, crab legs, abalone, mussels, oysters, red snapper 
and octopus. In fact, there's so much seafood that if you order it to go, 
you'll get an additional container -- it won't all fit in the soup. For a cold 
version of this seafood mix, try vuelve a la vida ($9). 
</P>
<P>
 Abalone soup ($8), oysters on the half shell ($8 for 13) and shrimp cocktail 
($7) are also popular. 
</P>
<P>
 Shrimp are prepared in eight ways, including camarones rancheros ($7), with 
tomatoes, onion, and bell peppers, and camarones al mojo de ajo , ($7), in 
garlic sauce. Like all entrees, these come with rice, beans, and salad. 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, Irene's isn't just for fish lovers. The carne asada tacos and 
carnitas burritos are still available. 
</P>
<P>
 Irene's is at 1419 E. Pacific Coast Highway, Wilmington. (310) 830-7315. Open 
8 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. daily.

 FEEDING THE BEARS 
</P>
<P>
 Offensive linemen John Welbourn of Peninsula High and Tate McCallister of Mira 
Costa, two of the South Bay's top college football prospects, have given 
unwritten commitments to attend California. 
</P>
<P>
 Welbourn, a 6-foot-6, 275-pound senior, made his decision after returning home 
from a recruiting trip to USC last weekend. Although he grew up a Trojan fan 
and his father attended USC, Welbourn said Cal made him feel more wanted. He 
visited Berkeley early in December. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was impressed with (USC Coach) John Robinson and I probably would have gone 
(to USC), but I didn't get the feeling I would be a high-profile player there," 
Welbourn said. "Cal really came after me. The other deciding factor was 
academics. They're not just a bunch of dumb jocks (at Cal)." 
</P>
<P>
 Welbourn, who scored 1,030 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test, also visited 
Nebraska. He said he might cancel a scheduled trip to UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Some speculated that Welbourn would choose USC because of his friendship with 
Trojan freshman fullback Taso Papadakis, a former Peninsula standout. 
</P>
<P>
 "As much as I would have liked to play with Taso for three or four years, I 
couldn't let that cloud my decision," Welbourn said. "I talked it over with my 
family, and we all felt the best decision was to go to Cal." 
</P>
<P>
 McCallister, a 6-4, 265-pound senior whose line play helped Mira Costa win the 
Southern Section Division VII title, committed to Cal during a recruiting trip 
last weekend. He chose the Golden Bears over Oregon, which he visited two weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just the best combination of academics and a quality Division I 
program," McCallister said of Cal. "I really fell in love with it up there. I 
liked the coaches and the guys on the team. It seems like a place I could be 
comfortable at in the next four or five years." 
</P>
<P>
 Welbourn and McCallister were named to The Times' South Bay All-Star team, and 
Welbourn was selected area lineman of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Prep seniors can officially commit to colleges starting Feb. 2, the first day 
of the national letter of intent signing period. ANOTHER ROUTE 
</P>
<P>
 Redondo running back Bob Cracknell led the area in rushing last season with 
1,709 yards, but interest from Division I colleges has been minimal. 
</P>
<P>
 If a late Division I offer doesn't materialize, Cracknell hopes to put his 
good grades to use by attending an Ivy League school. 
</P>
<P>
 Cracknell said he is looking at Columbia and Brown with the idea of playing 
football in a demanding academic environment. He recently broke 1,000 on his 
second SAT, the minimum score required for admission to an Ivy League school. 
</P>
<P>
 Walt Cracknell said his son is intrigued by the idea of playing on a team 
where all the linemen have SAT scores over 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Odds are they don't botch many blocking assignments. SHOWDOWN BY THE SEA 
</P>
<P>
 First place in the Ocean League will be at stake when Redondo plays host to 
rival Mira Costa at 7:30 Friday night in a boys' basketball game. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams feature outstanding guards. 
</P>
<P>
 Redondo is led by the senior threesome of Morgan Ensberg, Cecil Fletcher and 
Damani Washington, who combined for 48 points Friday in an 83-73 victory over 
Morningside. The Sea Hawks also have Tremaine Mayeaux, a talented sophomore who 
is beginning to come back from a leg injury suffered in football. 
</P>
<P>
 Mira Costa boasts perhaps the area's best guard in University of Hawaii-bound 
senior Shane Willis, who had 25 points Friday in a 51-44 victory over Culver 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior depth gives Redondo the edge. GUARDS GALORE 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop Montgomery's senior backcourt of Kareem Mutrie and Jayson Sanders has 
helped keep the Knights near the top of the Mission League standings. 
</P>
<P>
 Mutrie, who signed with the University of San Diego, scored a game-high 27 
points and Sanders added 15 to lead Bishop Montgomery over Sherman Oaks Notre 
Dame, 65-56, Friday. The Knights entered the week 9-5 and 5-1 in the Mission 
League. 
</P>
<P>
 A rundown of the area's top guards would not be complete without an update on 
Inglewood's Sam Turks and Banning's Jason Pickett. 
</P>
<P>
 Turks returned from a bruised leg last week to score 11 points, including a 
key three-point shot late in the game, in Inglewood's 67-54 Bay League victory 
over Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 Pickett, meanwhile, continued his string of high-scoring games Friday with 44 
points in Banning's triple-overtime 70-67 victory over Washington. Pickett made 
a three-point shot with 12 seconds left and followed his own miss with a basket 
at the buzzer to tie the score in regulation, 53-53. He also tied the score at 
the end of the first and second overtimes, making two free throws in the first 
overtime and a jump shot while falling down at the buzzer in the second 
overtime. COMMUNITY COLLEGES 
</P>
<P>
 * Former Narbonne basketball standout D'Mitri Rideout is one of the top 
players for Ventura College, ranked No. 1 in the state by the JC Athletic 
Bureau. The sophomore guard is averaging 10 points and four assists. Ventura 
entered the week with a 24-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
 * Harbor forward Shelton Simmons was the state's leading rebounder as of last 
week, averaging 12.8 a game, and El Camino forward Joe Zaletel was second in 
scoring, averaging 28 points. Zaletel scored a game-high 27 points Saturday, 
but it wasn't enough as Harbor beat El Camino, 97-95, in a South Coast 
Conference opener. 
</P>
<P>
 * Latasha Burnett of Harbor was the state's leading women's scorer as of last 
week, averaging 26.1 points. IN FIRST, FOR NOW 
</P>
<P>
 The Carson boys' basketball team entered the week tied for first place in the 
Pacific League, but winning the title is probably out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because the Colts are in the same league with Crenshaw, perhaps the 
most dominant team in California. Crenshaw routed Narbonne, 143-67, Friday in a 
Southern Pacific Conference game after opening a 30-point lead in the first 
quarter. Also last week, the Cougars beat Banning, 54-14, in a game called in 
the second quarter after Banning Coach Marc Paez was assessed three technical 
fouls. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson kept pace with Crenshaw by beating San Pedro, 76-53, Friday. Guard Tony 
Harvey scored 23 points and forward Anthony Browder added 17 for the Colts, who 
entered the week 12-4 and 3-0 in conference play. Carson meets Crenshaw next 
week. ATHLETE KILLED 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Roberts, a former quarterback at Gardena High and El Camino College, was 
shot to death Jan. 12 on a Hawthorne street after a "petty argument" with two 
men, according to a sheriff's spokesman. Roberts, 19, was an All-Southern 
League selection at Gardena, passing for more than 1,000 yards as a senior in 
1991. He failed to win the starting quarterback job at El Camino and 
transferred to Southwest College last fall, sitting out the season. ROB FERNAS

ENVIRONMENT; SOFTWARE THAT TEACHES CHILDREN TO RESPECT THE PLANET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD KAHLENBERG, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Children like being masters of all they survey, which is one reason they love 
computers. And makers of computer software who know that children are being 
taught not to abuse the planet have found a niche with pro-environment 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Southland software stores report heavy sales of titles like "SimCity 2000," 
which was recently released and spurred by the success of the original 
"SimCity," which has users fighting smog and leaky sewers as part of the 
computer game. It challenges children to "compete with neighboring cities, 
which will lure away citizens and industries if the city's business environment 
and quality of life decline." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes called educational software, but often found on shelves alongside 
regular computer games, these items are so popular that they sell nearly as 
well as the non-environmental educational sales champ Carmen Sandiego. "SimCity 
2000" has outstripped the champ in the past few days. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a waiting list of maybe 30 people before the game even came out," said 
software department manager Mirko Minaya of the Redondo Beach CompUSA store. He 
estimates that the store has sold 200 copies in four days. 
</P>
<P>
 This trend has not been lost on savvy parents who are looking for a way to get 
Junior away from television and into an activity that will improve his grades 
or give him a head start in the job market. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Futurekids, the private after-school computer class offering. This 
franchised operation started out to be a sort of American answer to juku, a 
Japanese intensive private tutoring program. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Rene Tabor, director of Futurekids of South Bay, children really 
like environmental software. "Our program is really theme-based. When we were 
dealing with environmental issues, they really liked it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Next month, a curriculum with the clever name of Megabyte Zoo will be offered, 
involving exercises such as this: The tyro computer whiz must "properly define 
the type of food, plants and temperatures the animals need to survive and 
remove any trash or pollution from the animal habitats.  
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Anne Louise Bannon contributed to this story. TO FIND THEM 
</P>
<P>
 Futurekids computer schools in the South Bay area are located in Torrance, 
Manhattan Beach and San Pedro. Environmental computer programs can be found at 
computer software retailers. Among the titles children enjoy most are 
"Zookeeper," "Zug's Dinosaur World," "Nigel's World," "Eco-Saurus," "Eco-Quest" 
and "SimCity 2000."

AS UCLA FOES GO, ARIZONA IS NO. 1; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: AFTER RIDING A SOFT 
SCHEDULE TO NO. 2, BRUINS PLAY WILDCATS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 For UCLA, it's a rare occasion -- playing a ranked team. 
</P>
<P>
 So before anyone gets too carried away with the Bruins' No. 2 ranking in the 
Associated Press poll, it probably wouldn't hurt to remember that tonight's 
annual Pauley Pavilion dunk-fest with No. 9 Arizona marks the first time UCLA 
has played somebody, well, good enough to be ranked any higher than 25th. 
</P>
<P>
 Lute Olson's Arizona team has waded through its first 15 games with only two 
defeats to quality teams -- a one-point loss to Kentucky on a tip-in at the 
buzzer and a five-point loss to California in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Definitely they've played a stronger schedule than us," Bruin guard Shon 
Tarver said. "So they're definitely going to be ready. It gives us a chance to 
see where we're at." 
</P>
<P>
 This leaves only one question: How good is UCLA? 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins are good enough to be ranked No. 2 in the AP poll and No. 1 in the 
CNN/USA Today poll. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the first time Bruin basketball has been ranked first in anything besides 
demanding alumni since January of 1983, when Larry Farmer was the coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Jim Harrick cautioned against being caught up in a numbers game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still real early in the year," he said. "We're more into being first in 
April than we are now." 
</P>
<P>
 For what it's worth, if UCLA defeats Arizona and Arizona State on Saturday, 
the Bruins will almost certainly move up to No. 1 in the AP poll because this 
week's No. 1 team, Kansas, lost to Kansas State on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing like a little extra incentive, as if any UCLA-Arizona game 
needed any more. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a great rivalry, no matter what's at stake," Tarver said. "Whenever 
we play them, it's kind of like an All-Star game." 
</P>
<P>
 So who is the best? 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, I'm going to say we're better," Tarver said. "It all comes down to 
competitiveness." 
</P>
<P>
 Against Arizona, a team whose fortunes depend on its guard play, a good game 
from Tarver is essential. Not only is Tarver the designated defender against 
Khalid Reeves, the top scorer in the conference, but Tarver also must make 
Reeves play defense. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been sort of a slow month offensively for Tarver, who is still 
recovering from his right ankle sprain, sustained Dec. 18 against Louisiana 
State. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarver had only six points in 22 minutes Saturday against Washington and is 
averaging 14.3 points, second to Ed O'Bannon's 19.2. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing has changed Tarver's inclination to be a scorer. He has 1,324 points 
at UCLA, only 19 behind Jamaal Wilkes, who is No. 18 on the school's scoring 
list. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tarver said his ankle injury has altered his slashing, driving style, 
turning him into a jump-shooter. And Harrick has found some fault recently in 
his defense and has not hesitated to remove him. 
</P>
<P>
 But Reeves and Wildcat point guard Damon Stoudamire are special players, so 
Tarver and Tyus Edney probably will attract a great deal of attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarver said he is ready. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're all pretty even down the line," he said. "I mean, guard play -- 
they won't take us for 50 points or anything like that. I don't think you'll 
see that." 
</P>
<P>
 There may be nothing like the present for the No. 2/No. 1 Bruins, who have 
until the start of next week to enjoy where they are or even go higher. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time UCLA finished the season ranked No. 1 was in 1975, when the 
Bruins won the NCAA title in John Wooden's last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "What good is it to be No. 1 in January and then tail off?" Tarver said. "(No. 
1) really doesn't mean that much now, except probably to fans, alumni and the 
coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I know is whoever wins between us two has the edge on winning the 
Pac-10," Tarver said. 
</P>
<P>
 For UCLA, how would they rank that? 
</P>
<P>
 Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Pauley Pavilion will be sold out tonight for the second time in eight games. 
Two more games are already sold out -- Feb. 3 against USC and Feb. 24 against 
California. . . . Ed O'Bannon, who leads UCLA in scoring (19.2) and rebounding 
(7.2), on the Bruins' No. 2 ranking: "That's what we're all trying to do, to 
get a little respect. We're going to play every game as hard as possible." And 
O'Bannon, on playing Arizona: "That's what you come to UCLA for, to play the 
top teams." . . . Jim Harrick had his own descriptive phrase when asked if the 
Arizona game was UCLA's biggest game so far. "No, but it's the first of great 
magnitude," he said. Fair enough.

PACIFIC 10 BASKETBALL / DAN HAFNER; SCORING AN UPSET IS GREAT, BUT THE NEXT 
GAME CAN BE A REAL BEAR 
</P>

<P>
 The late George Allen, a former Ram and Washington Redskin coach, always said 
the toughest game to win was the one immediately after a big victory. 
</P>
<P>
 USC Coach George Raveling, who had Allen as a lecturer at his basketball 
clinic a few days before Allen died, recalled Allen's remarks after Arizona 
State stunned California last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the game after Jason Kidd and his teammates scored an upset over 
Arizona in overtime at Tucson. "I've never forgotten George's philosophy," 
Raveling said. "If I had ever been a betting man, I would have won a lot of 
money. Just look what happened last week. Georgia Tech overwhelmed North 
Carolina and was trounced in the next game by Louisville. It happened to 
several teams just in the last week or so." 
</P>
<P>
 The youthful Bears and their 30-year-old coach, Todd Bozeman, learned the hard 
way about losing after a big victory. In a dramatic finish, Arizona State's 
Stevin Smith shot a 42-footer at the buzzer that hit only net and gave the Sun 
Devils a 63-60 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Thursday, the Bears achieved a feat only two teams had accomplished in 
the previous 102 games at McKale Center -- they beat the Wildcats, 98-93, in 
overtime. A three-point basket in the closing seconds by Cal's Lamond Murray 
put the Bears in overtime and they went on to win their eighth in a row. The 
Wildcats led by 11 points seven minutes into the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Saturday, Smith, nicknamed Hedake, had not often been a headache for any 
Sun Devil opponent this season. Smith's scoring had suffered since he took over 
at point guard for Marcell Capers, who is sidelined for the season because of 
an injury. 
</P>
<P>
 But Smith showed he was regaining his shooting touch in a victory last 
Thursday over Stanford when he scored 19 points. Then on Saturday, he planted 
himself just past center court and released the winning shot at the buzzer to 
give the Sun Devils a 2-1 conference record. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bears, who are 3-1 and trail unbeaten UCLA by one game, are at Stanford 
tonight. "Everybody was building up the game with Arizona as if it was for the 
championship," said Kidd, who made the pass that set up Murray's three-pointer. 
"It may have been a championship-type of game, but it's just too early in the 
season to be decisive." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After they overwhelmed USC for their first Pac-10 victory after three losses, 
the Washington State Cougars were in a confident mood. 
</P>
<P>
 "The coach wouldn't want to hear us saying that," senior center Fred Ferguson 
said, "but we think we can still win the conference. We really played well 
against UCLA, we just didn't get any breaks." 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling tends to agree with the Cougars. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a wide-open race," he said. "Nobody thought we'd be 3-1, and nobody 
thought the Cougars would be 1-3. Before a winner is decided, there will be 
some wild outcomes. The Cougars have a nice blend of seniors and freshmen. And 
they also have a pretty good sophomore in Mark Hendrickson. When he starts 
hitting his shots, the Cougars will really be tough to beat." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars (11-5) have played nine games on the road. This week, they play 
two more away from Friel Court, where they are 6-1. Tonight, the Cougars play 
at Oregon. Last week, the Ducks, with Mira Costa junior college transfer Darryl 
Parker averaging 15 points and 10 rebounds, built a big lead and held off 
Oregon State at Eugene for their first Pac-10 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before we got into what I call our Cadillac mood, when we aren't really 
working and (we) let the other team be the aggressor, I thought we played 
pretty well," Coach Jerry Green said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I asked the players what to do about blowing leads, they said we needed 
the killer instinct." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brevin Knight, Stanford's talented freshman, had a tough time against 
Arizona's Damon Stoudamire last week, and tonight he will go up against Jason 
Kidd, who figures to be even more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brevin is no longer a secret," Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery said. "When he 
found himself being outplayed by Stoudamire, he forgot what his job is. He 
started playing too much one on one." 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific 10 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The season ended for three Pac-10 players last week: Cal guard K.J. Roberts 
aggravated a stress fracture, Oregon State guard J.D. Vetter will have surgery 
on a separated shoulder and Oregon forward Damon Runyon suffered a knee injury. 
All are eligible for redshirt seasons. . . . Arizona Coach Lute Olson on Cal's 
Lamond Murray: "I can't imagine a better 6-foot-8 athlete. He's got great 
hands, he's a tremendous jumper and he can shoot. At that size and at that 
position, the only person I can compare him to is Sean Elliott."

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; HOW TO TURN THE 
TABLES ON DEVELOPING BETTER QUAKE BUILDING CODES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Predicting earthquakes may be impossible; minimizing their damage is not. 
Apartment complexes don't have to crumple; critical freeway overpasses needn't 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 If California and the country don't want to relive this week's destruction 
every time a major temblor roils the earth, it's time to invest in technologies 
that tell us how to build structures that are seismically safe and sound. 
</P>
<P>
 While seismographs are terrific for charting the course of a quake, they're of 
little use in building quake-resistant highways and houses. A different tool is 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk to the structural engineers and they'll tell you the most valuable data 
for designing and testing earthquake innovations doesn't come from 
sophisticated computer models of digitized earthquakes striking simulated 
structures, but from an aptly named device called a shake table. 
</P>
<P>
 Shake tables shake; they can be programmed to physically simulate the bucking 
and thrashing of earthquakes, real and imagined. The bigger the shake table, 
the larger the scale model of the structure that can be attached and tested. 
Design innovations, new materials, innovative construction techniques and even 
soil conditions can be effectively emulated on the appropriate shake table. 
</P>
<P>
 What wind tunnels have meant to the design and development of airplanes, shake 
tables can -- and should -- mean for building and retrofitting quake-proof 
structures. Our earthquake investment policies must now reflect that. 
</P>
<P>
 "What this country really lacks is a large enough shaking table," says 
Nicholas F. Forell of San Francisco-based Forell & Ellseser, one of the 
country's leading earthquake engineering firms. "The shaking tests that we've 
done have been extremely revealing and helpful to us. Computer models are 
important for design, but even they need the empirical data that comes from the 
shaking tests." 
</P>
<P>
 "We could have made significant inroads and cut by a significant margin much 
of the damage that happened (Monday) if the engineering community relied more 
rigorously on shake table testing," says Jack Moehle, who directs the 
Earthquake Engineering Research Center at University of California, Berkeley 
and is part of the teams investigating the freeway collapses. 
</P>
<P>
 Astonishingly, there are fewer than five shake tables of any meaningful size 
in the entire country. The State University of New York at Buffalo has a 
12-foot shake table; the University of Illinois in Urbana, along with the Army 
Corps of Engineers, has two tables; UC San Diego has a fairly crude one. The 
nation's largest shake table is at UC Berkeley's research center. It's all of 
20 feet long. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, says UC Berkeley structural engineering professor Stephen A. 
Mahin, Japan, which is very concerned about seismic design, has no fewer than 
20 larger tables. In fact, the largest shake table in the world is on the 
island of Shikoku off the east coast of Japan -- a 50-footer that was 
originally used to test the integrity of nuclear power plant designs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have the Japanese mentality to test everything that's possible 
before we build it," Mahin says, but he adds that recently the Berkeley center 
has done shake testing for a handful of private builders.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, why don't insurance companies insist on shake table tests for new 
building designs or for proposed seismic retrofits? Why, for example, has the 
California Department of Transportation relied solely on static hydraulic tests 
for determining highway integrity, rather than pushing for shake table testing 
of scale models here in the United States or Japan?  
</P>
<P>
 Why aren't shake tables being used to figure out low-cost ways to buttress and 
reinforce the higher-risk buildings in Southern California? Why aren't the U.S. 
Department of Transportation and the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development working hand in hand with California and the construction community 
to sponsor more shake table testing? 
</P>
<P>
 The answers lie as much in the politics and economics of funding as in any 
technical problems. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, shake tables are still seen more as a research tool than as a 
vital testing medium and so are treated like discretionary academic Tinkertoys. 
For another, building and construction codes are written independently of the 
data that can be generated by shake tables -- even though, ironically, some of 
the computer simulations that shape the codes are drawn from shake table tests. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Moehle, large shake tables can be built for less than $25 
million, and the cost of maintaining them is not particularly high. Indeed, for 
less than 0.1% of the cost of a space station or a superconducting super 
collider, America can build devices that help assure that people's homes and 
highways are significantly safer. If a shake table test could have saved but 
one freeway this past Monday, it would have more than paid for itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earthquake engineering community has not organized well on this," Moehle 
acknowledges. "We haven't gotten our act together; it's nobody's fault but our 
own." 
</P>
<P>
 That has to change. What's the point of being able to predict earthquakes if 
many of our key structures are not engineered well enough to survive them? 
While shake table testing -- like wind tunnels -- don't guarantee the safety or 
integrity of structures, it does offer a cost-effective way to boost their 
chances for soundness.

 As Los Angeles rebuilds from the rubble, it's essential that state and federal 
governments recognize the critical importance of investing in testing. Without 
that investment, efforts to rebuild will merely be futile exercises in tempting 
fate.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; CIVIL CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES LIKELY TO CASH IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Construction firms are already cleaning up -- literally and figuratively -- 
under emergency contracts to remove freeway damage from Monday's earthquake, 
while others stand to benefit handsomely from rebuilding work that will keep 
them busy for at least the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Three major demolition firms won four contracts worth $3.4 million from the 
California Department of Transportation to remove collapsed sections along the 
Golden State, Santa Monica, Simi Valley and Antelope Valley freeways within the 
week: Granite Construction of Watsonville, Calif.; Penhall Co. of Anaheim, and 
C.A. Rasmussen of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Transportation is readying streamlined 
procedures to speed highway funds to California so rebuilding contracts can be 
let. During a visit to Southern California Wednesday, President Clinton 
promised to make $45 million in emergency highway funds available, and added 
that he would go to Congress for more if needed. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no estimate yet on how many construction jobs will be created in the 
aftermath of the quake, but the Construction Industry Research Board in Burbank 
says that every $1 million spent typically results in 29 new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, construction firms -- including those responsible for some of 
California's largest public works projects -- have already put out feelers to 
Caltrans -- some just hours after the quake struck at 4:31 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Several well-known California firms in the tightly knit civil construction 
industry have expressed an interest in bidding on major freeway reconstruction 
contracts, expected to add up to billions of dollars: Kasler Corp. of Highland, 
MCM Construction of North Highlands, Steve P. Rados of Santa Ana and Granite 
Construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of these firms were involved in repair work after the 1989 San Francisco 
Bay Area quake, the Century Freeway project and other work. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, highway design contractors in the private sector are expected to 
get the lion's share of the work in planning the repairs, said Robert Bein of 
the Robert Bein, William Frost & Associates civil engineering firm in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way Caltrans has the resources on its own staff to handle the 
amount of design work necessary," Bein said. 
</P>
<P>
 That should be good news for about 150 minority- and women-owned contracting 
firms certified by Caltrans. The agency's rules require that they receive up to 
20% of the work, either directly or as subcontractors. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, minority-owned contractors wondered why none of their firms 
were considered for the initial four contracts, and they said they hoped they 
won't be left out of future work. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter Wednesday to state Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles), L.A. County 
Supervisor Yvonne Burke and L.A. City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, the United 
Minority Contractors Assn. complained about the lack of work and asked them to 
intervene. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim McCarthy, assistant to the Caltrans district director in Los Angeles, said 
some minority subcontractors had been hired, but he did not have details. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under the emergency rules we're working on . . . we have set goals of 20% 
(minority participation) on those contracts, and we are strongly encouraging 
our (primary) contractors to use minority contractors beyond that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans, meanwhile, is modifying its normal bidding procedures to expedite 
the massive process of rebuilding Southern California's crippled freeway 
network. 
</P>
<P>
 Large firms aren't the only ones that will benefit. With hundreds of damaged 
residential, commercial and industrial buildings -- everything from apartment 
houses to the crumpled scoreboard at Anaheim Stadium -- there will be more than 
enough work to go around, construction experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly these kinds of disasters generate some jobs -- and in this case 
that could be a lot of jobs," said Janice Tuchman, managing editor of 
Engineering News-Record, an industry magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson estimated that total damages could run between $15 billion 
and $30 billion. Wall Street apparently sensed the inevitable windfall to the 
industry, sending construction stock prices up on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Demolition contracts went out even as the ground was still shaking from 
aftershocks. By Monday afternoon, crews were starting to remove debris at the 
Interstate 5-California 14 interchange, where bridges collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 By Tuesday morning, Penhall Co. workers were already hacking away at what was 
left of the Santa Monica Freeway bridge over Fairfax Avenue at the east end of 
Culver City. With a dozen workers on each of two 12-hour shifts, the company 
was expected to have cleared Fairfax by late Wednesday. Workers were also 
clearing a collapsed bridge a short distance away over La Cienega Boulevard, 
said Roger Stull, president of Penhall's parent company. 
</P>
<P>
 In the informality of the emergency process, Stull said the company was 
billing the state hourly -- between $30 and $200 an hour, depending on the 
level of manpower and equipment used. The only criteria: have the roads cleared 
by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Penhall is also the firm that will clean up Anaheim Stadium, where the 
35,000-pound video display screen crashed onto the upper tier of seats, bending 
the trademark "A" backward. 
</P>
<P>
 Granite Construction, meanwhile, was fielding 20 workers per shift and 14 
pieces of heavy equipment to clear the damaged interchange where the Golden 
State and Antelope Valley freeways merge. At the same time, a Granite vice 
president began talking with Caltrans officials about bidding on future 
reconstruction work Monday morning, only hours after the quake's first massive 
jolt. 
</P>
<P>
 The freeway repairs may constitute the largest single projects, but it won't 
make up the only work. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program said its $10-million 
Granada Hills office building was declared a total loss and will probably need 
to be rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 But the health maintenance organization said hiring contractors was not on the 
top of the list of things to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our priority is to serve our health plan members," said spokeswoman Kit 
Niemeyer at the company's regional headquarters in Pasadena. 
</P>

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; GETTING DOWN TO WORK; SAN FERNANDO VALLEY 
COMPANIES STRUGGLE TO GET UP AND RUNNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Fitfully, the ruptured lifelines of commerce rumbled back into motion 
Wednesday in the San Fernando Valley, making patience a necessary virtue as 
residents sought out necessities and business people struggled to meet 
customers' demands. 
</P>
<P>
 In the quake-rocked West Valley, most shopping malls remained closed, and 
people spent hours searching for open gas stations, grocery stores and banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Major area employers tried earnestly to get back to business, but much of 
their work was limited to cleaning up debris, examining damage to buildings and 
picking up scattered files. 
</P>
<P>
 At one especially hard-hit firm, only a hundred of the 3,000 workers at Great 
Western Financial Corp.'s headquarters in Chatsworth were back on the job, 
though most of the thrift's branches were open. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, moving companies throughout the Valley and elsewhere in Greater Los 
Angeles were overwhelmed by calls from residents and business owners trying to 
move belongings into storage -- hoping, in many cases, to beat condemnation 
orders that would prohibit movers from entering unsafe structures. 
</P>
<P>
 For many Valley residents, the contrast with business as usual was typified by 
the obsessive hunt for the flexible copper lines that connect water heaters to 
home plumbing systems. With 37 other people, Lorraine Williams stood in the hot 
sun Wednesday afternoon outside Larry & Joe's Plumbing Supply store in Reseda. 
After being tossed around "like a salad" in Monday's quake, Williams' home had 
electricity and running water again. But those copper tubes in her garage had 
snapped. 
</P>
<P>
 "I drove all around the Valley this morning looking for a store that still had 
them in stock," the Northridge woman said. "My husband's boss told us about 
this store, and when I got here, the line was already twice as long as now." 
</P>
<P>
 Michele Lewis, a saleswoman at the store, said the iron laws of economics were 
hard at work. And she warned that Williams and the others might be leaving 
unsatisfied. 
</P>
<P>
 "Copper flex lines are in short supply in the Valley now," she explained. 
"Nobody expected the demand for them. We've run out and are talking to 
suppliers in Ventura County. Some suppliers are already beginning to gouge the 
consumer. Before the quake, suppliers sold us the tubing for about $10 a piece. 
Some suppliers are now charging retailers $25 a piece. We refuse to be gouged." 
</P>
<P>
 Plumbing stores were not the only Valley businesses with customers spilling 
out onto sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Albertson's supermarket at Corbin Avenue and Vanowen Street in Winnetka 
was one of a handful of food stores in the West Valley open on Wednesday. 
Employees were allowing two shoppers in at a time; the wait was about 15 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It kind of looks like the pictures you see of consumers in communist 
countries who wait in line for hours to buy a couple of loaves of bread," said 
Mike O'Leary, who had driven from Northridge with his girlfriend and was 
waiting at the end of the line. "I hope they have more than bread. Bologna 
would be nice." 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, many of the store's ceiling tiles were missing, but most of the 
shelves were restocked. Customers were buying meat almost as fast as the 
butchers could put it in the display cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Five miles to the south in Woodland Hills, Sheila Cook sat inside an office of 
Highland Federal Bank, tending with another employee to the trickle of 
customers that walked in. Electricity and phone service had been restored 
Tuesday night. But yellow tape surrounded the bank's exterior, warning of 
earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just taking deposits," Cook said. "We've worked out an agreement with 
Bank of America next door to cash checks for our customers. If the customer 
needs extra service, we send them to our next closest office in Burbank." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Arco station at Vanowen Street and Winnetka Avenue, Tomas Davila waited 
in his new Toyota behind a line of cars that snaked into the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is ridiculous," the Panorama City man said. "Every station I went to was 
either closed or had lines of cars. When will things get back to normal?" 
</P>
<P>
 As he talked to a reporter, a silver Honda zipped past the waiting cars toward 
an island of gas pumps. Davila and other angry motorists jumped out of their 
cars to yell at the young driver. 
</P>
<P>
 "Puhleeese!" she said. "I'm only looking for directions. I don't want your 
gas." 
</P>
<P>
 From behind locked doors, employees at shopping malls undertook the arduous 
process of cleaning up and assessing the impact of the quake. Damage ranged 
from broken tiles and plaster, toppled merchandise, shattered windows and water 
stains to utter devastation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Glendale Galleria, Panorama Mall in Panorama City and Antelope Valley Mall 
in Palmdale opened for business. Others -- including the Media City Center in 
Burbank, the Promenade in Woodland Hills, Fallbrook Mall in Canoga Park and the 
Valencia Town Center -- hope to reopen by the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 At the hardest hit shopping center, the Northridge Fashion Center, a collapsed 
Bullock's department store has been condemned, and two parking structures will 
have to be rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth floor of the mall's J.C. Penney store collapsed into the third 
level; one of the toppled parking structures leans against it. But officials 
have not determined if the store must be rebuilt, and engineers continued to 
pick through the Broadway, Sears and other severely damaged stores. It is 
uncertain when any mall can be reopened, even partially. 
</P>
<P>
 From makeshift offices in parking lots, under canopies and in trailers, many 
big Valley employers operated with skeleton crews, their workday made long and 
tense by the aftershocks that continued to rattle the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Ornstein, chief financial officer at Superior Industries, the Van Nuys 
wheel manufacturer, arrived at work carrying a flashlight and clad in jeans and 
sneakers. Almost all of the company's 200 white-collar workers were there, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "The phone is up, the lights are on," Ornstein reported jubilantly. "Overall, 
people are in good spirits." 
</P>
<P>
 But only a fraction of the firm's 800 blue-collar employees were called back 
Wednesday. The quake left gaping holes in the factory's ceiling, knocked big 
lathes out of position and damaged water pipes. But Ornstein said he remains 
hopeful full production will resume by the end of next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Other major employers aren't so sure when operations will be in full swing. 
</P>
<P>
 At Great Western's headquarters, department supervisors shuffled in and out of 
Building 2, the only one of 14 edifices at the thrift's sprawling headquarters 
complex that had been cleared by structural engineers. Working from a white 
trailer equipped with flashlights and walkie-talkies, spokesman Ian Campbell 
said he has no idea when the rest of the employees will be called back. 
</P>
<P>
 Business was brisk, meanwhile, at area moving and storage firms. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are calling to get out of their buildings before they are condemned 
and torn down," said Tom Smith, president of L.A. Moving & Storage in Arleta. 
Smith's company is moving about 30 households a day -- mostly apartment 
dwellers escaping damaged buildings in Northridge, Sherman Oaks and Granada 
Hills.  
</P>
<P>
 "Some people who have long distance moves planned for February, March and 
April are seeing if they can get it done right now," Smith said. "I think with 
the quake and the fires and potential mudslides coming with the next big rain, 
you will see more people wanting out this summer." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Bement, national accounts sales manager for Sylmar-based Security Moving 
& Storage, said the company's 40 movers are booked through next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every man and every truck that is available is out there working," he said. 
"It's been crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, Bement said, the company has turned down work from customers 
whose damaged homes and businesses it judged unsafe to enter, even if they were 
not yet condemned. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will not risk the safety of our men," Bement said.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; CHAOS IS KING AS BUSINESSES FRANTICALLY LOOK 
FOR OFFICE SPACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Frenzy gripped Los Angeles' commercial real estate market Wednesday, as 
businesses whose offices were damaged by the earthquake scrambled to find new 
space and building owners struggled to assess their damage and persuade tenants 
to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the sales of half a dozen high-rises around the county worth a 
total of $100 million were thrown into limbo, as buyers and their lenders 
demanded that the properties be reinspected. 
</P>
<P>
 In the long term, real estate brokers said the quake might actually help the 
office market by spurring new construction projects. But on Wednesday, chaos 
was king. 
</P>
<P>
 "All hell has broke loose," said Mark Sullivan, who represents several San 
Fernando Valley and Westside office tenants and owners for the Julian J. 
Studley commercial brokerage firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of buildings in the Valley and other parts of Los Angeles County 
remained closed Wednesday because they had yet to be visited by overworked 
government building inspectors, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, no one has been able to make a firm estimate of how much office 
space had been damaged or destroyed, although the figure will undoubtedly run 
into the millions of square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people don't even know if they're still in business, because they 
can't get in through their own front door," said Carla Gazzolo, a broker who 
runs the San Fernando Valley operations of CB Commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 Brokers said newer high-rises in downtown Los Angeles suffered little damage 
and that all of them remained open. But some older structures built prior to 
strict seismic codes sustained a range of problems, from broken water pipes to 
severe structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts worried that owners of buildings that sustained major damage 
might simply let their lenders foreclose. Property values of some office 
complexes in the Valley and other parts of the county have dropped more than 
20% over the past few years, so landlords have little reason to spend millions 
to repair their money-losing projects. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the long term, brokers said, the earthquake may provide some benefits 
for the overbuilt office market in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Vacancy rates across the county stood at about 19% before the quake, a lofty 
figure that has discouraged new construction projects and forced landlords to 
slash their prices in order to lure new tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 But the quake apparently wiped out a good-size chunk of that vacant space, 
particularly in the Valley. That could push rental rates higher and persuade 
developers to finally launch new projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "The quake created demand for new office space, and we haven't had a lot of 
demand for quite a while," said Ray Lepone, a broker in the Downtown office of 
Grubb & Ellis Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Broker Sullivan said he has been trying to find tenants for 100,000 square 
feet of vacant office space for a building on the Valley's trendy Ventura 
Boulevard for several months. On Wednesday alone, he received 20 calls from 
prospective tenants by lunchtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like suddenly I've got the hottest project in town," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But some business owners looking to rent temporary space until their permanent 
headquarters could be restored were already complaining Wednesday that 
landlords were demanding exorbitant rents and move-in fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Other landlords were giving priority to tenants who would agree to sign 
longer-term leases -- a difficult proposition for small businesses that need 
space for only a few months. 
</P>
<P>
 "All things being equal, we'd prefer a tenant who will stay with us for a 
while than someone who is going to be gone in a couple of months," said Mark 
Lainer of Lainer Development, a Van Nuys-based company that owns dozens of 
properties in the San Fernando Valley. "We're not gouging anyone, but we're 
certainly being practical." 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Penney, owner of a small public relations firm in Burbank that bears her 
name, said she and her assistant will probably be working out of their homes 
for a while because their office building has been closed by quake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess we'll just have to throw our computers in the car and set up shop in 
our dens," Penney said, taking a break from sweeping up the debris on her floor 
and picking up her toppled file cabinets. 
</P>
<P>
 Larger businesses don't have the luxury of being so mobile. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Levine, president of ARCS Mortgage, said the lending giant's sprawling 
headquarters in Calabasas suffered major damage from the quake. The temblor 
caused the fire sprinklers to go off, and they stayed on for three hours -- 
soaking thousands of important loan documents and causing the ceiling to 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 But since the main computer ARCS needs to process 90,000 loan payments a month 
can't be easily uprooted, Levine said the company cannot simply move its 
operations to temporary quarters. Thanks to luck and a round-the-clock effort 
by its staff, power to the building was restored Monday night and the computer 
came back on line. 
</P>
<P>
 With electricity restored, dozens of company employees spent Tuesday and 
Wednesday using hair dryers and fans to dry out reams of soggy loan documents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had better working conditions," Levine said, "but at least we're back 
in business."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; Q&A; GETTING YOUR FIRM BACK ON ITS FEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Many small businesses hurt by this week's earthquake need help in securing 
financing, making insurance claims, handling employees and reopening for 
business. Here are some answers to questions confronting owners victimized by 
the quake: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What should I do first? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Assess the full extent of damage to your operation. In addition to the 
obvious structural damage, check the safety and integrity of your business 
equipment, including computers and sensitive telecommunications systems. And be 
sure to assess the condition of your employees. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How do I resume operations? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Develop a systematic plan for fixing damage and starting up again. While 
plans will vary, rank your actions by determining what will get you back in 
business as quickly as possible, advises Ian Mitroff, director of the Crisis 
Management Center at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 If you can resume operations quickly, do so. But if fixing structural damage 
will take months, consider moving your operations to a branch office or another 
location. A trusted real estate professional can help. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, your most pressing need is to immediately contact key customers 
to explain how the earthquake has affected your operations. If you have a pizza 
parlor, put out signs and flyers saying you're open or available to deliver. 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, reach out to the community for support and resources. A study of 
businesses affected by the riots in 1992 shows that those that pooled resources 
and worked together reopened more quickly than those that remained isolated, 
Mitroff says. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information on how to cope with disaster, get "How to Survive a 
Catastrophe: A Guide for Business." This free pamphlet is available from the 
Insurance Information Institute by calling (800) 942-4242 or by sending a 
self-addressed, stamped business envelope to the institute at 110 Williams St., 
New York, N.Y. 10038. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How do I make sure my building is safe to work in? 
</P>
<P>
 A. A building inspector from your city can check for structural and other 
problems. (See accompanying list of phone numbers.) If municipal inspectors are 
not available when you want them, consider hiring a professional architect or 
structural engineer. Experts caution against relying on your own untrained 
assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 Business associates, neighbors and your employees can help evaluate the 
condition of your equipment. Be clearheaded and don't hang on to devices that 
may never be returned to working condition.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Is there anything special I should do for my employees? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Either you or your top lieutenant should talk to each worker to determine 
whether he or she faces earthquake-related problems at home. Remember, your 
employees have lives separate from the office and may be needed at home to deal 
with worried children and damaged property. In addition, your employees may 
face lengthy commutes due to freeway closures. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have formal employee assistance programs, remind your work force of 
counseling options or hold on-site seminars dealing with post-earthquake 
stress. Make workers feel safe by demonstrating that the work site is ready for 
another shaker. Consider earthquake drills.  
</P>
<P>
 Finally, cut your workers some slack. "Be as flexible as possible. Postpone 
nonessential work. Look at work as an aid to recovery and not just something 
that adds more stress," says Janice Stanger, benefits consultant for William M. 
Mercer Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Should I pay employees who aren't coming to work? 
</P>
<P>
 A. If workers are idled because your business is temporarily shut down, "it's 
smart to pay employees because . . . it builds up a reservoir of goodwill," 
Stanger says. 
</P>
<P>
 Longer-term business interruptions are trickier. Workers may qualify for 
unemployment insurance. Consider alternate arrangements, such as telecommuting, 
for workers with newly nightmarish commutes or other problems getting to the 
office, Stanger suggests. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How do I get the money I need to reopen my business? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Call your business banker. Even if you don't have a business loan, the bank 
that handles your business checking account should be able to help. 
</P>

 Many banks are offering business customers instant lines of credit with no 
application fees. Many are also offering 90-day loans at interest rates of 4% 
to 5% to merchants already approved for a federal disaster loan and awaiting 
arrival of the funds. Finally, many banks are willing to renegotiate terms of 
loan repayments to businesses affected by the earthquake.

<P>
 Q. How do I get federal disaster money? 
</P>
<P>
 A. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is setting up disaster centers to 
take applications for temporary housing funds and other assistance. Small 
Business Administration representatives will be at those centers offering 
business loans of up to $1.5 million for economic injury and damages to real 
estate, inventory, equipment and other assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses with no access to other credit pay 4% and others pay 7.7%. You must 
provide such normal business records as tax returns, income statements, profit 
and loss statements and balance sheets. FEMA and SBA have set up a toll-free 
number to start the process: (800) 462-9029. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What about my business insurance? Am I covered if I can't do business? 
</P>
<P>
 A. The standard business insurance package does not provide earthquake 
coverage of any sort, according to the Insurance Information Institute. To be 
covered for earthquake-related business interruption or structural damage, you 
must purchase additional earthquake insurance. Fewer than 20% of California's 
businesses have it. Help for Small Businesses

reported record fourth-quarter profit, it said it will give unionized employees 
profit-sharing checks averaging $4,300 each.Chrysler Corp. said the windfall 
represents the largest profit-sharing checks ever paid by a U.S. auto company.

 Weather Forces Ford, GM Plants to Halt Work: The auto makers said some plants 
have been idled as heavy snow and subzero temperatures prevented supply 
shipments.Thirteen Ford Motor Co. parts and assembly plants, mostly in the 
Midwest and Ohio River Valley region, have been affected. Other plants from New 
Jersey to Michigan were running partial shifts. General Motors Corp. closed its 
Moraine assembly plant near Dayton, Ohio, idling 1,500 workers who build sport 
utility vehicles. A Kentucky supplier could not ship body side panels, since 
Ohio highways remained closed following a record snowfall this week, a plant 
manager said. GM expected its plant to resume operation today and Ford said it 
hopes to reopen its plants soon.

 FHP-Takecare Merger Questioned: Shareholders with a 22% stake in Takecare 
Inc., a Concord, Calif.-based health maintenance organization, have sued the 
company, claiming the chairman engineered the rejection of a takeover offer in 
favor of a lower, $829-million acquisition bid by FHP International Corp. of 
Fountain Valley. That lower bid was favored, the suit alleges, because it would 
let Takecare Chairman Jack R. Anderson convert his stock to cash. The suit, 
filed Tuesday in Delaware Chancery Court, said the board should have accepted 
an allegedly superior, all-stock bid by United Healthcare Corp. Takecare 
spokesman David Briere said the suit "is without merit."

U.S. ECONOMY GROWING STEADILY -- EVERYWHERE BUT SOUTHLAND; COMMERCE: CONSUMER 
SPENDING AND FACTORY OUTPUT ARE UP IN OTHER REGIONS. CHEAP OIL SHAVES 6.7% OFF 
TRADE DEFICIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The U.S. economy is pumping along at a steady clip, but Southern California 
remains a stubborn weak spot and the region is losing ground to most of the 
rest of the country, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, tumbling oil prices in November helped narrow the U.S. trade gap, 
which shrank by 6.7% to $10.17 billion, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. 
But for the first 11 months of the year, the trade deficit remained at the 
worst level in six years, running at an annual rate of $118.7 billion, the 
department said. 
</P>
<P>
 In its periodic "beige book" report on economic conditions, the Federal 
Reserve found that weak economic conditions persisted in Southern California 
during December and January even as conditions in other regions improved -- 
with consumer spending and manufacturing activity up and inflation under 
control. When compared with the outlook in past reports, the Fed said, the gap 
between economic conditions in California and those in other regions appeared 
to be widening. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more of the same in California, but the states outside California are 
doing somewhat better," said Brian Cromwell, an economist at the Federal 
Reserve Bank in San Francisco. "Southern California remains the one area you 
can point to and say, 'This area is still in a recession.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The report on the state of the economy in late December and early January 
emphasized that weaknesses in manufacturing, construction and real estate 
markets continued to plague Southern California, while the economy in the 
northern part of the state showed "signs of bottoming out or of modest 
improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 Cutbacks in aerospace and defense manufacturing industries and weaknesses in 
residential and commercial real estate markets hindered economic growth in the 
southern part of the state, Fed officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, which is issued eight times a year, is based on anecdotal 
information gathered by the Fed's 12 regional banks. Wednesday's report 
summarized information received before Jan. 10, and therefore did not take into 
account the impact of the latest Southern California earthquake. But Federal 
Reserve officials say that it would be difficult to measure the economic cost 
of the quake using standard economic measures. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be difficult for us in terms of separating out the effects of 
the recession from the effects of this most recent disaster," Cromwell said. 
The earthquake's effect on the region's transportation system will be one of 
the key areas to watch in the days ahead in judging the effect on business, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, the report found that consumer spending during the holidays was 
strong this year, particularly on household items such as electronics, and 
automobile sales were found to be strong in some areas of the Midwest, South 
and West. But some weaknesses in apparel sales were reported in areas scattered 
throughout the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 On the manufacturing front, the report found that the demand for manufactured 
products was stronger in some areas, with increased demand for construction 
products reported by Fed banks in Atlanta, Boston, Dallas and Minneapolis and 
higher demand for automotive products reported by banks in Boston, Chicago and 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 Other strengths were reported in the demand for personal computers, capital 
equipment and textiles. But the report also says that sluggishness in defense 
industry manufacturing was reported by banks in Boston, Atlanta and San 
Francisco and that the manufacture of apparel was slow in some regions of the 
South. 
</P>
<P>
 On a different front, the merchandise trade deficit for October was $10.9 
billion, revised from a previously reported $10.46 billion, the Commerce 
Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 The politically troublesome trade deficit with Japan also fell in November to 
$5.72 billion before seasonal adjustment, from $6.09 billion the prior month. 
</P>
<P>

FINANCIAL MARKETS; DOW AGAIN HITS NEW HIGH, BUT NASDAQ DROPS

 Market Overview 
</P>
<P>
 * The Dow industrials surged to a new high, but the broad market finished 
mixed as some disappointing technology company earnings depressed the Nasdaq 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, many foreign markets regained their footing and rallied briskly. 
</P>
<P>
 * Long-term Treasury bond yields inched higher as investors weighed the 
potential impact of upcoming government note and bond sales. In commodity 
markets, oil prices gained again. Stocks 
</P>
<P>
 A torrent of buyers again entered the market, but there were plenty of sellers 
as well -- leaving broad market indexes only marginally higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the Dow climbed 14.08 points to a record 3,884.37, the Standard & 
Poor's 500 index added just 0.05 point to 474.30. And winners topped losers by 
a slim 11 to 10 on the New York Stock Exchange on heavy volume of 311 million 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nasdaq market of mostly smaller stocks was weighed down by disappointing 
profit reports from some of the biggest firms traded there. The Nasdaq 
composite index lost 3.74 points to 789.28. 
</P>
<P>
 But a truer measure of small-stock performance, the Russell 2,000 index, 
joined the Dow industrials at a new high, adding 0.20 point to 262.20. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts said the broad market gave a good account of itself considering 
the impact of lower than expected corporate earnings reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Computer chip giant Intel, for example, plunged 4 3/4 to 62 1/2 after 
reporting quarterly earnings that fell short of analysts' estimates, even 
though the company's results were up 38% from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In the drug group, Pfizer plummeted 5 to 62 7/8 on its weak earnings report. 
</P>
<P>
 And book publisher Houghton-Mifflin tumbled 6 7/8 to 46. It said 1994 earnings 
will be 10% lower than projections because of an expected drop in textbook 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the earnings shortfalls, Wall Street was pulled up by continued 
strength in industrial stocks and in some energy issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Wednesday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Dow was boosted by Alcoa, up 1 to 74 7/8; 3M, up 2 to 111 3/8; 
McDonald's, up 1 3/8 to 58 7/8, and Caterpillar, up 7/8 to 93 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other industrial names, Briggs & Stratton surged 3 5/8 to 85, Kennametal 
leaped 1 7/8 to 47 7/8, Air Products & Chemicals gained 1 3/8 to 48 3/4 and ITT 
jumped 1 5/8 to 94 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rising energy prices resulting from the cold wave in the East drove natural 
gas stocks up. Coastal rose 1 to 30, KN Energy added 7/8 to 24 1/8, Enserch 
gained 5/8 to 18 1/8 and Enron Corp. was up 1 1/8 to 32 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, Columbia Gas leaped 3 1/8 to 26 1/4 after the eastern gas utility 
filed a reorganization plan that would bring it out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Telephone stocks were strong. Ameritech soared 3 3/4 to 78 7/8 after 
reporting fourth-quarter earnings were up 19%. Other gainers included Bell 
Atlantic, 1 1/4 to 55 7/8; BellSouth, up 7/8 to 56 1/2, and MCI, which rose 1 
1/8 to 27 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the downside, technology company earnings disappointments were the rule 
of the day. Digital Equipment sank 3 3/4 to 32 3/4 after reporting a quarterly 
loss and issuing a cautious outlook. 
</P>
<P>
 Software firm Borland lost 1 1/2 to 13 7/8 after reporting sharply lower 
earnings.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Microsoft slid 1 3/8 to 83 1/4, but after the market closed it 
reported quarterly earnings were up 22%, better than expected. 
</P>
<P>
 * Drug stocks followed Pfizer lower after its weak earnings report. Merck fell 
3/4 to 35 7/8, Lilly lost 1 5/8 to 59 7/8, Schering-Plough sank 1 7/8 to 64 3/8 
and American Home Products eased 7/8 to 64 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 In foreign markets, Tokyo's Nikkei index rocketed 524.85 points to 19,039.40, 
its first close above 19,000 since Nov. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 In Frankfurt, the DAX index gained 20.54 points to 2,134.38, and London's 
FTSE-100 index soared 38.1 points to 3,475.1. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City's Bolsa index surged 44.88 points to 2,601.50. Other Markets 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury bond yields edged higher as investors focused on upcoming bond 
offerings. The Treasury said it will auction $17 billion in two-year notes and 
$12 billion in five-year notes next Tuesday and Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year T-bond yield closed at 6.29%, up from Tuesday's 6.26% close. 
</P>
<P>
 Also pressuring bond yields was an upbeat Federal Reserve Board report showing 
fresh "signs of acceleration" in the economy as 1994 began. 
</P>
<P>
 In other markets: 
</P>
<P>
 * Crude oil futures ended 35 cents higher at $15.22 a barrel on the New York 
Merc. 
</P>
<P>
 * Near-term gold futures eased 80 cents to $392.30 an ounce on the New York 
Comex. Silver was unchanged at $5.33.

2 CONTRACTORS TO CUT PRICE ON CLUSTER BOMBS; DEFENSE: GOVERNMENT SAYS AEROJET 
AND ALLIANT TECHSYSTEMS CONSPIRED TO ELIMINATE COMPETITION. THE FIRMS DENY IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an unwelcome message to the defense industry, the government announced the 
settlement of charges that two major ordnance manufacturers conspired to drive 
up the price of cluster bombs by eliminating competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a consent decree signed Wednesday, Aerojet of California and Alliant 
Techsystems of Minnesota agreed to cut the cluster bomb contract price by $12 
million and cancel a joint venture the two firms had formed to produce the 
bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a sharply worded response, Aerojet, which builds cluster bombs in 
Downey and Chino, rejected the government's allegations and said the Army had 
approved the teaming arrangement between Aerojet and Alliant that the Justice 
Department later called anti-competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 The unusual Justice Department action, which government officials hailed as a 
strong message to the industry, is sure to anger major defense contractors that 
have already contended the government is interfering with consolidation in the 
shrinking industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have been very 
erratic about whether they are going to permit consolidation, mergers, joint 
ventures, partnerships and teaming," said Herbert Fenster, a leading industry 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some instances, mergers or consolidations go through with flying colors, 
while in other instances they are stopped dead and in some cases they are 
subject to criminal investigation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fenster, echoing concerns expressed throughout the industry last year, said 
the lack of a cohesive policy is thwarting the industry's ability to shrink 
rationally in the face of a severe drop in weapons orders. He said the Defense 
Department has refused to provide any policy guidance on the issue to the 
Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jamie Gorelick, the Defense Department's special counsel, said the 
Pentagon is not attempting to stop mergers. Rather, she said, it is signaling 
that it intends to fight vigorously any anti-competitive arrangements that 
drive up weapons prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to send the message that the Department of Defense will be vigilant 
and the Department of Justice will be firm in enforcing the antitrust laws." 
</P>
<P>
 Aerojet and Alliant, the sole U.S. producers of cluster bombs, were accused of 
forming a team to submit a $133-million contract bid that contained $12 million 
in excess profit. The type of cluster bombs at issue contain 202 fist-size 
bombs to attack tanks and personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the consent decree, the two firms agreed to trim about $8 million from 
the price of the bombs and pay a $4.1-million penalty to the government. 
</P>
<P>
 The government said the Army never agreed to the teaming arrangement. But the 
two firms sharply disputed that, saying they formed the venture in an effort to 
save the government money and that the Army had approved the arrangement. The 
Justice Department only later "argued that the Army did not have authority to 
approve the teaming arrangement, and Aerojet became the victim of an internal 
government squabble between two agencies," Aerojet said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Pentagon has not interfered in a number of large mergers in 
recent years, defense executives have become increasingly concerned about the 
threat of antitrust actions as the pace of the industry's consolidation 
quickens.

 Norman Augustine, chairman of Martin Marietta Corp., said in a speech last 
year before the American Bar Assn. that the industry's consolidation "will more 
and more come into conflict with antitrust" actions, particularly as the number 
of suppliers for individual weapons begins to erode. 
</P>
<P>
 "It simply does not make sense, under the guise of competition, to keep two 
suppliers in business when there is not enough business to support even one," 
Augustine said. He argued that the defense industry is unique because of the 
government's unusual power in the marketplace to regulate it.

INVESTORS' ATTORNEY ASKS FOR $780 MILLION FROM PRUDENTIAL; SECURITIES: HE TELLS 
JUDGE TO REJECT $90.7-MILLION CLASS-ACTION SETTLEMENT BECAUSE MORE EVIDENCE OF 
FRAUD HAS EMERGED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 In what may be the closest thing to a public trial that investors in 
Prudential Securities' limited partnerships ever get, a federal judge Wednesday 
heard sharply opposing arguments over whether he should approve a $90.7-million 
class-action settlement for customers of the biggest of the firm's many failed 
partnership programs. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Marcel Livaudais Jr. is to decide if the settlement is 
fair to investors in Prudential's Energy Income Funds oil and gas partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
 The package is far more generous than one he derailed nearly a year ago. But 
lawyers for some investors contend that evidence of massive fraud has emerged 
since then, including findings by the Securities and Exchange Commission that 
Prudential committed extensive wrongdoing. For that reason, they argue, 
investors deserve far more. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Stuart C. Goldberg argued Wednesday that $780 million would be a more 
reasonable sum. He contended that the firm lied in its prospectuses and 
returned investors' own money to them disguised as profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg pledged to present evidence today that the partnerships were "a very 
complex Ponzi scheme" directed mainly at elderly customers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the firm's first detailed defense in open court, Prudential lawyer Scott 
Muller contended that the pending settlement offer was the best investors could 
hope for, because they are not likely to win in a full-scale trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Muller insisted that the partnerships were sound investments that lost money 
only because of the unforeseen collapse of oil prices in 1986. In a seeming 
contradiction of the SEC's October findings -- which the brokerage at the time 
accepted without admitting or denying guilt -- Muller denied that Prudential 
was guilty of any systemic fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no fraud at all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A large group of class-action lawyers for investors -- including most who had 
objected to the earlier offer as inadequate -- joined Muller in urging 
Livaudais to approve this one. The lawyers stand to share more than $20 million 
in legal fees if he does. 
</P>
<P>
 For investors, the settlement now on the table would make whole less than 80% 
of their out-of-pocket losses, with no interest for the lost use of their 
funds. Overall, Prudential would pay $90.7 million, down from its earlier 
$120-million offer because nearly 16,000 investors have opted to pursue 
independent legal claims rather than participate in the class action. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors are automatically bound by the settlement terms unless they 
indicated their preference to opt out before last Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
 More than 130,000 investors put $1.44 billion into the Energy Income Funds 
from 1983 to 1990. The vast majority suffered heavy losses.

BANKAMERICA'S QUARTERLY, ANNUAL EARNINGS IMPROVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Due to lower loan charge-offs, BankAmerica Corp. reported improved 
fourth-quarter and annual earnings Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The parent of Bank of America said its quarterly profit was $496 million, up 
5% from $486 million in the fourth quarter of 1992.For all of 1993, BofA's 
profit was $1.95 billion, up 31% from $1.49 billion in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Brent Erensel, of UBS Securities, noted the continuing decline in the bank's 
net interest income -- the difference between what it receives in payments on 
loans and other assets and what it pays out to depositors. 
</P>
<P>
 "They aren't unique in the industry, and BofA faces the special challenge of 
trying to generate revenue in a weak California economy," Erensel said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Paine Webber bank analyst Lawrence W. Cohn said he was encouraged by 
the slight increase in BofA's total loans over the three months ended Dec. 31 
-- the first quarter-to-quarter increase since the bank merged with Security 
Pacific in April, 1992. That could mean that California's economy "has finally 
hit bottom and is showing some growth," Cohn said. 
</P>
<P>
 BankAmerica stock fell $1.125 to $46.50 in New York Stock Exchange trading 
Wednesday. With $187 billion in assets, Bank of America is the nation's 
second-largest bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The higher fourth-quarter profit was a result of the decline in the bank's 
loan-loss provision, to $150 million from $270 million reported in the fourth 
quarter of 1992. For all of 1993, the bank's bad-loan write-offs were $803 
million, down from $1.01 billion in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank continues to clean up its bad loans. Non-accrual loans and 
foreclosures totaled $3.4 billion in 1993, compared to $5.7 billion in 1992.

 The Internal Revenue Service informed Pennzoil Co. that it could owe $956.5 
million in back taxes and interest associated with a $3-billion legal 
settlement received from Texaco Inc. in 1988. Pennzoil disputed the findings 
and said it will take the matter to court if necessary. . . . Chase Manhattan 
Corp. increased its quarterly dividend by 10% to 33 cents a share and announced 
a plan to grant all of its employees performance-based stock options.

 Seagram Raises Time Warner Stake Again: The liquor and beverage company said 
in an SEC filing that it raised its ownership in the media and entertainment 
giant to 11.7% from 10.4%. Seagram said it spent $207.2 million from Dec. 31 
through Wednesday to add 5.14 million shares to its holdings, which now total 
44.23 million shares.Seagram said it paid from $39 to $44.37 a share. Seagram, 
led by Edgar Bronfman Jr., has previously denied it plans to launch a hostile 
bid for Time Warner, but it said it may buy up to 15% of the company's stock. A 
Time Warner spokesman declined to comment on the latest purchase or Time 
Warner's stance on inviting a Seagram representative to join the board.

 McDonnell Douglas Posts Big Loss: Citing a previously announced $450-million 
pretax charge related to its troubled C-17 cargo plane project, the company 
said it posted a $132-million loss for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, 
contrasted with a profit of $762 million a year earlier. But excluding that 
charge and other onetime items, McDonnell's operating earnings jumped to $143 
million, or $3.63 a share, from $86 million, despite a 21% drop in revenue to 
$3.63 billion, from $4.62 billion.For all of 1993, the St. Louis-based 
aerospace giant earned $396 million, contrasted with a $781-million loss the 
prior year, which mainly stemmed from a change in McDonnell's accounting for 
retiree health care. McDonnell's annual revenue dropped 17% to $14.5 billion, 
from $17.4 billion.

 Southwest to Buy 63 Boeing Jets: Boeing Co. will sell Southwest Airlines 63 of 
its next-generation 737-700 jetliners for undisclosed terms, the companies 
said.Under the definitive agreement, Seattle-based Boeing will deliver the 
aircraft from late 1997 through 2001. In November, Dallas-based Southwest said 
it intended to be the first airline to use the new twin jet, which can carry 
128 passengers in two classes or 137 passengers in a single class. The 
no-frills carrier, which flies to 37 cities nationwide, said it also has 
options to buy an additional 63 737-700s.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; AS IN OTHER RECENT DISASTERS, EARTHQUAKE 
PROVIDES A QUICK JOLT TO SALES OF CELLULAR PHONES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

 Minutes after Monday's earthquake knocked out phone service in his Park La 
Brea district apartment, David Sargeant dashed to his car and retrieved his 
cellular phone. Almost immediately, it rang. It was his mother calling from her 
home in Hancock Park on her cellular phone. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was my lifeline," said Sargeant, an account executive at public relations 
firm Hill & Knowlton in Los Angeles. "I had no phone, no cable, no other 
communication." 
</P>
<P>
 Most Angelenos affected by the quake didn't have a cellular lifeline to the 
world. But with Pacific Bell's fiber-optic network damaged and phone service 
still on major overload Wednesday, several cellular phone retailers said 
business was booming. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate to say that it's good for business, but it has been, it has actually 
contributed," said Pactel spokeswoman Melissa May. "There are businesses buying 
blocks of phones to set aside for emergencies and individuals citing safety and 
security as their No. 1 reason." 
</P>
<P>
 Modesto Leon, director of the Soledad Enrichment Action Program in East Los 
Angeles, said he bought his cellular phone Tuesday morning as he scrambled to 
find a new location for the class he had planned to teach at a Pacoima church 
damaged in the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had come all the way back here and tried to call, it would have been too 
late," Leon said. "I think I put 100 minutes on it just in the last two days." 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of cellular phones have jumped during each of Los Angeles' recent string 
of emergencies, including the 1992 riots and last fall's fires. While the 
area's cellular system was overloaded immediately following Monday's temblor, 
cellular signals are less susceptible to physical damage than traditional phone 
service, which relies on copper wire or fiber cable. 
</P>
<P>
 But analysts say that although there may be a brief rush on cellular phones 
over the next several weeks, consumers will not buy them en masse until the 
prices come down. 
</P>
<P>
 The typical base rate for a cellular phone is 45 cents per minute. Pacific 
Bell offers unlimited local calling for $8.35 per month for normal phone 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 Other factors, such as massive damage to the region's roadways, may detract 
from sales at some cellular phone outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are on La Cienega Boulevard, and the way most people access our shop is 
the 10 Freeway," said Shawn Javidzad, manager of American Way Cellular. "People 
call in and want to buy phones, but they can't get to us!"

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; Q&A; 
RELIEF IS AVAILABLE FOR THOSE WHOSE HOMES WERE DAMAGED BY QUAKE

 Monday's devastating temblor left many homeowners, buyers, sellers and renters 
asking questions about paying their mortgages, replacing necessities, making 
repairs, seeking property tax relief and other matters. Here are answers to 
those and other questions: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Must I continue making mortgage payments if my house was damaged or 
destroyed? A. While payments are technically due regardless of damage, many 
lenders are allowing customers to defer payments for several months. Bank of 
America, for example, will give existing customers a payment moratorium of up 
to three months. Union Bank and Countrywide Mortgage also say they'll work out 
deferred-payment arrangements with borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What about paying my credit card and home equity loans? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Same deal. Payments are due but, if you contact your lender, you may be 
able to delay payments or even increase your credit line for emergency 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 But shop carefully and ask a lot of questions -- hundreds of dollars in 
interest costs can hang in the balance. For instance, Bank of America will 
increase credit lines for its existing Visa and MasterCard customers who are 
earthquake victims. But the bank is also offering unsecured lines of credit of 
up to $7,500 for victims. 
</P>
<P>
 If you take the credit card deal, you'll pay between 16.9% and 19.8% interest, 
depending on whether you have the variable- or fixed-rate card. If you take the 
personal line of credit instead, you get a 5% loan for up to four years. 
</P>
<P>
 You'd pay at least $238 more annually for borrowing $2,000 against the credit 
card instead of borrowing the same amount on the credit line. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. My next property tax installment is due Feb. 10, but my house was damaged. 
Can I get property tax relief? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Yes. If you suffered more than $5,000 in home damage, contact your county 
assessor's office. In Los Angeles County, that's (213) 974-7394; in Ventura 
County, (805) 654-2181. Ask for two forms, one seeking a reassessment of 
property damaged by "misfortune or calamity," and another seeking a temporary 
deferral of payment. File both forms within 60 days of the date the damage 
occurred and include photographs. 
</P>
<P>
 The assessor's office will send out an appraiser to determine the extent of 
the damage and reassess your home. If you've owned the home for a long period, 
however, don't expect the reassessment to fully account for the cost of damage, 
said Kenneth P. Hahn, Los Angeles County assessor. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because Proposition 13 has kept your property tax assessment 
artificially low. Assessors will "pro-rate" tax reductions based on the 
difference between the true market value of your home and the value for 
property tax purposes. So if your house is worth $100,000 but is assessed at 
only $70,000 because of limitations from Proposition 13, your $10,000 lost 
chimney may reduce your tax assessment by $7,000 -- or the pro-rated value of 
the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. My house wasn't hurt by the quake, but some of my neighbors have damage. 
I've got my house up for sale. Is this going to affect its salability or price? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Generally, home values suffer in disaster areas for several months, partly 
because the neighborhood doesn't have its usual luster. But, assuming that your 
neighbors get their houses repaired, prices should bounce back up relatively 
soon. If there's no real reason why you must move in the wake of the disaster, 
you might want to hang on to the house a few extra months to get the benefit of 
the bounce. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I've had substantial damage to my home, but I'm debating about repairing it 
now because of the constant aftershocks. If I wait, will I jeopardize my 
insurance coverage? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Not usually. The only time your insurance would be affected is if you were 
negligent about securing your belongings. In other words, if your chimney fell 
down, exposing part of your home to outdoor weather, the insurer would expect 
you to seal off the opening so rain didn't come in and cause more damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than that, you should immediately make any repairs that are necessary to 
ensure your safety and the safety of your family and guests. If these repairs 
need to be done twice because aftershocks damaged the repairs, the insurer will 
pay to fix it again. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I don't have earthquake insurance and I had substantial losses. Can I get a 
tax deduction? 
</P>
<P>
 A. For very substantial losses, yes. However, to claim a so-called casualty 
loss, you must have unreimbursed damage in excess of 10% of your annual income, 
plus $100. In other words, if you earn $50,000 a year, you can write off 
damages only in excess of $5,100. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that once an area has been officially designated a federal 
disaster area, you have the option of claiming your casualty loss on the 
previous year's tax return. That would allow you to get a refund processed 
immediately and have the money when you need it. 
</P>
<P>
 It also gives you the option of claiming the loss in the year -- this year or 
last -- when you would be eligible for the greatest casualty loss deduction. If 
your income was lower last year than this year, for example, you would get a 
bigger deduction because the 10% threshold would be lower. (If you earned 
$40,000, you can write off losses exceeding $4,100.)  
</P>
<P>
 But casualty loss claims can trigger a tax audit. So keep receipts, 
photographs and other appropriate documentation to substantiate the claim.

COMPUTER FILE / RICHARD O'REILLY: NEW OS/2 IS CHEAP, CHOOSY, COMPLEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD O'REILLY, RICHARD O'REILLY is director of computer analysis for The 
Times.

<TEXT>
<P>
 IBM Corp. is offering a special version of its powerful multi-tasking 
operating system, OS/2 2.1, at a bargain price of $49 to computer users who 
already have DOS and Windows. 
</P>
<P>
 The question is, will it make your life in front of the computer easier or 
harder? The answer is not simple. 
</P>
<P>
 This latest, cheapest version of OS/2 bears the somewhat misleading name of 
OS/2 for Windows, leading some to believe that it is a special kind of OS/2 
that runs under Windows. 
</P>
<P>
 It is, in fact, standard OS/2 2.1 but without IBM's emulation of Windows 3.1. 
It does not run under Windows. You can run Windows programs under OS/2, but to 
do so with this version you must already have Microsoft's Windows 3.1 installed 
when you install OS/2 for Windows. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll also need the original diskettes from which Windows was installed on 
your computer, because several Windows files must be read from those diskettes 
during the OS/2 installation. (Computers sold with Windows pre-loaded on the 
hard disk usually come with original diskettes for the software or a special 
utility program that will copy the pre-installed programs to diskettes.)

 This new release of OS/2 2.1 benefits from about a year of debugging the 
original release of version 2.1. In addition, it includes Multimedia 
Presentation Manager/2 with excellent sound, graphics and digital video 
capabilities compatible with most popular hardware systems. 
</P>
<P>
 But I couldn't find any performance advantage using OS/2 for Windows compared 
to the regular version of OS/2 2.1. In fact, Microsoft's Windows ran slightly 
slower than IBM's Win OS/2 emulation of Windows in the standard release of OS/2 
2.1. In both cases, Windows programs run slower than under Windows on a DOS 
computer. However, DOS programs usually run as well or better under OS/2 than 
they do in DOS. 
</P>
<P>
 I compared Windows program speed by running a macro in a Microsoft Excel 4.0 
spreadsheet that took nearly three minutes to complete its task. On the 
average, compared to Windows under DOS, the macro ran 11% slower under OS/2 for 
Windows. When I ran it in the regular edition of OS/2 2.1, the macro was 8% 
slower than Windows under DOS. All the tests were on the same 486, 50-megahertz 
computer using identical hard drives. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 There is much to admire about OS/2 and, in fact, it has been praised in nearly 
every review in the computer trade press. But it is not for casual computer 
users and definitely not for novices. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a multi-tasking operating system, and if you don't need to run two or 
more programs simultaneously, especially DOS programs or a combination of DOS 
and Windows programs, there is little reason to move to OS/2. Despite IBM's 
claims of ease of use, it is complicated and takes about 30 megabytes of disk 
storage that you could use other ways. 
</P>
<P>
 There isn't much general-use office software specifically for OS/2, and that 
isn't likely to change, since most publishers are concentrating on Windows 
programs. Despite that, some companies have made excellent use of OS/2 to run 
specially designed software tailored to their particular needs. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are the kind of user who constantly runs up against the memory 
constraints of DOS and Windows, and you are comfortable dealing with the 
technical aspects of computer software, then OS/2 may offer significant 
advantages. For instance, I found that a mapping program that demands the full 
attention of my DOS and Windows computer ran just fine under an OS/2 window, 
allowing me to instantly switch back and forth among other programs. I also had 
no trouble switching back and forth between a memory-gobbling game -- Flight 
Simulator 5.0 -- and other applications. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, if you're a programmer or just truly adventurous, OS/2 is a delight 
because it lets you tailor the way the computer allocates memory and other 
resources to each program you want to run in as much detail as you could 
possibly desire. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The price for such flexibility is complication. 
</P>
<P>
 I installed OS/2 for Windows on one of IBM's premier laptop computers, the 
ThinkPad 720C. It took about an hour and 15 minutes, because at the end of the 
15th and last disk to be copied, the installation program froze up. I had to 
start over, but the second time things worked fine. 
</P>
<P>
 However, after it was loaded, OS/2 would not work with my IBM modem. An IBM 
technician faxed me a set of instructions to solve the problem. There was a 
mistake in those instructions, but they got me close enough that I could solve 
the remaining error on my own. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the modem problem illustrates how finicky OS/2 is. OS/2 has a 
start-up file called CONFIG.SYS (just like in DOS, only much more complicated) 
that contains about 90 lines of instructions telling the computer how to behave 
when it starts. I had to rearrange the order in which 10 of those lines appear 
in order to get the modem to work. 
</P>
<P>
 The few programs I tested ran fine, but the OS/2 manual lists about 20 pages 
of popular DOS and Windows programs for which special tweaking is needed in 
OS/2 to get them to run. There is also a page listing programs that won't run 
in OS/2 at all. 
</P>
<P>
 There are plenty of compatibility problems in the world of DOS and Windows 
too, but at least software publishers usually can be counted on to fix those 
problems. You cannot rely on them to also make sure their programs are 
OS/2-compatible.

SPORTS MERCHANT OFFERS TO SETTLE NIKE SUIT; LITIGATION: NEWPORT MAN WILLING TO 
END LEGAL FIGHT IF ATHLETIC ATTIRE GIANT CONTRIBUTES $1 MILLION TO QUAKE RELIEF 
AND OTHER CHARITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sports merchandiser James H. Warsaw said Wednesday that he wants to settle a 
lawsuit he filed against Nike Inc. by having the athletic products giant donate 
$700,000 worth of apparel to earthquake victims and $300,000 in cash to other 
charitable causes. 
</P>
<P>
 Warsaw, former president of Nike's Sports Specialties Corp. subsidiary in 
Irvine, said he would drop his portion of the fraud and breach-of-contract suit 
that he and his brother filed two months ago if the Beaverton, Ore., company 
agrees to make the donations, which would provide it with substantial tax 
benefits as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsay Stewart, Nike's general counsel, said Warsaw's offer is a "novel idea" 
that the company would consider should he make a formal settlement offer. 
However, he said, Nike maintains that it owes nothing to Warsaw or to his 
brother, Robert Warsaw, who was chief executive of Sports Specialties. 
</P>
<P>
 Were Nike to agree to such a plan, it would put such a donation on a par with 
what some major companies like Anhueser-Busch Cos. are committing to the 
earthquake recovery. The St. Louis brewery said Wednesday that it would 
contribute $1 million to the relief effort. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warsaw brothers had expanded their father's company, which distributes Pro 
brand caps, and helped to engineer its sale to Nike last January for more than 
$75 million. The brothers stayed on to run the subsidiary, but their family 
business philosophy soon clashed with Nike's corporate culture, and the 
brothers quit in November. 
</P>
<P>
 James Warsaw, a Newport Beach resident, said he has been calling Nike founder 
and chairman Phil Knight to discuss his settlement proposal but hasn't reached 
him yet. Knight has been out of town, Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started thinking last night (Tuesday) that this million-dollar suit is 
petty compared to what's going on in the areas damaged by the earthquakes," 
Warsaw said. "All this suit is going to do is pay a lot of attorneys and maybe 
myself. There are people suffering tremendously from the earthquake who are a 
lot worse off than Jim Warsaw." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he had been planning for several weeks to try to settle the lawsuit by 
asking Nike to contribute to charitable groups, but was prompted to act by the 
earthquake and the death Monday of former University of Arizona basketball 
coach Fred Snowden, the first African American basketball coach at a major 
university. 
</P>
<P>
 Under his as-yet-unofficial proposal, Warsaw would ask Nike to contribute 
$700,000 worth of shoes, jackets, caps and other apparel to earthquake victims, 
donate $200,000 to a University of Arizona scholarship fund set up in Snowden's 
memory and donate $100,000 to the James H. Warsaw Sports Marketing Center, an 
endowment established last fall at the University of Oregon's College of 
Business Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim's pretty upset about what happened with Nike, and he's also upset about 
the earthquake," said Richard L. Fahrney II, a lawyer the Warsaws recently 
retained to take over the litigation with Nike. 
</P>
<P>
 Warsaw said his proposal applies only to him, not to his brother, who also is 
seeking $1 million in damages. Fahrney said that James Warsaw did not provide 
him with all the details of the settlement proposal. Robert Warsaw has not 
joined in his brother's idea yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the creativity, but I'm sure there's a lot more to this proposal than 
he has stated," the lawyer said. "There are other elements to explore, like 
what happens to the business the Warsaws sold." 
</P>
<P>
 The Warsaws claim Nike broke promises from the start about how Sports 
Specialties was to be operated. The brothers believe that Nike simply wanted 
the valuable licenses the company held with all the professional and major 
collegiate leagues and a host of national teams worldwide.

2 COMPANIES SELL MOST NEW HOMES IN O.C. IN 1993; HOUSING: KAUFMAN & BROAD AND 
THE IRVINE CO. TOP THE LIST OF BUILDERS IN A YEAR DOMINATED BY THE FIRST-TIME 
BUYER, STUDY SHOWS. 
</P>

 Kaufman & Broad Home Corp. and the Irvine Co. dominated a list of builders 
selling the most new homes in Orange County in 1993, a year where buyers were 
on the lookout for bargains and good neighborhoods, according to a study by a 
Newport Beach real estate consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "The home buyer last year was looking for value and location," said Stephen 
Smiley, managing director with the Meyers Group. "Many of these were sold to 
the first-time home buyer."  
</P>
<P>
 Prices of last year's best selling condominiums and townhomes ranged from 
about $75,000 to $165,000 and detached homes sold from $175,000 to about 
$250,000, Smiley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The most popular communities were close to freeway arteries, targeted for 
easier commuting. Most of the sales were in South Orange County, with two home 
projects located in Mission Viejo, one in Aliso Viejo and one each in Trabuco 
Canyon and Foothill Ranch. Three of the best-selling projects were in the 
central part of the county, in Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 Smiley said that as a result of the real estate downturn, which knocked some 
developers out of business, buyers are scrutinizing the developer more closely. 
"It's no surprise that seven out of the top 10 builders are Kaufman & Broad and 
the Irvine Co.," said Smiley. "People want a developer who is going to be 
around to fix things if there are problems." 
</P>
<P>
 The best selling housing project was Rancho Vera Cruz in Tustin, a condominium 
community with 317 units priced from $90,000 to $150,000, of which 124 units 
were sold in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think buyers were attracted by the architectural character of Rancho Vera 
Cruz. It's not just a box that delivers on price," said Rudy Svrcek, vice 
president of sales and marketing for the Irvine Co., which through its Irvine 
Pacific subsidiary built Rancho Vera Cruz. The other two Irvine Co. projects on 
the list were Mandevilla and Cantada, a pair of Tustin condominium projects. 
</P>
<P>
 These homes -- built next to a golf course and with a pool, spa and recreation 
area -- were recently converted from rental apartments to condos. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the best selling projects on the Meyers Group list were developed by 
Los Angeles-based Kaufman & Broad, including the top ranking detached housing 
project, California Ridge in Trabuco Canyon. "Location, location, location, 
price, price, price -- that's what buyers were looking for in 1993," said 
Roland Osgood, president of Kaufman & Broad's south coast division. "They were 
looking for value." 
</P>
<P>
 California Ridge, with 120 home lots of about 5,000 square feet each, sold 96 
homes last year. Buyers are attracted by the relatively large lots and its 
location in the hills between Foothill Ranch and Portola Hills, Osgood said.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you were a 12-year-old boy and saw the hills around our project, it's 
where you'd want to live," said Osgood. The homes sell for between $190,000 and 
$220,000, Osgood said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cinnamon Tree, the fourth best-selling project in the county, sold 88 of its 
91 attached units during two auctions last year, Smiley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vineyards, a 256-unit condominium project in Foothill Ranch, was ranked 
eighth, with 80 sales during the year. The project, which opened in April, 
1993, has homes ranging in price from $125,000 to $160,000.  
</P>
<P>
 "Vineyards is targeted to the first-time home buyer," said Dan Nahabedian, 
manager of land acquisition for John Laing Homes, which is based in Laguna 
Hills. "We think the move-up market is still struggling, so the best market to 
be in is for the first-time buyer. We also like being in Foothill Ranch because 
there is less attached product out there than in other places." Tops In Sales 
</P>
<P>
 New-home developments by Irvine Pacific and Kaufman & Broad were hot sellers 
last year. Kaufman & Broad had four developments in Orange County's top 10, and 
Irvine Co. subsidiaries posted three, including No. 1-selling Rancho Vera Cruz 
in Tustin.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: FORMER RESTAURANT ENTERPRISES GROUP SELLS BONDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As part of its bankruptcy reorganization, the former Restaurant Enterprises 
Group sold $450 million in bonds Wednesday in order to retire old debt and pay 
for the acquisition of 237 Chi-Chi's Mexican-style restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 The bonds carried a higher-than-normal interest rate because they were 
non-investment grade.Investor interest in riskier bonds is stronger these days 
because the securities pay higher returns than comparable fixed-income 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, a Delaware bankruptcy court approved the Irvine-based restaurant 
company's reorganization plan and its bond sale. The company changed its name 
to Family Restaurants Inc. and will end up with 682 full-service family and 
Mexican restaurants in 34 states. 
</P>
<P>
 In a complicated reorganization, Foodmaker Inc. in San Diego and two 
investment partners will acquire the former REG, which operates the El Torito 
Mexican restaurant chain and the Carrow's and Coco's chains. 
</P>
<P>
 REG acquired the Chi-Chi's restaurants, most of which are in the East. 
</P>
<P>
 The reorganization calls for a cash infusion plan by Foodmaker and two 
investors, Apollo Advisers L.P. in New York and Green Equity Investors L.P. of 
Los Angeles, which will put a total of $95 million in cash into the restaurant 
company. The plan also calls for the company to enter into a $150-million 
credit agreement with Credit Lyonnais. Both actions are expected to be 
completed later this month.

SHAREHOLDER'S SUIT MAY STALL FHP TAKEOVER; MERGER: THE CHAIRMAN OF TAKECARE IN 
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA REJECTED A HIGHER OFFER IN FAVOR OF A LOWER BID BY THE 
FOUNTAIN VALLEY HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATION, THE SUIT ALLEGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shareholders with a 22% stake in a Northern California health maintenance 
organization have filed a lawsuit that could complicate the company's plan to 
be taken over by rival FHP International Corp. in Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit alleges that the chairman of TakeCare Inc., an HMO based in 
Concord, engineered the board's rejection of a takeover offer in favor of a 
lower acquisition bid by FHP. That way, the suit alleges, TakeCare Chairman 
Jack R. Anderson would be able to convert his stock to cash. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed Monday in Delaware Chancery Court, contends that Anderson 
breached his fiduciary duties by maneuvering behind the scenes to ensure that 
FHP's bid was accepted by the board over an allegedly superior, all-stock bid 
by United HealthCare Corp. of Minnetonka, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
 TakeCare spokesman David Briere refuted the allegations, saying, "We feel the 
suit is without merit, and a majority of the board have approved proceeding 
with FHP." 
</P>
<P>
 FHP, which is also named as a defendant in the suit, would not comment. 
</P>
<P>
 FHP announced Jan. 10 that it has agreed to buy TakeCare for $829 million, or 
$62 a share, with 35% of the acquisition price in cash, 15% in common stock and 
50% in convertible preferred stock. The takeover would create one of the 
largest HMOs in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 The acquisition would allow FHP, which has 851,000 members, to expand its 
Medicare market into Northern California and Colorado, where TakeCare is 
already successful. TakeCare has 742,000 members. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit alleges that TakeCare's board voted 5 to 3 to accept the FHP bid on 
Jan. 5, shortly after rejecting an offer from United of 0.85 share of United 
common stock for each share of TakeCare. At that day's closing price, the 
United offer was worth $64.70 a share -- $2.70 more than FHP's winning bid. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit alleges that Anderson went to extraordinary lengths to persuade 
reluctant board members to support the FHP transaction, including promising to 
award the company's president, R. Judd Jessup, a $5-million bonus, allegedly 10 
times his salary, on completion of the FHP takeover. The suit alleges that the 
board was not told about the bonus before it was promised. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit contends that Jessup, who is a member of the board, favored the 
United bid at a Dec. 18 directors meeting, but on Jan. 5 voted for the FHP 
proposal. When questioned by two dissenting board members, Russell Ayres III 
and Richard M. Johnston, Jessup said, "I cannot vote against my chairman," the 
suit contends. 
</P>
<P>
 The bidding process, the suit alleges, was "single-mindedly directed by 
Anderson from the outset to deliver TakeCare to whatever bidder will allow 
Anderson to convert a substantial portion of his TakeCare holdings to cash." 
</P>
<P>
 When a board member at the Dec. 18 board meeting suggested hiring an 
investment bank to evaluate the two bids, Anderson said that he would 
personally select the bidder and that TakeCare would hire an investment bank 
only in the final stages to "rubber stamp" the transaction, the suit alleges. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit also contends that United asked the directors for permission to raise 
its bid shortly after the Jan. 5 board meeting. The board rejected that request 
before signing its agreement with FHP on Jan. 9, the suit alleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Plaintiffs include the investment firms United Vanguard Fund Inc., United 
Funds, United New Concepts Fund Inc., United Continental Income Fund Inc. and 
Waddell & Reed Funds Inc. Growth Fund. Among them the firms own roughly 525,000 
shares of TakeCare's common stock, or about 4% of outstanding shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Other plaintiffs include The Hillman Foundation Inc., which is described as a 
not-for-profit corporation based in Pittsburgh. The Hillman Foundation and four 
affiliated organizations that are also plaintiffs own 2.3 million TakeCare 
shares, an 18% stake. 
</P>
<P>
 Also named as defendants besides FHP and TakeCare are the five board members 
who voted for the FHP offer: Anderson, Jessup, Richard Burdge Sr., George E. 
Bello, and Robert W. Jamplis. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit asks the court for a preliminary injunction to block the FHP buyout 
of TakeCare. It alleges that a so-called lockup provision in the agreement that 
would give FHP $25 million if the transaction is not consummated is an illegal 
impediment to competing bids.

BRIEFCASE: THE WORKPLACE; COUNTY JOBS OUTLOOK LOOKS BETTER THAN IN THE REST OF

 Job prospects in Orange County may be slightly better than in the rest of 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent survey, more managers here than elsewhere said they plan to hire 
during the next six months.Thomas Temporaries spoke with 200 local managers, 
24% of whom said they will be adding workers. Across the region, however, only 
21% of the 1,200 executives surveyed said they plan to hire in the first half 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's numbers also look better than last year's, when only 21% of 
local executives said they would be expanding their payrolls. 
</P>
<P>
 As for layoffs, only 9% of managers in Orange County plan to reduce staffing 
this year -- the same proportion as in 1993. By contrast, this year 14% of 
Southern California executives plan to lay off workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you look at the entire Southland, Orange and San Diego County businesses 
are better positioned to recover quickly from the recession than other 
counties," said Gene C. Wilson, president of Thomas Temporaries in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because the two counties "have a solid base of new companies in growth 
industries such as the health-care, high-tech and biomedical fields," he said.

 Career Flexibility: Time was you got out of school, went to work and stayed in 
the same business your entire life. People who grew up in the Great Depression 
wanted that kind of security, and those who changed careers were viewed as 
flaky and unreliable. 
</P>
<P>
 No more. Now it's the norm to move from company to company -- and even to 
another industry -- in the course of a career. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, with all the changes going on in the workplace these days, people 
have to be more flexible about careers. The old days are over, and they won't 
come back. 
</P>
<P>
 So says Shena Crane, an Irvine career counselor, who has a book coming out 
from Vista Press in a few days titled, "What Do I Do Now? Making Sense of 
Today's Changing Workplace." 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, in order to do well or just survive, people must revise their ideas 
about careers and jobs," writes Crane, who runs a company called Mentor Career 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those who continue to plan careers and pursue jobs based on yesterday's 
realities will have a tough time succeeding."

GALBRAITH STILL A STANDOUT AMONG ECONOMISTS; PROFILE: AT 85, AFTER MUCH WAXING 
AND WANING OF HIS POPULARITY OVER THE DECADES, 'THE MOST FAMOUS PROFESSOR AT 
HARVARD' SEES HIS VIEWS BACK IN VOGUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN YENKIN, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For decades, John Kenneth Galbraith etched his opinions into the nation's 
psyche as a prolific writer, as a presidential adviser and, as some colleagues 
call him, "the most famous professor at Harvard." 
</P>
<P>
 His liberal views have not always been embraced, especially in the 1980s when 
the White House sought to shrink the role of government. But now, with 
Americans fixed on enormous issues such as health care and the economy, there 
are echoes of the old economist's views in much of the discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 At age 85, he's back in vogue. 
</P>
<P>
 "His influence has been great," says Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich. "Ken 
Galbraith's influence can be felt not only in the insistence that every 
American have access to high-quality health care, but also in the confidence 
that we as a nation can accomplish that feat." 
</P>
<P>
 Even some of his adversaries acknowledge Galbraith's ideology is holding sway 
these days. Says the Nobel-winning conservative economist Milton Friedman: 
"Galbraith is clearly in the vanguard." 
</P>
<P>
 In typical fashion, Galbraith deflects such compliments with dry wit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't accept vindication," he said. "I just adhere to the same position 
year after year." 
</P>
<P>
 But Galbraith too sees the pendulum swinging back in his favor, particularly 
in the public's demand that the government cure the nation's ailing health care 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are seeing that some things can only be accomplished by the state, the 
government," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Galbraith's basic philosophy, outlined in books such as his 1958 bestseller 
"The Affluent Society," says capitalism cannot survive in a country that fails 
to help its needy through social programs such as housing, public schools and 
welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 To his admirers, Galbraith stands out for his ability to put a human face on 
economic theories. "Galbraith quite correctly understands the reason why 
capitalism survives is because government humanizes it," said historian Arthur 
Schlesinger Jr., a longtime friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Schlesinger also offers another, facetious reason why the 6-foot-8 Galbraith 
stands out: "He's taller than anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 But to Galbraith's critics, his height has been matched only by his fondness 
of big government that intrudes on a free market economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not a liberal economist," Friedman said. "He's a socialist." 
</P>
<P>
 Galbraith insists he does not take an adoring view toward government. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see government as good or bad," he said. "I see it as indispensable." 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a great many things in this world which can only be done by 
government," he added. "And therefore, it's not a question of whether 
government is efficient or inefficient, it's a question of making it better, 
because there's no alternative." 
</P>
<P>
 Galbraith says he did not see much of a need for government while growing up 
in the small town of Iona Station in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 "We needed public schools and could have used a little health care, but there 
was a high level of self-sufficiency," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But after he graduated from the University of Toronto in 1931, Galbraith moved 
to the United States, where he saw a country in the throes of the Great 
Depression, desperately needing government help. 
</P>
<P>
 After completing his studies and teaching several years at Harvard and 
Princeton universities, Galbraith began a career in public service, becoming a 
price control czar under President Franklin D. Roosevelt during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the public figures he has known, Galbraith said he revered Roosevelt 
the most. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of my generation did," he said. "We didn't make up our minds on an issue 
until we knew what Roosevelt wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 But the person for whom Galbraith had the greatest affection was John F. 
Kennedy. Galbraith was the late President's ambassador to India. 
</P>
<P>
 "My recollection of him is of a charming, intelligent and extremely effective 
man, who had one qualification -- he was always interesting," Galbraith said. 
</P>
<P>
 The admiration was mutual. In his book "A Thousand Days," Schlesinger writes 
how Kennedy "took pleasure in announcing that Galbraith was the best ambassador 
he had." Colleagues have described how Kennedy enjoyed Galbraith's prose so 
much that he would insist on seeing all his cables, regardless of whether they 
were directed at the President. 
</P>
<P>
 After Galbraith came back from India, he returned to teaching at Harvard, 
where he had earlier rejoined the faculty in 1948 and remained a professor of 
economics until his retirement in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in this role that Galbraith did much of his writing, gaining national 
acclaim. One colleague, Henry Rosovsky, has often told how he once took his car 
to a mechanic in New Jersey in 1966 and mentioned that he taught at Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ah," the mechanic said, "do you happen to know Professor Galbraith?" 
</P>
<P>
 In retirement, Galbraith keeps producing bestsellers such as "The Age of 
Uncertainty" and "Almost Everyone's Guide to Economics." 
</P>
<P>
 All told, Galbraith has written about 30 books and is now finishing up another 
that will recount his personal views of economic history since World War I. And 
once he is done with that book, he plans to start another one, describing his 
encounters with famous figures such as Roosevelt, Kennedy and former French 
President Charles de Gaulle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a book that would be an exercise in name-dropping," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Samuelson, the Nobel-winning economist from the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology and another longtime friend, said he is astounded by Galbraith's 
energy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's an amazingly imaginative and creative and hard-working person," 
Samuelson said. "There's no day that goes by that he doesn't write every 
morning, and it adds up to a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Galbraith, who lives a few blocks from Harvard Yard and still regularly 
attends events at the university, says he does not see himself kicking back and 
relaxing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid I might not die of boredom, but I might wish that I would," he 
said.

WORDS FROM THE WISE ECONOMIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When John Kenneth Galbraith expounds on his ideas, he chooses his words 
carefully, frequently recasting phrases moments after he utters them, as if 
each sentence were crafted to be a quote for the ages. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a sampling: 
</P>
<P>
 On the lessons learned from the Wall Street crash of 1929 and the merger mania 
of the 1980s: "There's no necessary association between intelligence and 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 On the usefulness of economic predictions: "I do not have a high regard for 
economic forecasting. I've always been cautious about it, partly because people 
have a wonderful memory for your wrong forecasts, but rarely for your right 
ones." 
</P>
<P>
 On the role of government serving the needy: "If you're rich, you can buy 
books. If you're poor, you need a library."

VERSATILE ATMS OFFER BOTH CONVENIENCE, HAZARDS TO CONSUMERS; BANKING: THE 
TECHNOLOGY CAN NOW EVEN HANDLE INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS. BUT WITH INNOVATION 
COMES PREDATORS. 
</P>

<P>
 As automated teller machine, or ATM, cards get more and more versatile and 
convenient, the job of handling them wisely and safely becomes more and more 
important as well. 
</P>
<P>
 ATMs started out about a decade ago as a way to allow 24-hour banking, for 
deposits of checks and withdrawals of cash without the need to have a human 
teller involved in every transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then their uses have multiplied. Many ATM cards now double as debit 
cards, with terminals in stores where consumers can use them instead of checks 
or cash at checkout counters to pay for goods of many kinds. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to nationwide and worldwide ATM networks, a card from a local bank, 
thrift or credit union now also can serve as a handy source of money for 
travelers in faraway places, making it unnecessary to carry large amounts of 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
 At some institutions, furthermore, they can even be used to invest money in, 
or withdraw it from, investments like mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of uses seems certain to keep increasing, aided by continuing 
advances in technology. But with all their benefits, ATM cards require careful 
handling, especially with regard to security. 
</P>
<P>
 The machines where they are used are natural magnets for thieves, robbers, con 
artists and other predators looking for ways to breach the security of the 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 "At night, use ATMs that are well-lighted, with a good view of the surrounding 
car and pedestrian traffic," counsels the Credit Union National Assn. "Try to 
have a friend accompany you. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anyone asks you to withdraw money from an ATM for any reason, leave at 
once and report the incident to police," says the association. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the cards themselves, any lost or stolen cards should be reported as 
soon as possible to the institution that issued them. "The amount you'll be 
responsible for depends on how quickly you report the loss," notes the National 
Coalition for Consumer Education in a booklet published with MasterCard 
International and the MasterCard subsidiary Maestro U.S.A. 
</P>
<P>
 The personal identification number, or PIN, used with the card represents an 
especially vulnerable point. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never give your PIN to anyone," says the consumer education group. "Do not 
write it on your ATM cash card or carry it in your wallet. Also, when selecting 
your PIN, avoid numbers and letters that can be easily associated with you." 
</P>
<P>
 Protecting your PIN also means preventing people from learning it by watching 
you punch it into a machine. The eavesdropper needn't be standing right next to 
you -- it can be someone "shoulder surfing" with binoculars a long distance 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 Receipts produced by ATMs also need to be treated as security risks, not left 
behind carelessly at or near the machines. 
</P>
<P>
 Suggests the the Credit Union National Assn.: "Take your receipt with you, and 
keep it to compare against your monthly statement as a way to guard your budget 
and avoid fraud." 
</P>
<P>
 It's also only sensible to be mindful of fees that you may be charged, or may 
avoid, when you use an ATM card. 
</P>
<P>
 The card can save you on checking account charges. But depending on the 
policies of the issuing institution, it may also be costly to use in certain 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Says the Credit Union National Assn.: "Retailer fees should be displayed at 
the checkout counter. Fees charged by a financial institution must be disclosed 
to you at the time you receive your card. 
</P>
<P>
 "The charges will also appear on your monthly checking account statement. Ask 
about fees before using your ATM cash card."

DISCOVERY OF 4 BODIES RAISES TOLL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 In a grisly reminder that there would be no cap on the quake's death toll 
until the rubble is cleared and the ground is still, authorities found four 
more bodies Tuesday night and Wednesday, bringing the number of earthquake 
victims to 47. 
</P>
<P>
 At what was once a majestic Studio City home, rescue teams returned early 
Wednesday for a third day of cutting and carving through crumbled walls and 
8,000 pounds of smashed Spanish tile in search of a 69-year-old woman, who 
authorities said was probably crushed in the initial quake. 
</P>
<P>
 They found the body of Beatrice Baitman on Wednesday night, buried under 20 
feet of rubble at her Sunswept Drive home. She was still in bed, said Rick 
Warford, Los Angeles City Fire Department battalion chief, and was still 
covered in blankets. 
</P>
<P>
 "My guess is that it was really quick," Warford said. "The ceiling and part of 
a wall came right down on top of her." 
</P>
<P>
 Aftershocks had hampered the search. The house, which collapsed and slid 30 
feet down a hillside in the Monday shock, shifted farther downward with each 
new jolt. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other members of the household had been rescued Monday. Using 
flashlights, neighbors took advantage of a lull in the house's lurching slide 
and pulled Michael Minkow, 49, and his wife, Lola Minkow, 46, from the imploded 
structure. Michael Minkow's mother, Rose Minkow, 75, was pinned in the rubble 
for four hours and suffered minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite rescue workers' belief that Baitman -- who was Lola Minkow's mother -- 
was dead, they wheeled in lights Wednesday and used chain saws and hydraulic 
lifts to try to find Baitman. They also used two kinds of dogs -- one trained 
to find the living and the other to locate the dead. 
</P>
<P>
 The house was the younger Minkows' dream house. The couple and their mothers 
moved in three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to see as much as we could of our parents in their older years," 
Michael Minkow said. "They (were) not going to be around forever." 
</P>
<P>
 The family pets, a dog and a cat, probably suffered the same fate as Baitman, 
Michael Minkow said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Van Nuys, two other quake victims were dug out Tuesday from beneath 
hundreds of pounds of collectibles that littered the couple's home. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert (Sarge) Pauline and Judith Ng ended up as victims of their hobbies: the 
ceiling-high piles of books, model trains, video equipment and papers that 
toppled onto their bed during Monday's quake. Neighbors and relatives became 
concerned and called police after Pauline and Ng had not returned phone calls. 
The quake had caused only moderate damage to their home. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were eccentric, but they were kind, friendly people," said Jeff Ng, the 
victim's brother, as he delved through hundreds of videocassette tapes, hoping 
to find a recorded will. "They collected things, stacks of stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Pauline, 72, and Ng, 42, stood out in their neat, well-kept Van Nuys 
neighborhood. Neighbors ignored the overgrown shrubs and vines that shielded 
the house from the street; Pauline watched over them and their children. 
Neighborhood young people, referring to his long white beard, called Pauline 
"Santa." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple met at Riverside City College. Ng had just graduated from high 
school and Pauline had retired from a 20-year career in the Marines, Jeff Ng 
said. They were married shortly after they met. 
</P>
<P>
 They were private, keeping their shelves of old letters, out-of-date 
calendars, stereo equipment and cameras hidden. Friends and even Ng's 
close-knit family were not invited inside, relatives said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If any of us had known about the mess, we'd have been breaking the door down 
a lot sooner to get them to clean up," Jeff Ng said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hits like lightning what a tragedy this is," Ng said. "You watch the news 
and you don't realize." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities also discovered the body of an unidentified 62-year-old Northridge 
man sitting in a parked car in front of a partially collapsed house. Although 
the official cause of death had not been established Wednesday evening, 
coroner's investigators listed it as quake-related and speculate that the man 
died of a heart attack, said LAPD Sgt. Richard Todd. 
</P>
<P>
 Another death, that of Olga Uribe, 26, of Pasadena, was reclassified as 
quake-related. Uribe was in the passenger seat of a car traveling through 
Sylmar when the driver lost control during the quake, said coroner's spokesman 
Scott Carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 In Studio City, Mindy Minkow, 20, watched as workers dug through the family 
home in search of her grandmother. Mindy Minkow had moved out of the house a 
month earlier and now lives in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone was begging me to come back home," she said. "For once, I guess not 
listening paid off."

MANY MALLS STAY CLOSED FOLLOWING EARTHQUAKE; RETAIL: THREE AREA SHOPPING 
CENTERS ARE OPEN. OTHERS HOPE TO BE BACK IN BUSINESS BY THE WEEKEND.

 Most San Fernando Valley-area shopping malls remained closed Wednesday as they 
began the arduous process of cleaning up and assessing the impact of Monday's 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Glendale Galleria, Panorama Mall in Panorama City and Antelope Valley 
Mall in Palmdale opened for business. A few others, including Media City Center 
in Burbank, the Promenade in Woodland Hills, Fallbrook Mall in Canoga Park and 
Valencia Town Center, remained closed, but hoped to reopen by the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 At the hardest-hit shopping mall, Northridge Fashion Center, a collapsed 
Bullock's department store has been condemned and two parking structures will 
have to be rebuilt. The fourth floor of the mall's J. C. Penney store fell into 
the third floor, and one of the toppled parking structures is leaning against 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 It hasn't been determined yet if that Penney store will need to be demolished 
and rebuilt, but J. C. Penney spokesman Hank Rusman said observers in a 
helicopter "marveled that it even survived." 
</P>
<P>
 Other stores in the Northridge mall, including Broadway and Sears, were also 
severely damaged. Engineers continued to pour through the rubble Wednesday, and 
it wasn't immediately known how long it would be before any part of the mall 
might reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Melillo, spokeswoman for R. H. Macy & Co., the parent company of 
Bullock's, said the company hasn't decided whether to rebuild its Northridge 
store. "At this point, we're still in the process of assessing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Melillo added that Macy has earthquake and other insurance covering its losses 
and the interruption of business. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Bullock's store, at Sherman Oaks Fashion Square, was also badly 
damaged by the quake but has not been condemned. Although part of the fourth 
floor fell into the third floor, Melillo said that building isn't considered a 
total loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The parking structure at Sherman Oaks Fashion Square was cracked in places, 
and areas of the mall are badly damaged by water from burst pipes, Marketing 
Director Sandy Turner said. The mall underwent a $60-million renovation in 1990 
that included the addition of a second shopping level and upgrading to 
then-current earthquake codes. In 1991, the center's Bullock's was renovated at 
a cost of $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Topanga Plaza in Canoga Park was also closed and had severe damage. 
Development Director John Lyda said there was no structural damage to the small 
shops in the mall, but broken glass and tile and damaged drywall would keep the 
mall closed for one to two weeks. Some hard goods merchants, such as housewares 
chain Crate & Barrel, lost much of their inventory, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not counting the department stores, Lyda said, quake damage at Topanga Plaza 
could total $1.5 million to $2 million.

<P>
 Engineers for Robinsons-May, Broadway, Montgomery Ward and Nordstrom were 
still assessing damage, Lyda said, but he estimated that those stores might be 
closed from one to three months. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Turner, a Broadway spokeswoman, said the Topanga Plaza store had 
structural damage, possibly as bad as its Northridge store. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurel Plaza in North Hollywood was also closed Wednesday, and management at 
the mall couldn't be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Glendale Galleria was open Wednesday, broken cement forced the 
closure of one of its parking structures near Nordstrom and Mervyn's. Nicolette 
Abernathy, marketing director at the mall, said the structure might reopen next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Panorama Mall escaped major earthquake damage, but Manager Mary Callahan said 
two men and one woman used a tire iron to break through a glass window Monday 
shortly after the quake. Jackets from Wilson's Suede & Leather and watches from 
Silva's Jewelers were stolen, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Media City Center in Burbank, general manager Allen Oblow said 90% of the 
water damage from the sprinkler system, broken glass and cracked plastic had 
been cleaned up by Wednesday. Most of the mall would be open today, but the 
entrance near Bullock's would remain closed due to ceiling damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrol Beals, general manager at Sherman Oaks Galleria, said damage was mainly 
from water and broken glass. But she said it wasn't known yet when the mall 
would reopen. "Everyone is working 'round the clock to clean things up," she 
said, "but services are stretched to the limit." 
</P>
<P>
 The Promenade, which completed a $40-million renovation last year that 
included upgrading the mall to current earthquake codes, might reopen this 
weekend, Marketing Director Elizabeth Pedersen-Knapp said. But individual 
department stores could remain closed for a few more days, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At least part of Valencia Town Center was due to reopen today, General Manager 
Kristin Mueller said. Damage there included cracks in the asphalt, and broken 
floor tiles and windows. On Wednesday, Sears sold water heaters and other 
merchandise on the curb outside the store, Mueller said. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the confusion Wednesday, some things hadn't changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman Oaks Fashion Square still received a few frantic calls from customers, 
one looking for a wedding gift, another for evening clothes to wear during an 
upcoming trip to New York.

EARHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; WASTE WATER ADDS TO RIVER'S PROBLEMS; 
ENVIRONMENT: VALENCIA PLANT POURS MILLIONS OF GALLONS INTO OIL-POLLUTED SANTA 
CLARA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Santa Clara River, already assaulted with 168,000 gallons of crude oil 
from a pipeline ruptured in Monday's earthquake, was furthered imperiled when 
sewage treated with chlorine poured into the river, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 About 6 million gallons of treated sewage from the Valencia treatment plant 
with added chlorine has poured down storm drains into the Santa Clara River and 
into Ventura County almost to Piru since Monday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chlorine, which is added to waste water to kill bacteria, is toxic to wildlife 
and is usually removed before the treated sewage is released into the river. 
The earthquake may have damaged a system that removes the chlorine before it is 
discharged. 
</P>
<P>
 However, officials said they also purposefully left the chlorine in the water 
to guard against any possible health and safety problems to humans because the 
waste water was not as highly treated as it usually is. The concentration of 
chlorine in the river does not pose a danger to humans, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't dechlorinate because we were operating in an emergency situation," 
said Jim Stahl, assistant general manager for the Sanitation Districts of Los 
Angeles County, which runs the Valencia plant. "We wanted to err on the side of 
human safety." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, earthen berms built by workers on Tuesday were restricting the oil 
spill to a 12-mile stretch of the river just east of Piru, said Mary Gale, 
spokeswoman with the California Department of Fish and Game's office of oil 
spill prevention and response. 
</P>
<P>
 But forecasts of up to one half of an inch of rain this weekend threatened to 
spread the spill farther downstream, Gale said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would carry the oil beyond the berms and affect a greater stretch of the 
river," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 By Wednesday, workers had vacuumed up about one-third of the oil, but the 
cleanup effort was expected to continue for weeks or months as contaminated 
soil is removed. Wildlife officials will write a plan to restore the damaged 
habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 The spill contaminated a stretch of the river that supports at least two 
endangered species, the tiny songbird least Bell's vireo and the unarmored 
three-spined stickleback, a fish that dates from prehistoric times. 
</P>
<P>
 The first of the oiled wildlife began appearing Wednesday, but rescue workers 
stayed on the shorelines to avoid contact with the oil and chlorine, Gale said. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the animals get cold and stressed, they will come to higher ground where 
the rescue workers can reach them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wildlife officials had no count Wednesday of the number of birds that were 
affected. But International Bird Rescue of Berkeley, whose workers only 
recently returned home after the Christmas Day oil spill at McGrath Lake, was 
called to the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Fish and Game's mobile bird-cleaning trailer returned to the Ventura County 
animal shelter at the Camarillo Airport to begin cleaning and rehabilitating 
the animals. No birds had yet been brought to the shelter Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 An oil spill in the same area in 1991 killed 186 birds. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Arco Oil, the parent company of pipeline owner Four Corners 
Pipeline Co., said that company efforts were focused on the cleanup and that 
they had not yet had time to determine why that particular section of the 
130-mile pipeline ruptured during the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 He estimated that it would be a full month before service is restored to the 
10-inch pipeline that carries crude oil from Kern County to oil refineries in 
the Long Beach and Los Angeles areas.

WOMAN WHO SUED ACTOR FOX WINS DAMAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE TAMAKI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Superior Court jury awarded $104,386 in damages to a woman who 
bought a Studio City home from actor Michael J. Fox and then sued the movie 
star for landscaping and repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Michele Ader said Wednesday in a telephone interview that the jury ordered Fox 
to pay the damages after finding he breached a contract over the sale of the 
home.The same jury found Fox had not committed fraud or negligent 
misrepresentation. 
</P>
<P>
 Drew Pomerance, an attorney representing Ader, had asked the jury to award his 
client more than $325,000 -- nearly half the $750,000 selling price of the home 
-- to replace 14 cypress trees and other landscaping and to repair a damaged 
pool, a leaky roof and a potential problem with the home's foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for Fox could not be reached for comment after business hours. 
However, one of them, Martin Snyder, told the Associated Press that while he 
disagreed with the verdict, "obviously, the jury felt that some of the repairs 
had not been attended to." 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder said he would consult with Fox to decide whether to ask a judge to 
reduce the award. 
</P>
<P>
 "We disagree with the calculation of amounts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ader said that in addition to the $104,386 damage award, the actor will also 
be responsible for her legal fees, which she estimates at $150,000. JULIE

BOOKS & AUTHORS: A JOURNAL NOT JUST OF SIGHT BUT . . .; A NEWPORT BEACH COMPANY 
EXPANDS THE CONCEPT OF PUBLISHING WITH MULTIMEDIA PACKAGES THAT COMBINE QUALITY 
VOLUMES WITH AUDIO TAPE, VIDEO AND CD/ROM DISKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 "Anthology: Peter Max," an upcoming title from an innovative new publishing 
house in Newport Beach, canvases the life and work of the renowned pop artist 
who soared to fame in the psychedelic '60s with his kaleidoscopic style and 
cosmic themes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the book is just for starters. 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanying the heavily illustrated, large-format book is a videotape 
chronicling the past 30 years of Max's career and an audio tape in which the 
artist shares his insights into the creative process and imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 But most fascinating of all is an interactive CD/ROM in which readers at their 
computer terminals can examine Max's work in both "virtual" and "real-time" 
formats. 
</P>
<P>
 The virtual journey transports the reader into a gallery with a choice of 
hallways, each reflecting a decade or theme in Max's work. Face a particular 
painting, and you can use your computer mouse to call up a "curator" who 
provides information about the work or the era in which it was painted. Or you 
can call up text on the subject. Or Max himself might appear on the screen and 
talk to you. You can also "morf" -- or blend -- one painting into another. 
</P>
<P>
 In the "real-time" format, you can watch the artist painting in his New York 
City studio and select different angles to view his work-in-progress. It's sort 
of a day in the life of Peter Max as he works on a variety of projects -- from 
painting to sculpting to etching. You can even watch him standing in front of a 
window drinking a cup of tea. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to book publishing in the '90s -- at least at Donovan Publishing, a 
company whose goal is to combine "the best of the past, present and future." 
</P>
<P>
 The Peter Max package is one of a number of multimedia book packages due out 
from the Newport Beach company in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 "What it does is it really expands the information you're reading in the 
book," said publisher Paul Sumner, co-founder and CEO. "I think all people have 
a feeling that it would really be neat to see what's happening when they're 
reading about anything. What the CD/ROM does is give you an opportunity to 
witness in motion things that are happening in the book." 
</P>
<P>
 Sumner, 47, who had a major marketing success in the sports trading card 
industry in the late '80s with his creation of the Upper Deck Co., co-founded 
Donovan Publishing with his sister, Win Fiandaca, in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we started out, there was nobody doing this, to our knowledge," said 
Fiandaca, 52, the company's president. "We've now seen a few of the mainstream 
publishers coming out with books that have (music) CDs or tapes with them. But 
to our knowledge no one is developing as complete a package as we are, and 
certainly not with a CD/ROM." 
</P>
<P>
 Donovan Publishing is launching its first book this month: Buddy Ebsen's 
autobiography, "The Other Side of Oz." It is one of the more traditionally 
published books -- minus the multimedia addenda -- on the drawing board at 
Donovan. At $24.95, it also is one of the more traditionally priced. 
</P>
<P>
 The publishing company's emphasis, however, is on creating limited-edition 
multimedia book packages. 
</P>
<P>
 The first, due in February, is "Animation: The Art of Friz Freleng." The 
leather-bound book, published in a 4,000-copy limited edition, chronicles the 
career of the five-time Oscar-winning animation pioneer -- from his days at 
Warner Bros. (Bugs, Porky and company) in the '30s through the Pink Panther in 
the '60s.  
</P>
<P>
 The package includes an autographed book, a videotape featuring cartoon clips 
and interviews, an audio tape compilation of animation highlights of the artist 
directing music segments, an illustrated Animator's Workbook and three new 
sericels created by Freleng, who is 88. 
</P>
<P>
 The Freleng package, complete with collection case, will retail for $1,200. 
</P>
<P>
 The limited edition Peter Max package, due out later this year, will include a 
signed 12-by-12 serigraph, with the whole works retailing for a cool $2,500.  
</P>
<P>
 The book packages, not surprisingly, will be sold in selected art galleries. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its multimedia approach to publishing, at Donovan, the book's the 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
 The leather-bound, "packaged" books are billed as being of heirloom quality. 
Even the Ebsen book was printed on a high-grade coated white paper with the 
highest grade binding, and it contains more than 125 photographs strategically 
placed throughout the narrative (as opposed to traditional eight- or 10-page 
photo section in the middle of a book). 
</P>
<P>
 In creating the company, Sumner said, they wanted to "make sure that we 
maintained the traditional value in book publishing while we're getting the 
reader -- or participant -- involved in the other media." 
</P>
<P>
 Sumner has a history of innovation. 
</P>
<P>
 A pioneer in the application of holographic technology -- he was the first to 
produce a "white light projection hologram" while studying at Cal State Long 
Beach in the early '70s -- Sumner created Upper Deck in 1987 after a career in 
sales and marketing for various Southern California printing companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Upper Deck, which relocated from Yorba Linda to Carlsbad in 1991, 
revolutionized the sports trading card industry by offering high-quality cards 
featuring full-color photographs of athletes in action on both sides of the 
cards, with a small hologram of the company logo to prevent counterfeiting. 
Within three years Upper Deck became one of the nation's leading trading card 
manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Sumner was just off his first vacation in three years when he retired 
as company president to develop other creative projects. (He's still one of the 
Upper Deck owners and is on the board of directors.)  
</P>
<P>
 Sumner had conceived of the idea for Upper Deck after taking his son to buy 
baseball cards, but it was his late father who supplied the incentive in coming 
up with idea to start a book publishing company. 
</P>
<P>
 His salesman father, Merton Sumner, had written prolifically all his life, and 
when he died in 1981 he left behind several cardboard boxes full of his short 
stories, poems and other writings. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he was living we always talked about getting Dad's things published," 
said Sumner, who called his sister, who was working on her bachelor's degree in 
English at Arizona State University. 
</P>
<P>
 With her literary background and his printing background, the pair formed 
Donovan Publishing, named for their father's middle name. Their intention was 
to publish their father's writings, including a complete manuscript for a book 
he wrote on a humanistic approach to alcoholic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 They put their father's writings on the back burner, however, as the concept 
of the company expanded.  
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Sumner said, he was intrigued by the idea of audio books and 
noticed that no one was really packaging tapes and books together. Taking that 
concept further, he envisioned publishing traditional, well-crafted books but 
including with the books other items of interest that would complement the 
subject matter. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, he said, "it was like a bridge between traditional publishing 
and the new media coming down the pipeline -- which is your interactive laser 
disks, CD/ROMs and audio/video in a collection of some sort." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he emphasizes, "to us at Donovan Publishing the book is the most 
important part of the package," from the written word to the way the book is 
presented, "right down to the way your senses react to it when you first open 
the book -- the traditional leather smell and the touch." 
</P>
<P>
 Fiandaca says she thinks of Donovan Publishing as a "kind of a shot in the arm 
to the publishing industry, to pump a little life into books that I now see on 
the bookshelf in the stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "You walk into store and pick up a book, and you have plain newsprint paper 
and pictures usually clumped together," she said, adding that she has purchased 
books in which the pages have separated from the spine even before she finished 
reading them. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we wanted to do right from the start was to have a very high quality 
paper and pictures throughout. In other words, upgrade the product." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, just as Upper Deck spurred other sports card companies to upgrade 
their products, Fiandaca hopes Donovan will have a similar beneficial effect on 
the book publishing industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like to think what we're doing at Donovan is going to be generalized 
around the marketplace so that the end result will be that the reader is going 
to have a finer book to own," she said.

'THE OTHER SIDE' OF BUDDY EBSEN; AUTOBIOGRAPHY: THE ACTOR -- WHOSE CAREER 
INCLUDED MUCH MORE THAN JED AND BARNABY -- WILL LAUNCH HIS CHRONICLE AT A 
LUNCHEON JAN. 27 AT THE BALBOA BAY CLUB. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Buddy Ebsen had just finished noodling with Fats Waller's "Ain't Misbehavin' " 
on the white baby grand piano in his elegantly appointed living room when he 
was asked if he still tap-danced. 
</P>
<P>
 Ebsen grinned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought you'd never ask," he said, blue eyes twinkling and gray loafers 
gracefully slapping out a time step on the hardwood floor: "You like that?" 
</P>
<P>
 Two months shy of his 86th birthday, Ebsen's still got it. 
</P>
<P>
 More than six decades after a lanky, 6-foot-3 20-year-old from Florida showed 
up in the Big Apple to break into show biz with only $26.65 in his pocket, the 
hoofer-turned-actor is getting ready to go back on the road -- this time to 
promote his autobiography. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Other Side of Oz" (Donovan; $24.95) chronicles his life and career in 
vaudeville, on Broadway in "Whoopee" and the "Ziegfeld Follies," in movies such 
as "Captain January" with Shirley Temple and "Breakfast at Tiffany's" with 
Audrey Hepburn, and on TV, the medium that gave him superstar status: nine 
years as folksy Jed Clampett in "The Beverly Hillbillies" and another eight 
years as the cool and methodical private detective in "Barnaby Jones." 
</P>
<P>
 That's not to mention his role as Fess Parker's sidekick Georgie Russell in 
that baby-boomer cultural phenomenon of the 1950s: "Davy Crockett." 
</P>
<P>
 Ebsen will launch "The Other Side of Oz," which is published by Donovan 
Publishing of Newport Beach, at the Round Table West author luncheon Jan. 27 at 
the Balboa Bay Club. 
</P>
<P>
 The book's title refers to Ebsen's most unusual claim to fame: He was 
originally cast as the Tin Man in "The Wizard of Oz" but, after he nearly died 
from inhaling the aluminum dust in his makeup, was replaced by Jack Haley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suspect I'm still in a couple of the long shots because you couldn't tell 
who was in there and it cost a lot of money to re-shoot," said Ebsen, adding 
that he's sure his voice remains in the "We're Off to See the Wizard" musical 
number. 
</P>
<P>
 As he says in the book: "Listen closely next time." 
</P>
<P>
 Dapperly dressed in a burgundy V-neck sweater, open-necked violet shirt and 
ascot, the actor was seated at a table in the sun room off the kitchen. The Old 
European-styled two-story house in Palos Verdes Estates, north of Long Beach, 
has been home since shortly after Ebsen -- a former longtime Balboa Island 
resident -- and his wife, Dorothy, were married in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Ebsen had moved to Balboa Island in 1960, having summered there with his 
family for a decade. His ex-wife Nancy, whom he divorced a decade ago after 39 
years of marriage, served as president of the Newport Harbor Children's Theater 
Guild and founded the now-defunct Newport Harbor Actors Theater, whose 
productions included the staging of Ebsen's play, "Mary Queen of Hearts."  
</P>
<P>
 Ebsen himself cropped up periodically in local newspapers, serving as the 
grand marshal of the Newport Harbor annual Character Boat Parade one year and 
as honorary chairman for the Providence Speech and Hearing Center's 
fund-raising campaign another year. 
</P>
<P>
 But mostly he worked during his Orange County years, commuting daily to 
Hollywood during the making of "The Beverly Hillbillies" and later, as the 
county grew and freeway traffic became too heavy, staying in Hollywood during 
the week while making "Barnaby Jones." 
</P>
<P>
 Like his screen persona, Ebsen is low-key, down-to-earth, gentlemanly. It's 
that down-home quality, grown to avuncular familiarity over the years, that has 
given him such a long career run. 
</P>
<P>
 Most recently, he had a cameo as Barnaby Jones in the "Beverly Hillbillies" 
movie and he just finished filming a guest shot on the new "Burke's Law" 
series. A few years ago he performed a one-man show in Branson, Mo., doing, as 
he says, "what I have done all my life: singing, dancing, jokes." 
</P>
<P>
 A history buff and painter who still sails the catamaran he used to win the 
Trans Pacific race in 1968, Ebsen said he's been writing down stories and 
reminiscences for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a scribbler," he said. "I always wrote down things that I thought were of 
interest. Also, my mother used to say, 'Son, one of these days you'll write a 
book. So remember all those interesting things that are happening to you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Belleville, Ill., on April 2, 1908, Ebsen is one of five children (he 
had four sisters). His father worked as a physical culture instructor in a 
German American athletic and social club and, damming up several springs on 
their nine acres on the outskirts of town, he created a public swimming pond 
and resort called the Ebsen Natatorium. 
</P>
<P>
 When Ebsen was 12, the family moved to Florida, where his father, who also 
taught dancing, opened a dance studio in Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
 Ebsen originally intended to become a doctor, an ambition fueled by watching 
one of his sisters suffer seizures from epilepsy. But after two years of premed 
courses, money ran out and he abandoned medicine in favor of show business. 
</P>
<P>
 His father, Ebsen said, had taught all of his children to dance -- ballet. "Of 
course, at that time I resisted it because it was considered a little bit 
girlish to dance." Ebsen's interest in dancing grew in the '20s, however, with 
the advent of the Charleston, and from that he learned to tap-dance. 
</P>
<P>
 Ebsen arrived in New York City in 1928, initially working as a soda jerk to 
make ends meet. About a year later, he was joined by his sister, Vilma. Billed 
as Vilma and Buddy Ebsen, they were a hit playing in vaudeville houses and 
nightclubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was kind of gawky and tall and it was easy to create eccentric (dance) 
moves," Ebsen recalled. "My sister was the pretty one and I was the funny one, 
and together we made a good team." 
</P>
<P>
 They were given several screen tests in New York in the mid-'30s, dancing and 
telling jokes for the camera. Then, as Ebsen says, one screen test "took" and 
they were called out to Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 A key moment in the book has Ebsen seated across MGM boss Louis B. Mayer's 
large polished desk and Mayer, the most powerful man in Hollywood, saying he 
wanted to sign Ebsen to a seven-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "Money is no object," Mayer said. "But in order to give you the kind of parts 
you deserve, Ebsen, we have to own you." 
</P>
<P>
 The word own sent a chill down Ebsen's spine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Mayer," he replied, "here's the kind of fool I am. You can't own me. I 
can't be a piece of goods on your counter." 
</P>
<P>
 Financial incentives aside, Ebsen recalls, "I just couldn't stand to be owned. 
It was the way he said it; it came out like capital letters: We have to OWN 
you."' 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back, he concedes that "I was young and, by many standards, had a lot 
to learn." 
</P>
<P>
 And while he occasionally had second thoughts -- "on days I was a little low" 
-- he never totally regretted turning down the offer. "It cost something in 
dollars to me for a while, but in the long run it didn't," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When World War II broke out, Ebsen recalled, "I was of an age that didn't 
require I be in the armed services, but I was stubborn and went in anyway." He 
served in the U.S. Coast Guard, in anti-submarine duty in the North Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 After the war, he appeared in Oscar Hammerstein's 1946 revival of "Showboat" 
on Broadway. But a year later, he began what he calls in the book "a seven-year 
economic plague for me." 
</P>
<P>
 From a previous $2,000-a-week motion picture salary to $750-a-week for 
"Showboat," he slipped to an average of $135 a week in 1947. A low point for 
morale came when William Morris Jr. -- head of the famous talent agency -- 
suggested that Ebsen, the no-longer-youthful half of a "cute brother and sister 
team," retire from show business. 
</P>
<P>
 Years later -- when "The Beverly Hillbillies" was riding high as the most 
popular show on television, Ebsen thanked Morris for his earlier "advice."  
</P>
<P>
 Sums up Ebsen today: "The big lesson is you get more negative reactions than 
positive reactions as you go through life, and the big lesson is nobody counts 
you out but yourself. . . . I never have, I never will." 
</P>
<P>
 After five B Westerns at Republic in the early '50s and occasional TV work, 
Ebsen's career logjam was broken when he was hired by Walt Disney to play in 
"Davy Crockett." 
</P>
<P>
 "Northwest Passage," a short-lived TV series, and "Breakfast at Tiffany's" 
followed. 
</P>
<P>
 But the big break came in 1961. He was 53, a time when many actors are looking 
more at their credits than ahead at their calendars: Ebsen met with TV writer 
Paul Henning to listen to Henning's idea for a new TV series. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Beverly Hillbillies," starring Ebsen as the family patriarch, ran for 
nine years. Three decades later, it's still syndicated in more than 30 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's got long legs," acknowledged Ebsen, uttering Jed Clampett's most famous 
catch phrase: "Weeell doggies. That's a piece of Americana. Of course, the 
whole thing is a piece of Americana." 
</P>
<P>
 As Ebsen sees it, the show's instant and enduring popularity boils down to one 
thing: 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a friendly show -- friendly and funny in a way that people could 
understand. There's a term, I'm not sure the usage of it -- other people use 
it: It related. It related to people. They understood it, and it was funny." 
</P>
<P>
 Ebsen views the story about mountain folks moving to the hills of Beverly as 
more than just a fish-out-of-water story. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they did was convert the water to their temperature," he said with a 
laugh. "They didn't ever feel out of water. They thought the others were out of 
water. They had poise, the Hillbillies. They never felt out of place." 
</P>
<P>
 As Jed, Ebsen essentially played the role of straight man to Granny, Elly May 
and Jethro, which "was one of the only things that (initially) bothered me 
about the show," he said, recalling that when Henning was describing the 
proposed series to him "and falling down laughing at all the fun that was going 
to be in it, I was waiting for him to say when Jed was going to be funny. He 
wasn't funny. 
</P>
<P>
 "That disturbed me for a bit and so I made a deal: (I'd do it), provided that 
Jed always had control of the money. In that way, he could never get lost in 
the story. So he came out with some good lines, some of them that lived: 'Some 
day, I got to have a long talk with that boy.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ebsen said his character served as the show's anchor, giving it a "hunk of 
legitimacy." Jed, he added, was a "human character," who had "kindness, and a 
sense of humor and great dignity." 
</P>
<P>
 Not unlike the image Buddy Ebsen has portrayed on television, a personality 
that seems best-suited to a medium that comes into our living rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be that I have an intimate personality," he said. "I did some broad 
things for the stage, but generally I think I communicated with the close-ups 
on television. There was some kind of a human kinship, I suppose."  
</P>
<P>
 Viewers, he added with a grin, "knew I meant no harm. I was friendly."

OC HIGH / STUDENT NEWS & VIEWS; CONFLICT AS AN INTEREST; AT WESTMINSTER HIGH, 
TEENS LEARN MEDIATION TO EXAMINE AND UNDERSTAND VIOLENCE AND TO COUNTER IT WITH 
SELF-EMPOWERMENT AND SELF-CONFIDENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NA TASUKON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES, Na Tasukon is a senior at Westminster High 
School. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A student walking home from school is confronted by gang members who offer the 
ultimatum: Join the gang or die. Another student is stabbed in the back in the 
school parking lot because of a "look" given another student earlier that day. 
A student of one race tells a student of another that "they" don't belong on 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Distressing incidents such as these -- fueled by ethnic differences, sexual 
tensions, drugs and other issues -- are becoming increasingly familiar to 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 At many schools, efforts to control increasing violence on campus have come in 
the form of suspension or detention. The idea is to assign blame and inflict 
punishment, often without examining the matter or finding its underlying cause. 
</P>
<P>
 At Westminster High School, a different approach is being taken.  
</P>
<P>
 On this campus, conflict mediation classes teach teen-agers how to examine and 
understand violence, how to counter it through self-empowerment and how to deal 
with it using self-confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 While there is little that teen-agers can do directly to correct the economic 
and social injustices of their world, they can learn through conflict mediation 
how to face the violence that exists within it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Conflict mediation at Westminster High has grown so much since its beginning 
that now we have 50 trained student mediators to serve the campus," said 
resource specialist Sharon Rawls, who coordinates the conflict mediation class 
and acts as the school's At Risk/Cultural Diversity Mentor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The program has successfully resolved more than 80 cases and has attracted 
the attention of numerous schools throughout Orange County," Rawls said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Westminster High program received an Orange County Outstanding Recognition 
Award in 1993 from Supervisor Harriett M. Weider. 
</P>
<P>
 The class is the most recent metamorphosis of a program started in 1991 to 
help deal with a burst of on-campus violence in late 1990. It is based on a 
program established in San Francisco to deal with community-based conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 The conflict mediation class is a semester long, requiring 25 hours of 
instruction. It is given before and after school and is now administered 
through the district's adult education department. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who complete the course receive state certificates in mediation. 
</P>
<P>
 The instruction helps students learn how to turn conflict into an opportunity 
for growth and understanding before it becomes violent, making them feel 
competent enough to participate in the resolution of their own disputes. They 
are taught that conflict is a natural human state often accompanying change and 
is best approached with skill and a sense of understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than viewing conflict as negative, mediation students are told to 
perceive conflict as a process that signals change -- neither positive nor 
negative, good nor bad -- that is a part of their lives. When they wake up each 
morning, for example, they may have an inner conflict about whether they should 
get out of bed and go to school. 
</P>
<P>
 When a dispute occurs at Westminster High, those involved are asked to 
participate in mediation. If they agree, they meet with trained student 
mediators in a conference room in the hopes of reaching a mutual solution. 
</P>
<P>
 "The student mediators are not there to solve the disputants' problems for 
them. Rather, they are there to assist the disputants in solving their problems 
themselves," Rawls said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Disputants are each given a chance to speak their own side of the conflict . 
. . (and to listen) to other points of view. The program is very effective 
because there is a greater opportunity for understanding and cooperation when 
mediation is on a student-to-student level," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Student mediator Ryan Nguyen said the most rewarding part of mediation is 
seeing the anger between disputants decrease right before your eyes and result 
in a positive outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice principal Neil Snowden said: "At first I was skeptical of allowing teens 
to deal with disputes and disputants on their own, without the intervention of 
adults, but then, that is the purpose of conflict mediation -- empowering youth 
to be responsible." 
</P>
<P>
 Snowden is now a big supporter of the program and its 98% success rate. Before 
mediation, he said, students suspended for fighting or altercations often 
returned to his office because suspension did little to solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rawls said disputants often have no understanding of what really took place in 
the conflict. And when a dispute involves both aggressive and passive 
personalities, the passive side rarely has the opportunity to speak out. With 
mediation, everyone is heard. As teens go through mediation, she said, a sense 
of comprehension and acceptance develops. From there, the participants move 
into communication, discussion of problems and, finally, resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 As alternatives to violence are created, doors open for those who may have 
grown up believing that violence was the only way out of a problem, Rawls said. 
</P>
<P>
 The process begins as students learn to get in touch with who they are inside, 
discovering self-confidence. As students tune in to their own unique 
personalities, Rawls said, they draw on their abilities to help them through 
any situation. Not only must students have respect for one another's needs and 
individuality, they must also have respect for themselves and take pride in who 
they are. 
</P>
<P>
 Westminster High School's pioneering efforts toward conflict mediation have 
significantly improved campus harmony, say students and school administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 "These students have not only helped their peers at Westminster High School to 
strive for a more peaceful campus and student empowerment, but they have also 
helped themselves by acquiring communication skills which will show other 
students the power of mediation. They will take these skills into their 
careers, as well as their family life," Rawls said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Lamb, a recent Westminster graduate, says his qualifications in 
mediation skills were one of the factors his employer considered when he was 
hired. "Now they're planning on organizing a training class for company 
employees to help with the day-to-day conflicts that occur," Lamb said. 
</P>
<P>
 As students learn to understand and acknowledge the needs of other individuals 
as well as their own, they acquire the ability to deal with confrontation, 
hostility and violence -- a skill that is becoming vital in today's society.

MY TURN; HARSH RALLY RULES WOULD ALLOW MOSHERS TO RUIN FUN FOR EVERYONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN PHILLIPS, Kevin Phillips is a junior at Brea Olinda High School. This 
article first appeared in the student paper, the Wildcat. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five years ago, rallies at Brea Olinda High School were plagued by 
egg-throwing and firecrackers. Now the problem is moshing -- students slamming, 
pushing and throwing each other around. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a problem that needs to be addressed. People can be seriously injured 
from being jumped on or thrown. It is not a laughing matter when students 
endanger the safety of others by jumping around and pushing onto one another. 
</P>
<P>
 The behavior of these students has caused the administration to reconsider the 
rules for rallies. Another rally, which will be a test of student behavior, is 
scheduled for Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 One rule that has been suggested for future rallies is that all students stay 
seated during the entire event. That this is even being considering is an 
insult. By keeping us seated, the administration is detracting from the 
excitement of the rally. They are punishing the whole student body because a 
minority of the students want to ruin it. 
</P>
<P>
 However, that would not be a change for some juniors. At the homecoming rally, 
while everyone else was getting caught up in the excitement of the rally, the 
juniors in the top and middle sections of the bleachers were not allowed to 
express their spirit by standing and cheering. Students in the senior section 
were swaying from side to side and dancing, but when a few of the juniors 
started dancing they were told to sit down. 
</P>
<P>
 Admittedly there was slamming and moshing going on in the junior section, and 
there would be some apprehension on the part of the administration that more 
dangerous behavior would follow. However, better judgment would show that these 
students did not intend to cause a ruckus and hurt people. They were just 
trying to have some fun. To tell students to sit down when they had no 
intention of causing any safety problems or harm toward others is unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 A more reasonable solution to the problem that has been suggested is to have 
teachers in pairs seated with students throughout the bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
 At the homecoming rally, administrators were situated in large groups at the 
top of class sections where they thought trouble might occur. This was a 
mistake, because problems would break out in areas they could not get to. By 
placing teachers throughout the bleachers, they could get to all of the 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble starts with a few kids intent on ruining the rally, and these 
students pull in the borderline students who would normally not act in such a 
fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 Troublemakers should be thrown out immediately. There should be no exceptions 
to those who ruin the rally for others. 
</P>
<P>
 These students should also be banned from all school activities for the rest 
of the year, because these people are the ones who ruin the rally for the whole 
group.

MIGHTY BOSSTONES CAFE SHOW CANCELED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Jan. 27 concert at the Rhythm Cafe by the Mighty Mighty Bosstones, a 
ska-rock band from Boston, has been canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 The show had been booked by an outside promoter, Paul Tollett of Goldenvoice 
Presents, who said Wednesday that he decided to cancel because of uncertainty 
over the Rhythm Cafe's future.The club's landlord has filed papers in Orange 
County Superior Court seeking to have the current Cafe management evicted for 
non-payment of rent. 
</P>
<P>
 Tollett said Tony Cardullo, who has been trying to coordinate Cafe bookings, 
told him last week that the club was having "license problems" and advised him 
to switch the show to another location, but there was not enough time. Cardullo 
could not be reached.  
</P>
<P>
 Tickets to the show will be refunded at points of purchase. MIKE BOEHM and

QUAKE EMERGENCY DECLARED; DISASTER: COUNTY TAKES ACTION THOUGH AREA WAS SPARED 
SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE. ANAHEIM CAN NOW APPLY FOR HELP IN MAKING REPAIRS TO 
STADIUM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County declared a state of emergency Wednesday because of costs and 
damage sustained in the Northridge earthquake, the largest being the collapsed 
scoreboard at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley signed a declaration of 
emergency late Wednesday afternoon even though the county was largely spared 
the destruction caused elsewhere by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernie Schneider, the county's administrative officer, said the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency urged the county to make the declaration. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley said the declaration primarily will help local public safety departments 
seek reimbursement for expenses encountered in their response to hard-hit areas 
in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 The chairman said probably the greatest interest in the declaration came from 
the city of Anaheim, where the temblor caused severe damage to part of the 
city-owned stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary damage estimates to the stadium were $3 million to $4 million, but 
Anaheim officials backed away from those figures Wednesday, saying it is 
unclear what the final cost will be. 
</P>
<P>
 With the declaration, the city also could apply for federal and state help in 
making repairs to the stadium, Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether stadium damage should qualify for assistance, Riley said: "If 
the criteria makes it eligible under the law, I think you should get your 
share." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, removal of the 17-ton Sony Jumbotron scoreboard from its landing 
spot in the stadium's third deck began Wednesday night after the Anaheim City 
Council, meeting in emergency session, hired a demolition company to do the 
work. The board collapsed during Monday's early morning quake, destroying or 
damaging more than 1,000 seats. Only two guards were in the stadium at the time 
and they were not hurt, but hundreds could have been killed if an event had 
been taking place. 
</P>
<P>
 Penhall International Inc., which specializes in earthquake demolition and is 
removing some of the collapsed Los Angeles County freeways, began erecting 
bracing in the damaged left-field part of the stadium immediately after the 
council vote and was expected to work around the clock until the board is 
removed. 
</P>
<P>
 The company will receive up to $500,000 for its work, and its deadline is Jan. 
28. The stadium's next scheduled event, a series of motorcycle races, is set 
for Jan. 29. The damaged portion of the stadium will remain closed during that 
event, but city officials say the rest of the stadium has been inspected by 
engineers and declared safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Stadium General Manager Greg Smith also said the city hired three engineering 
firms to conduct independent investigations into why the board collapsed. No 
other major structural damage was reported within 30 miles of the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The firms also will determine whether installation of a scoreboard at that 
location is safe and whether the left-field stands suffered structural damage 
from the impact. 
</P>
<P>
 The firms will work separately, and each will issue its own reports. Two of 
those reports will be made public, he said, while the third will be for the 
city's use in any litigation that might arise from the collapse. No deadline 
for completing the reports has been set.

CENTER PLAN TO BE UNVEILED AT NIXON SALUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Shortly before noon today, 25 years after he stood on the steps of the 
nation's Capitol and swore to uphold the Constitution, former President Richard 
Nixon will stand in the shadow of his boyhood home and celebrate the part of 
his past that was glorious. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid much fanfare and souvenirs from that day when he became the nation's 37th 
President, Nixon will hear accolades about foreign policy achievements, be 
hailed as the sage from whom world leaders seek advice, and pose for a 
commemorative photograph with one of his former vice presidents and about two 
dozen members of his Cabinets. 
</P>
<P>
 And in tribute to Nixon -- the only American President forced to resign after 
being disgraced by political scandal -- the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace 
will mark the anniversary of his inauguration with the unveiling of plans for 
the Center for Peace and Freedom, a think tank dedicated to Nixon's principles 
of "enlightened national interest in foreign policy and pragmatic idealism in 
domestic affairs." 
</P>
<P>
 Or as one library official said Wednesday, the center's policy studies will 
use as a guide Nixon's "hardheaded, pragmatic, realistic focus on what can be 
accomplished, rather than what we hope to be accomplished" on foreign and 
domestic issues. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,000 invited guests are expected to attend the event, which is closed 
to the public but will be broadcast later in the day on C-SPAN. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 An ongoing fund-raising drive for the library and new policy center, which is 
scheduled to open in 1997, was boosted with the announcement Wednesday that the 
Annenberg Foundation will make a $5-million challenge grant. As of Wednesday, 
the "Legacy for Peace" campaign had raised $13.5 million of its $25-million 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Annenberg Foundation is named for former Ambassador Walter H. Annenberg, 
who announced during a White House ceremony last December that the foundation 
would donate $500 million for U.S. schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "His personal support for our campaign and for the Center for Peace and 
Freedom is the surest indication we could have that we are engaged in a 
profoundly worthy cause," library Chairman George L. Argyros said in a 
statement Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the $25 million to be raised, $20 million will be used to fund an 
endowment, with some of the income used to defray the operating costs of the 
Nixon library, as well as programming at the policy center. 
</P>
<P>
 While officials say the library is financially sound, federal tax documents 
filed by the facility last November showed it had lost $1.5 million during two 
years of operation. It is the only presidential library in the nation to 
operate without federal funds. In 1974, Congress refused to turn over to Nixon 
the papers and tape recordings from his presidency, making the library 
ineligible to become part of the National Archives system until the law is 
amended. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Headquartered in Yorba Linda, the new policy center will establish eight 
endowed chairs -- six in the area of foreign policy and two focusing on 
domestic issues -- reflecting the primary focus that the Nixon Administrations 
paid to foreign relations. 
</P>
<P>
 It is in the area of foreign policy that Nixon achieved his greatest success, 
Nixon observers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody would want to hear what he has to say" on domestic issues, said 
Stephen E. Ambrose, a Nixon biographer and history professor at the University 
of New Orleans. "It was not an interest of his and certainly not a strength." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Nixon's greatest foreign policy achievement was in the 
re-establishment of relations with China after two decades of isolation, 
followed by the beginning of detente with the Soviet Union and the "shuttle 
diplomacy" of his Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger in an attempt to 
negotiate peace in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Nixon had campaigned for the presidency in 1968 with the promise that 
he had a "secret plan" to end the Vietnam War, it took him five years to 
accomplish only a withdrawal of American troops from the war. 
</P>
<P>
 The foreign policy chairs will be titled: "Russian and the Other Post-Soviet 
States," "Sino-United States Relations," "United States-Japan Relations," "The 
New Europe," "The Mideast," and "The Moslem World." The two domestic policy 
chairs planned so far are in "Representative Governance" and "Morality, Freedom 
and National Renewal." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the policy center's program will include the Richard Nixon Foreign 
Policy Institute to be established in Washington. Part of its mission will be 
to prepare "an annual assessment of each incumbent Administration's conduct of 
national security policy," library officials said.

TYCOON BIDS FOR BIG BLOCK OF SAN JUAN; REDEVELOPMENT: COUNCIL OPTS FOR RICHARD 
O'NEILL'S OFFER FOR PROPERTY IN HISTORIC HEART OF CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard J. O'Neill, a local rancher and one of the county's wealthiest men, is 
expanding his vast holdings in South County by purchasing an entire downtown 
block across from Mission San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 In a closed-door meeting, the City Council decided to negotiate exclusively 
with O'Neill and a partner for the commercial property in the heart of the 
historic city. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill, 70, won out over a Riverside-based investment group that offered the 
city exactly the same $1.1-million bid. The decades-old unreinforced brick 
buildings, including a former City Hall, need extensive retrofitting to bring 
them up to earthquake standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Jeff Vasquez said Wednesday that O'Neill's standing in the 
community convinced the council his group was the better choice to buy the 
block. 
</P>
<P>
 "The O'Neills have created a tradition in this city," Vasquez said. "I think 
the feeling of the council was that, with the O'Neill family's commitment to 
San Juan Capistrano and their generosity here, they would be more sensitive to 
creating something that fits within our parameters." 
</P>
<P>
 Both of the finalists for the property owned by the city's redevelopment 
agency were well qualified, but the council knows the O'Neill family better, 
said City Manager George Scarborough. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purchase prices ended up the same, so the council made a decision not on 
financial issues," Scarborough said. "It just came down to different approaches 
made by both groups. I think the majority of the council is more comfortable 
with Mr. O'Neill and his group." 
</P>
<P>
 The council directed the staff to negotiate with O'Neill in an executive 
session held Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the other finalist questioned the council's action, although he is 
still in the running if the city cannot complete a deal with O'Neill. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as last week, Riverside Commercial Investors had been informed it 
was the highest bidder and would probably be the council's choice, Rufus 
Barkley of Laguna Beach, a co-owner of the company, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm frustrated and upset," Barkley said. "We have some serious concerns with 
regard to the process we have been put through. What apparently happened . . . 
is that O'Neill changed his offer." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said O'Neill teamed with another bidder, Steve Nordeck, the 
owner of the legendary Swallows Inn, and matched RCI's offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "If negotiations are not successful with O'Neill, our expectation is we would 
approach one of the other parties and come to a successful conclusion with 
them," Scarborough said. "Both groups are very qualified and there is no real 
possibility for a bad decision." 
</P>
<P>
 The sale comes at a time when the city is studying revamping the entire 
downtown near the 218-year-old mission. Among the possibilities is a 
realignment of Ortega Highway to Verdugo Street, directly behind the property 
O'Neill is negotiating to buy. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, San Juan Capistrano real estate brokers hailed the expected sale as 
a boon to the community. 
</P>
<P>
 The price also seemed appropriate for 17,500 square feet in three aged 
buildings that could need major investments of time and money, said Wit Muller 
of Muller Commercial Real Estate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd call it a fair deal for both the buyer and the seller," Muller said. "I 
don't think they stole it or necessarily got a great bargain. They entered into 
an unknown situation with property like this . . . so maybe they got a good 
deal and maybe they didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Muller added that he was "pleased it is going to people in the community who 
are interested in the community." 
</P>
<P>
 If the deal closes as expected, O'Neill will extend his already formidable 
holdings in San Juan Capistrano and the South County. His family owns the 
40,000-acre Rancho Mission Viejo, and O'Neill is chairman of the board of the 
Santa Margarita Co., developers of master-planned Rancho Santa Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Juan Capistrano, O'Neill owns the El Adobe restaurant, where 
then-President Richard M. Nixon liked to dine, and the former Tiny Naylor's 
restaurant along Interstate 5, which has been closed for years. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Forbes Magazine listed O'Neill -- a former chairman of the state 
Democratic Party -- as one of the 400 richest people in the country with an 
estimated wealth of $275 million. 
</P>
<P>
 He could not be reached for comment Wednesday. Block Purchase 
</P>
<P>
 The purchase of a block of downtown will expand the O'Neill family's holdings 
in San Juan Capistrano. The acquisition, next to the historic mission, has some 
landmarks of its own.

FIRM CRIES FOUL OVER RADIO CONTRACT PROCESS; COMMUNICATIONS: FLORIDA COMPANY 
ALLEGES THAT GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS LEAKED INFORMATION TO ITS COMPETITOR, 
MOTOROLA, PUTTING IT AT A DISADVANTAGE. THE LAW ENFORCEMENT DEAL IS WORTH $80 
MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Florida-based communications firm, which is expected to lose an $80-million 
Orange County law enforcement radio contract, accused local government 
officials of leaking confidential documents to the competing company and 
compromising the selection process. 
</P>
<P>
 In a scathing six-page letter to the Board of Supervisors, the Harris Corp. 
alleged that the county had essentially rigged the highly technical and 
competitive contract process so that only giant Motorola Communications and 
Electronics Inc. could meet the standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract is one of the biggest in county history and is designed to 
improve police radio communications countywide during an emergency, such as 
Monday's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The board is scheduled to award the contract to Motorola on Tuesday. The 
decision could cost the county and local cities at least $6 million more than 
the Harris bid, which was initially accepted by the county. "To require the 
unique features of one manufacturer to be presented as mandatory requirements 
is tantamount to eliminating competition," Harris Contract Manager R.C. Ford 
wrote in the letter to board Chairman Thomas F. Riley. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley could not be reached for comment Wednesday, but Supervisor Roger R. 
Stanton, who also received Harris' letter, said he regarded the allegations as 
"serious" and has asked staffers to brief him on the company's concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to talk about this publicly until I get some answers," Stanton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton and other county officials declined to address details of the Harris 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorola consultant Randy Smith likened the allegations to tactics employed in 
"a professional wrestling match" with Harris officials engaging in 
"eye-gouging" and "manufactured bull." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ford contended that the county's actions and those of a special team 
created to review the competing proposals "present a strong appearance of 
impropriety and questionable judgment." 
</P>
<P>
 The selection process has been dogged by controversy for the past few months 
since a top county official said that Sheriff Brad Gates had urged him to 
consider Harris, which employed the sheriff's political ally, San Juan 
Capistrano Councilman Gary L. Hausdorfer, as a consultant. Gates denied any 
efforts to steer the contract to Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed communications system, touted as the most sophisticated of its 
kind in the nation, would join all law enforcement, fire and public-works 
authorities in the county and 31 area cities on the same radio system. Cities 
are expected to pay for 70% of the system and the county 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is a key provision in the county's plan to upgrade its overall 
preparedness in case of disaster, such as the 6.6-magnitude Northridge 
earthquake that shook Southern California early Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, the board voted to award the contract to Harris on the condition 
that the company satisfy seven technical concerns outlined by the review team 
of county and city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 But two months later, county officials issued a memo stating that Harris 
failed to meet those standards. At that time, the review team found that 
Harris' proposal contained "risks" of "added costs, delayed implementation 
schedules, operational difficulties, and in extreme cases, physical safety of 
personnel." 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, county General Services Agency Director R.A. (Burt) Scott denied 
Harris' allegations. Based on technical merit, he said, the counties and the 
cities were unanimous in their recommendation of Motorola. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I can say is that this thing has been worked on by a number of people, a 
number of cities and representatives from outside Orange County," Scott said. 
"I think there is unanimous feeling that this process has been fair." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott declined further comment, except to say that the county would once again 
review Harris' final proposal. But the county's recommendation for Motorola was 
not expected to change. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Harris letter, Ford alleged that 25 pages containing about 200 
questions related to the Harris proposal were transmitted by county staffers to 
Motorola in March, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "These questions would provide Motorola with a clear understanding of the 
substance of the Harris proposal," Ford wrote. "Although this was a very 
serious breach of confidentiality, the county maintained that this did not 
create an imbalance between the competitors." 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, Harris officials recommended that the county begin negotiations 
with them to "remedy this impropriety," Ford said. The county declined. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorola's Smith acknowledged that some questions regarding the Harris 
proposal had been "mistakenly faxed" to Motorola by county staff. Smith said 
the questions were contained on one page and that county officials were 
immediately notified. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this (Harris letter) is a last, desperate attempt to snatch victory 
from the jaws of defeat," Smith said. "If their reasoning is that the county is 
biased in favor of Motorola, I don't doubt it, but it's not because of any 
dishonesty." 
</P>
<P>
 Among other claims, Harris also alleged that a San Francisco-based consulting 
firm hired by the county to review the Motorola and Harris proposals was not 
nationally recognized as a specialist in analyses of public safety systems. The 
firm, C.S.I. Telecommunications, favored Motorola in the review. 
</P>
<P>
 C.S.I. officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris also alleged that the county review team was insistent on standards 
only Motorola could deliver. 
</P>
<P>
 "To say that the proposed system . . . is not acceptable because it lacks 
Motorola-unique features, ignores the positive references received from 
numerous Harris customers," Ford stated.  
</P>
<P>
 Members of the review team have said that the process has been fair, but that 
Harris could not satisfy the system's demands. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hoped that Harris could pull this off from the start," said La Habra Police 
Chief and county review team member Steven Staveley in a Dec. 21, 1993, letter 
to county officials.  
</P>
<P>
 "This was my wish for several reasons, but the bottom line is they simply did 
not do it. They can complain about the process all they want, but it's not the 
process that's wanting, it's their product."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; ELEMENTARY STUDENTS GET TO EYE EAGLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Elementary school children enjoyed a rare opportunity Wednesday to stand a few 
inches from a bald eagle -- the national bird and an endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 40 children were able to crowd around a 5-year-old eagle named 
Buddy, who suffers from an unusual mental problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Buddy doesn't know he's supposed to act like an eagle, and he actually prefers 
human company. 
</P>
<P>
 Buddy was apparently snatched from his nest at birth and learned to recognize 
humans as his parents, explained Dick Griffin, administrator of the Alaska 
Raptor Rehabilitation Center, who brought Buddy to Kline School. 
</P>
<P>
 Buddy stood patiently on his handler's glove as schoolchildren lined up to be 
photographed next to him. The children clapped when Buddy ruffled his feathers 
and they gasped when he spread his wings to their six-foot span. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin said an eagle would normally be frightened by a group of people, 
thinking they were enemies about to attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why can't Buddy live in the wild?" one child wanted to know. Because Buddy 
does not know how to hunt and would beg food from people, Griffin answered. He 
said that Buddy, who has keen eyesight, might spot a child eating a hamburger 
and swoop down to land on the child's arm to take a bite of the burger. 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of behavior could frighten humans and cause Buddy to be killed, 
Griffin said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the raptor care group found Buddy a few years ago, the members' initial 
plan was to care for the animal and then release it back to the wild. That's 
what the nonprofit group does for about 50 bald eagles each year. 
</P>
<P>
 But veterinarians soon discovered that Buddy did not know how to fly, Griffin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trainers at the raptor center had to teach Buddy to fly by rocking his perch, 
center veterinarian Vicky Vosburg told the schoolchildren. That way, Buddy 
learned to flap his wings to keep his balance. Later, when trainers pushed him 
off his low perch, he learned to fly instead of dropping to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 But Buddy has never learned to hunt, Griffin said. He likes to eat salmon 
bought at the grocery store, but when taken to a stream filled with live 
salmon, the eagle watches the fish swim by and does not even try to catch them. 
</P>
<P>
 Buddy is about two feet tall and weighs only eight pounds. As with all eagles, 
many of his bones are hollow, making him light for flight. 
</P>
<P>
 The raptor center takes Buddy on tours to show the damage that humans can do 
to birds, Griffin said, as well as to foster appreciation for the bald eagle. 
Buddy also visited two Newport Beach schools Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Students at Kline presented Griffin with a $355.50 check for Buddy's care. The 
money had been raised through sales of arts and crafts. Buddy could live 
another 50 years at the nonprofit center. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin said there are about 40,000 bald eagles in Alaska and perhaps 20,000 
in the rest of the country. Locally, the birds can be seen on Catalina Island 
and near Big Bear Lake, he said. Eagles also migrate through the Southland.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; COUNTY WORKERS SET UNITED WAY RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County government employees who led their peers during their 
record-breaking 1993 United Way Campaign were honored Wednesday for raising 
more than $839,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, who chaired the county's United Way effort, 
presented awards to dozens of agency leaders and employees for their 
fund-raising activities and donations, which combined to exceed the 1992 
campaign total by more than $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The success of the 1993 effort continues the county employees' impressive 
pattern of breaking their own fund-raising records with every new year, Wieder 
said. In addition to outstripping the previous year's accomplishment, the 1993 
totals more than double the 1987 campaign revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "This accomplishment is highlighted by the fact that it comes at a time when 
county government and its employees are struggling with an economic downturn," 
Weider said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several agencies were honored Wednesday for having 100% participation by their 
employees, including the county administrative office, the county counsel's 
office, the county clerk's office and the clerk of the Board of Supervisors 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Fire Department was singled out for leading all agencies. 
Firefighters, fire officials and their support personnel collected $133,811 on 
their own, even though the campaign kicked off just as the wildfires surged 
across the Southland in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Merritt Johnson, president of United Way Orange County, said the effort 
mounted annually by the employees is among the most successful county campaigns 
in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Totals for the overall, countywide United Way campaign will be made available 
March 1, a United Way spokeswoman said Wednesday. The 1992 campaign collected 
$18.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The money goes to the 109 health and human service agencies supported by the 
area United Way, and, during the campaign, another 300 programs are supported 
by the Community Care Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Targeted issues for the 1993 campaign were assistance for abused children, 
crime prevention and victim assistance, AIDS prevention and education, alcohol 
and drug-abuse treatment, assistance for families in distress and child care 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 United Way officials said 800,000 area people -- or about one out of every 
three Orange County residents -- received assistance in 1992 through agencies 
supported by the charity. For more information call the United Way at (714) 
660-7600. GEOFF BOUCHER

 The cause of the 1:10 p.m. fire is still under investigation.Fire Capt. Ed 
Garrode said he is waiting for lab results before deciding if the fire was 
arson. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire gutted two apartments in the two-story, four-unit building in the 100 
block of Escalones Street. According to witnesses, the fire started on a 
ground-floor apartment and moved quickly to a second-floor apartment and onto 
another building before firefighters put it out. 
</P>
<P>
 The two gutted apartments are not inhabitable, Garrode said. However, he said, 
the two other apartments were not affected. 
</P>
<P>
 Red Cross spokeswoman Judy Iannaccone said the owner of the building will 
provide housing for the five families affected beginning today. She said that 
in the interim, the Red Cross has been providing shelter, food and clothing at 
a local hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Goodwill Industries has provided the clothing. FERNANDO ROMERO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAKE FOREST; CITY OKS JOINING BASE REUSE AGENCY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pledging to represent South County, the City Council voted Tuesday to become 
part of an intergovernmental agency that will decide the fate of the El Toro 
Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Although council members expressed disappointment that more cities are not 
included in the executive group that will have final say over base reuse, they 
voted to join so that at least one South County city would be represented even 
though Irvine is on the agency board. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can protect our quality of life, it's going to protect the citizens 
living around Lake Forest," said Mayor Marcia Rudolph. "As unhappy as we were 
having only one vote, we felt it was critical that South County be at the 
table." 
</P>
<P>
 The council's vote was conditional upon a final review of the bylaws for the 
Joint Powers Authority, which will also include the County Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's first meeting will take place Wednesday morning at the county Hall 
of Administration in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, the board of directors will have voting power over development 
plans for the air base, which the Pentagon tentatively plans to close by 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 The board will include the five county supervisors, who each will have one 
vote. The city of Irvine will get three votes and Lake Forest one vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The El Toro agency will also have an advisory committee that will include 
representatives from the 31 Orange County cities, seven business groups and 
seven South County unincorporated communities. FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL; SENIOR CENTER IS NAMED SEA COUNTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CORE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The senior center now under construction will be named Sea Country, a name 
associated with the city since its early years as an unincorporated, 
master-planned development in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of us in the community, certainly those of us who have lived here a long 
time, really identify that name with Laguna Niguel," said Councilman James F. 
Krembas."It's really appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 The $3.4-million center, scheduled to open this summer, was officially named 
the Sea Country Senior and Community Center.  
</P>
<P>
 The name was first used by developers to market the Laguna Niguel area in the 
late 1960s, and was emblazoned on a large sign along Interstate 5 near Crown 
Valley Parkway up until the early 1980s. Sea Country was widely used by members 
of the community but faded somewhat after Laguna Niguel's oceanfront property 
was turned over to Dana Point when it incorporated in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff had recommended to the council name variations that included Laguna 
Niguel Senior and Community Center. City Manager Tim Casey also suggested 
Laguna Oak or Oak Plaza Senior and Community Center.  
</P>
<P>
 But during the council's discussion, Krembas suggested Sea Country, which drew 
an immediate and enthusiastic response. RICHARD CORE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; SENIOR CITIZENS PANEL SETS GOALS FOR YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The committee that advises the City Council on issues of importance to senior 
citizens elected new officers Wednesday and set goals for the year, including a 
push to improve transportation for elderly people. 
</P>
<P>
 Amy Morimoto, a home care worker, is the new chairwoman of the Senior Citizens 
Committee; Bud Toelkes, a retired postal carrier, is the new vice chairman.Joe 
Zavala, the legislative chairman for the local chapter of the American Assn. of 
Retired Persons, is the secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 Toelkes said he would like to see a bus shelter at Bear and Baker streets and 
is studying places in the city where seniors need new bus stops.  
</P>
<P>
 Toelkes and other committee members also said they are concerned about senior 
citizens crossing the road at 19th Street and Pomona Avenue. Many older people 
cross 19th Street to get to the Costa Mesa Senior Center, Toelkes said. But he 
said the busy road can be dangerous, especially when cars on Pomona Avenue turn 
right on a red stoplight while seniors are crossing 19th Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Toelkes also said he would like to make a video to show seniors at the center 
some safety tips for crossing the street. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee will meet again on Feb. 16 at the Senior Center. Alternate 
members are needed for the committee. Anyone who would like to join or who 
would like to learn more about the committee's work should call Glen Stroud, 
the city liaison, at (714) 754-5300. WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; POLICE DEPARTMENT TO HIRE 5 NEW OFFICERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Police Department, which is down 10 officers, should be back to full 
strength within a year, said Chief Charles S. Brobeck. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council last week authorized the department to hire five new 
officers. Brobeck hopes the council will also allocate funds to hire an 
additional five when it approves a fiscal 1994-95 budget in the next few 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 The addition of 10 officers would bring the number of sworn police personnel 
to 129. 
</P>
<P>
 The department has a list of qualified applicants and is completing background 
checks on those being considered for the first five slots. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the five officers are selected, they will go through field training and 
should be ready for duty in the fall, Brobeck said. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual cost of each new officer, including salary, benefits, equipment and 
workers' compensation insurance, is about $91,000. The five new officers will 
be funded in part by proceeds from Proposition 172, the 1993 ballot measure 
designed to increase funding for fire and law enforcement agencies. City 
officials are not sure exactly how much the city will receive in Proposition 
172 funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-person vacancy in the Police Department developed over the last year as 
officers left and the city did not have the money to immediately replace them. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Brobeck was forced to redeploy officers from investigative and 
support units into the patrol bureau to keep street service at normal levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Brobeck said he might not return all personnel to support duties once the new 
officers come on board. Instead, the patrol bureau could be expanded and the 
extra officers might be used to form special units to deal with specific crime 
issues, such as drunk driving, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 More changes in police deployment are expected in the next few years as the 
department organizes a community policing program. Such a program would tap the 
resources of Irvine residents and businesses to identify areas in which the 
Police Department could be more efficient and effective. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; CITY CRITICIZES COUNTY OVER WETLANDS 
PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT BARKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Council members this week criticized county officials for refusing to 
hold a public hearing on an environmental impact report dealing with 
development of the Bolsa Chica wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Ralph Bauer told county representatives that the proposed Bolsa 
Chica project of more than 4,000 homes may be the most important ever in the 
city and that it is "outrageous" not to accept public comments. 
</P>
<P>
 He also claimed the county "reneged" on a commitment to hold a hearing in the 
city so that residents could voice their opinions about the environmental 
document. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Matthews, Orange County's director of planning, said the county made no 
pledge to hold a public comment meeting in the city. He also said the county is 
meeting a standard policy of requiring written, not verbal, comments, so that 
officials can respond thoroughly and can keep records of their replies for 
legal purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthews briefed the City Council and Planning Commission on Tuesday night on 
the environmental impact report process and timetables for future developments 
of the plan that appear headed to the Orange County Planning Commission at 
midyear. 
</P>
<P>
 Local residents can make written comments until the deadline of Feb. 18. 
Copies of the report are available at the Central Library and in the city 
clerk's office at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other controversies over the Bolsa Chica environmental report surfaced 
at Tuesday's City Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents challenged council members agreeing to spend more than $130,000 
earlier in the month for legal help and technical consultants to study the 
environmental report. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Charles S. Barbara said "it is totally ridiculous" for the city to 
use the money for an outside consultant while being hit by budget shortfalls. 
</P>
<P>
 But resident Connie Boardman said the hiring of a consultant is a sound 
business decision because the city lacks experts to determine the adequacy of 
the environmental report. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman David Sullivan said the consultants are needed in the areas of 
tidal hydrology, archeology, wetlands biology and liquefaction because there 
are no qualified experts on the city staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Tuesday night, the City Council in a closed session weighed the 
possibility of litigation to block the environmental report, should its 
consultant find problems in the document. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Linda Moulton-Patterson said Wednesday officials reached no decision but 
must be prepared to take legal action. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Earle Robitaille and Jim Silva boycotted the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Moulton-Patterson said the City Council will hold a special public hearing on 
Jan. 31 at 6 p.m. to give residents an opportunity to make their comments, at 
least to city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The comments may be recorded and submitted in written form to the county, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It should be the county's obligation to listen to the people who are most 
affected by development in the Bolsa Chica," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Koll Real Estate Group seeks to build 4,286 homes on 400 acres inland of 
Pacific Coast Highway and surrounded by Huntington Beach city limits. For the 
right to build the homes, the company would spend about $48 million to restore 
1,100 acres of wetlands by constructing a tidal inlet to the ocean to 
reintroduce a natural marsh. ROBERT BARKER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; LAUGHTER IS SERIOUS BUSINESS TO STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By BERT ELJERA

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Simon Volkov held the plastic device in one hand, tilted it toward the ceiling 
light, and in about 10 seconds, a roaring laugh echoed through the room, 
catching the 35 students in front of him by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tustin High School students soon joined in the laughter as Volkov held the 
laughing box, called "Surpriser." The light-activated device, about the size of 
a television remote control, is sold by his company as a gag gift. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting attention is the first thing in selling a product, Volkov said during 
his lecture. He was there as part of a special program between the school 
district and local businesses to teach students "real life" business principles 
and practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Spicing up his talk with anecdotes, Volkov, who owns a marketing company, was 
invited Tuesdayto recount his experiences as a businessman to high school 
seniors attending an economics class. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have motivation and direction, you can be successful. Ideas, not 
money, determine if you will succeed or not," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Money is in selling, not manufacturing, Volkov said. And use a lot of 
advertising, particularly if it's free, whenever possible, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year Volkov, 29, donated more than 1,000 copies of his booklet "World of 
Business" to Tustin and Foothill high schools. He also donated videotapes and 
audiocassettes dealing with starting and managing a small business. 
</P>
<P>
 Volkov publishes motivational books and tapes, drawing from his experiences as 
an entrepreneur for the past 11 years. He sold wooden car dashboards at one 
time and now specializes in gag gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Surpriser," manufactured by a Hong Kong company, sells for about $13 and 
is intended to startle someone opening a closet, refrigerator or bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fads are good, if you create them," Volkov said. "But know when to stop." 
</P>
<P>
 Teacher Sharron Seidenberg said she often invites business people to talk to 
the class to complement the students' book studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Seidenberg said that the class itself deals with practical matters, such as 
buying a car, renting an apartment, opening a bank account and doing taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's useful, it's handy," said Amber Churchin, 17, who said she is 
considering setting up her own business someday. "It's a class you pay 
attention in. It will help you organize your life." 
</P>
<P>
 Joyce Bellinger, who coordinates programs involving businesses, said students 
in the program visit local businesses, observe their operations, or receive 
on-the-job training. Managers and employees serve as mentors and tutors to the 
students, and several businesses have donated computers and other equipment.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA; VOTE POSTPONED ON STREET PARKING FEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After heated testimony from residents accusing the city of trying to make 
money off the poor, City Council members this week postponed a decision to 
charge an annual fee for overnight parking on local streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care what you do here in Brea, you're not going to turn it into 
Irvine," resident Sid Greves told the City Council at its meeting Tuesday 
night. "You people shouldn't be voting to destroy the poor people of this 
town." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Carrey J. Nelson agreed with many residents who oppose the city's 
proposed ordinance, which calls for a $20 annual fee for a parking permit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just not fair," he said. "This is something we really don't need. . . . 
It's an overburden on the city and the citizens of this city." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents said the proposed parking ordinance will cause financial hardships 
and said they can't understand why they would not be allowed to park more than 
one car in front of their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance also restricts the number of permits to two per house and one 
per apartment. All other vehicles would receive parking citations. Repeat 
violators would face fines of up to $1,000 or jail terms of up to six months 
for parking on city streets for longer than 30 minutes between 2 and 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The current parking ordinance requires that free, unlimited parking permits be 
obtained every three years. The law was adopted in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Cutts, director of development services, said he did not know why the 
ordinance was originally adopted. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Frank Benest said the ordinance helps ease concerns of residents 
who believe it enhances the town's look and reduces crime. Councilman Burnie 
Dunlap added: "It does improve property values." 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Donald L. Forkus said crime is not lessened in the city as a 
result of parking permits. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, the city had proposed that a fee of $80 be charged for parking 
permits, but officials asked for changes in the ordinance and postponed making 
a decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The council has again directed city employees to alter the ordinance and bring 
it back to the council for discussion at a study session Feb. 1 and a vote Feb.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: PLACENTIA/YORBA LINDA; WRITER, LAWYER MAKE IT TO HALL OF

 Screenwriter Elisa Bell called one of her first scripts ever sold "Writer's 
Block," but the 1983 Esperanza High School graduate has managed to avoid that 
particular pitfall since she quit her day job and began writing full time. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past four years, Bell has sold 15 original screenplays and worked on 
several rewrites and book adaptations. She just finished working on two 
projects with producer Steven Spielberg and in a few months, Michael J. Fox 
will make his debut as movie director in Bell's "Thirty Wishes." 
</P>
<P>
 For her accomplishments, Bell is being inducted today into the Placentia Yorba 
Linda Unified School District Hall of Fame. Frederick Aguirre, a local attorney 
who has been active in community groups, will also be inducted. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating with honors from USC in 1987, Bell got a job as "the Xerox 
girl" at Tri-Star Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically I was hired to make copies of scripts," Bell said. "After a while I 
started reading scripts, giving my opinion and suggestions."  
</P>
<P>
 Within three years, she was head of the story department.  
</P>
<P>
 Throughout that time, Bell continued writing at night and in 1990, after 
selling her first script, she quit her job at Tri-Star to write full time.  
</P>
<P>
 "Now it feels like I don't have a job," Bell said.  
</P>
<P>
 Aguirre, whose family settled in what is now Placentia in the early 1900s, 
graduated in 1964 from Valencia High School, where he was student body 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney with a private practice in Fullerton, Aguirre has been active in a 
variety of community groups. He has formed several business and real estate 
ventures, including building Bradford Square Retirement Villa. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguirre was also involved in a Latino broadcast group that acquired and later 
sold the federal license for a television station that eventually became QVC. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguirre has worked on many projects to benefit Latino residents, including the 
Community Minority Affairs Advisory Council at Cal State Fullerton, a Fullerton 
Youth Gang Advisory Committee and the Stay in School Program for Santa Ana 
Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, Aguirre helped re-establish the local chapter of the League of United 
Latin American Citizens.  
</P>
<P>
 "My family's heritage has always been a source of pride," Aguirre said. The 
Hall of Fame ceremony will be held at 7 p.m. in the District Education Center, 
4999 Casa Loma Ave., Yorba Linda. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; PROJECT SABADO WILL HOLD FORUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group that focuses on social problems stemming from alcohol and illegal drug 
use will hold a community forum today to organize new grass-roots programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Project SABADO, which stands for Santa Ana Broad-based Alcohol and Drug 
Organization, has scheduled the forum for 7:30 p.m. at Madison Elementary 
School, 1124 E. Hobart St. 
</P>
<P>
 Group leaders will ask participants to suggest programs or strategies to 
combat the problems of substance use. The results of a local public opinion 
survey in September will be presented to help define the problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The 400 respondents to the SABADO survey listed drunk driving, alcohol-spurred 
domestic violence and illicit drug sales among the most serious social ills in 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 SABADO, created last March, is a $150,000-a-year program funded by the Orange 
County Health Care Agency. The project is headed by a 10-member committee that 
includes residents, local activists, teachers and police. 
</P>
<P>
 For information about the forum, call SABADO at (714) 542-3396.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; NEW CIVIC CENTER TO BE DEDICATED FRIDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The new Civic Center, which was built at a cost of more than $11 million, will 
be dedicated Friday, although repair work on the Community Center floor will 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
 Ceremonies begin at 4 p.m. at 300 Centennial Way.Mayor Jim Potts and other 
members of the City Council will participate. There will be entertainment, and 
refreshments will be served. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction and renovation of the Civic Center started in August, 1991, and 
was completed two years later. The project was financed by the Community 
Redevelopment Agency and developer fees from new construction in East Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 The complex consists of City Hall, the Police Department, council chambers, 
the Community Center and an adjacent 59,000-square-foot parking structure. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the council, acting as the Community Redevelopment Agency, 
unanimously approved spending $27,000 to repair the Community Center's vinyl 
flooring, which has been bubbling because of trapped moisture. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract for the repairs has been put out to bid. The work will include 
removing the existing flooring and rubber base and installing new flooring. 
Repairs could be completed by April, officials said. BERT ELJERA

ANAHEIM POLICE DEPT.'S 24-HOUR VIRUS ENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY SPENCER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city's police officers, having recovered from a 24-hour "blue flu" 
epidemic, returned to work Wednesday with their union leaders calling the job 
action a "remarkable success" and planning to confront the City Council over 
their demands for a new labor contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as solidarity is concerned, this was a remarkable success," said Bruce 
Bottolfson, president of the Anaheim Police Assn., who noted that 197 of 205 
officers scheduled to work between 6 a.m. Tuesday and 6 a.m. Wednesday called 
in sick. 
</P>
<P>
 With 96% of its police officers participating in the walkout, the city was 
obliged to patrol its streets and respond to calls for assistance with Police 
Department management personnel and with officers on loan from surrounding 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, all Anaheim officers reported back to duty. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Randall Gaston said emergency services were not affected by the 
walkout and all calls for assistance were answered. "We had experienced field 
officers on duty and, as you would expect, there was a comparable level of 
service," Gaston said. 
</P>
<P>
 The union -- without a contract for 18 months, and without a raise since 1991 
-- is demanding that salaries be increased 10% through July 1995, and has 
rebuffed the city's offer of a 10% to 11.5% raise through July, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city was telling us (by not seeking a court order to stop the walkout) it 
was put up or shut up time. Well, we put up," Bottolfson said. "So we are going 
to go to the council next Tuesday, and tell them, 'Let's get on with this, and 
sit down and negotiate this thing.' " 
</P>
<P>
 More than 400 officers and supporters have twice picketed council meetings in 
recent months, and union officials expect a similar demonstration Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But several council members said Wednesday they doubted the union's tactics 
will have any effect on negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this time of a tough economy and tight budgets, the city is offering a 
very good package," Mayor Tom Daly said. "Any increase of wages and benefits 
should be appreciated. But this doesn't mean I'm not open to solutions." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Frank Feldhaus called the sickout "very unprofessional" and said it 
might make negotiations more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like it when they try to hold a hammer over the citizens' heads," 
Feldhaus said. "This is an indication of their bad faith."

TB SCREENING BEGINS AT LA HABRA HIGH SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tuberculosis screening began Wednesday at La Habra High School to test 
students and staff who were in close contact with a senior who earlier this 
month was diagnosed with a contagious form of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things went very smoothly," said Ron Anderson, assistant to the 
superintendent at the Fullerton Joint Union High School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson said of the 291 current and former students who were requested to 
participate in the screening, 229 were tested during the school day. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he said, 85 teachers and other school personnel took the test, 
which will determine if they have the TB bacterium in their bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 The test was conducted jointly by school nurses and county public health 
nurses, who on Friday will inspect the prick sites on the test-takers' arms to 
look for hardening of the skin that would indicate a positive response. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who test positive, health officials said, will immediately receive chest 
X-rays to find out if they have active tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberta Maxwell, program manager for the county's pulmonary disease services, 
said her office has arranged for a portable X-ray machine to be brought to the 
high school Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson believes the majority of current students who were recommended for 
the tuberculosis screening were tested Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 He said of the 232 students whose parents were notified of the testing, all 
but 15 brought signed parental permission slips to school.

CSUF'S CLEAN, BRIGHT IDEAS EARN IT A $1-MILLION REBATE; CONSERVATION: 
INVESTMENT OF $6 MILLION TO MODERNIZE LIGHTING AND AIR CONDITIONING PAYS 
DIVIDEND ON FRIDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 For the last three years, Cal State Fullerton has carried on a campaign to 
become as energy-efficient and non-polluting as possible, replacing fluorescent 
lights with longer-lasting illumination, renovating its air-conditioning 
system, and constructing a laboratory with a more efficient air-filtration 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 The university spent $6 million to get most of the job done, but on Friday it 
will get some of that investment back. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California Edison Co. will present Cal State Fullerton a $1-million 
rebate, which is part of a program designed to encourage customers to make 
energy-saving, non-polluting changes. The rebate is one of the largest ever 
given by the energy company, said SCE officials. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the project, the university will save 7.9 million kilowatt 
hours -- enough electricity for about 1,500 houses a year -- and more than 
$600,000 annually, said Jerry Keating, campus spokesman. "In the long haul, we 
recover the costs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 H. Fred Mickelson, regional general manager of SCE, said the rebate program 
started in the late 1970s, "when it became very apparent that the cost of 
building new power plants was high enough that it made sense to use energy more 
efficiently and pay rebates to encourage people to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, after Cal State Fullerton had struggled with a 25-year-old 
air-conditioning system, university officials sat down with SCE to discuss 
rebates and funding for the energy project, said Mickelson. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton's $1-million rebate is the result of several phases of the 
energy-saving project, including: 
</P>
<P>
 * Replacement of the lighting system in which, according to Corbett, 
"virtually every light fixture on campus" was replaced with newer versions at a 
cost of $2 million. The new fluorescent tubes are four times as efficient, last 
thousands of hours longer and do not contain carcinogens. Photo cells tell a 
computer when to activate outdoor lighting, rather than having them on all the 
time. Edison is giving the campus a $200,000 rebate on the lighting project. 
</P>
<P>
 * Installation of a $4-million cooling system, including a storage tank, which 
stores water from a chiller at night, when overall utility use is lower. Later, 
the water is piped to buildings to cool them. Edison is giving a $700,000 
rebate for that system. 
</P>
<P>
 * Construction of a laboratory facility, which was built with $20 million in 
voter-approved bonds, rather than with state-funded energy bonds. Corbett said 
the facility will not recirculate air because of concern about chemical 
emissions. The fumes go through an exhaust system and filter hoods. Edison gave 
a $50,000 rebate. 
</P>
<P>
 Miscellaneous alterations account for the remaining $50,000 in rebates, 
Corbett said. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is not finished. More construction is starting on the first heat 
recovery storage system in Southern California, said Corbett. The system, 
scheduled for completion in November, will store waste heat from the chiller 
tanks used in the air conditioning system. This will eliminate the use of 
boilers, which waste more energy and emit noxious fumes. Edison's research 
division and the South Coast Air Quality Management District are supporting the 
$2.5-million project, Corbett said. 
</P>
<P>
 SCE Vice President Bob Bridenberker and Mickelson will present the rebate to 
Cal State Fullerton President Milton A. Gordon at the 2 p.m. ceremony in 
Langsdorf Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony will also honor the late Ed Knipe, chief of energy and utilities 
for the CSU system. Knipe helped push for state funding and is credited with 
much of the organizing of the energy-saving project. He died in March, 1992, at 
the age of 43. A plaque will be installed on campus in his name.

PNEUMONIA SPREADS AMONG INFANTS; MEDICINE: THIS WINTER, 271 BABIES WITH THE 
VIRAL INFECTION HAVE BEEN ADMITTED TO CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL, COMPARED TO 194 LAST 
SEASON. TWO HAVE DIED SINCE SATURDAY. 
</P>

<P>
 An unusually large outbreak of a potentially deadly viral pneumonia in 
Southern California this winter is proving especially dangerous to babies, 
according to physicians at Children's Hospital of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The illness, known as respiratory syncytial viral pneumonia, killed a 
2-month-old girl Wednesday who had been admitted to CHOC, said Dr. Gary 
Goodman, associate director of the pediatric intensive-care unit. Another 
infant, a 2-month-old boy, died Saturday from the ailment at the hospital, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, 13 of the 23 infants in the pediatric intensive-care unit in Orange 
are being treated for the life-threatening viral infection, CHOC physicians 
said. More than half of the babies at the CHOC-operated pediatric hospital in 
Mission Viejo have the pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
 Last winter, 194 babies were admitted to CHOC with the illness, compared to 
271 so far this winter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Southern California is being hit harder with this virus than other parts of 
the state -- and country for that matter," Dr. Nick Anas, director of the 
pediatric intensive-care unit at CHOC, said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the rate we are going, we'll reach the same numbers as the '91-92 season, 
which was an epidemic season in Orange County," Anas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two winters ago, Goodman said, 367 babies were hospitalized at CHOC with the 
pneumonia, and it remains to be seen whether this season will match that 
number. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not over yet," Goodman said, noting that each year the virus surfaces 
between November and April, although December through February tend to be the 
peak months. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodman said the illness is a "highly contagious" virus for which there is no 
immunization. It begins with a runny nose and low-grade fever, he said, and can 
progress to coughing and wheezing. 
</P>
<P>
 While adults also can get the virus, she said, it is more serious in infants 
because their lungs and airways are smaller and their breathing muscles are not 
as strong. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodman said that for every baby whose symptoms are serious enough to warrant 
hospitalization, there are 100 infants in the community also suffering from the 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually they are brought to the hospital when their breathing is labored and 
they are no longer able to eat or drink anymore," he said. In the hospital, he 
said, the babies receive intravenous fluids and are put on ventilators. Some of 
the most critically ill babies, he said, are treated with newer techniques such 
as high-frequency ventilation or are placed on heart-lung bypass machines. 
</P>
<P>
 It is important for parents to seek medical care for infants who show 
symptoms, Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If infants under a year have respiratory problems, they need to see a doctor, 
he said, "particularly those born prematurely or those with heart problems and 
lung problems or where something is wrong with their immune system."

DEFENSE ATTORNEYS DECRY LACK OF ASIANS ON GRAND JURY; JUDICIARY: ATTEMPTING TO 
OVERTURN INDICTMENTS IN SEVERAL CRIMINAL CASES, THEY ARGUE IN A SUPERIOR COURT 
HEARING THAT MINORITY CLIENTS WERE DENIED THEIR RIGHT TO JUDGMENT BY AN 
ETHNICALLY DIVERSE PANEL. 
</P>

<P>
 Defense attorneys seeking to overturn criminal indictments in several 
high-profile cases argued Wednesday that Asians have been unfairly excluded 
from voluntary service on the Orange County Grand Jury. 
</P>
<P>
 While prosecutors and county attorneys argued that Asians are not 
underrepresented on the panel that brings criminal indictments, defense 
attorneys said their Asian and other minority clients have been stripped of 
their constitutional right to have an ethnically mixed jury decide their fate. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're a group that is growing, and the difference between their numbers in 
the community and their numbers on the grand jury is important," said Deputy 
Public Defender Denise M. Gragg, who represents one of the teen-agers accused 
of killing Foothill High School honor student Stuart A. Tay. 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Dist. Atty. Eric W. Snethen argued that the grand jury system is 
being held to an unfair standard, since defense attorneys are using the term 
Asians to include numerous cultures and nationalities. In the past, Snethen has 
compared its use to the term Europeans.  
</P>
<P>
 Snethen said discrimination does not play a role in the grand jury system. 
County attorneys contend that the court system makes an effort to invite Asian 
residents to apply for the grand jury, but few take up the offer. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing on the defense attorneys' complaints, which began several days ago 
and ended Wednesday, was a showcase for number-crunching experts who used U.S. 
Census figures, population data and complex mathematical formulas to prove 
their points. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Asians made up 11.7% of Orange County's population, but only two 
Asians applied for a spot on the grand jury, according to data presented by a 
defense witness. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge Theodore E. Millard said he will make a 
ruling Wednesday on the motion to overturn the indictments. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the four defendants charged with the slaying of Tay on New Year's 
Eve, 1992, are Asian. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal challenge marks the latest attack on the Orange County Grand Jury. 
Many in the minority communities have complained about the lack of racial 
representation on the panel, which critics say led to a 1993 grand jury report 
linking immigration to a wide array of societal ills. 
</P>
<P>
 The report prompted outrage and helped trigger an upcoming fact-finding 
hearing by a panel of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights on the treatment of 
minorities in Orange County.

SANTA ANA TO WIELD NEW ANTI-CAMPING LAW; LEGISLATION: A SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE 
DENIES A REQUEST BY LEGAL ADVOCATES FOR THE HOMELESS TO HALT ENFORCEMENT OF THE 
ORDINANCE, WHICH GOES INTO EFFECT FRIDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The city has been cleared to start arresting homeless people Friday under a 
new law that bars individuals from using the Civic Center area for "living 
accommodations." 
</P>
<P>
 Legal advocates for the homeless asked Orange County Superior Court Judge 
Robert J. Polis on Wednesday to halt enforcement of the law, which was passed 
in December, until the court rules on whether it is constitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 But Polis rejected the request for a temporary restraining order, saying that 
the law, which bars people from sleeping, cooking or storing items in public 
areas of the Civic Center, seems likely to "pass muster." 
</P>
<P>
 "This new ordinance, being more surgical, less broad (and) more focused on 
specific problems, is more likely to survive a constitutional attack," Polis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant City Atty. Robert Wheeler said the city must "maintain the safety of 
the Civic Center." 
</P>
<P>
 The anti-camping ordinance is the city's second law to push the homeless from 
public areas, and police have also used a state law against lodging in public 
places to clear transients. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers from the Legal Aid Society of Orange County have challenged both the 
state law and Santa Ana's first ordinance, and police have been blocked from 
enforcing them. 
</P>
<P>
 Criminal cases against 25 homeless people cited under the first ordinance have 
been stalled while the court deliberates. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4th District Court of Appeal is expected to decide on the first 
ordinance's constitutionality within weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Police will post flyers describing the latest law in the Civic Center over the 
next few days, Wheeler said, and then will begin citing those who violate the 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal Aid lawyer Harry Simon said he will ask Polis to decide on the 
constitutionality of the new city ordinance and the state anti-lodging statute 
in about three months. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon questioned the new law because, he said, it restricts the freedom of a 
homeless person to travel in Santa Ana, is written vaguely and constitutes 
cruel and unusual punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Polis said the law is likely to stand up constitutionally because it 
concentrates on a small portion of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 He also indicated that he would like to hear, in future hearings, whether 
homeless people in Santa Ana have any other place to go at night. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 351 shelter beds and about 3,000 homeless people in the city, Simon 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the judge wants evidence on that, we're going to force the city to cough 
up that evidence," he said.

NOT GUILTY PLEA IN MISAPPROPRIATION CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former county welfare employee pleaded not guilty Wednesday to providing 
food stamps and cash to a relative who was not eligible for aid, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgina Martinez, 28, is charged with two felony counts each of 
misappropriating public funds and being an accessory to welfare fraud. 
Martinez, who was an eligibility technician with the Orange County Social 
Services Agency, has since been fired, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office investigated the suspected misappropriation 
after it was allegedly discovered by social services officials. If convicted, 
Martinez faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison.

 An 18-year-old pedestrian was shot in the head Wednesday in what police said 
was a gang-related attack. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, Benjamin Silva Torivio of Santa Ana, was reported in critical 
condition at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Torivio and a companion were walking west in the 400 block of East Vance 
Street near the intersection of French Street, when a small pickup truck 
passed, Lt. Bob Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 yards away, the truck stopped and the passenger got out and fired a 
handgun three times in the direction of the pedestrians, witnesses told police. 
One of the shots hit Torivio in the head. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no conversation between the pedestrians and the two men in the 
truck, witnesses said, and the pickup sped away. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are investigating the shooting as gang-related, Helton said. The pickup 
truck is described as a dark red or maroon Nissan or Toyota with primer on the 
driver's door, left front fender and tailgate.

WATER SERVICE STILL UNAVAILABLE TO THOUSANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 They awoke Wednesday for the third straight day without one of the basic 
necessities of life. Tens of thousands of families were without water to wash 
in, to brush their teeth with, to flush their toilets, to drink. 
</P>
<P>
 From stuccoed condos in Reseda to posh mansions on the Westside, the fractured 
infrastructure began to reveal how grinding this long haul now will be. Broken 
pipes. Cracked aqueducts. Drinking water yellow with rust. No drinking water at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 In the northwest San Fernando Valley, about 40,000 customers of the Department 
of Water and Power were told that their faucets will probably be dry for the 
rest of the week. Despite round-the-clock efforts, DWP crews had been unable to 
repair breaks in two major aqueduct lines and hundreds of smaller water mains 
that fed their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands more customers throughout the city were told to expect low pressure 
or cloudy or contaminated water for days, the result of power problems and 
other snafus at filtration plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents between DeSoto Avenue and Balboa Boulevard and north of the Foothill 
Freeway (I-210) between the Golden State Freeway (I-5) and Hubbard Avenue were 
expected to have intermittent service. And a "boil water" advisory was expanded 
to include customers west of Fairfax Avenue and south of Sunset Boulevard, all 
the way to Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 For the poor and infirm, the loss was no mere inconvenience. Suddenly, basic 
sanitation had a price. In some sectors of the Valley, drinking water was 
selling for $6 a quart and more. Word of water drop-off centers was spreading 
slowly among refugees cut off from media reports. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see the water bottle trucks go by, but they just pass us by," said Alma 
Hernandez, who sat huddled with her neighbors beside a makeshift tent outside a 
cracked Northridge apartment house. 
</P>
<P>
 Around her, half a dozen infants and children, sticky and tired, played in the 
concrete courtyard. Hernandez said the group had water, but they were unable to 
boil it because they have no gas for stoves. And they could not afford 
currently inflated prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have only one can of Similac for six babies," added neighbor Urania 
Walker, as she fed tiny sections of an orange to her parched 7-month-old baby 
girl. Beside her, another woman cradled her own infant, who was damp and 
feverish. 
</P>
<P>
 For those better off, the deprivation was also grating, in a way that somehow 
went deeper than, say, a cutoff in the electricity or gas supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Water is different," said Susan Smith, a Chatsworth woman who has been 
without it on and off since the quake. It had been days, she said, since her 
family had been able to flush the toilets in the three bathrooms of her 
3,200-square-foot home. Things were getting so smelly, she said, she was 
thinking of setting up a bucket brigade from her swimming pool to fill her 
toilet tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 And on Tuesday night, she had unthinkingly dropped some eggs into the garbage 
disposal, realizing a split second afterward that she would have to dig them 
back out, because they would end up rotting there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel dirty," said Smith, who devoutly hoped she could soon wash her hair. 
"There's no way to get clean." 
</P>
<P>
 At Northridge Hospital Medical Center, the water seemed to be everywhere but 
where people needed it. In the wrecked room that had once been the waiting area 
for the emergency room, broken pipes had flooded the carpets and soaked the 
ceiling tile. 
</P>
<P>
 But the toilet tanks were empty, and had been since Monday morning, when 
maintenance workers had begun carting water from the rehabilitation swimming 
pools to the bathroom in wheeled garbage cans. Doctors and nurses moved from 
patient to patient with plastic bottles of Crystal Geyser drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden," said surgical nurse Kyung Lee, "you realize what a precious 
thing it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the shortage arose from quake damage to the elaborate 
infrastructure that delivers water to this desert metropolis. DWP General 
Manager Dan Waters said that three of the four aqueducts serving Los Angeles 
have been severed, leaving most of the city to rely on a local reservoir system 
that contains a supply for just seven to 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Some DWP officials said that supply could be stretched to a month if 
necessary. And in seeking to bolster the limited local supply, the DWP has 
begun pumping ground water from wells in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Waters said, between 3,000 and 4,000 breaks in mains have already been 
reported. As water service is restored to West Valley neighborhoods, he added, 
many more will be identified. Moreover, the city's backup supplier, the 
Metropolitan Water District, also suffered a devastating blow in the 
earthquake. A 10-foot break in a huge pipe feeding the MWD's Granada Hills 
filtration plant prevented water in the California Aqueduct from reaching the 
San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials were hopeful that the pipe would be repaired by late Wednesday. With 
that line back in service, the MWD could begin service to about one-third of 
the North San Fernando Valley customers, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only about 1% of all the water used by Southern Californians daily is actually 
ingested. Water officials say that about half of all water used ends up 
watering lawns and flower beds. An additional 30% to 40% goes to washing 
people, clothes and dishes. And about 10% is simply lost, much of it running 
down the drain while users wait for hot water to come up. 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquakes create an especially dangerous set of conditions that can 
contaminate water supplies with bacteria and viruses that can lead to 
everything from a simple stomachache to life-threatening diseases such as 
cholera, said Mark Beuhler, director of water quality for the MWD. 
</P>
<P>
 Temblors can break underground sewage pipes as well as potable water mains. If 
water pressure drops, sewage can seep into the water lines, Beuhler said. 
Complicating the problem is the fact that breaks are difficult to pinpoint 
because they are underground. As a result, he said, predicting which homes may 
be getting contaminated water "is like Russian roulette." 
</P>
<P>
 That's why officials are recommending water sterilization for residents of 
vast areas of the city. For those with a water supply, but of questionable 
quality, water officials give the following advice: Boil water for at least 
five minutes or use eight drops of unscented household bleach per gallon if the 
water is clear. If the water is cloudy, 16 drops of bleach per gallon of water 
should be used. Either way, let the mixture sit for 30 minutes before drinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, DWP tankers filled with potable water will be at the following high 
schools from 5 a.m. to midnight: Chatsworth, Granada Hills, Kennedy, Sylmar, 
Cleveland, Taft, El Camino Real and Canoga Park. Tanker trucks are also 
dispensing water at Chatsworth Convalescent Home and Olive View-UCLA Medical 
Center. Ice will be available from 11:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. at Chatsworth, 
Granada Hills, Kennedy and Sylmar high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers should bring their own containers. There is no limit on how much 
water they can receive because the trucks are constantly refilling and 
returning to the sites. No Water 
</P>
<P>
 Water service for tens of thousands of San Fernando Valley residents could be 
a week away. In the meantime, water officials offer these tips on how to cope: 
</P>
<P>
 * Check to see if there is still water in your water heater, advises Matt 
Puffer of the Metropolitan Water District. There could be 50 gallons or more of 
potable water still there. "That can go a long way if you're just using it for 
drinking and washing your face," said Jerry Gewe of the Department of Water and 
Power. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pool owners can use that water to refill toilets, though they should not 
drink it because of all the chemicals typically present, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 * If there is no water available for filling toilets, Puffer said, 
constructing a chemical commode is simple. He suggests lining a 5-gallon bucket 
with two plastic trash or garbage bags. After using, toss in a handful of 
powered laundry detergent to keep down odors. And if you only need to urinate, 
Puffer said, "you can always just head for the rose bushes." 
</P>
<P>
 * Use paper cups and plates to eliminate dish washing, "or just eat out at 
McDonald's a little more often," Gewe said. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you suspect pipes are broken, turn off the water at the meter so there is 
no flooding when water returns. 
</P>
<P>
 * When the water does return, Puffer said, be sure to allow it to run for a 
while to clear out sediment in the pipes.

RESCUED FROM A PARKING LOT IN THE SKY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Of all the striking images of Monday's devastating earthquake, the sight of 
Sharon Adams' stranded 27-foot motor home will endure as one of the loneliest. 
</P>
<P>
 Perched on a road to nowhere -- a raised stretch of the Golden State Freeway, 
sheared off on both ends and supported only by a few wobbly looking pillars -- 
the vehicle was a stark reminder of the powerful force of nature. And on 
Wednesday, a daring rescue transformed the Class A cruiser into a symbol of 
something else: human ingenuity. 
</P>
<P>
 With a huge crane, a sturdy yoke and more than a little courage, a team of 
professional rescue workers harnessed Adams' motor home in its precarious 
parking space about 60 feet above Old Road in the Santa Clarita Valley. Then, 
ever so slowly, they lifted it over the freeway guardrail, swung it away from 
the overpass and lowered it to the ground. Working through several strong 
aftershocks over four hours, they also rescued an Oregon trucker's 65-foot rig 
and a Newhall man's pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe it -- there's hardly a scratch on it," said Adams, a 
51-year-old grandmother from Reno, who had been en route to an Arizona vacation 
when the Northridge quake hit, knocking a hole in the highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Ervin (Nick) Nichols, 49, the Oregon trucker, was equally impressed. "I 
haven't had this much excitement since my first divorce," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three days before, all Adams and Nichols had had in common was a stretch of 
road. Heading south on the Golden State Freeway, they had struck up a 
conversation on the CB radio. Adams admitted she wasn't familiar with the 
route. Nichols, whom she knew only by his handle, "Windwalker," suggested that 
she follow him over the Grapevine. They were in the slow lane, going about 50 
m.p.h. up a slight grade, when Adams saw Nichols slam on his brakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams' first thought was that Nichols had spotted an accident. But as she hit 
her brakes, she heard Nichols' voice over the CB radio. "Earthquake! 
Earthquake!" he yelled. 
</P>
<P>
 Nichols' truck, filled with 46,000 pounds of particle board, jackknifed twice 
before he could stop it. He flung open his door, stepped onto the still 
shuddering pavement and realized he was parked less than a foot from the 
sheared edge. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first thought was, 'Get the hell off this bridge,' " Nichols said 
Wednesday as he waited for his rig to be lowered from the overpass. Dave 
Farley, an electrician for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority who lives 
in Newhall, had precisely the same thought. He had brought his aqua pickup 
truck to a frantic halt just behind Nichols. And he was afraid the worst was 
not yet over. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I was going to die. I'll be honest with you. I thought the bridge 
was going down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Farley's fears were justified. A little south of where he stood, an LAPD 
motorcycle officer flew over the edge of a severed ramp where the Antelope 
Valley Freeway meets the Golden State, plunging to his death. And on the 
northbound side of the overpass on which Farley and the others had stopped, two 
vehicles toppled over the side. Miraculously, the passengers survived. 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily for Farley, Nichols and Adams, they had an escape route. To their 
north, the roadway had dropped about a foot where the overpass connects to the 
road, but it still seemed sturdy. Nichols went to the motor home, where a 
rattled Adams was trying to decide which belongings -- her silver fox fur 
jacket? her Christmas presents? her cellular phone? -- she should grab to take 
with her. Farley told her possessions wouldn't matter much if she wasn't around 
to enjoy them. Then they ran. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, their escape route would hold fast for hours -- it gave way 
Tuesday, and only then because Caltrans workers knocked the section out to 
relieve pressure on the overpass. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the pre-dawn darkness, all Nichols, Adams and Farley wanted was terra 
firma underfoot. When they reached it, Farley headed for home -- he was worried 
about his wife and two children, four miles away, and was determined to walk to 
them if he had to. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nichols and Adams were far from their families. They had nowhere to go, no 
one to stay with. A CHP officer offered them a lift to a Valencia hotel, but 
when they arrived they found the place closed because of damage. Then, in the 
hotel's parking lot, they met Danny and Jeannie Scoggin. The Scoggins were 
transporting a 40-foot motor home back to their Portland, Ore., home. But they, 
too, were stranded: Before leaving, they needed to pick up another vehicle in 
Saugus at a company that had not yet reopened its doors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Scoggins invited Nichols and Adams to temporarily move in with them. For 
two nights, the group shared the six-bunk motor home, eating potato chips and 
snack cakes and watching repeated reports about Nichols and Adams' stranded 
vehicles on television. 
</P>
<P>
 On the first night, a refugee from the damaged hotel stayed there as well: a 
coffee salesman who donated his samples to keep the motor home well stocked 
with caffeine. Water was a precious commodity -- the Scoggins, Nichols and 
Adams melted cubes from the hotel ice machine to brush their teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 They passed the time telling stories. Nichols admitted that this was actually 
his fourth earthquake on the road. During the 1989 San Francisco-area quake 
(magnitude 7.1) he had been on U.S. 880. Then there were last year's two 
magnitude 5.9 earthquakes in Klamath Falls, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
 His new friends teased him about being cursed. 
</P>
<P>
 "God wants you," said Danny Scoggin, 45, patting Nichols on the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Nichols smiled a tired smile. Maybe he was in the wrong place at the wrong 
time, he said, but Monday's magnitude 6.6 quake was the worst he had ever felt. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were just rocking and rolling all over the road," he said. "I'm not a 
religious man, but I think I'm going to start carrying some religious tapes to 
listen to. I'll have to throw all that country-Western out." 
</P>
<P>
 Adams, too, said a divine force must have looked out for her and her 
wide-bodied cruiser. "Somebody has to be watching," she said. "A split second 
and we would've been off the side." When the crane first lifted Nichols' rig 
off the overpass, Adams crossed herself. "You cross your heart and hope," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Curt Gillette, a general field supervisor for Penhall International who was 
overseeing Wednesday's vehicle rescue, appreciated the prayers. His crew was 
experienced, he said -- they had hoisted vehicles off the Embarcadero Freeway 
after the Bay Area quake. But big vehicles, particularly ones like Adams' 
mobile fortress, were easily damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem with a motor home is it has no structure. They're like a beer 
can: They just crush from the outside," he told her, delivering what turned out 
to be an unnecessary warning about possible damage. Gillette's crew won 
applause by getting all the vehicles down unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
 After everyone had been reunited with their vehicles, talk turned to planning 
another reunion -- of the survivors of the Freeway to Nowhere and the people 
who helped them survive. They exchanged addresses and phone numbers and took 
snapshots of one another. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to be sad to see you go," Jeannie Scoggin, 48, told Nichols. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, we'll keep in touch. After something like this, that's what you do," 
Nichols said, pointing up above to where his rig had been perched just a few 
minutes before. "We're going to get together every year and have a barbecue up 
on that span."

500 INSPECTORS DECIDE WHO CAN GO HOME AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
 As thousands of residents made uneasy assessments of their own, a small army 
of more than 500 building inspectors fanned out across Los Angeles on Wednesday 
to determine whether thousands of houses and apartments damaged by the quake 
could be reoccupied. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials estimated that they had inspected nearly 3,000 residential and 
commercial buildings by Wednesday evening but said there were many more still 
to be checked for structural soundness and other safety problems. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the deployment, many residents said they had not been contacted by 
authorities, leaving them in an uncomfortable limbo -- trying to measure 
whether it was worse to spend another night camping in the cold or to return to 
houses and apartments riddled with cracks and sagging roofs. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents and business people flooded the city's dozen hot lines with more 
than 200 calls an hour, and many others found the phones busy. Inspectors on 
the street were besieged by worried residents who were looking for reassurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when the inspectors had declared buildings safe, they found that many 
residents were too nervous to move back in, particularly after two sizable 
aftershocks Wednesday afternoon. Inspectors spent much of their time trying to 
persuade the fearful to return home. 
</P>
<P>
 The task of inspecting for quake damage -- from the north end of the San 
Fernando Valley to San Pedro -- proved far greater than officials had 
anticipated. Initially, they hoped to complete the bulk of the work by Tuesday 
evening, but it continued through Wednesday and is expected to take at least 
one more day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a much bigger job than after the riots," said Art Johnson, the second in 
command in the city's Department of Building and Safety. "Then (damage) was 
pretty much restricted to commercial corridors. . . . We didn't have to fan out 
into neighborhoods for mile after mile after mile." 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the day Wednesday, building officials were tabulating 
information from the damage survey and said they plan to release results today. 
They said computer problems and other glitches had delayed a more prompt 
assessment of the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren O'Brien, general manager of the Department of Building and Safety, said 
he expects "at least a couple hundred" structures to be condemned, meaning they 
will need to be torn down or undergo major repairs to be safe. 
</P>
<P>
 As of 3 p.m. Wednesday, at least 217 buildings were already condemned, said 
Greig Smith, chief of staff for Councilman Hal Bernson, in whose district much 
of the damage occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 The vast majority of the condemned structures were houses and apartment 
complexes, and most were in the San Fernando Valley, the epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Monica, officials said nearly half of the 500 structures inspected 
there had been declared at least temporarily uninhabitable, including several 
along the popular pedestrian mall, the Third Street Promenade. Reports of 
damaged and condemned buildings also were being compiled as far away as Pomona 
and Azusa. 
</P>
<P>
 The total damage assessment for the region remained imprecise but Gov. Pete 
Wilson projected it could reach $15 billion to $30 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary checks with Los Angeles officials showed that structures built 
after standards were tightened in 1973 fared better in Monday's earthquake. 
Inspectors said the bulk of dozens of buildings that have already been 
condemned were built before the 1971 Sylmar earthquake prompted a revision of 
Los Angeles' building codes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chet Widom, president-elect of the American Institute of Architects, said 
there was a disturbing lack of consistency to much of the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "There doesn't seem to be a trend from what we can gather," said Widom, whose 
own Santa Monica office suffered serious damage despite an earthquake 
retrofitting six years ago. "We're seeing all kinds of buildings in various 
kinds of failure." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles doubled the number of inspectors on the streets Wednesday -- to 
540, including 40 volunteers from the Assn. of Structural Engineers. But even 
with the extra inspectors, and working 12-hour shifts, progress was slow 
because of the widespread damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren O'Brien, general manager of the Department of Building and Safety, said 
the time spent reassuring residents was slowing up the inspections themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are being besieged because everyone wants to talk to us and tell us their 
story," O'Brien said. "We are trying to be polite and considerate, but it slows 
us down a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 The officials urged residents to be patient and, with suspect buildings, to 
wait until they receive official clearance before moving back. But many 
residents found the question of safety clouded by other issues, ranging from 
fear to financial insecurity. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Saticoy Apartments along Saticoy Street in Canoga Park, tenants were 
weighing the battered appearance of their homes against the assurances of their 
landlord that the building was safe. The rear apartments had moved several 
inches, and teetered precariously above several thin concrete stilts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The owner says it's safe, but with all the cracks all over . . ." said Felix 
Galarza. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's another earthquake," said his neighbor, Lucy Garavito, 16, "it 
will fall." 
</P>
<P>
 As the residents pondered their options shortly after the quake, apartment 
owner Robert Thum said the damage was merely cosmetic. "Sure, they're safe," he 
said. He said the large fissures in the building were the result of brittle 
stucco. "The building is earthquake-built and it will move but it won't break," 
Thum said. "The stucco is solid, so it breaks." 
</P>
<P>
 At another Canoga Park apartment, Dianne Herrmann stared through cracks in the 
walls so large that she could see the sky. She wanted to move her family out, 
but said she did not have the money. "We don't have anyplace to go," Herrmann 
said. "We have to stay until we figure out what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Housing Department was trying to inform people that they might have 
the money to move, even without government assistance. Landlords are required 
to return and advance rent for uninhabitable buildings, along with any 
deposits. And although the city's rent stabilization law allows two weeks to 
refund the money, Housing Department chief Gary Squier said many building 
owners had agreed to reimburse tenants more promptly. 
</P>
<P>
 If the refunds are not enough to allow tenants to move into new homes, 
additional funds will be available from the Federal Emergency Management Agency 
and city Housing Department, Squier said. At another apartment complex on Van 
Nuys Boulevard, residents took matters into their own hands when city 
inspectors told them it might take several days for them to come by. The 
residents of the 48-unit building hired their own contractor to check on the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tenants took over the building," said resident Kitty Rourke. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the contractor spotted a few problems, residents nonetheless felt 
comfortable enough to move back in. "Where else can you go?" asked Judith 
Tuckich. "The longer you stay away, the harder it is to move back in." 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of the inspectors, nearly 400, were assigned to the Valley. They 
fanned out from the Van Nuys government center for a block-by-block review of 
the hardest hit communities, such as Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 At some locations, such as the Northgate apartment complex on a Granada Hills 
hillside, inspectors made their calls quickly. Three inspectors visiting there 
found concrete staircases buckled and deep cracks radiating through walls and 
columns supporting underground garages. 
</P>
<P>
 "These units here -- they gotta get everybody out of here, right now," said 
inspector Bob Sunday, nodding in the direction of residents who were packing up 
furniture, clothes and bedding. Yellow tape and red warning signs were up on 
the building within minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, a quick drive-by was enough to assure inspectors that problems were 
not severe. 
</P>
<P>
 The weary inspectors sometimes spent as much time addressing the cracks in 
human psyches as those in buildings. "We're running into that a lot -- people 
are scared and just want reassurance," said inspector George Meyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Building and Safety Department spokesman David Keim and others said they fear 
many people in the city have unnecessarily fled to parks and other open spaces, 
and that they only need reassurance that their homes can be safely occupied. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want anyone homeless if they don't have to be," said Pat Talley, an 
inspector working out of the department's Northridge substation Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The inspection teams tried to take time to offer some quick advice -- strap 
down that water heater, cover that fallen chimney in case of rain, secure that 
now unfenced swimming pool from wandering children. 
</P>
<P>
 They also dispensed comfort. Inspectors walked through Leigh Laird's home even 
though her husband, a construction supervisor, already had told her it was 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank you," she sighed, after inspectors gave her the thumbs up. "I guess 
we're all just paranoid." 
</P>
<P>
 Several Los Angeles City Council members had complained Tuesday that districts 
away from the epicenter were receiving little attention from inspectors, but 
they said the problem seemed to be largely remedied by Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some residents in the outlying areas couldn't help but feel neglected. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Contreras and about a dozen other residents were camped outside their 
South-Central Los Angeles apartment building, hoping that building inspectors 
would come. None did. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like we have been forgotten," Contreras said. "No one has come by to 
help us." 
</P>
<P>
 The two-story, four-unit apartment had been lifted about six inches from its 
foundation and stood at a slight angle. Broken glass littered the floor of the 
ramshackle rooms. The walls were cracked in the closet that serves as the 
bedroom for Contreras' two daughters, ages 5 and 7. 
</P>
<P>
 The building owner, Lee Linden, said he had been trying for two days to reach 
the Building and Safety Department, but that the line was always busy. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't get through," he said. "I'm sick and tired of it (getting no 
response). I'm doing what I can do." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they hope to learn something from the pattern of the 
destruction, when more thorough reports are compiled. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Marvin Braude, chairman of the council's Building 
and Safety Committee, said Wednesday that the panel will discuss on Monday 
possible changes in the Building Code to strengthen older residential buildings 
such as the Northridge apartment complex that collapsed, killing 16. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the most immediate problem that the panel will discuss is whether the 
city is moving fast enough to inspect buildings damaged in the quake to see if 
they are habitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will start the inquiry," he said. "I expect the inquiry to start a lot of 
probing."

5.1 AFTERSHOCKS ROCK SOUTHLAND; CLINTON VISITS L.A., VOWS AID; TOLL CLIMBS TO 
47; DISASTER: COMMUTES ARE SLOW AND THE SAFETY OF MANY BUILDINGS IS STILL 
UNCERTAIN. GOV. WILSON'S OFFICE SAYS THE DISASTER COULD BE THE COSTLIEST IN 
U.S. HISTORY.

 President Clinton visited a still shaking Los Angeles on Wednesday as the city 
inched from the urgency of disaster to the grim reality of post-quake life: 
tediously slow commutes, uncertainty about the soundness of buildings and a 
death toll that rose to 47, with four new victims found in the hard-hit San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, who arrived in time to be rocked by two magnitude 5.1 aftershocks in 
the early afternoon, offered relief and federal money to rebuild communities 
and the region's vital transportation links. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a national problem. We have a national responsibility," Clinton told 
an audience of elected officials and other leaders at a meeting in a hangar at 
Burbank Airport before returning to Washington. "This is something we intend to 
stay with until the job is over." 
</P>
<P>
 It promises to be a multibillion-dollar job: 
</P>
<P>
 * Gov. Pete Wilson's office told federal officials that the quake's financial 
toll could conservatively rise to $30 billion or more and exceed Hurricane 
Andrew in 1992 as the costliest natural disaster in the nation's history. The 
damage to public facilities and highways alone was pegged by the governor at 
$500 million. In light of the state's economic troubles and the recent 
wildfires, Wilson asked the Federal Emergency Management Agency for full 
reimbursement of that sum instead of the standard 75%. Clinton said he was 
considering a federal share of 90%. 
</P>
<P>
 * At a Caltech news briefing, scientists said the sequence of aftershocks has 
now become "very energetic" and "slightly above the normal" for such quakes. 
Seismologist Egill Hauksson said the center of the pattern of aftershocks, 
numbering over 1,000, had migrated about five miles northwest from the 
Northridge epicenter of Monday's 6.6 magnitude quake. 
</P>
<P>
 * Residents and city officials braced for a rainstorm predicted for the 
weekend, which would add to the miseries of at least 18,000 people still 
camping in parks across the city, as well as those living with cracked roofs 
and walls. Anxious officials tried to get park dwellers to return to homes that 
were safe, sending out bilingual reassurance teams and launching a blimp 
flashing airborne messages and informational telephone numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 * More than 500 building inspectors fanned out across Los Angeles to determine 
how many of the nearly 2,000 structures damaged by the quake and aftershocks 
were still habitable, tagging total losses with red warning signs and those 
that were safe with green notices. On numerous streets on the Westside, 
residents ordered out of their condemned apartment buildings caused a run on 
rental moving vans. 
</P>
<P>
 * Even though many people tried to return to work, creating long ticket lines 
at the Metrolink station serving the Santa Clarita Valley and jamming surface 
streets near damaged freeways, many also struggled with continued disruption of 
their basic services: Water was expected to be shut off to as many as 40,000 
homes for several more days and more than 30,000 Department of Water and Power 
customers were still without power by 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * An 11 p.m.-to-dawn curfew continued through this morning, although Los 
Angeles police said they made only 75 arrests during a second extraordinarily 
quiet night Tuesday. Even so, good citizenship was not universal: More than 100 
people called the city's anti-price gouging hot line with reports of merchants 
charging as much as $65 for a pizza and $10 for a gallon of milk. There were 
also reports of tension in Pacoima, where police increased patrols Wednesday 
night to counter threats of violence by gang members displaced from Roger 
Jessup Park by a dozen families camping there. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ventura County, where damage was estimated at $1 billion Wednesday, made the 
list of federal disaster areas, making county agencies eligible for financial 
aid and residents for rental assistance and low-interest construction loans. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hoping to get reimbursement for the quake-caused damage to Anaheim Stadium, 
Orange County supervisors Wednesday declared their county a disaster area, even 
though it was spared the kind of devastation wreaked in Los Angeles. County 
officials said FEMA urged the county to make the declaration, which also will 
help local fire and police departments seek help with expenses for assisting 
with problems in Los Angeles County. The Northridge temblor caused the 17-ton 
scoreboard in the city-owned stadium to tumble. Tragedy Still Unfolding 
</P>
<P>
 It was the day that the emergency gave way to the hassles and uncertainties of 
post-quake life and the realization sank in that the impact of the disaster 
would linger for months and possibly years. Even so, the enormity of the 
tragedy grew as workers continued to dig the dead out of collapsed-house 
coffins. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunswept Drive in Studio City, Michael Minkow, 49, his wife, Lola, 46, and 
mother, Rose, 75, survived when their four-story hillside house imploded and 
slid. But the body of Lola's mother, Beatrice Baitman, 69, was found in the 
early evening Wednesday still in bed and buried under 20 feet of tile, concrete 
and glass. 
</P>
<P>
 The bodies of Robert (Sarge) Pauline, 72, and his wife, Judith Ng, 42, were 
found Tuesday night in their Van Nuys home in the 14200 block of Kittridge 
Street after neighbors alerted police patrols that they had not been seen since 
the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Pauline, a retired photographer, artist and occasional movie extra, and Ng, 
who worked in the Los Angeles Housing Department, were found crushed under 
hundreds of pounds of books, model trains and the other collectibles that were 
their hobby. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were eccentric, but they were kind, friendly people," said Jeff Ng, the 
victim's brother, as he delved through hundreds of videocassette tapes hoping 
to find a recorded will. "They collected things, stacks of stuff. They had a 
pathway to get around." 
</P>
<P>
 A 62-year-old man was found Wednesday dead of what was thought to be a 
quake-related heart attack suffered as he sat in a car in front of his 
partially collapsed Northridge home. The Coming Rain 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 18,000 people camped out in the city's parks Tuesday night -- 
about half of them children -- and officials said it is their top priority to 
find them housing before the arrival of rain, predicted for late Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Storms could pose other problems as well: Damage to quake-damaged homes and 
landslides on hillsides stripped of vegetation during last fall's brush fires. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis Brack, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., said there is a 40% 
chance of light showers this weekend and the possibility of several storms next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to get those people out of the parks," said Jackie Tatum, general 
manager of the Department of Recreation and Parks. "It's unhealthy out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Tatum said her department will provide centers for the distribution of 
rain-proof plastic sheeting that residents can use to cover damaged roofs. The 
sheeting is also being used in some areas to cover vegetation-bare hillsides 
that could slide if wet. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasing the prospect of homelessness, however, were additional evacuation 
orders Wednesday by city inspectors at scores of buildings throughout the 
earthquake zone. An estimated 3,000 buildings had been checked by Wednesday 
evening but many more still needed to be examined for structural soundness and 
other safety problems. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the continuing aftershocks tended to reinforce the widely held 
perception that returning to any quake-damaged building is unsafe. Police Chief 
Willie L. Williams said that is not necessarily true, especially if city 
inspectors have declared a building fit for habitation. 
</P>
<P>
 "A crack in the wall doesn't mean that you can't go back home," Williams said. 
The President Visits 
</P>
<P>
 As a small down payment on what Administration budget officials expect will be 
a multibillion-dollar federal relief effort, Clinton announced release of $45 
million in emergency transportation grants to pay for removing rubble and 
beginning emergency repairs on freeways, and $95 million in Small Business 
Administration funds that will allow the agency to leverage up to $239 million 
in loans to area businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 During Clinton's five-hour tour, he got an earful from those struggling with 
the devastating after-effects of Monday's jolt. He walked briefly along Balboa 
Boulevard and Rinaldi Street in Granada Hills, shaking hands and listening to 
people whose homes had been destroyed and lives disrupted. 
</P>
<P>
 "No water. No electricity. I haven't had a shower in three days," said one 
man. Another told Clinton about a neighbor who had rescued his son from their 
crumbled house. And a woman who lost her house told Clinton she had seen stores 
jacking up prices for water and other necessities and had heard from friends 
who planned to try to cheat their insurance companies to gain extra money. 
People should "do the right thing, and we'll be all right," Clinton later said 
the woman had told him. 
</P>
<P>
 As he drove through the area, Clinton could see the sporadic and seemingly 
random nature of the earthquake damage -- a crumbled house standing in a line 
with other houses apparently left intact, tents pitched in front yards and in a 
public park, a row of shattered windows covered with plywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week, once preliminary damage estimates are in, Clinton said he plans to 
send Congress a special budget request to cover the costs of cleaning up and 
rebuilding the region. Clinton may announce the request in next week's State of 
the Union speech, officials said. Toll in Ventura County 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going up by the minute," Ventura County Supervisor Vicky Howard said of 
damage estimates. "At first blush we looked around and said we came through 
this pretty well. But as the hours and days passed we discovered that there is 
much more damage than we first thought." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard was part of a Ventura County delegation led by Rep. Elton Gallegly 
(R-Simi Valley) that met with Clinton at Burbank Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "We told him we also have devastation in Ventura County," Gallegly said. "In 
the east end of Simi Valley we literally have thousands of pieces of property 
with major structural damage. That area is less than seven miles from the 
epicenter." 
</P>
<P>
 At a Red Cross emergency shelter at Royal High School in Simi Valley, 
temporary home to 70 people, Frances Echterling, 60, summed up the feelings of 
many Southland residents. Echterling's house was damaged, first by the quake 
and then by a natural gas fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unbearable," she said. "There are holes in the roof and I don't even 
know if it's safe to go in and I can't even begin to think about what it's 
going to cost to get everything fixed." Moving Out and Moving On 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than continue living with uncertainty for several more days, tenants of 
a damaged 48-unit apartment building on Van Nuys Boulevard in Sherman Oaks 
hired a contractor to check out the complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our landlord just deserted us," resident Kitty Rourke said. "The tenants took 
over the building." The building turned out to be safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Sections of nearby streets were clogged with residents deserting uninhabitable 
apartments. On a short stretch of Willis Avenue there were 27 moving vans, and 
tenants warned not to linger for long in their sagging units darted in and out 
with the help of friends and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiorenza Lewis' building tilted noticeably. Her two-bedroom, $875-a-month 
apartment was a shambles, its walls collapsed, its windows blown out. "It's a 
total miracle we're alive," she said, waiting for a friend with a truck. 
</P>
<P>
 She and her husband, Mark, were going to move in with his parents in North 
Hollywood. All morning the couple had been running in and out of their 
apartment, depositing their belongings on the lawn: books, a television, a 
string of Christmas tree lights, several bottles of champagne, clothing and 
photo albums. 
</P>
<P>
 "They tell you not to go in but you go in anyhow," said Lewis, an assistant in 
the feature music department at Universal Studios. "I know possessions mean 
nothing but you think of photos your parents gave you and you go back." 
</P>
<P>
 Amid runs on food and water, flashlights and other supplies in many 
neighborhoods, the efforts to move to safer quarters and to secure belongings 
created new shortages. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving companies were overwhelmed by calls from residents and business owners, 
many of whom were trying to beat condemnation orders that would prohibit movers 
from entering an unsafe structure. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are calling to get out of their buildings before they are condemned 
and torn down," said Tom Smith, president of L.A. Moving & Storage in Arleta. 
Smith's company is moving about 30 households a day, mostly apartment dwellers 
in damaged buildings in Northridge, Sherman Oaks and Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every man and every truck that is available is out there working," said Paul 
Bement, national accounts sales manager for Sylmar-based Security Moving & 
Storage, whose 40 movers are booked through next Monday. "It's been crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Even places for storage were in short supply, particularly for those 
struggling to get by. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg took advantage of the President's 
visit to insist that the city -- and federal government -- not overlook how the 
quake had displaced thousands of the area's poorest residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Her immediate concern: untold numbers of poor, in Hollywood and elsewhere, who 
had no place to store what little they own and were refusing emergency shelters 
for fear that their few belongings would be stolen in the night. Food Donations 
</P>
<P>
 As residents prepared to spend a third consecutive night under the stars, an 
informal private relief effort accelerated. 
</P>
<P>
 Food donations hinted at the city's ethnic sprawl: 21,000 bagels from one 
company, 73,000 dinner rolls from another, more than 100,000 tortillas from a 
third. 
</P>
<P>
 In Reseda, hundreds of displaced residents waited patiently for two hours 
under the blazing sun to get their share of $250,000 worth of food, water and 
other supplies donated by Shell Oil Co. and its dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Eshelman, 33, of Riverside, came on his day off to unload 4,300 bags of 
ice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am fine but it's a little cold in here," said Eshelman, standing in a 
trailer filled with bags of ice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to help because I would like people to do the same if I am in 
their situation." 
</P>
<P>
 In West L.A., police closed the busy intersection of Olympic Boulevard and 
Barrington Avenue because of the slow collapse of a six-story medical office 
building. The closure exacerbated traffic tie-ups caused by the toppling Monday 
of a section of the Santa Monica Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Rows of windows were buckled and shattered, more than a dozen yard-wide, 
X-shaped cracks cleaved supporting pillars. Shards of glass and chunks of 
concrete rained on the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm part of this building and it breaks my heart," said Kay Veach, who has 
operated the building's coffee shop -- Marshall's -- since 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD Sgt. Stan Schott said city building and safety inspectors pronounced the 
structure in immediate danger of collapse. Based on that decision, police 
closed off traffic along Olympic and Barrington, and about a dozen National 
Guard members helped redirect motorists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Public safety is our first priority," Schott said, "then comes traffic." 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Monica, officials waived fees for earthquake repairs to more than 240 
badly damaged buildings, and frazzled residents sought solace from a 
roller-coaster week of evacuations and unnerving aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Building inspectors had checked out 500 buildings, labeling 100 of them unsafe 
to live in. More than 250 people crowded a Red Cross shelter at Santa Monica 
College Tuesday night, and city officials announced that a federal 
disaster-relief center will be set up Thursday to handle aid applications from 
people who had lost homes or property. 
</P>
<P>
 Frenzied residents loaded belongings into cars outside the beachside Sea 
Castle Apartment building, a city landmark crumpled in the quake. Rumors were 
flying among residents that the damaged building would be locked up. In fact, 
the building was deemed unsafe by city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just look at the exodus outside," one resident said. "They're all panicking!" 
Back to Work 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the scope of the tragedy continued to unfold, many tried to get on 
with their lives and sought to return to their jobs. They were greeted by 
choked traffic, packed Metrolink trains and crowded parking lots at Metrolink 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
 They quickly came to realize that however bad the current snarl, the coming 
days will be worse as more people return to work and school resumes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's gonna throw a hitch in everybody's get-along," said Kevin Butler, a 
Palmdale resident who took 4 hours and 15 minutes to get to the Burbank office 
of his fire door company. "I'm pretty drained." 
</P>
<P>
 The flip side of Butler's agony was that, generally, commuters who lived to 
the east, northeast or south of Downtown experienced few problems. 
</P>
<P>
 For Bob Kessler, a computer consultant for Arco, the bus commute from 
Westchester to Downtown was no longer than normal, despite detours, but when 
the vehicle was able to pull onto the virtually deserted Santa Monica Freeway 
at La Brea Avenue, it was like entering the Twilight Zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "What was eerie was getting on the freeway and there was no traffic because 
that was the first entrance open after the structural damage," Kessler said. 
Commuter Trains Full 
</P>
<P>
 Commuters who rode the Metrolink from Santa Clarita to Downtown Los Angeles 
seemed to fare much better than those who drove their cars and got caught in 
the nightmarish stream of traffic crawling through the Newhall Pass on 
Wednesday morning, where traffic was reported backed up for miles. 
</P>
<P>
 All four Metrolink trains from Santa Clarita to Downtown Los Angeles were full 
Wednesday morning, carrying about 4,000 passengers per train, said Brendan 
Shepherd, a spokesman for the commuter rail system. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the earthquake, Metrolink carried only about 500 people a day from 
Santa Clarita to Los Angeles. Since the earthquake, Metrolink expanded each 
Santa Clarita train to eight cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Motoring commuters from the Antelope and Santa Clarita valleys, tens of 
thousands of whom use the Antelope Valley Freeway daily to get to work, woke up 
earlier than usual to begin their trek. 
</P>
<P>
 They were accepting, perhaps rudingly, that inconvenience and frustration have 
become a part of Los Angeles life, indefinitely.

<P>
 As thousands more Los Angeles-area commuters returned to work Wednesday, 
bottlenecks grew by several miles on some quake-damaged routes and 
transportation officials raced to expand transit service and boost the ability 
of key surface streets to handle overflow traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, backups were estimated at nearly 11 miles and two hours 
approaching the collapsed junction of the Golden State and Antelope Valley 
freeways near Newhall, where a landslide temporarily blocked the main alternate 
route along Sierra Highway, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale resident Kevin Butler, who owns a Burbank fire door company, watched 
his normal one-hour commute extended to four hours and 15 minutes Wednesday. 
"I'm pretty drained," Butler said, after rising at 4:15 a.m. and creeping along 
the Antelope Valley Freeway for nearly three hours before reaching the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 In the afternoon, commuters headed back to Palmdale and Santa Clarita waited 
for up to two hours on Roxford Street in Sylmar, after being routed off the 
Foothill Freeway. "This is terrible, I can't stand it," said John Carusillo, a 
landscaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Wednesday, Metropolitan Transportation Authority chief Franklin White 
announced a $100-million crash program to expand bus service and add four 
Metrolink commuter rail stations, extending service as far north as Lancaster, 
well beyond the Golden State and Antelope Valley Freeway interchange. The 
project, which will include dozens of additional rail cars, is to be completed 
within three weeks. The first two stations, in Lancaster and Palmdale, are 
scheduled to open Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We observed backups on (the Antelope Valley Freeway) as long as 11 miles," 
MTA Chairman Richard Alatorre said Wednesday. "We need to divert traffic off 
(the highway) as far north as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink service to Simi Valley and Moorpark, which was suspended because of 
a train derailment Monday, also was scheduled to resume today. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a special express bus service was to be started this morning to 
carry workers from the Santa Monica-Malibu area to Downtown Los Angeles -- 
around destroyed sections of the Santa Monica Freeway. A main boarding station 
was set up at the Will Rogers State Beach parking lot at Ocean and Pico 
boulevards in Santa Monica, with service every 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's earthquake destroyed 11 highway structures at eight locations, 
officials said, closing a total of 14 roads, including a 3.5-mile stretch of 
the Santa Monica Freeway, the nation's busiest stretch of highway. 
</P>
<P>
 And officials also warned Wednesday that the volume of cars snaking through 
detours still appeared well below normal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We definitely figure it's going to get worse in the next few days," Caltrans 
spokesman Russell Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials emphasized that the vast majority of the 597-mile freeway system in 
Los Angeles and Ventura counties flowed at least as freely as normal Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But they also were glum in assessing the ability of their patchwork of detours 
in quake-ravaged areas to absorb a tide of vehicles that could materialize in 
the days ahead as people return to normal routines. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way what we can put up will handle the amount of vehicles out 
there," said Stanley J. Higgins, a supervisor in Caltrans' computerized traffic 
nerve center in Downtown Los Angeles. "People are going to have to learn to car 
pool and use mass transit." 
</P>
<P>
 At least for now, many were attempting to heed the advice. Motorists abandoned 
their cars to jam onto normally lightly traveled Metrolink commuter trains 
running to the city from the Santa Clarita Valley -- on the far side of the 
virtually impassable Newhall interchange. The double-decker trains from Santa 
Clarita were doubled in size to handle 1,200 passengers each, and all were 
filled as they pulled into Downtown's Union Station. "Great Scott -- we are at 
capacity," Metrolink spokesman Pete Hidalgo said. By day's end, officials said 
ridership on the Santa Clarita route had soared eightfold. 
</P>
<P>
 But frustration mounted as remote train station parking lots overflowed and 
hourlong ticket lines formed at sometimes confounding, automated ticket 
machines. "Quite frankly, it can be a frightening experience" for new 
passengers, Hidalgo said. "People don't know where to stand or how to buy a 
ticket." 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to adjust to the onslaught, officials tripled the size of Metrolink's 
staff on station platforms and, ultimately, instructed commuters to board 
trains with or without tickets and pay at their destinations. Also, the hunt 
was on Wednesday afternoon for more parking lots near stations, and officials 
were urging commuters to car pool or be dropped off at train stations. 
Officials also were encouraging new riders to purchase more convenient and 
economical monthly passes, which cost $144 for the trip from Santa Clarita to 
Los Angeles. Otherwise, each round trip is $10. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after passengers managed to board the trains Wednesday, things moved 
slowly. Trains rolled at reduced speeds because of continuing aftershocks, 
which caused 30-minute delays. And with the extra cars, trains exceed the 
length of Metrolink stations, forcing engineers to stop and start as they 
loaded passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 Navigating the final leg from stations to jobs provided some with a last, 
unwelcome challenge. Nicholas Nassif, a Los Angeles attorney who lives in 
Canyon Country and began riding Metrolink this week, developed his own strategy 
for using the rail line to his offices. He takes the train out of Santa 
Clarita, but uses his car to shuttle between the Metrolink station in Glendale 
and his office at Vermont Avenue and Wilshire Boulevard in the Mid-City area. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite delays, Metrolink rider Marlene Foreman, who normally rides the bus 
from her Rosamond home to a bank in Downtown Los Angeles, said the train was 
"better than what I expected." 
</P>
<P>
 The return trip Wednesday was more problematic. Service was temporarily 
disrupted after a 5.1 aftershock triggered a rock slide on freight tracks near 
the Newhall tunnel, Hidalgo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans engineers said they hope to have an additional bypass road open 
within four or five days at the collapsed Newhall interchange. And near the 
Santa Monica Freeway, local and state transportation officials were trying to 
gear up a high-tech, computerized system of traffic signals on adjacent 
boulevards to move larger volumes of rush-hour traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Tie-ups on detours around the damaged Santa Monica Freeway appeared modest 
Wednesday morning, although officials said many motorists appeared to have 
stayed home or blazed new routes. 
</P>
<P>
 Downtown attorney John Hodes, who lives in Playa del Rey, tried the newly 
opened Century Freeway and connected to the Harbor Freeway. "I got here faster 
than I ever got here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anticipating more problems ahead, MTA officials also said they would add 20 
buses beginning today to five existing Westside bus routes, increasing the 
frequency and capacity of MTA service on such major thoroughfares as Wilshire, 
Santa Monica and Sunset boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens more buses -- some borrowed from Orange County and other areas -- were 
being added in the Central City and Valley areas to help ferry rail commuters 
to employment centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some commutes were clearly nightmarish, highway experts emphasized 
that problems were largely localized. Overall, far more people are affected, 
for example, when a first, heavy rush-hour rainstorm snarls vast sections of 
the sprawling freeway system. "I've seen worse," said Caltrans' Joseph Brahm, a 
senior transportation engineer who was monitoring traffic flow Wednesday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, away from the points of greatest misery, there was a silver lining for 
some. Bottlenecks in outlying areas were holding back thousands of cars, 
meaning commutes Wednesday in some areas, including parts of the Valley, were 
far better than normal, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Westchester resident Bob Kessler, a computer consultant at Arco's headquarters 
Downtown, said his bus commute was no longer than normal, despite detours off 
the Santa Monica Freeway. That was partly because beyond the troubled area, the 
freeway was virtually deserted. 
</P>
<P>
 "What was eerie was getting on the freeway and there was no traffic," Kessler 
said.

COLUMN ONE; DISPATCHES FROM THE WAR ROOM; HOW DID L.A.'S EMERGENCY SYSTEM 
RESPOND TO ITS BIGGEST CHALLENGE EVER? A LOG FROM CITY HALL'S COMMAND POST 
SHOWS WHAT WENT RIGHT -- AND WRONG -- IN THE FIRST FRANTIC 24 HOURS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Less than half an hour after Monday's earthquake tore through Los Angeles at 
4:31 a.m., a cadre of emergency workers, their skills honed by the city's all 
too regular stream of catastrophes, descended on a subterranean City Hall 
bunker to manage the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 They would spend the next 24 hours frantically sifting through thousands of 
calls from law enforcement agencies in the field. During those crucial hours, 
they would face three disabled police stations, hazardous materials spills, 
broken gas mains, more than 100 fires, a jail riot, sporadic looting, a downed 
computer system and a dizzying array of urgent requests for help -- including a 
call from President Clinton asking how congressman Henry Waxman (D-Los Angeles) 
had fared. 
</P>
<P>
 Interviews and a minute-by-minute log of the Emergency Operations Center's 
activities obtained by The Times reveal the enormity of the emergency response 
to the earthquake. And they dramatically illustrate the obstacles encountered 
by city leaders as they tried to assess damage and dispatch thousands of 
police, firefighters, sheriff's deputies and National Guard troops to the 
hardest hit areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city government, the state government, the federal government, and the 
tens of thousands of citizens of this city all came together starting at about 
4:32 Monday morning," Police Chief Willie L. Williams said Wednesday. "There 
were no egos involved. 
</P>
<P>
 There was just a dedication to get the work done." EARLY HOURS 
</P>
<P>
 When the quake struck Monday morning, it left key links of the region's 
emergency response system in tatters. Parker Center, headquarters of the Los 
Angeles Police Department, was badly damaged: Water mains burst, flooding its 
computer operations. Power was out, as it was for most of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as Los Angeles groped about in the early morning darkness, city 
leaders rushed to the emergency center, four floors below City Hall East in a 
room designed to resist the strongest earthquake. There, dozens of harried 
workers scrambled to gather bits of information, working the phones, scanning 
banks of television sets, posting every report on computer screens. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, the silence from the city's police stations was alarming. Many 
telephone lines and computer systems were down. As the center received updates, 
things looked grim: 
</P>
<P>
 * 6:30 a.m.: Los Angeles International Airport had been closed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 6:50 a.m.: Three sewage treatment plants were down and 34 others were 
operating on emergency power. Landslides were reported throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
 * 7 a.m.: Two hospitals in the San Fernando Valley were closed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 6 to 7:30 a.m.: At least three LAPD stations -- Van Nuys, Devonshire and 
West Valley -- were a wreck, some without phones, some being evacuated. Others 
had no power. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan was at the emergency center within about 45 minutes of 
the earthquake, but Chief Williams, who lives in Woodland Hills, had a harder 
time getting in. He had narrowly escaped being pinned under a heavy armoire in 
his bedroom. After finally getting out of his house, he made it to the nearest 
police station and was flown Downtown by helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters took to the streets to search for damage, some hampered by the 
loss of electricity. Garage door openers were disabled, so station doors had to 
be wrenched open by hand. 
</P>
<P>
 An unconfirmed report said the Valley's Foothill LAPD station had been 
evacuated. At first, frustrated center officials could not confirm the 
information. Their fears would later be confirmed: The temblor rippled through 
the aging station, causing severe damage. Anxious officers abandoned it as soon 
as the shaking stopped. Outside, the parking structure was destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Van Nuys station, the situation also was bleak. Gas leaks were erupting 
throughout the area, a few looters had been seen, and a chlorine leak sparked 
concerns. The station was so damaged that an evacuation was under way by 7:15 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Another log entry from that time discloses an especially difficult decision 
that officers were forced to make: "Valley jail may be releasing misdemeanor 
suspects 10 at a time." 
</P>
<P>
 Damage to the station left them no choice; the police opened the cell doors 
and sent their misdemeanor offenders home. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the chief concerns of the LAPD was the fear that looting could break 
out, an anxiety rooted in the 1992 riots, when thousands of looters overwhelmed 
the Police Department and ran virtually unchecked for more than a day. The 
riots were one of the LAPD's darkest episodes, and this time police were 
determined to respond aggressively. 
</P>
<P>
 The first report of looting came to the center at 6:45 a.m. Officials from the 
Southeast area reported some looting and said they already had sent out 
patrols. At 7:30 a.m., when Van Nuys requested six squads to deal with any 
possible looters, police officials sent elite LAPD Metro officers within 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 That morning, LAPD Cmdr. David J. Gascon, sitting between rows of computers 
and eyeing the updates on a screen above his head, sternly reiterated the 
Police Department's determination to strike hard at looters. "There is no way 
that we will tolerate any looting in the wake of this event," he said. GAINING 
CONTROL 
</P>
<P>
 By about 9 a.m., the emergency center was a swirl of energy: Riordan moved 
from table to table, looking at computer screens and urging the staff to keep 
up its work. Top officials from every city department descended on the adjacent 
board room for briefings. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, emergency crews scrambled to get into the field. Updates to the 
center made it clear that fire crews, police and other emergency workers were 
desperately needed in Hollywood and the Valley. The city's far-flung resources 
were tapped. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD's training division quickly assembled more than 160 officers and 
recruits, and they hit the road. Officers working the night shift were held 
over. The entire Sheriff's Department was mobilized. Communications units were 
dispatched to the Valley so emergency commanders could get better information 
from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 One television report featured footage at 8:18 a.m. of cars passing beneath a 
badly buckled overpass along the Simi Valley Freeway. An emergency operations 
worker saw the report on a center TV set and sent word that the road needed to 
be closed, lest it fall in an aftershock. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department rushed to the aid of overwhelmed police officers, 
offering assistance in earthquake ravaged communities. At the same time, 
however, the Sheriff's Department was hit by a crisis of its own: a jail riot. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pitchess Honor Rancho in Saugus, long plagued by tension between black and 
Latino inmates, ignited in the chaos after the earthquake. Scores of deputies 
were needed to put down that insurrection, which left 19 inmates injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD was experiencing jail problems of a different sort. "Jail division 
accepting felony arrests only," the log entry for 8:45 a.m. reads. "The jail 
might be evacuated due to flooding." 
</P>
<P>
 City jails managed to hold onto their most serious offenders, but by day's end 
petty criminals had become some of the earthquake's few beneficiaries. All 
misdemeanor suspects ultimately were released from city custody. 
</P>
<P>
 That morning, however, it was fire that most preoccupied emergency center 
officials. New reports of blazes arrived by the dozen, and television crews 
broadcast vivid pictures of gas fires erupting throughout the West Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got our hands full," Fire Chief Donald Manning said as he emerged from 
a Monday morning briefing. "But we're moving." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, scores of wounded people were seeking medical help, putting 
pressure on the operations center from yet another front. 
</P>
<P>
 At 10 a.m., the damaged Veterans Administration Hospital in the Valley said it 
needed buses to transport 331 patients to another hospital. The emergency 
center immediately asked the Metropolitan Transit Authority for assistance. 
Fifteen minutes later, buses were at the VA, loading patients. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fire Department rushed six patients on life support to other hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as officials began to get the upper hand on the danger, massive logistics 
problems cascaded into the emergency center: How to restore power and water to 
thousands of people? How to get medical attention to those who were injured 
when several nearby hospitals were barely able to function? How to house and 
feed police officers and firefighters, many of whom had been working for 12 
hours or more without a break? 
</P>
<P>
 In the heat of so much activity, agencies cooperated with remarkable ease. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Clarita, for instance, some of the many police officers who live out 
there reported to a sheriff's station so they could call the emergency center 
to ask where they should report for duty. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, the center advised them to head to their regular work assignments. 
But road closures made that impossible. So the Sheriff's Department pressed 
them into service and provided the LAPD with a like number of deputies to 
assist in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also wasted no time in summoning the National Guard. During the 1992 
riots, the city had been ablaze for hours by the time city leaders agreed that 
the Guard was needed to help restore order. This time, Riordan, Williams and 
Sheriff Sherman Block called on Gov. Pete Wilson to supply the Guard as quickly 
as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Before nightfall, hundreds of troops were stationed in armories throughout the 
city and would later be deployed to protect gun stores, shopping centers and 
other buildings considered especially vulnerable to looting. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the region, other city and county agencies chipped in to help. When the 
state Department of Transportation was trying to figure out how to remove 
debris, the emergency center alerted them to a supplier with hefty amounts of 
explosives. When LAPD cars in the Valley were running out of gas, the city 
Department of Water and Power, stretched thin by outages, offered assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Re: Your 13:55 (1:55 p.m.) request for fuel at DWP yards: You want it, you've 
got it," DWP officials told the LAPD just before 2 p.m., according to the log. 
NIGHTFALL 
</P>
<P>
 As the sun set Monday, thousands were without shelter -- their homes in ruins 
or so damaged they were uninhabitable. Some took to parks, where officials 
waived rules against camping. Police were armed with a curfew measure imposed 
just as night fell, but they used it sparingly, only arresting people who they 
believed were up to no good. 
</P>
<P>
 Directed by the emergency center, city personnel workers shuttled supplies to 
communities most in need. They delivered food and water to the Valley and 
supplied police officers and residents with flashlight batteries. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even as the panic of early morning subsided, new crises were erupting. 
</P>
<P>
 At 9 p.m., officials were told the Pacoima Dam was in "imminent danger of 
giving way," an event that emergency crews feared could unleash a 12-foot wall 
of water. Officials rushed to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 At 10:35 p.m., engineers concluded there was not enough water behind the dam 
to pose an immediate threat. "They found small cracks in the dam, but no 
leaks," the log reads. "No need for an evacuation." 
</P>
<P>
 As dawn approached, thousands of people were hunkered down in parks and 
National Guard troops were still deployed throughout the city. The early hours 
of Tuesday's log include reports of water leaks and occasional fires, but fears 
of catastrophic chaos had largely passed. 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly 24 hours after the quake struck, the log reveals how far the city had 
come. The update from 4:30 a.m. Tuesday: "Central Bureau, no activity; West 
Bureau, no activity; South Bureau, no activity; Valley Bureau, no activity. All 
quiet in all bureaus, no new information."

L.A. SCHOOLS, PARENTS DEALT A CRIPPLING BLOW; EDUCATION: DAMAGE TO CAMPUSES 
DISPLACES 250,000 CHILDREN. DISTRICT MAY FACE $700-MILLION REPAIR BILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 All Los Angeles Unified schools will remain closed at least through Friday and 
150 quake-damaged campuses are closed indefinitely as educators and parents 
grapple with the district's most formidable crisis ever: what to do with the 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 About 250,000 of the 640,000 students in the nation's second-largest school 
system have neither clean nor safe classrooms to return to. About 80,000 youths 
bused around the 700-square-mile district face a grueling commute over buckled, 
broken and gridlocked roads. 
</P>
<P>
 As inspections of schools, especially in the San Fernando Valley, continue, 
officials estimate that damage has skyrocketed to as much as $700 million, 
enough to bankrupt the district 10 times over. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, district officials will announce plans for the week ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 The already-hemorrhaging district is in a crisis like never before, and the 
brunt of it is falling squarely on the shoulders of parents, teachers, 
administrators and the children as the fragile balance of school, work and day 
care crumbles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have all the odds against us. How can we take one more crisis? This is so 
devastating it could cause someone to literally throw up their hands, find a 
hole and disappear," school board President Leticia Quezada said Wednesday. 
"But we don't have the luxury of that choice. Too many children are depending 
on us." 
</P>
<P>
 Even in the best of times, it is a delicate equilibrium that allows families 
of the 1990s to get the children off to school, the parents to work, the 
children picked up and everyone home on time for dinner. One hitch and the 
relay falters; one earthquake and it caves in. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no normalcy anymore. The children don't have their routines. They 
feel so displaced," said Karlene Weg of Encino, whose daughter's elementary 
school classroom overlooks a two-foot gap in the earth. "They don't feel safe 
anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Melanie Otey designed her 8:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. work schedule around her 
children's school day. Now Crescent Heights Boulevard Elementary, which her 
daughter attends, is a wreck. Her son's school is closed until further notice. 
Her husband, a writer, has a deadline to meet next week and she is needed back 
at the Brentwood advertising office where she is a business manager. A Roy 
Rogers ranch outing with friends will occupy the children today, but what about 
Friday? 
</P>
<P>
 "Friday?" Otey said wearily. "That's still two days away." 
</P>
<P>
 Even when her children return to school, Otey can no longer travel the freeway 
route she used to pick up her children in the 20-minute window she has allowed 
herself. "This schedule doesn't leave a lot of room for error," she said, 
deciding to worry about that later. It is challenging enough to console two 
nervous children, one of whom clings to her mother with every aftershock. 
</P>
<P>
 Damage estimates have skyrocketed to as much as $700 million as engineers and 
inspectors continue to survey school buildings. At least 108 of the Valley's 
187 schools have sustained significant damage, including 24 that are badly 
battered, with collapsed walls, broken ceilings and toppled cafeteria 
equipment. District officials pledged to update parents Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 All of it comes at a time when school officials, recovering from unprecedented 
budget cuts and labor strife, were just beginning to focus on a new course for 
education reform and the restructuring of the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, it is all they can do now to get children back into schools with 
drinking water, usable lights and toilets that flush. 
</P>
<P>
 Some teachers took it upon themselves to keep students on a course of study, 
however unorthodox. Dave McClay leaned inside the back of his pickup truck 
Wednesday and handed math, social studies and science books to Aurora Rivas, 9. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want you to do some homework, honey," he said gently. "It'll help you and 
it'll keep you busy." 
</P>
<P>
 McClay, a third- and fourth-grade teacher at Valerio Street Elementary School 
in Van Nuys, spent the morning putting textbooks in paper shopping bags and 
delivering homework to students, some living in trucks outside of their 
battered apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just refuse to sit by and not have them study," McClay said. "We have so 
little time with these kids as it is." 
</P>
<P>
 State and local officials are moving quickly to bring financial and other aid 
to the district. State officials said 98 portable classrooms are available for 
immediate shipment to Valley school sites if needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Deliver them, we'll take them," a delighted Dom Shambra, director of planning 
and development for the district, told a panel of state legislators in 
Sacramento on Wednesday. He said decisions would be made later in the week on 
where the portable classrooms would be placed. 
</P>
<P>
 The district is in no danger of losing state funding based on school 
attendance because of the emergency conditions, said Maureen DiMarco, the 
governor's top education adviser. She said another option for quick financial 
aid may be to allow the district to use its state school construction money for 
rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 On the home front, parents -- some already being summoned back to work -- 
struggle to find child care. They are cashing in on sick days and vacation time 
to cover for school closures. Car pools are falling apart. Children, many at 
home without water or electricity for three days, are beginning to squabble. 
Cabin fever is setting in. 
</P>
<P>
 And even when schools reopen, some parents will be tormented by the idea of 
being more than an arm's length away from their children, whatever their ages. 
</P>
<P>
 Even a clean safety inspection at Franklin High School is not enough to 
convince Marta Cardenas that it is all right for her 18-year-old son to return 
to school anytime soon. The continued aftershocks and the thought of being 
separated from him are more than she can deal with this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "What if there is another bad quake and we can't get together? It's so scary 
to even think of that," said Cardenas, 47, who is active in the district's 
bilingual education issues. "We are not in a steady situation. I don't want to 
add any more confusion in my life right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Some teachers were equally jittery about the prospect of going back to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be very nerve-racking -- especially for the kids," said 
Francine Cantero, an eighth-grade science teacher at Portola Middle School in 
Tarzana. "Every time there's an aftershock, we're going to do a drop drill and 
have kids under tables. It's going to be very hard to get back on track." 
</P>
<P>
 While the rest of the city aims for a return to normalcy, many children -- 
whether in private or public schools -- will never resume their familiar 
routines, facing instead the prospect of campus transfers, year-round schedules 
and makeshift classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "They used to go to sleep at 8. Now it's like summer schedule, whatever they 
want to do is fine," said Diane Neubauer of Westwood, the mother of five 
children, all of them at home since the quake. Her 13-year-old daughter, 
Elizabeth, is in the middle of finals at Harvard Westlake, a private school in 
Holmby Hills. She studies every night on the off chance that school will open 
the next morning. So far it hasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every night at 8 o'clock they call and let us know," Neubauer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Children are asking questions that make it difficult for parents to leave 
them. One 6-year-old girl asked her mother: "Is the earthquake all gone?" 
Another child wanted to know "why the freeways are broken." 
</P>
<P>
 "Just in case, I want to be with my kids," said Elena Silverman of Encino, 
whose daughter attends Castlemont School in Woodland Hills. "We have all been 
sleeping together in the same room." 
</P>
<P>
 One mother, who attends UCLA part-time, is considering dropping out of her 
classes to stay home with her children. "It's only one night a week I would be 
leaving my kids. But that's all it takes is one night. My head is spinning."

 On one block there is power and the comfort it brings: lights, a refrigerator, 
heat.

<P>
 Yet two blocks down Index Street, neighbors are still sleeping on their front 
lawns, and, when there is anything to eat but cold sandwiches, it comes from a 
gas barbecue.

 Here in Granada Hills, in what used to represent the best of suburban living, 
the invisible umbilical cord linking residents to 110 volts of life-sustaining 
energy has been broken, replaced by the unaccustomed intimacy that comes from 
having to share even the most basic necessities. 
</P>
<P>
 A 28-foot camper powered by a gas generator becomes the family room for 
neighborhood youngsters, who gather around the reassuring blue light of a tiny 
portable television. Water, also cut off to some, is dipped out of one family's 
pool and used to flush toilets and wash sticky kitchen floors up and down the 
block. And, in every 38-year-old stucco ranch house, residents pitch in to 
clean up during the all-too-brief daylight hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very much a community effort here," said Dave Campbell, 39, a lawyer 
with the district attorney's office who has lived on the block for four years. 
"The first thing we did after the quake was borrow a flashlight from our 
neighbors to find our glasses. Without their help, we would have been blind." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have nothing in my fridge, but everyone is feeding us," added Jeanne 
Fritzel, a retired teacher who has lived in the housing tract since it was 
built in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
 Although power had been restored Wednesday to most of the 1.3 million 
customers served by the Los Angeles Department of Power and Water, a 
spokeswoman said that about 45,000 customers remained cut off, including those 
neighbors on Index Street. The outages may last throughout the week because of 
downed power lines and damaged transformers, DWP spokeswoman Jan Merlo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, Merlo warned that there may be sporadic outages throughout the 
region in coming months as workers try to permanently repair equipment that 
they could only jury-rig in the aftermath of the Northridge quake. "Expect 
interruptions," Merlo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, the outages hopscotched from block to block in San Fernando Valley 
communities from Granada Hills to Sylmar to Sherman Oaks, skipping some houses 
and affecting others in a seemingly illogical pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the 15900 block of Index Street coped with the lack of power by 
digging out long-unused camping equipment, including lanterns, tents and 
portable toilets. Gary Boener, 46, retrieved his 28-foot tan-and-white RV out 
of a North Hollywood storage facility Monday and parked the camper in front of 
his house. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of become the focal point of the whole neighborhood," said Jeff 
Webb, 36, a director for Disney Studios. "We can watch TV in there and not feel 
so cut off from everything." 
</P>
<P>
 "Before this, our only contact with the outside world was sharing earphones to 
our Walkman," agreed Suzanne Campbell, 31, a former nurse who has lived in the 
neighborhood for four years. "It's amazing to be so close and not know what's 
going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Without electricity, and in many cases without natural gas, many residents had 
also been unable to bathe for days, a new hardship for many. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like somebody living under a bridge," said Sam Farfalla, 65, who had 
been sponging off with cold water for three days. 
</P>
<P>
 Other residents said living without lights lent a sense of urgency to their 
cleanup efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to get as much done before dark as you can," said Marilyn Hutton, 
30, washing a goopy mixture of spilled orange juice, sugar and oil off her 
dog's water bowl Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Putting a positive spin on the trying situation, Noel Laspinas said the 
disaster afforded him a reprieve from working three jobs to support his wife 
and her parents, who recently emigrated from the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels good to be kicking back, even though without electricity I can't 
watch my favorite shows," Laspinas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after noon, an automatic sprinkler system on the north side of the 
street began spurting, indicating that power had been restored there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I just inherited a million bucks," said David Ra, 24, a computer 
technician who lives on that side of the street. "The first thing I'm going to 
do is shower." 
</P>
<P>
 But the power was still out on the south side, and a DWP lineman working in 
the area said twisted power lines, which might take another day or so to 
repair, were responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 Neil Berger, 42, an attorney who lives on the north side of the block, 
promised not to abandon his less-fortunate neighbors. When the quake struck and 
Berger could not immediately reach his wife, who was working a graveyard shift 
at a telephone company, his neighbors listened patiently to his concerns, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Time to dig out the extension cords for them!" he said, just moments after 
his power came on.

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; RESCUED MAN DESCRIBES 7-HOUR ORDEAL; SURVIVOR: 
AS TONS OF CONCRETE FELL ON HIM, SALVADOR PENA SAYS, HE THOUGHT OF HIS WIFE AND 
FIVE CHILDREN, AND PUT HIMSELF 'IN GOD'S HANDS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As two floors of concrete tumbled onto him, Salvador Pena recalled Wednesday, 
his thoughts turned to his family -- his five children and his wife, whom he 
has struggled to support since leaving war-torn El Salvador for Los Angeles a 
dozen years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought that I was going to die, and my family needs me so much," Pena said 
in his first public comments since his rescue from beneath the rubble of the 
Northridge Fashion Center's parking structure, which collapsed in Monday's 
earthquake. "I've always fought to give them food, give them a little strength 
to sustain themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Pena, 43, was operating a power sweeper on the garage's first floor when the 
quake struck. The building collapsed, trapping Pena beneath 20 tons of 
concrete. Rescuers worked seven hours to free the janitor from the debris in a 
dramatic scene that was broadcast live. 
</P>
<P>
 The janitor's ordeal has become one of those tales of miraculous survival that 
inevitably surface during catastrophes, transforming individuals such as Pena 
into symbols of hope and perseverance. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is truly lucky to be alive," said Dr. Michael J. Zinner, chief of surgery 
at UCLA Medical Center, where Pena remains hospitalized in serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
 The debris crushed Pena's legs and his right hand, also slicing a gash behind 
his left knee. He still has only limited feeling in both legs, but doctors say 
amputations probably will not be necessary. Physicians are optimistic that 
Pena's limbs will respond to treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, though, Pena -- a devout Roman Catholic wearing a rosary around 
his neck -- left no doubt that he believed his complete recovery was imminent. 
He seemed cheerful. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very content, very happy to have this new life," the thankful janitor 
told journalists during a brief interview from his bed in the hospital's 
intensive care unit. "I had faith (then), and I have faith now that I will be 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 As the garage shook, Pena recalled, he quickly realized there was no time to 
escape. 
</P>
<P>
 "It happened so fast, I wasn't able to do anything," he said. "I put myself in 
God's hands." 
</P>
<P>
 While thanking God, Pena also effusively praised the firefighters, paramedics, 
physicians and others who saved him. He seemed taken aback by his sudden 
celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
 "All this interest, all this fuss about a person who is so humble and simple," 
Pena said. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing by his bedside was his younger sister, Martha Pena de Tejada, a 
mother of two who recognized her brother while watching television accounts of 
the rescue at her home in Oakland. Also visiting was his eldest son and 
namesake, Salvador Remberto Pena, a 24-year-old electronics worker who lives in 
Downey. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father always worked hard to take care of his family," the son said. "He 
wants to get back to work." 
</P>
<P>
 The janitor's life story, sketched from interviews, seems emblematic of those 
of so many new immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Pena is a native of El Salvador's Chalatenango province, site of some of the 
fiercest fighting during the recent civil war that sent Pena and hundreds of 
thousands of his compatriots fleeing north. 
</P>
<P>
 His years of toil in the low-wage immigrant work force have financed the care 
and education of his five children, four of whom remain in El Salvador along 
with Pena's wife, Gloria de Pena. The two eldest daughters are university 
students. To economize, Pena shares an apartment in Los Angeles' Westlake 
neighborhood -- a hub for newcomers from Central America -- with three other 
immigrants, his son said. It is a common survival strategy for those supporting 
families back home. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what he most wanted when he left the hospital, Pena didn't hesitate: a 
plate of good pupusas, the Salvadoran delicacy, he said.

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; BAY AREA DRIVERS SAY IT'LL BE A LONG HAUL; 
TRANSPORTATION: FOUR YEARS AFTER LOMA PRIETA QUAKE, NOT A SINGLE DAMAGED 
FREEWAY HAS BEEN COMPLETELY REOPENED. BUT CALTRANS SAYS THE TASK IN L.A. ISN'T 
AS DAUNTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bay Area commuters have this advice for Los Angeles drivers fretting about 
post-quake traffic congestion: Get used to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Loma Prieta quake in October, 1989, not a single damaged freeway 
here has been completely reopened. Of the four battered freeways in San 
Francisco and Oakland, one has been demolished and obliterated from route maps 
while work on the other three double-decked highways is years from completion. 
</P>
<P>
 "From a traffic standpoint, this city is still recovering from the effects of 
Loma Prieta," said Stuart Sunshine, an assistant to San Francisco Mayor Frank 
Jordan. "We don't have one freeway that is 100% operational four years after 
the earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials, however, predict that they can repair the Southland's 
damaged freeways in a year, having learned seismic and political lessons from 
the Loma Prieta temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 While Monday's quake knocked down portions of five Southern California 
freeways, officials say they will be easier to repair than the complicated 
viaducts in San Francisco and Oakland. Furthermore, unlike the Bay Area, all 
Los Angeles freeway reconstruction will occur in the footprint of the collapsed 
structures. 
</P>
<P>
 "San Francisco and L.A.? They are light years (apart)," said Caltrans 
spokesman Jim Drago. 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor Los Angeles officials have already begun to exploit: This is an 
election year. No politician wants to take the blame for slow repair work, 
especially Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, who is up for reelection on Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, anxious Los Angeles officials have already begun an urgent drumbeat: 
We need our roads. 
</P>
<P>
 "The freeways are critical to the flow of commerce and people in L.A. -- we 
couldn't get along without them," said Los Angeles County Supervisor Ed 
Edelman. "In San Francisco you have a different kind of environment. There's no 
question that the freeways here have to be rebuilt sooner rather than later. 
People are not going to take the inconvenience." 
</P>
<P>
 But some experts caution that the Caltrans predictions of rebuilding Southern 
California's damaged freeways in a year seem overly optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "The repairs may take longer than people might imagine," said Stephen Mahin, a 
professor of civil engineering at UC Berkeley who specializes in double-deck 
freeways and overpasses. "When something like the I-10 goes down, if portions 
have to be torn down and rebuilt, it will not be a matter of months, it will be 
a matter of years." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said Southland residents will not 
stand for the kind of delays that have plagued the Bay Area's freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 After meeting with President Clinton and other officials about the earthquake 
damage, the councilman said, "We need the logistical equivalent of Desert Storm 
on this reconstruction, and if we do it with that kind of intensity and focus, 
it can be done. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let this be a warning to everyone in elected office: Every day longer it 
takes could be a nail in the coffin of their political careers," he added. "If 
people think their government is failing them they will turn on their leaders." 
</P>
<P>
 The magnitude 7.1 Loma Prieta earthquake collapsed the double-decked Cypress 
Freeway in Oakland, killing 42 people. It also damaged the Bay Bridge, and 
three San Francisco freeways: the Embarcadero, the Central and a portion of 
Interstate 280 -- all double-deck viaducts of the same design as the Cypress 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Work crews repaired the damaged section of the Bay Bridge in 45 days. And 
within two months, Caltrans came up with plans to rebuild the four freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 But reconstruction hit its first snag when a panel of experts said the new 
design would do little to protect the structures from future earthquakes. It 
took three years of seismic tests to come up with a new design theoretically 
capable of withstanding an 8.5 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Oakland residents won approval of a new route for the Cypress 
Freeway that will no longer divide the neighborhood of West Oakland in two. 
Construction of the mile-long section of Interstate 880 is scheduled to begin 
this month and take at least until 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Francisco, residents who had long opposed the routing of freeways 
through their neighborhoods took advantage of the earthquake to win removal of 
the unsightly Embarcadero Freeway from the waterfront and the northernmost 
section of the Central Freeway. Now, the traffic that once traveled those 
freeways is consigned to surface streets. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, Caltrans crews have begun working seven days a week to repair 
Interstate 280, which has been open since April to one lane of traffic in each 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Transportation Chairman Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco), who represents 
the area, said it would have been cheaper and faster to remove the damaged 
section of I-280 and build a new freeway. But Caltrans feared that 
environmentalists would block reconstruction, he said, so the state embarked 
instead on a complex project of repair and retrofitting. 
</P>
<P>
 "What Caltrans would have done if 280 was in Los Angeles would be to tear it 
down and rebuild it," Kopp said. "You can't take a chance on doing that in San 
Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
 For commuters traveling into San Francisco from the south or trying to make 
their way through Oakland, the missing sections of freeway have been the cause 
of horrendous traffic jams for the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Ash McNeely, who used to commute from Burlingame on the San Francisco 
Peninsula to UC Berkeley, said she finally quit her job because the traffic was 
so bad. "It was awful," she said. "I was really relieved when I was offered 
another job." 
</P>
<P>
 Work on I-280 is due to be completed by the end of 1995. Similar work on the 
remainder of the Central Freeway will start later this year and result in 
closed lanes and blocked traffic until 1997. And there is no telling when new 
surface street connectors will be built to replace the demolished Embarcadero 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 To some extent, Southern California has already benefited from the Loma Prieta 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the 1989 quake, Caltrans began an ambitious program of retrofitting 
bridges and overpasses and had completed work on 114 in the Los Angeles area by 
Monday. All withstood the 6.6 Northridge quake, said Caltrans spokesman Jim 
Drago. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans had been planning to begin the same retrofitting work next month on 
the section of the Santa Monica Freeway that collapsed. Now, repairs are likely 
to proceed faster because much of the design work can be adapted for 
reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's earthquake closed portions of the Pacific Coast Highway and five 
freeways, including a 3.5-mile stretch of the Santa Monica Freeway and the two 
main routes -- the Golden State Freeway and California 14 -- linking the Santa 
Clarita Valley to Los Angeles. The resulting traffic backups neared monumental 
proportions -- even by L.A. standards -- as commuters attempted to drive to 
work Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers have begun removing debris from the collapsed freeway sections, Drago 
said. When reconstruction begins, he said Caltrans will rebuild rather than 
retrofit any damaged roadways. "We will accelerate those construction jobs on 
an emergency basis," he said. 
</P>

CAPITOL JOURNAL: PRESSURE IS ON POLITICIANS TO PRODUCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Our family slept in our cars last night; hold on a minute, we're getting an 
aftershock." 
</P>
<P>
 That's how my uncommon telephone interview began Tuesday with Assemblywoman 
Paula Boland, whose Northridge home sits atop the earthquake epicenter. "Things 
started flying. My husband covered me over," she said, her voice still shaky. 
"We searched for clothes and raced to my mother's. She's 81." 
</P>
<P>
 Bowland is 54 and Monday was her birthday. She observed it by driving around 
her legislative district -- where she grew up -- and being stunned by the 
devastation. Her own two-story home sustained major structural damage. "Every 
time a tremor goes through, the fireplace moves further away from the wall," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The assemblywoman was afraid to spend the night in her house, so she and her 
mother slept in a car in the driveway. Her husband slept in another car with 
their granddaughter. Their daughter and son-in-law slept on the lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 "My family's alive. What more can I want?" she said. "There are people here 
who have lost lives, people who have been totally displaced, who now have no 
income. Our attention has to be turned to them. They desperately need help." 
</P>
<P>
 Boland is a conservative Republican who hates taxes. But a big chunk of any 
temporary state tax increase -- on sales, gasoline -- now being proposed by 
Democratic legislators for earthquake recovery would be spent in her district. 
So it would reason that she might support such a tax hike, especially since 
residents of her district paid higher sales taxes for 13 months to help the San 
Francisco Bay Area recover from its 1989 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrong. And her position and attitude are illustrative of the challenges and 
hazards that Gov. Pete Wilson, President Clinton and California legislators in 
both Sacramento and Washington face in responding to the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "People are taxed to death," Boland said instinctively. "We've got to start 
finding ways to conserve money and quit taxing people." 
</P>
<P>
 But how do the freeways get repaired and other facilities rebuilt when state 
government already is strapped with a projected $4-billion deficit? 
</P>
<P>
 "The feds are going to have to come through for us," she insisted. "They've 
taken our military bases and all those jobs. They're going to have to start 
giving some things back to California. Far as I'm concerned, the President 
still owes us $1.1 billion for that illegal immigration (reimbursement). Let's 
see if (Sen. Dianne) Feinstein and (Sen. Barbara) Boxer can do anything for us 
this time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hear a lot of rhetoric. I want to see some action." 
</P>
<P>
 Boland had just gone through a bit of terror and needed a good night's sleep. 
But I suspect her attitude toward Washington is shared by millions of 
frustrated Californians. And if the Clinton Administration is seen by Southern 
Californians to be bungling the recovery -- through bureaucratic snafus or 
stinginess -- the President will pay the price in 1996 when he'll probably need 
this state's votes to win reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the earthquake has given Clinton an opportunity to 
ingratiate himself with California and prove he's more than just a President 
who shows up for town halls and Hollywood haircuts. Clinton got off to a good 
start by immediately sending out two Cabinet secretaries and other top 
officials to help expedite the cleanup, then flying to Los Angeles himself 
Wednesday and saying the right things. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the President reported that a highway engineer had told him 
"it'll take about a year" to repair the Golden State Freeway. Clinton said he 
replied, "What do we have to do to fix it in less time?" That's the kind of 
question voters want presidents and governors to ask. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson similarly is confronted by peril and opportunity. But unlike the 
President -- who has problems around the globe -- the governor faces a special 
burden of leadership as Sacramento responds to the earthquake. He has nothing 
on his desk of more importance -- substantively or politically -- than speeding 
the recovery of a region that contains nearly half the state's electorate. 
</P>
<P>
 For one, Wilson will need to persuade the Paula Bolands of the Legislature to 
support a tax increase that seems inevitable. The public may be less difficult 
to convince. After the San Francisco quake, a Times poll found that most people 
were willing to pay a higher sales tax temporarily to help their fellow 
Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Republican governor still hadn't taken a position himself as of 
Wednesday. He was waiting to "find out the magnitude of the problem" and hear 
how much Washington will pay. 
</P>
<P>
 That seems a formula for prolonged gridlock -- in the Capitol and on Los 
Angeles roadways.

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; SCIENTISTS PONDER NORTHWARD CONCENTRATION OF

 As aftershocks continued to rattle the region Wednesday, scientists pondered 
the future effects of Monday's magnitude 6.6 earthquake, the eighth 
significant, damaging temblor since 1970 to occur along or near the so-called 
Front Range comprising the San Gabriel and Santa Susana mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday saw two of the strongest aftershocks yet, a magnitude 5.1, followed 
just two minutes later by another 5.1. They occurred at 1:09 p.m. and 1:11 p.m. 
and were the fourth and fifth aftershocks in the magnitude 5 range -- not that 
unusual a number and intensity after such a strong quake, according to 
seismologists. (A magnitude 4.4 aftershock had struck at 6:09 a.m.) 
</P>
<P>
 The latest strong aftershocks were centered six miles northeast of Simi 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, all the seismic activity in the last 24 years has scientists 
pondering if a larger quake will occur somewhere along the Front Range in the 
years ahead. From Lytle Creek northwest of San Bernardino, through Upland, 
Whittier Narrows, Sierra Madre, Pasadena, San Fernando, Northridge and coastal 
Ventura County, the quakes have been of at least magnitude 5, with three close 
to magnitude 6 and two, including Monday's, in the strong mid-6 range. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of these temblors has ruptured only relatively short segments of various 
thrust faults. But earthquake scientists are now trying to determine whether 
these faults are independent of one another or are linked deep under the 
surface and could rupture all at once -- producing a major quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary research, however, indicates that huge magnitude 7 or 8 quakes 
along the mountains have been rare. The largest in historical times, a 
magnitude 7, occurred at Wrightwood in the eastern San Gabriels in 1812. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Caltech's Egill Hauksson wrote two years ago in a book prepared 
by the Assn. of Engineering Geologists: "A future magnitude 7.7 earthquake that 
could rupture all seven segments or the whole length of the Sierra Madre Fault 
cannot be excluded." 
</P>
<P>
 But Hauksson quickly added that "seismological and geological evidence for 
segmentation along the fault suggests that 6.4 to 6.6 earthquakes occur more 
frequently and that the magnitude 7.7 earthquake may be a very rare event." 
</P>
<P>
 Lucille M. Jones of the U.S. Geological Survey has called the Sierra Madre 
Fault, extending along the San Gabriels for 75 miles, possibly the most 
dangerous near or in the Los Angeles Basin. But the magnitude 5.8 quake at 
Sierra Madre in 1991 broke only one of its seven segments. 
</P>
<P>
 Hauksson said this week that there is also a question whether all the quakes 
that have occurred along the northern edge of the Los Angeles Basin could 
portend a larger quake on the San Andreas Fault north and east of Los Angeles, 
a little more than 25 miles northeast of the epicenter of the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't predict a Big One on the San Andreas based on the Front Range 
quakes," Hauksson said. "But if one did occur, we'd see an oodle of papers 
viewing what has happened in recent years as precursors." 
</P>
<P>
 Another question concerns whether the hundreds of aftershocks that have been 
occurring this week could suggest the possibility of a larger quake relatively 
soon in the vicinity of Monday's Northridge temblor or in some particular 
direction away from it. 
</P>
<P>
 Frequent aftershocks following the magnitude 6.1 Joshua Tree quake of April 
22, 1992, migrated in a northwestward direction and appeared to some scientists 
to have triggered the much larger 7.6 Landers quake of June 28, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Hauksson said Wednesday that a Caltech analysis indicated some migration of 
aftershocks from the Northridge quake about five miles in a northwestern 
direction toward Ventura County. He said the aftershocks have now developed 
"into a very energetic pattern, slightly above the normal." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Hauksson told a news briefing that it is too early to reach any 
conclusions about the significance of this. He said a further migration would 
be analyzed carefully, if it develops. 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether, there have been more than 1,000 aftershocks since Monday morning, 
but the majority of them were too weak to be felt. 
</P>
<P>
 Most scientists at media briefings at Caltech have suggested that the 
Northridge quake will not lead immediately to a bigger one, and the state 
Office of Emergency Services has thus far abstained from issuing advisories of 
possible impending larger quakes, as it has occasionally done in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 The view by scientists of what may happen several years ahead is often less 
optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 Hauksson has pointed out that the Front Range earthquakes since 1970 represent 
a distinct change from the pattern of quakes in and around Los Angeles in the 
early years of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 Records show that there have been three major phases of seismic activity in 
the Los Angeles-Orange County area since 1920. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1920 to 1941, all of the most significant earthquakes occurred in 
southern or southwestern parts of the basin. 
</P>
<P>
 In a second phase, from 1941 to 1971, there were no quakes over magnitude 4.8 
anywhere in the basin. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, in the third phase, all the earthquakes in the 5 and 6 magnitude 
range have been at or near the northern edge of the basin, near the San Gabriel 
or Santa Susana mountains. Tracking the Quakes 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1920 and 1941, virtually all significant earthquakes in the Los 
Angeles area were in the southerly or southwest parts of the basin. After the 
magnitude 6.4 Sylmar-San Fernando quake in 1971, there have been seven sizable, 
damaging quakes at the northern edge of the basin. Scientists now ponder 
whether the shift may not portend a larger quake along the San Gabriel or Santa 
Susana Mountains, or possibly a big one on the San Andreas fault north and east 
of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Researched by KENNETH REICH and VICKY McCARGAR / Los Angeles Times How 
Earthquake Magnitude Is Measured 
</P>
<P>
 There are 270 seismometers positioned throughout Southern California. By 
examining the interval between waves of quakes, seismologists can identify the 
epicenter and the magnitude. A look at the three main types of waves, the 
sequence in which they occur and how they are measured for magnitude: 
</P>
<P>
 Primary wave: Travels through earth. When it hits the surface, it causes 
buildings and other structures to contract and expand. 
</P>
<P>
 Secondary wave: Travels through earth, moving rock back and forth, up and 
down. At earth's surface, it shakes structures violently. 
</P>
<P>
 Long waves 
</P>
<P>
 Love wave: Originates and travels along earth's surface, shaking structures 
from side to side. 
</P>
<P>
 Rayleigh wave: Originates and travels along earth's surface, rolling like 
swells on the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 How Magnitude Scale Works 
</P>
<P>
 Seismologists determine the magnitude of an earthquake by measuring two 
factors: time and amplitude. How Wednesday's 5.1 aftershocks appeared on a 
seismograph: 
</P>
<P>
 Base line (no quake activity) 
</P>
<P>
 Primary wave begins 
</P>
<P>
 Secondary wave begins 
</P>
<P>
 Time lapse: 24 seconds 
</P>
<P>
 Amplitude: Highest peak 33 millimeters 
</P>
<P>
 This chart measures time lapse between primary and secondary waves as well as 
distance in kilometers of that particular seismometer from the epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
 A straight line is drawn between the distance and amplitude charts to 
determine magnitude. Magnitude: 5.1 
</P>
<P>
 This chart measures amplitude, or the highest peak from the base line. 
</P>
<P>
 How Seismometer Works 
</P>
<P>

hours of data.

<P>
 A Quake's Energy 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquakes release energy that scientists measure in metric units called 
ergs. One erg is the amount of energy it takes to move one gram of mass one 
centimeter in one second. Some examples of an earthquake's energy force: Energy 
released (in millions of ergs): 20,000,000,000,000,000,000 Magnitude (not to 
scale): 9 Energy released (in millions of ergs): 600,000,000,000,000,000 
Magnitude (not to scale): 8 Example or equivalent: 1933, largest quake 
recorded, Japan (8.9) Example or equivalent: 1906 San Francisco earthquake 
(8.3) Energy released (in millions of ergs): 20,000,000,000,000,000 Magnitude 
(not to scale): 7 Example or equivalent: Energy generated by Niagara Falls in 
four months Energy released (in millions of ergs): 600,000,000,000,000 
Magnitude (not to scale): 6 Example or equivalent: Energy to launch 2 million 
NASA space shuttles Energy released (in millions of ergs): 20,000,000,000,000 
Magnitude (not to scale): 5 Example or equivalent: Energy created by atomic 
bomb test in 1945 Energy released (in millions of ergs): 600,000,000,000 
Magnitude (not to scale): 4 Example or equivalent: Kiloton of TNT exploding 
Energy released (in millions of ergs): 20,000,000,000 Magnitude (not to scale): 
3 Example or equivalent: Smallest quakes commonly felt Source: The World Book

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; FALLEN FAME; LANDMARKS SUFFER DAMAGE, 
INCLUDING FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT HOUSE. EGYPTIAN THEATER, CHURCHES AMONG THOSE HIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 At his masterpiece Hollyhock House on a hillside above east Hollywood, 
architect Frank Lloyd Wright placed 14 rooftop spires, each four feet high and 
molded in concrete to resemble the many-petaled hollyhock flower that inspired 
his 1919 design. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, five of those spires had been toppled -- two shattered beyond 
repair -- by this week's earthquake and aftershocks. The massive Mayan-style 
fireplace in the city-owned house showed hairline cracks, its library room 
foundation had slipped, and concrete garden walls had tumbled down the westerly 
cliff of the Barnsdall Park cultural complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a very expensive proposition, but structurally the building 
is not in bad shape," Hollyhock's curator Virginia Kazor said of possible 
repairs, as she led an entourage of architectural preservationists, city 
cultural officials and state and local politicians through the house Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The tour was part of a still-emerging effort to determine earthquake damage at 
Los Angeles-area architectural, historical and cultural landmarks. Building by 
building, street by street, volunteers and government employees are inspecting 
those treasures of the Southland and urging owners of damaged landmarks not to 
move too hastily toward demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important to us to stay ahead of the curve before people get firmed up 
that the buildings can't possibly be saved. Maybe they can't," said William F. 
Delvac, an architectural preservationist who works at a Hollywood-based firm 
called Historic Resources Group. 
</P>
<P>
 For him and others involved in the ongoing surveys, this week brought back bad 
memories of the 1992 riots in Los Angeles. According to a report by the state 
Office of Historic Preservation, more than 100 buildings damaged or destroyed 
in that civil unrest were historically, architecturally or culturally 
significant. Some are still awaiting repair. 
</P>
<P>
 It may take weeks to come up with such a count for the earthquake. The 
temblor's effect on landmarks varied widely, depending on geology, construction 
methods and sheer luck. 
</P>
<P>
 The Downtown Los Angeles Central Library, which burned in 1986 and reopened 
last fall after $214 million in renovation, came through Monday's temblor with 
little damage. The two-century-old San Gabriel Mission church, which reopened 
in September after a $1.2-million project to repair damage caused by the 1987 
Whittier quake, suffered only plaster cracks this time. The Hollywood sign and 
most historic structures Downtown emerged in good shape. The stone mansion 
McGroarty house, at the McGroarty Cultural Center Park in Tujunga, was nearly 
unscathed, officials reported. The exterior of the Art Deco Bullocks Wilshire 
building in Mid-Wilshire had no visible cracks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Watts Towers showed more than a dozen cracks, but Rodney Punt, assistant 
general manager of the Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Department, said those 
appear to be minor problems. The Egyptian Theater on Hollywood Boulevard now 
has huge holes in its rear tile walls that were thought to be repairable, as 
were the exterior cracks behind the massive screen in the nearby Chinese 
Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 A recently restored 1920 Art Deco building at 5620 Hollywood Blvd., designed 
by John Parkinson, one of the architects of Los Angeles City Hall, had its 
pyramid-shaped crown knocked loose from a tower that looms 95 feet over the 
two-story structure. The pyramid was dangling precariously Wednesday, but the 
former bank building will be fixed, declared its owners, the Johns & Gorman 
Films television commercial production company. The structure is eligible for 
the national and local landmark status, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 More threatened are a host of beloved churches and apartment buildings in 
Santa Monica. St. Monica's Roman Catholic Church, a 1925 Romanesque structure, 
showed fractures on its tower top to bottom. The Spanish-style Charmont 
apartments on California Avenue and the El Cortez apartments on 4th Street were 
both in bad shape. So was the Henry Weaver House, a distinguished 1910 example 
of the Craftsman style which, like the Egyptian and Chinese theaters and 
Hollyhock House, is on the National Register of Historic Places. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners of the building, Lauren Greene and television director David B. 
Greene, spent more than $400,000 restoring the two-story Santa Monica house 
since 1985, and now are not certain if they can afford massive repairs, Lauren 
Greene said. In the earthquake, bricks flew off the foundation, sinking 
vertical timber beams that are supposed to support the massive porch roof; the 
roof is collapsing in several spots, she explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners of some other historic or architectural landmarks may use earthquake 
damage as a pretext to tear down structures that could be otherwise saved, said 
Linda Dishman, executive director of the Los Angeles Conservancy, the 
preservationist group conducting the surveys. 
</P>
<P>
 One such looming battle is said to involve the former Brown Derby, which 
housed the fabled restaurant on Vine Street in Hollywood. The 65-year-old 
Spanish-style building was damaged in two arson fires since its 1985 closing 
and had some of its brick walls cracked this week. The owners reportedly want 
to tear it down for a parking lot. On Wednesday, the building was cordoned off 
and had the ominous red danger tag from city inspectors on its front door. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry A. Milofsky, an architect who volunteered Wednesday to help with the 
conservancy's survey of Hollywood buildings, said he thought the two-story 
Brown Derby could be restored even now. The owners could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brown Derby is part of a large district on and near Hollywood Boulevard 
that is listed on the National Register. Such designation does not grant 
permanent protection from demolition, but does allow at least delays on 
tear-downs through state rules, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Milton Marks, the San Francisco area Democrat, toured the Hollyhock 
House and other Hollywood area sites Wednesday. In the wake of the 1989 Loma 
Prieta quake, Marks authored a law that forbids demolition of a national, state 
or locally designated landmark damaged in a natural disaster "unless the 
structure presents an imminent threat" of bodily harm to the public or damage 
to adjacent property. The law calls for inspections of such damaged buildings 
by experts selected by the state Office of Historic Preservation. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the tour was Douglas P. Wheeler, state Secretary for Resources, who 
oversees historic preservation. State rules promulgated in 1991 further put 
brakes on proposed demolition of any damaged building on or eligible for the 
National Register, Wheeler noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Procedurally, we want demolition only in the last resort," Wheeler said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Hollyhock House, those officials -- along with Los Angeles City 
Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg -- were saddened to see the cracks and tumbled 
spires. But they were relieved to see how a leaded glass ceiling fixture had 
fallen down to a carpet and had only two tiny panels cracked. They were also 
happy to see that the Wright-designed furniture survived, and were pleased to 
learn that the broken spires can be replicated. 
</P>
<P>
 "The damage is significant, but I was impressed it was not more," Wheeler 
said. "I had feared the worst." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the repairs might cost $750,000, estimated Punt, of the city cultural 
affairs department. Meanwhile, he said, tours might resume soon if rooms on the 
south side are cordoned off.

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; DAMAGE REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here are some facts and figures on Monday's magnitude 6.6 earthquake: 
</P>
<P>
 * DEATHS: 47 
</P>
<P>
 * AFTERSHOCKS: Since Monday's 6.6 temblor, there have been two aftershocks 
measuring 5.1; 19 measuring 4.0 to 5.0; and 143 in the 3.0 to 3.9 range. There 
have been about 1,000 aftershocks of magnitude 3.0 or less. 
</P>
<P>
 * DAMAGE: Earthquake damage costs could range from $15 billion to $30 billion, 
Gov. Pete Wilson estimated, making it the most expensive natural disaster in 
California history. Losses suffered in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake in the 
San Francisco Bay Area totaled about $7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 * INJURIES: More than 2,300 people were treated and released at hospitals; 
about 530 were admitted for care. 
</P>
<P>
 * CURFEW: The need for an 11 p.m.-to-dawn curfew for Los Angeles will be 
evaluated on a day-to-day basis. 
</P>
<P>
 * ARRESTS: The Los Angeles Police Department took 128 people into custody in a 
48-hour period. Most were general arrests and not for curfew violations or 
looting. On a typical day, there would be about 550 arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 * HOMELESS: About 4,700 people stayed in 24 American Red Cross shelters 
overnight, hundreds more reportedly stayed in Salvation Army shelters and 
thousands camped out in tents and parks. An additional 700 people reportedly 
camped out overnight outside a Red Cross shelter in San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 * NATIONAL GUARD: A total of 2,579 National Guard troops have been mobilized. 
Currently, the National Guard has committed more than 1,000 soldiers -- in day 
and night shifts of 500 -- conducting security patrols at shopping malls and 
selected sites in quake-ravaged areas. That is in addition to continuing 
National Guard humanitarian and aviation support missions. 
</P>
<P>
 * UTILITIES: 20,000 Southern California Gas Co. customers were without 
service. The Department of Water and Power is trying to restore power to 60,000 
customers in the San Fernando Valley; 40,000 customers remain without water. 
Brownouts were concentrated in Granada Hills, Northridge, Chatsworth, Tarzana, 
Canoga Park, Porter Ranch, Sylmar and North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 * TRANSIT: At least 1,200 commuters piled onto Metrolink commuter trains in 
Santa Clarita rather than brave numerous freeway detours. That is more than 
twice the usual number of riders on the new commuter rail line. 
</P>
<P>
 * SCHOOLS: More than 200 school buildings have been seriously damaged or 
destroyed. All Los Angeles Unified District schools will be closed today. The 
Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles reports that 93% of its schools will 
be open. L.A. Mission College will be closed through Monday. UCLA resumes 
general classes today.

 On an earthquake-scarred stretch of Balboa Boulevard in Granada Hills, a gas 
explosion that occurred Monday an hour after the 6.6 temblor shot flames 100 
feet upward, the fire and horrific heat destroying five houses. Here are 
vignettes from 48 hours later, on a day when President Clinton visited the 
neighborhood and examined a 10-foot-deep crater caused by the explosion on the 
east side of the street: 
</P>
<P>
 "We've lost everything but our minivan and car -- we drove away just in time," 
said Calvin Lee, standing amid ashes and a blackened chimney. Lee, who moved 
here from Korea 25 years ago, can't imagine leaving California. "Yes, it's 
scary," said Lee, who plans to rebuild. "This," he said, gazing at the rubble, 
"is already home!" 
</P>
<P>
 This house burned to the ground in the same fire, but its occupants fled 
unhurt, neighbors say. 
</P>
<P>
 A retired couple lived in this house, neighbors say, and escaped unharmed 
before the fire destroyed it. 
</P>
<P>
 An unopened newspaper lay at the front door. Yellow emergency tape was 
stretched from here past the three gutted houses down the street. 
</P>
<P>
 In front of this empty house stands a "For Sale" sign. 
</P>
<P>
 "The headboard broke and fell on top of me. I thought, "This is the Big One," 
said Bob Moore. With no phone service, Moore had no way to call relatives. But 
a granddaughter saw a photo of the neighborhood on television and notified 
relatives that his house was intact. Moore says he intends to stay. "We don't 
get earthquakes like this but every 20 years. I don't expect to see another 
one." 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked like the end of the world!" Deanna Brydon said of the flames 
leaping from the gas explosion. "I wondered, 'Are we the only ones left?' " 
Deanna's brother, Darryl, said, "I'm considering asking for a transfer out of 
here." His retired father also was in the house when the quake struck. "Dad 
left for Phoenix today -- he can't stand it here any longer," he said. "He told 
us, 'I love you. Goodby.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Strings of multicolored Christmas lights still adorn this one-story house. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs on plywood-covered windows say in red paint: "PLEASE HELP US" and "BILL 
CLINTON HELP." 
</P>
<P>
 Only charred rubble remains at this residence. The occupants are said to have 
escaped. 
</P>
<P>
 In the ashes of this residence sat the blackened carcass of a compact car. The 
residents fled unhurt, a neighbor said, but not until he banged on the door to 
warn them. "The man was scared and he asked, 'What do I do?' I said, 'Get out! 
Now!' " 
</P>
<P>
 The quake jolted a group of Cal State Northridge fraternity brothers. "I 
looked outside the upstairs window, and water was gushing down the street," 
said Chris Gadomski, who also works for the Los Angeles Fire Department. "I 
told everybody to get outside." Sniffing gas, he ran to the next two houses and 
houses across street and told occupants to get out. "They all got out alive." 
Meanwhile, the gas line exploded. Back at his house, the roommates scooped 
water from the swimming pool and formed a bucket brigade and saved their house 
from fire.

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; THE METROLINK WILL NEVER BE THE SAME; TRANSIT: 
THE SANTA CLARITA-TO-UNION STATION LINE HAD BEEN A QUIET COMFORT ZONE FOR THIS

<P>
 For months, it was my secret transportation paradise, a movable feast of 
bright lights, cushy seats. There was always enough room to fling your 
briefcase on the open chair beside you and -- if the conductor wasn't watching 
-- put your feet up across the aisle. 
</P>
<P>
 Sliding down the ugly, graffiti-tattooed backsides of Los Angeles' industrial 
zones, we riders were comfortable and perhaps a wee bit smug as we read books, 
wrote reports, scanned the papers or balanced checkbooks on the hour-long 
Metrolink run from Santa Clarita to Union Station. 
</P>
<P>
 No crowds, no noise, no traffic jams, no auto emissions -- and we were 
performing an environmental service, to boot. It was bliss. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Wednesday, it was . . . New York! There were more desperate souls at 
the Santa Clarita Metrolink station on Soledad Canyon Road than miracle-seekers 
at Lourdes. It looked like they were filming a movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Cars crammed the station parking lot that usually is only half full, and 
sheriff's deputies directed hundreds more to overflow lots at the adjacent 
Saugus Speedway. Santa Clarita Transit employees hawked free connecting bus 
schedules like theater programs to the throng of commuters standing nervously 
on the platform for the 204, the 7:33 a.m. with stops at Burbank and Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 Uh-oh. The earthquake had done what promotional campaigns couldn't. In the 
past, people would look at you as if you were speaking Tagalog. Metrolink? You 
mean Blue Line, don't you? The Red Line? 
</P>
<P>
 By Tuesday, however, the term was falling with alarming regularity from the 
lips of television newscasting talent. 
</P>
<P>
 "No amount of advertising could encourage these many people to ride," said 
Mary Redmond, another regular who works in Disney's international film 
department. Attorney Richard D. Walton confessed amazement and began to lament. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was always plenty of room," he said. "It was like a secret." 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that we were even speaking showed you how far things had gone. The 
unwritten rule on Metrolink is that except for pleasantries, you stake out your 
seat and keep mum out of respect for those working or reading. An occasional 
conversation on your cellular phone is OK. 
</P>
<P>
 As we waited for the train, however, Walton opened up, telling me he moved his 
law practice from Beverly Hills to Downtown in August so he could ditch his car 
and ride Metrolink. Now he rides to Union Station, takes the subway to the 
Pershing Square and walks two blocks to his office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to drive 80 miles a day. Now I drive 15 miles a week," he bragged. 
"I'm in love with the Metrolink." 
</P>
<P>
 The feeling was familiar. Metrolink was one of the biggest reasons we decided 
to move to Valencia. Before I ever dialed a realtor, checked the school test 
scores or consulted crime stats, I called the Metrolink office and studied a 
map to make sure it would work. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, it was a chance to avoid the infamous L.A. freeway creep. Over 
time, however, Metrolink has evolved into a cherished part of the day when I am 
delivered from urban Angst , when I can either gear up for the workday or 
psychologically decompress to the seductive rhythm of the rails. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless, of course, we hit a car. Or a person. Thankfully, my trains haven't 
been responsible for the handful of deaths. But last week we did sheer the rear 
bumper from some idiot who tried to run a crossing guard off of San Fernando 
Road. He drove away, unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been some difficult adjustments. Although Metrolink's inflexible 
departure schedule delivers you home in time for dinner with the family, even 
when it rains, it dictates discipline, requiring you to curb workaholic 
tendencies and forfeit after-work schmooze fests. 
</P>
<P>
 It also forces you to master the fine art of the Five O'Clock Brush-Off. The 
trick is using just the right dash of rudeness as you rush toward the door, 
averting direct eye contact and praying you don't encounter a chatty boss. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest problem with Metrolink is those foursomes of facing seats, which 
must have been designed by Lilliputians. Easy enough on a person's, uh, frame, 
there's little clearance for competing pairs of knees. That's why any regular 
dreads the day when ridership increases to the point that we have to sit at 
awkward angles. Hey, buddy, my knees were here first!  
</P>
<P>
 Sure, we secretly root for Metrolink to gain in popularity -- perhaps to ease 
our guilt over the fact that California taxpayers subsidize us at an estimated 
$21 a trip. But we never wanted it to get out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the movement of geological plates. Now everyone has discovered 
Metrolink. U.S. senators, even, are calling for additional Metrolink cars 
within earshot of the President of the United States. On Wednesday, Metrolink 
administrators announced that they would extend the Santa Clarita by adding 
four stations all the way to Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 The result, as John Milton would say, is Metrolink Lost. The finality of this 
hit me when, as the train chugged up to the Santa Clarita station half an hour 
late Wednesday morning, someone breached decorum by shouting "Here it comes!" 
</P>
<P>
 Then a conductor used the public address system to make an announcement that 
Walton, Redmond and I would never have dreamed possible just last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you find a seat, grab it! You're lucky!"

EX-N.Y. PROSECUTOR TOPS WHITEWATER COUNSEL LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former New York prosecutor Robert B. Fiske Jr., a Republican, emerged 
Wednesday as the leading candidate for the job as special counsel in the 
Whitewater case, government sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 An announcement could come as early as today. 
</P>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Janet Reno has promised she would move quickly to find a "ruggedly 
independent" lawyer to investigate whether Bill Clinton or his wife, Hillary, 
violated any laws in connection with their investment in the Whitewater land 
development company in the Ozarks or the subsequent failure of the Madison 
Guaranty Savings & Loan. The Clintons made the investment when he was Arkansas 
governor and Mrs. Clinton worked as a prominent Little Rock attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno's aides have considered several prominent Republican attorneys, including 
former Chicago prosecutor Dan Webb and former U.S. Solicitor General Kenneth W. 
Starr. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fiske, 63, has moved to the top of the list, government sources said. He 
is known both as an aggressive prosecutor and a specialist in white-collar 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 During the late 1970s, he was U.S. Attorney in Manhattan and compiled an 
impressive record, including the conviction of powerful labor bosses on 
racketeering charges and breaking up a notorious heroin ring. 
</P>
<P>
 Now in private practice, he successfully defended former Defense Secretary 
Clark M. Clifford and his partner Robert Altman against federal charges that 
they deceived regulators by hiding foreign ownership of the Bank of Credit & 
Commerce International, whose failure cost investors billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite his GOP and Wall Street credentials, Fiske is not a particular 
favorite of Washington conservative activists. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh planned to named Fiske as the deputy 
attorney general, the No. 2 post in the Justice Department. But conservatives, 
including Republican senators on the Judiciary Committee, raised objections. 
Fiske had chaired the American Bar Assn.'s committee that evaluated potential 
court nominees, and conservatives blamed him for the ABA's lukewarm endorsement 
of the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Robert H. Bork in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornburgh finally dropped Fiske's nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno was traveling for much of the past week but returned to the Justice 
Department Wednesday. Aides confirmed that she was nearing a final decision and 
planned to hold a press conference today even though government offices will be 
officially closed because of extreme cold temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Department officials were at work late Wednesday evening making 
preparations for an announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno had originally opposed choosing an outside counsel to handle the 
Whitewater investigation, but Clinton bowed to political pressure on Jan. 12 
and ordered her to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 The Whitewater investigation could drag on for months or years, and several 
candidates have reportedly been reluctant to take on the assignment. 
</P>
<P>
 With Republican senators clamoring for a special counsel, Reno can head off 
potential criticism by choosing a Republican for the job.

WOUNDED ATF AGENT POINTS TO DAVIDIAN AS GUNMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal agent showed jurors his bloodied vest Wednesday, described his 
bullet wounds and pointed out the Branch Davidian he said shot him. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no doubt in my mind that man shot me," agent Eric Evers said as he 
gestured toward defendant Livingston Fagan, who sat expressionless in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Evers was the second Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agent to testify 
in the trial of 11 Branch Davidians charged with murder and murder conspiracy 
in the killing of four agents and the wounding of 16 others. 
</P>
<P>
 Six Branch Davidians also are believed to have died in the 45-minute gunfight 
that followed a Feb. 28 raid in which the agents sought to arrest Davidian 
doomsday prophet David Koresh. The raid triggered a 51-day standoff that ended 
April 19 when Koresh and about 80 followers died amid a huge fire that 
authorities say the Davidians started. 
</P>
<P>
 Evers, who underwent hours of cross-examination, never wavered from his 
statement that Fagan, flanked by two men with handguns, shot him with either an 
AR-15 or M-16 assault-style rifle. 
</P>
<P>
 The agent showed the bloodied vest he was wearing, told of being wounded in 
the chest and forearms, and talked of how he dove for cover in a ditch as 
bullets flew. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something told me deep down inside, 'You've got to get up. You've got to get 
up. These people aren't playing games. They're going to shoot you in the head,' 
" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was terrifying. . . . As time went on I got very lightheaded. I didn't 
realize I was bleeding as badly as I was," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys claim the Davidians acted in self-defense, and at issue is 
which side fired first. Fagan's attorney, Rocket Rosen, opened his 
cross-examination by asking: "Who were the bad guys?" 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who were shooting at me," Evers replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosen accused Evers of identifying Fagan because the agent's assailant was 
black and Fagan was the only African American in the compound to survive after 
the raid. He left the compound nearly a month before the fire and was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that man over there shot me," said Evers, repeating his unwavering 
refrain. "Everything is etched in my mind until the day I die because of that 
incident."

RUBLE'S FALL FUELS A RUN ON BANKS; RUSSIA: CITIZENS SCRAMBLE FOR DOLLARS AS 
DOUBT OVER REFORMS COLLAPSES CURRENCY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BOUDREAUX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the biggest blow to the ruble since it stabilized last year, Russians in 
search of dollars mobbed banks and exchange houses for a third straight day 
Wednesday, bringing urgency to a crisis over leadership of the country's 
economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruble, relatively steady since July, plunged to a low of 1,607 to the 
dollar on the Moscow Inter-Bank Currency Exchange. It had closed at 1,354 per 
dollar last Friday but dropped to 1,402 Monday after the government's leading 
reformer, Economics Minister Yegor T. Gaidar, resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, it has slid another 100 points per day as President Boris N. 
Yeltsin and his prime minister struggle to form a new Cabinet and as Muscovites 
scramble through snowstorms to dump the ruble, fearing the demise of 
anti-inflation policies that had sustained its value. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid my savings will evaporate tomorrow," said Ludmila S. Pashkova, 67, 
a retired schoolteacher who has never owned a dollar bill, as she lined up at 
Moscow's Inkombank. Shivering in a worn cloth coat and no gloves, she waited 
more than an hour to buy $50. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're feeling panic here, an enormous influx of people -- businessmen, 
babushkas , students, everybody," said an exchange house cashier on Neglinka 
Street after selling all $40,000 on hand and closing early. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruble's stability has been an important cornerstone of Russia's agreements 
with the International Monetary Fund and other leading creditors, and its 
collapse could threaten the delivery of billions of dollars in promised 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking to restore calm, Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin announced a 
partial restructuring of the Cabinet on Wednesday night, without settling the 
most important dispute: Who will control Russia's finances? 
</P>
<P>
 Economists said they expected the ruble to keep falling until that question is 
resolved and the rest of the Cabinet named -- a process that Yeltsin's office 
said could take several more days. 
</P>
<P>
 The Interfax news service reported that Russia's Central Bank had abandoned 
its efforts to prop up the ruble after pumping more than $1 billion into the 
banking system -- nearly one-fourth of its hard currency reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years after the collapse of communism, Russia developed a true currency 
market only last summer, when Finance Minister Boris G. Fyodorov achieved a 
stable exchange rate of 1,000 to 1,200 rubles to one dollar, in part by 
limiting subsidies to money-losing enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 The credit squeeze has thrown many people out of work and delayed paychecks 
for others, adding to the hardships and uncertainties of Russia's transition to 
a free market. 
</P>
<P>
 A backlash came last month when voters gave surprisingly strong support to 
Communists, nationalists and other advocates of a return to a planned economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaidar, a 37-year-old economist and the leading symbol of reform, resigned 
Sunday after failing to win Yeltsin's backing to continue his radical assault 
on subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 And the political crisis deepened as Fyodorov, Gaidar's even younger ally, 
fought to keep his influence. He refused to stay in the Cabinet unless two of 
his foes -- Central Bank President Viktor V. Gerashchenko and Alexander K. 
Zaveryukha, who oversees agriculture policy -- were subordinated to him or 
fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin met for more than six hours Tuesday and failed to 
resolve the crisis, adding to a sense of political paralysis. 
</P>
<P>
 It was anticipation of Fyodorov's ouster and a subsequent burst of inflation 
that sent Russians fleeing from the ruble this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe the old apparatchiks like Chernomyrdin can fix the 
situation," said Sergei Tishkin, a 23-year-old businessman who used up a tank 
of gasoline Wednesday shopping for the best exchange rate. "He's part of the 
old guard that ruled this country for 70 years and led it to catastrophe. Now 
they're telling us they know how to achieve 'stabilization.' Ha! We're no 
idiots." 
</P>
<P>
 Anders Aslund, a Swedish economist who advises the government, said the 
ruble's collapse has put Fyodorov in a strong position to keep bargaining for 
control of financial policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time, the market is playing a role in a Russian political 
crisis," Aslund said. "Chernomyrdin simply cannot accept a devaluation like 
this every day. He has to find a credible finance minister, or he looks quite 
weak. Right now, there's nobody but Fyodorov." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with Interfax late Wednesday, Fyodorov said the devaluation 
was a direct result of politics and could be reversed. 
</P>
<P>
 The embattled minister added that he was willing to bet 100,000 rubles that if 
he were to resign, the ruble would crash to 2,000 per dollar within a week -- a 
wager worth $62 now but $50 or less if he wins.

U.N. CHIEF BALKS AT AIR STRIKES IN BOSNIA; REPORT: BOUTROS-GHALI SAYS THERE ARE 
NOT ENOUGH GROUND FORCES IN PLACE TO MAKE AIR POWER EFFECTIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali held back Wednesday from ordering 
immediate air strikes in Bosnia-Herzegovina, arguing that they would be useless 
without a ground offensive that the United Nations is now too weak to mount. 
</P>
<P>
 The secretary general's decision, announced in a report to the Security 
Council, came despite the pressure of a NATO summit communique a week ago that 
threatened air strikes and called on the United Nations to draw up urgent plans 
for ordering them. 
</P>
<P>
 His report made it clear that he is not yet ready to take the responsibility 
of ordering the planes of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization into action 
against Bosnian Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Boutros-Ghali dealt with only two areas: the towns of Srebrenica, where Serbs 
have refused to allow the replacement of 150 Canadian peacekeepers by Dutch 
troops, and Tuzla, where Serbs have closed the airport to humanitarian relief 
flights. 
</P>
<P>
 The secretary general said it is clear in both cases that "the use of air 
power, or the threat of its use, could not alone achieve the desired 
objectives." 
</P>
<P>
 "Other military assets" would be required, the secretary general said, adding, 
however, that these "assets" would be "in excess of those currently available" 
to the United Nations in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesman Joe Sills told reporters that the secretary general was clearly 
referring to the need for ground support. 
</P>
<P>
 Boutros-Ghali told the Security Council that he had instructed his chief aide 
in the former Yugoslav federation, Yasushi Akashi of Japan, "to prepare 
forthwith detailed plans for military operations, with the use of air power as 
required . . . and to submit these plans to me as a matter of urgency." 
</P>
<P>
 But regarding ground forces, Boutros-Ghali has been unable to persuade 
governments to contribute more than half the 7,600 troops already authorized to 
guard Srebrenica, Tuzla and other Muslim enclaves designated "safe areas" by 
the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Sills emphasized that the United Nations cannot come up with more troops if 
governments persist in refusing to send them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have troops," the secretary general's spokesman said. "We don't 
print money. We don't have ships. . . . We depend on the member states." 
</P>
<P>
 Boutros-Ghali's report, according to diplomatic sources, also appeared to 
rebuff a proposal by Britain and France that he speed up the procedure for 
ordering air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 They wanted him to give Akashi the authority to order the strikes in 
Srebrenica and Tuzla upon the recommendation of Lt. Gen. Jean Cot of France, 
the U.N. military commander in the former Yugoslav federation. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Boutros-Ghali asked Akashi to make a preliminary study. 
</P>
<P>
 In that study, Akashi concluded that air strikes by themselves would not do 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Any discussion about the use of air power in Srebrenica may be moot: 
Boutros-Ghali said Akashi is trying to arrange the exchange of Canadian and 
Dutch troops by "political agreement" with the Serbs.

SERBS AND CROATS AGREE TO LOW-LEVEL DIPLOMATIC LINKS; BALKANS: PACTS ARE SEEN 
AS A WAY OF PRESSURING BOSNIA'S MUSLIMS TO ACCEPT PARTITIONING. THEY COME AS 
PEACE TALKS FAIL AGAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Serbs and Croats agreed on Wednesday to establish low-level diplomatic 
relations as another round of peace talks among Bosnia-Herzegovina's three 
warring parties ended without a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic blamed Bosnia's Muslims for "blocking 
peace" and praised the accord with Zagreb as "significant progress." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the modest agreement, signed by the foreign ministers of Yugoslavia and 
Croatia, the two countries will set up representative offices in their 
respective capitals by Feb. 15. Their Bosnian proxies signed similar 
declarations. 
</P>
<P>
 Croatian President Franjo Tudjman proclaimed the pacts, which cap months of 
improving personal relations between him and Milosevic, "a major step toward 
the normalization of relations between Croatia and Serbia." The two countries 
severed ties after their six-month war that began in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Many view the accords, which do not extend to full diplomatic recognition, as 
an attempt to force Bosnia's Muslim leaders into accepting a three-way 
partition of their war-torn republic. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Serbs may now pound Sarajevo (Bosnia's capital) with artillery, trying to 
increase the pressure," a Western diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
 Milosevic is anxious to get his Muslim foes to sign a peace agreement in order 
to win the easing of international sanctions that have strangled Serbia's 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations imposed the sanctions on Yugoslavia in 1992 for Belgrade's 
role in the violent rending of Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnia's ambassador to the United Nations, Muhamed Sacirbey, echoed the 
concern over the agreement, saying: "We hope this (agreement) does not signal a 
further alliance of war against our country." 
</P>
<P>
 The Croatians should decide, he added, "whether they are a victim in this war 
or whether they are opportunistic aggressors." 
</P>
<P>
 In Sarajevo on Wednesday, an American plane bringing food and medicine to the 
besieged capital was hit by gunfire -- the second relief plane struck in two 
days, causing the United Nations to suspend aid flights to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no injuries, and the plane landed safely in Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 International mediator Lord Owen told reporters in Geneva that peace talks 
remained deadlocked on Muslim demands for the return of a string of towns 
throughout Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic has refused to accept the republic's 
division along ethnic lines drawn during 22 months of war. He seeks to recover 
territory in eastern and western Bosnia that, once mostly Muslim, has been 
seized by Serbian forces. 
</P>
<P>
 He has rejected proposed maps that would give his government more than a third 
of Bosnian territory but would leave it with a virtually landlocked, 
geographically disjointed state. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the warring communities have agreed to meet again on Feb. 
10, Owen said, but will probably resume full-scale fighting "with no real 
prospects of coming together in a constructive frame of getting a peace 
agreement."

BENTSEN CAUTIONS CHINA ON RIGHTS; DIPLOMACY: TREASURY SECRETARY TELLS BEIJING 
TRADE STATUS HANGS IN BALANCE. BUT HE ADDS THAT ITS HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD IS 
IMPROVED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen told China's senior leadership Wednesday that 
while Beijing has improved its human rights record, the progress is still 
insufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 But that message, suggesting that China cannot yet count on renewal of its 
favorable trade benefits, was countered early today by a Treasury official who 
said that some progress is being made in negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 The official said the Administration is optimistic that agreement on the 
sensitive issue of prison labor can be reached before Bentsen leaves Beijing on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 That issue is once again coming to a head in the cyclical relationship between 
China and the United States, particularly in the area of human rights, because 
President Clinton must decide by July 3 whether to continue preferential trade 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Under an executive order he issued last May 28, Clinton said the renewal will 
not be granted in 1994 unless China complies with a 2-year-old agreement with 
the United States limiting the export of products made by prisoners and allows 
freer emigration, particularly of dissidents and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Clinton order, China must also make "overall significant progress" 
on human rights and meet a number of conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 It must release political and religious prisoners, treat other prisoners 
humanely, permit international radio and television broadcasts to reach the 
country and protect "Tibet's distinctive religious and cultural heritage" in 
the wake of Chinese repression there. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're looking for is concrete progress. Some of that has been made," 
Bentsen said at a news conference after meeting with Chinese Premier Li Peng 
and with Finance Minister Liu Zhongli. "We expect and anticipate more." 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen appeared to go out of his way to give a nod to the progress China has 
made in reducing its infant mortality rate and educating its people. Some 
within the Administration have argued that these developments should also be 
considered in the trade decision. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of current talks, officials said, is an effort to gain access to 
prisons suspected of being work camps where a variety of export goods, 
including diesel engines, socks, sheepskin and leather, are manufactured or 
processed. U.S. Customs Commissioner George J. Weise told Congress in September 
that only one of five requests to inspect such sites had been granted, in 
violation of a U.S.-Chinese accord reached in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 A Treasury official said the Administration is negotiating over how many sites 
can be visited, as well as over additional steps to ensure compliance with the 
1992 agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Importing the products of prison labor is a violation of U.S. law. 
</P>
<P>
 But other issues remain, and it was unclear whether resolution of the prison 
question would itself guarantee for China the preferential trade status. 
</P>
<P>
 The focus on human rights during Bentsen's four-day visit to China masks key 
economic goals. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior Treasury official said Bentsen is pressing China to allow such U.S. 
financial service operators as banks and investment companies to conduct 
business freely, and he wants enforcement of rules against copyright 
violations. Bentsen is also urging China to move ahead with economic reform, 
with U.S. assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 The prominence of the human rights issue on a visit by the Clinton 
Administration's chief economic spokesman reflects the melding of politics, 
diplomacy and economics that is occurring in the post-Cold War world. And the 
matter was given added weight because it was presented not by a State 
Department official but by a senior Cabinet member whose brief does not 
normally encompass such issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Some have argued that human rights and economic matters, particularly trade 
issues, should be kept apart -- or that economic growth will lead to improved 
living standards and a more relaxed political atmosphere that will bring limits 
on repression. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration, with some dissent from senior officials, has persisted in 
linking the two. 
</P>
<P>
 China has been host in recent weeks to a series of U.S. political figures, 
whose approaches to the human rights issue reflect the divisions of opinion 
over it back home. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. J. Bennett Johnston (D-La.) said on a visit here two weeks ago that it 
would be "unthinkable" for the United States to remove China from the list of 
countries given "most favored nation" status, which makes their U.S.-bound 
exports taxable at the lowest levels. 
</P>
<P>
 House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) arrived shortly afterward, 
representing those closely linking adherence to universal human rights 
standards with renewal of the preferred trade status. And in recent days, 
former President George Bush, who repeatedly resisted congressional attempts to 
force him to take a harder line toward Beijing, was also here, renewing his 
longstanding friendship with China's officialdom. 
</P>
<P>
 The flurry of interest in human rights problems here demonstrates the cycle of 
political attention paid to the subject and to the flow of U.S.-Chinese 
relations, as well as a realization within the Administration that it ignored 
China during the first half of 1993 and that it needs to develop its policy 
options. 
</P>
<P>
 The relationship soured last summer shortly after the conditional one-year 
trade status extension was granted, but it has been improving in recent weeks 
-- a textile dispute was just settled -- and is being capped with the first 
visit by a Cabinet member of Bentsen's status during the Clinton 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen said in his news conference that he emphasized to the Chinese 
leadership that U.S. concerns over human rights reflect the thinking of the 
American people, the President and the Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior Treasury official said later that the secretary reminded his hosts 
that he served 22 years in Congress -- he was a senator from Texas and chairman 
of the Senate Finance Committee when Clinton picked him for the Treasury post 
-- and consulted with members of Congress before making the trip. 
</P>
<P>
 The message was this: China should not hold out hope that the Administration 
is isolated on this issue, or that it lacks the will to resist Johnston and 
other influential members of Congress who seek increased trade with China and 
who cite examples of progress in arguing for a more relaxed approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the examples was one cited by Bentsen: the release from prison of two 
Tibetans, including a tour guide who had frequent contact with Westerners who 
criticized Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 Premier Li was said by the Treasury aide to have replied that he understands 
the role of Congress but that it is the executive branch that will make the 
decision -- suggesting that the secretary's message had not immediately taken 
hold or was being ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 In its account of Bentsen's meeting with Li, the official New China News 
Agency hinted that Beijing may be ready to make concessions, saying that Li 
said the two nations should take "practical steps" to put the relationship on a 
more normal footing. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the Chinese account said, Li called for emphasizing the points of 
agreement while putting aside "differences in ideologies and concepts of 
values," code words for human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Li also dangled in front of Bentsen the prospect of opening to U.S. exports 
the vast Chinese nation, with 1.2 billion people -- "a huge potential market 
(that) takes interest in American technology and equipment," the news agency 
said.

JAPAN REFORMS WIN PRELIMINARY APPROVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By an 18-16 vote, an upper house committee in Japan's Parliament today passed 
four political reform bills on which Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has 
staked his political future. 
</P>
<P>
 One member of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party defied his party and 
voted for the bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Final passage on the upper house floor was endangered by a rebellion within 
Hosokawa's coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 Last August, Hosokawa promised to assume "political responsibility" should he 
fail to enact the reforms that would give Japan a completely new election 
system and ban corporate contributions to individual politicians.

THREAT TO MAIM IS ALLEGED IN BOBBITT TRIAL; JUSTICE: WITNESSES DESCRIBE 
INTENSELY JEALOUS WIFE. FRIEND TESTIFIES ABOUT CONVERSATION RELATING TO THEIR 
REACTION TO SPOUSES' POSSIBLE INFIDELITY. 
</P>

<P>
 John Wayne Bobbitt's friends and relatives took the stand Wednesday at his 
wife's trial to paint a picture of an overly possessive and intensely jealous 
woman who once threatened to mutilate her husband if he ever had an 
extramarital affair. 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial in Manassas, Va., that has captured the nation's attention, 
prosecutor Paul Ebert called on a host of rebuttal witnesses to describe a very 
different Lorena Bobbitt from the one that the defense has portrayed as a 
battered spouse driven temporarily insane by her husband's abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorena Bobbitt, facing up to 20 years imprisonment for cutting off her 
husband's penis last June, also was described by a psychiatrist as a severely 
depressed woman who, while driven to mental illness by abuse, was still in 
control of her actions on the night in question. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, John Bobbitt was recalled to the stand for the third time to again 
deny that he had ever beaten, raped or forcibly sodomized his wife, as she has 
said he did throughout their four-year marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 He also denied having pressured his wife into having an unwanted abortion near 
the end of their first year of marriage, saying that the decision was mutual 
and based on the belief that they were not ready to have children. 
</P>
<P>
 The highlight of Ebert's rebuttal came when Connie James, a friend and former 
co-worker of Lorena Bobbitt, testified about a conversation that she said they 
had had in 1990 about how they would react if they ever found out that their 
husbands were being unfaithful. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a discussion about what we would do if our husbands ever cheated on us 
. . . (and) Lorena stated exactly: 'I would cut his dick off because that would 
hurt him more than just killing him,' " James said. She added that Mrs. Bobbitt 
"appeared to be serious" about the threat. 
</P>
<P>
 James, who worked in the beauty parlor where Lorena Bobbitt was a manicurist, 
also described her as being "very possessive of John," to the point of being "a 
little obsessive about it." She said that Mrs. Bobbitt would pace the floor and 
try to telephone her husband "if he was even a minute late" in picking her up 
after work. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorena Bobbitt, in cross-examination last week, denied making the threat that 
James described. But she did acknowledge that she had been deeply disturbed to 
discover later that her husband was indeed having an affair. 
</P>
<P>
 While other prosecution witnesses also described Bobbitt as obsessive about 
her husband, most testimony as the trial wound down centered on the conflicting 
conclusions drawn by the psychiatrists who examined her. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Dr. Susan Feister, a forensic psychiatrist testifying for the 
defense, described Bobbitt as an emotionally "fragile" person who, because of 
her husband's abuse, suffered from a "constellation of psychiatric disorders" 
-- including severe depression, anxiety and post-trauma distress. 
</P>
<P>
 Feister said that Bobbitt -- worn down by four years of beatings, forced sex 
and other traumas -- suffered a brief stress-induced psychosis June 23, when 
she says her husband came home drunk and raped her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overwhelmed by her emotions," Bobbitt succumbed to an "irresistible impulse" 
to strike out "against the instrument of her torture -- her husband's penis" by 
cutting it off with a carving knife as he slept, Feister said. 
</P>
<P>
 But two other psychiatric experts who followed Feister to the stand disputed 
her central legal conclusion: that Bobbitt had lapsed into a "reactive 
psychosis" and experienced an uncontrollable impulse to mutilate her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Gwaltney Jr., a clinical psychologist, said that Bobbitt suffered from 
severe clinical depression because of her husband's abuse but was not psychotic 
or unable to distinguish "right from wrong" at the time of the mutilation. 
</P>
<P>
 His testimony reinforced that of Dr. Miller Ryans, a forensic psychiatrist, 
who told jurors that Lorena Bobbitt's "act of retribution" did not qualify as 
an irresistible impulse because it was a "goal oriented" and not "totally 
random" act. 
</P>
<P>
 The conflicting psychiatric testimony illustrated what legal experts said was 
the most precarious part of Bobbitt's defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite John Bobbitt's denials of spousal abuse, the defense has presented 
what most observers agree is a convincing case that Lorena Bobbitt was a very 
battered and abused woman. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the jury of seven women and five men to find Lorena Bobbitt not 
guilty, it will have to believe not only that she was battered, but that the 
abuse induced a mental illness that in turn produced the temporary psychosis 
that led her to mutilate her husband on an "irresistible impulse." 
</P>
<P>
 With only one rebuttal witness left to testify, the trial is expected to go to 
the jury today.

U.S. TURNS UP THE HEAT ON VIOLATORS OF LABOR LAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY DELGADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Labor Department said Wednesday that it had stepped up efforts to 
prosecute businesses for violating labor laws and vowed to continue the 
crackdown as part of a larger effort to improve the lot of the American worker. 
</P>
<P>
 "The legitimate businesses in this country have an interest in making sure 
that the bad actors are vigorously prosecuted," Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich 
said in a press conference called to outline his department's accomplishments 
in 1993 and goals for 1994. "No good and responsible business in this country 
should have to compete with businesses that gain competitive advantages by 
violating labor law." 
</P>
<P>
 Reich said such indictments against businesses had nearly doubled last year -- 
from 42 to 78 -- and he cited numerous examples of successful prosecutions for 
a host of infractions, including violation of child-labor laws and safety 
regulations and failure to pay employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief among the successful enforcement actions for which he claimed credit 
were: 
</P>
<P>
 * A first-of-its-kind $600,000 settlement in a "glass-ceiling" case involving 
52 female workers near the top of the pay scale who had sought promotions at 
Fairfax Hospital in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 * A record $16.2-million wage and child-labor law settlement with Food Lion 
supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
 * An increase in indictments from 49 to 102 in connection with violations of 
health and welfare-benefits laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Reich also said his department was responsible for a 12% increase -- to $34.5 
million -- in money paid to settle discrimination cases. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the enforcement efforts go hand-in-hand with other programs to retrain 
displaced workers, provide more job security and create higher-paying jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Reich also listed several initiatives he hoped to begin this year, including 
creation of a series of job centers that would provide job counseling, 
job-search assistance and retraining. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans also are under way for a jobs summit in March, Reich said, in which 
representatives from the world's seven largest industrial nations would gather 
in Washington to discuss ways to create new jobs.

NEWS ANALYSIS; INMAN WAS UNPREPARED FOR HEAT FROM PUBLIC SPOTLIGHT; GOVERNMENT: 
A CAREER BEHIND THE SCENES MAY HAVE LEFT THE FORMER DEFENSE NOMINEE POORLY 
EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH THE WORLD OF POLITICS.

<P>
 Bobby Ray Inman's bizarre withdrawal as the defense secretary nominee provides 
a glimpse into a peculiar Washington phenomenon -- the insider who has spent so 
long behind the scenes that he is unprepared for the glare of the public 
limelight. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than 20 years, first as a Navy admiral and later as director of the 
National Security Agency and then deputy CIA director, Inman was part of a 
cadre of people who exercise great power in government but are insulated from 
the give-and-take of daily political life. 
</P>
<P>
 Inman's remarks in announcing his withdrawal Tuesday and interviews with some 
of his friends suggest that the retired admiral was unequipped to step into the 
public arena. Despite his stated reasons, that lack of exposure to public life 
has emerged as the most plausible explanation for Inman's abrupt turnabout. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought: 'He's an insider -- he probably knows the rules of the game.' But 
he didn't," said Stephen H. Hess, a Brookings Institution political analyst. 
"We were all caught off guard by that." 
</P>
<P>
 William Safire, the New York Times columnist accused by Inman of mounting 
unfair attacks, said Wednesday that he suspects Inman withdrew because he and 
other journalists were working on stories that might have damaged Inman's 
chances for winning confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
 In his column appearing today, Safire wrote that Inman might have been worried 
by probes into reports that Inman had used a source on the Senate Intelligence 
Committee staff to help "manipulate" unsuspecting senators during Inman's time 
at the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
 Inman had blamed a "new McCarthyism" in the press and the threat of a 
"partisan attack" by Republicans for his decision, but the media coverage and 
the GOP were overwhelmingly favorable toward him. 
</P>
<P>
 There were other ingredients as well: By Inman's own admission, he did not 
thirst for the post. "I did not want a job in Washington," he said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he accepted Clinton's offer because, as a career military officer, he 
found it difficult to refuse a presidential request. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends suggest that Inman's longtime insecurities, apparently stemming from 
his days as a clumsy, bespectacled youngster, may have played a part by 
prompting him to overreact to fears that his reputation was being besmirched. 
</P>
<P>
 Inman's experience is not unique in Washington politics. Others who have made 
the transition -- notably Dwight D. Eisenhower, who went from five-star general 
to President, have had similar adjustments to make, although Eisenhower managed 
it more deftly. 
</P>
<P>
 Being an admiral or general provides a degree of insulation that often is a 
handicap for a would-be politician. Few are willing to criticize a senior 
military officer, especially in public. 
</P>
<P>
 And someone who has spent the bulk of his career as an intelligence officer is 
even more protected. By nature, the chiefs of the nation's intelligence 
agencies stay in the background, even while advising presidents, briefing 
congressional leaders and influencing policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially during the Cold War, the bulk of their contact with the outside was 
behind closed doors -- with lawmakers or reporters respectfully grateful for 
any morsel of information they were given. 
</P>
<P>
 Inman's circumstances, and his own talents, accustomed him to receiving 
nothing but plaudits. Presidents, lawmakers and even the press praised him 
lavishly, extolling his brilliance and wisdom. Hardly an unkind word was to be 
found. 
</P>
<P>
 What Inman actually had to face during his few short weeks as defense 
secretary-designate was mild: 
</P>
<P>
 * A potential flap over his failure to pay Social Security taxes for a 
housekeeper peaked a few hours after it was announced, leaked by the White 
House to head off any serious brouhaha. The issue had been a major element in 
toppling two candidates for top Justice Department posts. 
</P>
<P>
 * News stories, backed up by bankruptcy records, noted his mixed performance 
in various business ventures. The articles were brought on mainly by Inman's 
statements that he planned to bring more business techniques to government. 
</P>
<P>
 As Inman eventually admitted, the only real criticism came from a handful of 
columnists. News coverage and most editorials were heavy with praise; Inman 
said Tuesday that the working press had treated him fairly. 
</P>
<P>
 Inman did "more to besmirch his own reputation in his press conference than 
the press or the Republicans ever did," Hess said. "Most people think his 
response bordered on the bizarre." 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), whom Inman accused -- apparently 
without foundation -- of spearheading a GOP attack against him, offered perhaps 
the unkindest cut of all: 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's probably a break for President Clinton that he didn't get the 
job, the way he carried on yesterday," the senator said Wednesday on CBS-TV's 
"This Morning" program, in a view shared by some White House aides.

 The White House intensified its search for a new defense secretary on 
Wednesday after the abrupt and unexpected withdrawal of nominee Bobby Ray 
Inman. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that Georgia Democratic Sen. Sam Nunn, the powerful chairman of 
the Senate Armed Services Committee, had been approached about the job, but 
Nunn, who has sparred with President Clinton on defense budget issues and on 
the acceptance of gays in the military, declined to be considered. 
</P>
<P>
 Other possible candidates cited by White House and congressional officials 
include former New Hampshire Republican Sen. Warren B. Rudman, defense industry 
executive Norman Augustine and the current deputy defense secretary, William 
Perry. 
</P>
<P>
 Inman, a retired admiral and former top intelligence official, was supposed to 
bring unimpeachable credentials to the job but withdrew on Tuesday, citing a 
poisonous atmosphere in Washington that made further public service 
unattractive.

SHULTZ'S IRAN-CONTRA CRITICISMS SURFACE; PROBE: INDEPENDENT COUNSEL'S REPORT ON 
SCANDAL REVEALS THAT THE THEN-SECRETARY OF STATE HARSHLY CONDEMNED BUSH AND 
WEINBERGER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOYLE McMANUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Secretary of State George P. Shultz considered George Bush a 
"superficial" politician who was "up to his ears" in the Iran-Contra scandal, 
according to Lawrence E. Walsh, the independent counsel who investigated the 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
 But Walsh's final report also said that Shultz himself knew more about 
then-President Ronald Reagan's secret arms sales to Iran than he later admitted 
to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, released Wednesday, holds no major new revelations about the 
scandal, but it does include some startlingly salty excerpts from the notes of 
Shultz's top aides -- and a new, more complex picture of the Cabinet officer 
who did the most to stop the clandestine Iranian deal. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the notes of Shultz aide M. Charles Hill, who kept a meticulous 
daily record of the then-secretary of state's pronouncements, Shultz was 
startled to learn how deeply then-Vice President Bush was involved in the 
Iran-Contra affair -- and he believed the scandal probably doomed Bush's hopes 
of becoming President. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is up to his ears in Iran," the notes quote Shultz as saying of Bush in 
1987. "(He's) getting drawn into a web of lies," another note said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing crushes Bush," Shultz was recorded as saying. " I don't think 
he can get elected now on his own." 
</P>
<P>
 The scandal erupted when it was learned that the Reagan Administration 
secretly sold weapons to Iran in 1985 and 1986 in order to gain the release of 
U.S. hostages in Lebanon and to generate funds to aid rebel forces in 
Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that Bush had wanted to fly to Syria "to have a hostage come back on 
his plane," the notes quote Shultz as saying: "There's a superficiality there." 
</P>
<P>
 Shultz's policy battles with then-Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger 
were legendary at the time, but the notes reveal great personal animosity as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tiresome," Shultz complained to his aide, according to the notes. 
"(Weinberger is) dishonest. Says these outrageous things. . . . You don't have 
to sit in these meetings and listen to Cap. He's either stupid or dishonest, 
one or the other." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Shultz had higher regard for Weinberger than for William P. Clark, 
Reagan's national security adviser from 1981 through 1983. "Cap is an ally in 
some ways. A real guy," a 1986 note reads. "Bill Clark has no substance. An 
influence peddler." 
</P>
<P>
 Shultz, now a fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, said he 
considers Walsh's charges "outrageous" and the publication of his aide's notes 
"completely inappropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 "Here you are blowing off steam in the privacy of your office, and all of a 
sudden it turns up in public," he said in a telephone interview. "It's 
important, from a historical point of view, to keep good written records of 
important public business, but this kind of thing . . . is creating a 
tremendous bias against record-keeping." 
</P>
<P>
 It was not immediately clear why Walsh included the pungent excerpts from the 
Shultz records in his report. However, the report accuses Shultz and Hill of 
failing to produce all their records until 1991, and Walsh cited the excerpts 
as examples of "private comments and personal reflections" that the former 
secretary of state was apparently reluctant to release. 
</P>
<P>
 More broadly, Walsh charged that Shultz gave "incorrect" and "misleading" 
testimony to Congress by minimizing the extent of his knowledge about the arms 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "Walsh's charges are just outrageous," Shultz said. "I testified to everything 
I could remember. . . . Nothing was held back at all." 
</P>
<P>
 When the Iran-Contra affair exploded in 1986, Shultz was seen as one of the 
scandal's few heroes -- the man who opposed the arms sales, battled to stop 
them, and was thwarted when other high officials lied to him. 
</P>
<P>
 But Walsh's report charges that Shultz knew most of the important details of 
the deal, chose not to fight, and later tailored his testimony to make it 
appear that he had been in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shultz's testimony (to Congress in 1986 and 1987) was incorrect, if not 
false, in significant respects," Walsh's report concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to his testimony, "Shultz was aware of direct arms transfers from the 
United States to Iran during 1986," the report said. "To the extent Shultz did 
not have complete information regarding the arms transfers, his situation was 
caused as much by his desire not to know more as it was by efforts at the 
(National Security Council) staff to conceal information from him." 
</P>
<P>
 But Walsh's report praises Shultz for his "admirable role" in stopping the 
arms sales.

U.S. URGES HIGH COURT TO BACK STATE IN MULTINATIONAL TAX CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Siding with California in a tax case in which $4 billion is at stake, lawyers 
for the Clinton Administration on Wednesday urged the Supreme Court to uphold 
the state's use of the so-called "unitary tax" on multinational corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal brief, filed in the pending case of Barclays Bank vs. California, 
92-1384, redeems Clinton's campaign pledge to take a "pro-California" stand in 
the huge tax dispute, which involves the nation's foreign trading partners. 
</P>
<P>
 In an earlier phase of the case, officials of the Ronald Reagan and George 
Bush administrations had contended that California's distinct method of 
taxation disrupted the nation's foreign relations and should be declared 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 If the high court were to adopt that view, the state could be forced to pay 
refunds or forgo disputed tax assessments that amount to $4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Administration brief argues that neither Congress nor the White House 
put California on notice during the 1970s and 1980s that its taxing system was 
disruptive. 
</P>
<P>
 The state should not be "unjustly held liable for refunds of tax that violated 
no federal policy" at the time, the brief says. Congress could have required 
all states to adopt an identical taxing system, but it did not do so, the brief 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most states and nations, which treat the local operations of a 
multinational firm as though they are separate businesses, California treated 
multinationals as a single business and taxed a portion of the whole 
enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporate tax lawyers complain this unitary method permits California to tax 
profits that were not earned within the state. 
</P>
<P>
 But state lawyers counter that the simple accounting system combats 
international tax cheating. Some foreign firms have allegedly shifted their 
costs so as to claim they earn no profits in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, state lawmakers bowed to pressure from international business 
last year and essentially repealed the unitary tax. But billions of dollars in 
past collection remain in dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 The high court is expected to hear arguments in the case in late March and 
issue a ruling by summer.

3-HOUR TOUR: WHERE TO CLIMB, HEAR BIRDS AND PICK FLOWERS -- INSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

contributes to The Times Orange County Edition.

<P>
 If it looks like an industrial zone, that's because it is an industrial zone. 
But beyond the faceless exteriors, a single long block of Logan Avenue in Costa 
Mesa reveals delights both heavenly and earthly. Enterprises devoted to 
climbing and birds serve those with their heads in the clouds. Shops 
specializing in flowers (both real and acrylic) and antiques cater to those 
with their feet more firmly on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 2 to 2:45: What skateboards were to the '70s, and snowboards to the '80s, rock 
climbing is to the '90s, and Rockreation rides the wave of the spinoff activity 
known as sport climbing, which focuses on steep, well-protected routes. The 
climbing gym occupies one of the block's few two-story buildings, and the 
reason is obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the room devoted to climbing is 6,000 square feet, climbing surface is 
10,500, almost a 2-1 ratio of climbing surface to floor space. While there's a 
"bouldering cave" for unprotected traversing, the shortest routes for roped 
climbing are almost 30 feet high, and in many cases climbs continue right up 
onto the ceiling for a stretch of 45 feet. Brightly colored artificial hand and 
foot holds look as if hundreds of different flavored bubble gums have been 
splattered against the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Take some time to watch these guys, many of whom could teach Spiderman a thing 
or two. When you have more time, come back for the two-hour "Fight Gravity I" 
class: At the end of it, you could be right up there with them. 
</P>
<P>
 2:45 to 3: V.I.P. Aviaries not only offers Very Important Parrots, but all 
manner of "parrot-phenalia" -- cages, books and toys -- for those with feather 
fever. Every bird needs Birdy Buddy, for instance: "Cuddly cozy company for 
your bird makes every nap a slumber party!" 
</P>
<P>
 Because Russ and Madonna La Pell believe that most people don't understand the 
commitment involved with owning a parrot, they don't cater to first-time 
buyers. Domestic hand-fed babies include Congo African grays, "the best 
talkers, with no natural scream to offend neighbors," at $995 each, magnificent 
blue and gold macaws at $1,495 and rare scarlet macaws at $2,495. 
</P>
<P>
 Because parrots sitting on eggs are easily disturbed, the public is generally 
not allowed access to the aviaries, but the roar can be deafening even with the 
aviary doors closed. Babies are kept at the La Pells' home; prices include 
bonding sessions for prospective owners. 3 to 4: A hand-painted sign out on the 
street near Jack & Gloria's Antiques boasts "funky to formal" merchandise, 
including imported English oak. Four huge adjoining suites house things big and 
small, from England and the East Coast. Prices include refinishing, but items 
can be purchased for less as is. 
</P>
<P>
 Offered recently were a 1906 stove bearing the Sears Roebuck imprint; "potty 
chairs" from the 1890s (you lift up the seat, the pot goes beneath); and pine 
iceboxes from the 1860s. Morris chairs, the first recliners, are a specialty. 
"My partner owns 19," Gloria Reichstein said. "I own nine. We don't use sofas." 
Nearly 60 were for sale. There were too many imposing armoires, hall stands and 
sideboards to count. 
</P>
<P>
 4 to 4:30: Another sign several doors down reads, simply, "Flowers." Yet on 
Valentine's Day and at Easter, the police have been known to come regulate 
traffic here. Suffice it to say that prices at Flower Warehouse are good and 
the selection intriguing. 
</P>
<P>
 For a really different arrangement try ornamental chili peppers at $6.50 a 
bunch. Pass up birds of paradise for sassy parakeets, at $1.50 a stem, or 
marvelously melancholy amaranthus, also known as love-lies-bleeding, at $7.50 a 
bunch. The deal that keeps 'em coming, however, is short-stem red roses, $7 for 
a bunch of 25, with a maximum of four bunches per person. 
</P>
<P>
 4:30 to 5: Roses are $12 per stem, on the other hand, at Wyatt's Acrylic Gifts 
and Workshop, and an arrangement of birds of paradise runs $225. But then, 
these flowers are made of different stuff: "Everything is cut, by hand, from a 
flat sheet of plastic, then formed with heat, by hand," artisan James Wyatt 
explained. Wyatt also offers orchids, anthurium, ginger, tulips, tiger lilies 
and Calla lilies, and said he's "experimenting with a pansy." 
</P>
<P>
 Wyatt invites the public to come watch him at work, and especially encourages 
children. "Children don't often see people working with their hands anymore, 
and it's a big loss," he said. Wyatt has been on Logan for 10 years, in his 
present endeavor for five. "I had an earlier line of acrylic sculpture. Where 
does an idea come from? All of a sudden I was making flowers." 1. Rockreation 
1300 Logan Ave. (714) 556-7625 Open Monday through Thursday, 11 a.m. to 10 
p.m.; Friday, 11 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturday and Sunday, 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. 2. 
V.I.P. Aviaries 1366 Logan Ave., Suite A (714) 540-0220 Open daily except 
Thursday and Sunday, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., Saturday until 5 p.m. 3. Jack &

daily except Wednesday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. 4. Flower Warehouse 1308 Logan Ave.

Logan Avenue.

IN FISHER'S DEFENSE; HE FLOURISHES WITH 49ERS AFTER FLOPPING WITH RAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 "I consider myself fortunate just to be in this business. Every morning, I get 
up and high-five myself knowing that I can go into work and enjoy my job. But 
Monday, it was different. It was very different."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Jeff Fisher, San Francisco defensive backs coach 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't rumbling that woke Jeff Fisher at 5:30 a.m. in his home near Santa 
Clara. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a crackling voice over his clock radio. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher was stirred Monday by news of the 6.6 earthquake that had struck 
Southern California an hour earlier. Curiosity quickly turned to concern. 
</P>
<P>
 He began piecing together scraps of information as he dressed and left for the 
49ers' training facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake's epicenter in Northridge was only a few miles from his parents' 
home in Woodland Hills. He tried to call them, but he couldn't get through. 
</P>
<P>
 It made Fisher uneasy all day as the 49er coaching staff prepared for Sunday's 
NFC championship game at Dallas. Still, he attended game-plan meetings and 
watched films, trying somehow to devise a plan that will slow Dallas' runaway 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
 But his thoughts kept straying home. 
</P>
<P>
 He wondered about his brother, Chris, and sisters, Pam and Lisa, who live in 
the San Fernando Valley. He learned later in the day that they were fine, but 
he still couldn't get through to his parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sat there in meetings, and I kept calling up in the back of my mind what 
was going on down there," Fisher said. "Were my parents OK? How bad was it? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to concentrate on your work when you're wondering if the house you 
grew up in is still there." 
</P>
<P>
 It was. 
</P>
<P>
 By 10 p.m., Fisher finally reached his parents by phone. Their home had 
sustained some minor damage, but everyone was fine. A fence collapsed in the 
back yard, and the kitchen was scattered with broken dishes and crystal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was quite a relief," Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up in Southern California, Fisher has had more than his share of 
anxious moments in earthquakes. He was 10 when when Southern California was 
shaken in 1971. Smaller quakes hit when he played at Woodland Hills Taft High, 
USC, and later when he was the Rams' defensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher surveyed the damage on TV that night -- the crushed freeway overpasses, 
the fires and the homes that looked as if they were squeezed by a vise. 
</P>
<P>
 He thought about what a crazy year this has been. Only a few weeks earlier, he 
watched his mentor, Houston defensive coordinator Buddy Ryan, slug Oiler 
offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride during a sideline scuffle. 
</P>
<P>
 That wasn't the Buddy Ryan who Fisher knows. 
</P>
<P>
 He knows the Buddy Ryan who groomed him as a player with the Chicago Bears and 
as a coach with the Philadelphia Eagles. Not the Ryan who blasts the Oiler 
offense in the media. 
</P>
<P>
 He knows the Buddy Ryan who is loved by his players. Not the Ryan who 
challenged former Bears' Coach Mike Ditka to a fight. 
</P>
<P>
 He knows the Buddy Ryan who stopped by on Christmas Eve to see Fisher's three 
children the day before the 49ers played the Oilers. Not the Ryan who lashes 
out at fellow assistant coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never gone into detail with Buddy about what happened with Gilbride," 
Fisher said. "There are a lot of frustrations in coaching, as there are in all 
walks of life. And with Buddy, he vents his frustrations a little differently 
than most do." 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher's playing career ended in 1985, the year Ryan's 46 defense and Ditka's 
offense led the Bears to a victory over the Patriots in Super Bowl XX. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher was out with an ankle injury that season, but gained valuable 
experience assisting Ryan's staff. When Ryan accepted the head coaching job in 
Philadelphia in 1986, he brought Fisher along as the defensive backs coach. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Fisher's first as the Eagles' defensive coordinator, they led the 
league in interceptions (30) and sacks (62). The next season, they ranked first 
in the league against the rush and were second in sacks (46). 
</P>
<P>
 But the Eagles floundered in the playoffs, and owner Norman Braman didn't 
renew Ryan's contract after the 1990 season. Ryan headed to his horse farm, and 
Fisher went looking for work. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher's complex but effective defensive scheme appealed to several teams. His 
age -- 32 at the time -- made him an attractive heir apparent as a head coach. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams couldn't resist. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher lasted only one season in Anaheim. An undermanned defense couldn't run 
Fisher's scheme the same way Reggie White, Clyde Simmons and Jerome Brown did 
in Philadelphia. The Rams gave up nearly 26 points a game during a 10-game 
losing streak in which the offense failed to score more than 20 in a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jeff did a great job in '91," said 49er linebacker Larry Kelm, a starter on 
the 1991 Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just didn't have a very good team that year. He came in with a complex 
defense, and we didn't have the people who could execute." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson resigned after the season, but it wasn't Fisher who replaced him. The 
job went to Chuck Knox, who brought in George Dyer, his assistant in Seattle, 
as the defensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the Rams let Jeff go, it really wasn't a reflection on his ability," 
Kelm said. "He just took the fall. He wasn't Chuck's kind of guy, and Chuck 
wanted to bring in his guy." 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't take long for Fisher to find work. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati, Minnesota and Pittsburgh contacted him about their vacant 
defensive coordinator jobs. Then 49er Coach George Seifert called. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven days after the Rams fired him, Fisher accepted the defensive backs 
position with the 49ers, replacing Ray Rhodes, who left to become the Green Bay 
Packers' defensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was disappointing when the Rams didn't retain me," Fisher said, "because I 
wanted to finish what I had started. But I think it has worked out in the long 
run. It really has." 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco is 26-9 since Fisher joined its staff. The 49ers were ranked 
10th in league in passing defense (192.7 yards a game). Safeties Tim McDonald, 
who signed as a free agent in the off-season, and Merton Hanks steadied the 
secondary. 
</P>
<P>
 Although sporadically effective this season, San Francisco's defense stood 
firm last week, holding the New York Giants' Rodney Hampton to 12 yards rushing 
in a 44-3 divisional playoff victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a great performance across the board," Fisher said. "We had fumbled 
around earlier in the year, and in those last couple games (Houston and 
Philadelphia) we played a lot of people. Still, there were a lot of question 
marks about this club's defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Questions that could be answered Sunday against the Cowboys. Fisher said 
memories of last year's 30-20 championship game loss to the Cowboys still 
linger with the 49er coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never look ahead, but we were staring down the road to (the Super Bowl in) 
Pasadena last year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll never forget the feeling after we lost last year's championship game, 
when we came back to our offices that Monday. It was hard to describe. It was 
so tough. We were so close. 
</P>
<P>
 "I keep reminding myself of that feeling every once in a while."

WILL MATURITY SPOIL WATTERS?; 49ERS: RUNNING BACK SAYS THAT HE HAS GROWN UP, 
WHICH IS GOOD FOR A LAUGH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Significant news to relay from the San Francisco 49ers' practice facility: 
Running back Ricky Watters has found maturity. 
</P>
<P>
 He said so Wednesday, and while he had to be coerced by team officials to be 
available for a 10-minute interview, he concluded that now that he has scored 
five touchdowns in one game, he is all grown up. 
</P>
<P>
 Research into his background, therefore, is not relevant, although 
irresistible. 
</P>
<P>
 There was the fumble in last year's NFC championship game that led to a 
sideline temper tantrum and Dallas' first touchdown. There were also reports 
from that 30-20 loss that he had yelled at quarterback Steve Young for 
"choking" in the big game. 
</P>
<P>
 Kids will be kids, of course. While at Notre Dame, Watters missed the USC game 
in his final season after being suspended for breaking team rules. After going 
on to the NFL as a second-round pick, Watters returned to the huddle after his 
first professional carry and shouted to teammates: "They can't stop me." 
</P>
<P>
 They didn't, and Watters knew it. Last season, after his second year in the 
pros, he gained a trip to the Pro Bowl that reportedly left players throughout 
the league moaning and groaning about an ego gone wild. 
</P>
<P>
 An ejection for a late hit earlier this season against the Steelers prompted 
Pittsburgh cornerback D.J. Johnson to say, "He's a punk." 
</P>
<P>
 Old news, Watters said, while declining to talk about the bad old days 
Wednesday. The new and improved Ricky Watters, he said, has matured and will 
never again embarrass his parents, who reside in Harrisburg, Pa., as he did 
against the Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The man says he's much more mature now," 49er center Jesse Sapolu said. "And 
I believe him wholeheartedly." 
</P>
<P>
 Once Sapolu had stopped laughing and had regained his composure, he added: "I 
can see it, I guess. You don't see any Gatorade bucket flying around, now do 
you? 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to know Ricky. I think one of the reasons he's such a good player is 
that he doesn't let the past wreck his concentration." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Watters became the only player to score five touchdowns in an NFL 
playoff game during the 49ers' 44-3 victory over the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to describe his five touchdowns, Watters said he could do so in one 
word: "Offensive line." 
</P>
<P>
 It's the Watters curse: He can't contain himself. His mother took him to a 
doctor when he was 5, concerned he was hyperactive. The doctor advised her that 
he was going to be like that for quite some time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ricky was walking the sideline last week and saying, 'I'm hot, get me the 
ball,' " teammate Dexter Carter said. "He wasn't lying. He's a big piece of the 
puzzle here, and if we want to get to the Super Bowl, Ricky needs to get his 
carries." 
</P>
<P>
 Watters carried the ball eight times against the Cowboys earlier this season 
in a 26-17 loss to Dallas. At the time, he had not yet been touched by maturity 
and was seen yelling at an assistant coach while walking from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 His diatribe continued later for the benefit of reporters: 
</P>
<P>
 "How many times did Emmitt Smith carry the ball? Is he a tailback? What am I? 
A tailback, so that right there speaks for itself. I'm the starting tailback 
here; a good starting tailback is supposed to carry the ball. Simple as that. 
That's how it has been since I've been in grade school." 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers used Watters as a decoy and lined him up as a wide receiver against 
the Cowboys, while Smith ran 27 times for 92 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why that was that way," Watters said at the time. "They 
(coaches) know what happened. There are grown men up there doing that." 
</P>
<P>
 Maturity, however, has tempered Watters' present-day remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I weren't to (carry the ball much) and we still win the game, then that 
would be all right with me," he said Wednesday. "I mean, hey, let's just get to 
Atlanta." 
</P>
<P>
 Watters, at 6 feet 1 and 212 pounds, carried the ball 208 times for 950 yards 
this season, but missed three games because of a knee injury. A year ago he ran 
for 1,013 yards with two fewer attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ricky meets all challenges," 49er tight end Jamie Williams said. "And he 
knows how to get the other team's attention. A good example of that is his 
first game against the Giants last year. They got so caught up into trying to 
shut this young guy's mouth that they forgot about some other people. 
</P>
<P>
 "He talks a good game and he can handle it." 
</P>
<P>
 Watters' boundless energy is accepted almost as if it were part of the 49ers' 
weekly game plan. After the wife of one of the team's assistant coaches sang 
the national anthem before a game this season, Watters broke ranks, ran onto 
the field and kissed her. 
</P>
<P>
 A week ago he sprinted around Candlestick Park and slapped the hands of fans 
before the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "My teammates are very businesslike in the huddle," Watters said. "I do most 
of the talking." 
</P>
<P>
 When he scores, he struts, and then he carries on for the fans' entertainment. 
Tom Rathman advised Watters before the start of this season that he was going 
to be a marked man because his flashy antics on the field had irritated 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Watters didn't know what he was talking about. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be a showboat," Watters said, "means you're making a conscious effort. 
You're making it a point to show these people up. But as long as it's 
spontaneous, it's just me playing football." 
</P>
<P>
 When he gets hit hard on a tackle, Watters likes to jump quickly to his feet 
to show opponents they won't be able to keep him down. His displays of emotion, 
coupled with his running commentary, bring a knowing chuckle from teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's kind of funny to me," Williams said. "He'll get going and in the huddle 
we'll say, 'Time to turn the water on.' 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got so much energy, I guess he can waste it. I mean he used to go 
ballistic at times, but now he seems to keep cool. You could say he's learning 
how to channel it better. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like he had to go, go, go, and prove to people he was a good player. I 
think he's starting to realize that people know he's a good player. He's still 
spiking the ball between his legs when he scores and saluting the fans, but 
he's, you know, more mature." 
</P>
<P>
 This Sunday Watters plays against the Cowboys, and the winner earns a trip to 
the Super Bowl. Given such theater, a spontaneous Watters might be too much to 
behold. But then maturity settles a man down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to be a lot more focused, simply because I know some things now 
that I didn't know the last time we played them in the championship game," 
Watters said. "You have to put more time in studying the plays, all the plays, 
focusing on them. A lot of times you can get caught up in the whole event and 
start worrying about things like how am I going to look on camera and is my 
tape job nice. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to get down to basics and concern yourself with what it takes to win 
the game." 
</P>
<P>
 How mature, but how boring. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to conserve myself," Watters told reporters Sunday after scoring his 
five touchdowns. "I'm getting older now. I'm getting more mature." 
</P>
<P>
 Even he had to laugh.

49ERS HAVE TO BE ON SHARK ALERT; COWBOYS: KENNY GANT HAS BECOME POPULAR IN 
DALLAS AND A TARGET FOR OPPONENTS WITH HIS CELEBRATION DANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As with any fine work of art, this one did not evolve for the purpose of fame 
or riches. 
</P>
<P>
 In the beginning, Kenny Gant danced only for himself. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the sixth game of last season. The Dallas Cowboys against the Seattle 
Seahawks. Gant against Seahawk quarterback Dan McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a safety blitz. A sack. An inspiration to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
 Gant wasn't supposed to be here. He was from a small town, a small school, had 
never stepped inside an airplane until being drafted in a distant round. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing over McGwire at Texas Stadium, thousands suddenly cheering for him, 
Gant remembered a maneuver he had fooled with in practice. 
</P>
<P>
 He stuck his right hand above his helmet and began shaking it like a fin. At 
the same time, he swung the ball in his left hand and took several exaggerated 
steps. 
</P>
<P>
 In front of a television set in Lakeland, Fla., a minister and a schoolteacher 
blushed. 
</P>
<P>
 That night when the phone rang, Kenny Gant knew he had a hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'What in the world was that ?' " Patricia Gant recalled. "I said, 
'Son, are you crazy?' " 
</P>
<P>
 As crazy as a shark. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen months later, Gant's "Shark" dance has become the biggest thing in 
this town since the two-step. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Cowboys defeat the San Francisco 49ers Sunday in the NFC championship 
game, the dance could be the biggest thing since the Ickey Shuffle. 
</P>
<P>
 As a special teams player, and linebacker in the nickel defense, Gant dances 
after sacks, big hits, forced fumbles, or anything else that feels good. 
</P>
<P>
 Gant dances even when the ball is dead. Before kickoffs, he is the player on 
the goal line, 30 yards behind the rest of the kickoff team, posing and 
strutting and firing up the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Of particularly interest is his "Three Stooges" routine, in which he slaps his 
hands wildly across the front of his helmet before the ball is kicked. 
</P>
<P>
 "He puts a smile on a lot of people's faces," Cowboy safety Bill Bates said. 
</P>
<P>
 And steers them toward their wallets. One can now purchase foam-rubber sharks, 
a shark poster, and T-shirt that proclaims Texas Stadium as "the Shark Tank." 
</P>
<P>
 Gant has unwittingly become the most sought-after Cowboy who is not named 
Aikman, Smith or Irvin. 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, he is the only team member who has made a paid appearance at 
a bar mitzvah. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really impressed with the religious aspects of it, with all the candles 
and everything," he said. "Then I danced." 
</P>
<P>
 If you think that dance looks good on the artificial turf, you should see it 
on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
 Gant recently performed it at Reunion Arena before a game between the Dallas 
Stars and . . . the San Jose Sharks. 
</P>
<P>
 He can barely step outside these days without being spotted by somebody who 
immediately breaks into the dance. In restaurants. In banks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even in the doctor's office," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes the dance work so well is that, when he is not dancing, he is 
hitting somebody. Gant has led all non-starters in tackles for the last two 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 His worth was never more evident than last weekend in the playoff game against 
the Green Bay Packers. Remember when Corey Harris fumbled a kickoff at the end 
of the first half, leading to a quick Cowboy touchdown and a 17-3 lead? 
</P>
<P>
 It was Gant who caused the fumble. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, some people looked at him like, what in the world was going on?" 
special teams veteran Dale Hellestrae said. "But then you see the plays he's 
making. Jimmy (Johnson) gives impact players like that a little leeway." 
</P>
<P>
 The only time the Dallas coach has been angry with Gant this season, oddly 
enough, is when he didn't dance. 
</P>
<P>
 That was last week, after the tackle on Harris. Gant separated his left 
shoulder for the fourth time this season on the play and apparently could not 
move. 
</P>
<P>
 Because they were in the last two minutes of a half, the Cowboys were forced 
to use an injury timeout to attend to him. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was finally helped to his feet, sensing that the crowd was 
disappointed with no dance, he charged off the field pumping his left arm and 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson felt that if Gant was sound enough to celebrate, he was sound enough 
to get up without any assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'The hell with your shoulder, get off the field, you just cost us a 
big timeout,' " Johnson said. "Of course, we scored right away so it didn't 
hurt us." 
</P>
<P>
 Gant's antics have made opponents even angrier. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lots of guys come up to me and say, 'Our coaches would never let us get away 
with that,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year in Indianapolis, while doing his goal-line dancing before a 
kickoff, he noticed two members of the Colts' kickoff team run to the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 On the kick, those same two players sandwiched him. 
</P>
<P>
 "And one of those guys had never blocked my position before on the films," 
Gant said. "I knew what they were doing and I just told them, 'I'll be back.' " 
</P>
<P>
 So was the dance, which Gant considers much too important to discontinue 
because of a couple of thugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fans pay a lot of money for their seats, I think they deserve more than 
just a game," he said. "I think they deserve excitement." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, when the dance was merely an idea, Gant had all the excitement he 
could handle. 
</P>
<P>
 After barely making the team in his first two seasons, this ninth-round draft 
pick out of Albany (Ga.) State noticed teammate Kevin Smith acting like a shark 
during practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith was imitating a dance that he had seen on a rap video and in practice 
while at Texas A&M. Gant felt secure enough to join him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I showed it to Kenny, then he just started doing it in a game one day, 
surprised everybody," Smith said. "But then, if he wasn't a shark, he would be 
something else. He's that kind of guy." 
</P>
<P>
 You would not know it to talk to him. He barely speaks above a whisper. He 
shrugs when talking about his newfound popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 But he laughs when recalling that owner Jerry Jones did the Shark on the team 
plane returning from the NFC championship game in San Francisco last year. 
</P>
<P>
 And he does smile when talking about what has become the real reason for the 
dance. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I'm doing my thing before the kickoff at Texas Stadium and 60,000 people 
are screaming at me," he said, "I know they're thinking, 'Look at that crazy 
guy. He better go down there now and do something good.' 
</P>
<P>
 "That keeps me on my toes." 
</P>
<P>
 How true.

HARDING'S EX-HUSBAND CHARGED; OLYMPICS: GILLOOLY DENIES FINANCING AND PLOTTING 
ATTACK ON KERRIGAN. CONFESSED ACCOMPLICE IMPLICATES OREGON FIGURE SKATER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Only hours after Tonya Harding announced she was breaking up again with her 
ex-husband, he was arrested and charged Wednesday with financing and plotting 
the attack on rival Olympic figure skater Nancy Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding has not been charged, but investigators disclosed that a confessed 
accomplice, relying on secondhand conversations, had implicated her. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Gillooly, who was divorced from Harding last year but then reconciled and 
lived with her until Tuesday, surrendered to FBI agents and was arraigned on 
one count of criminal conspiracy to commit assault. He was freed on $20,000 
bail. The felony charge carries a maximum sentence of 36 months in jail under 
Oregon's sentencing guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 With the fourth arrest in connection with the attack, authorities released 
their first detailed accounting of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding was said to have called a skating rink to inquire about Kerrigan's 
practice schedule. The calls were made to a Boston-area rink on Dec. 28 at the 
time the suspected "hit man" was en route to try to disable Kerrigan, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 That attempt fizzled, but the attacker then rode a bus to Detroit, where 
Kerrigan was clubbed on the right leg on Jan. 6, just before she competed in 
the U.S. Figure Skating Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Her accuser also said he understood that Harding "was concerned about having 
made those phone calls and had stated that in the event she was ever questioned 
about them, she would say she had made those calls in an effort to get Kerrigan 
to sign a poster for a fan of Harding's." 
</P>
<P>
 The link to Harding comes from one of the more unusual figures in the case, a 
300-pound acquaintance of Gillooly's named Shawn E. Eckardt. Eckardt has been 
described as Harding's bodyguard, but the FBI and sheriff's investigation 
indicated that may have been invented to try to give the conspirators an alibi. 
</P>
<P>
 Eckardt's story of Harding's involvement was not based on direct conversations 
with the skater, but from accounts of conversations he had with Gillooly. 
</P>
<P>
 Eckardt said he met with Gillooly and the two other men charged in the case in 
late December in Portland. Eckardt said the men agreed that Gillooly would pay 
$6,500 to have Kerrigan disabled -- and they further decided it would be the 
skater's right leg that would be bludgeoned because that is her "landing" leg 
for jumps. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the reports, Eckardt at first said Harding had no knowledge of 
the plot. But later Eckardt "recalled" Gillooly telling him that Harding made 
two telephone calls from her Portland-area home to the Troy Kent Arena near 
Boston to try to find out Kerrigan's practice schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Phone records from the Harding-Gillooly residence on Dec. 28 show four calls 
to Boston -- one to directory information, one to the rink's public number, 
which plays a tape-recorded schedule of operating hours, and two to the 
receptionist's office at the arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Hotel records show that the alleged hit man, Shane M. Stant, traveled to 
Boston on Dec. 29 and stayed until Jan. 3. One call from his hotel room was 
made to Kerrigan's rink. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Stant was unable to carry out the assault in Boston, so he 
traveled to Detroit a week before the national championships and checked into a 
motel in Romulus, Mich., on Jan 4. He received a phone call there the next day 
from Gillooly and Harding's home phone. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators also released a detailed accounting of cash and wire payments 
that they say link Gillooly. The source of the cash was not described. 
</P>
<P>
 The summary of the investigation said the motive for the attack was simple and 
chilling: "To prevent Kerrigan from competing in the nationals, thus enhancing 
the chances for Tonya Harding to win the national championships and to proceed 
to the winter games." 
</P>
<P>
 Harding was questioned for 10 1/2 hours by FBI and local authorities Tuesday 
and denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 During the interrogation, a lawyer who is the husband of Harding's coach 
issued a statement from her saying she was separating from Gillooly to 
concentrate on preparations for next month's Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 The two were married in 1990 and divorced last year. They reconciled in the 
autumn and resumed calling themselves husband and wife. Their relationship has 
been stormy and sometimes violent. Twice Harding obtained restraining orders to 
keep Gillooly away, and she told authorities he hit her with his fist and palm. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding and Kerrigan are the U.S. representatives to the women's figure 
skating competition, although Harding's position remains clouded because of the 
case. U.S. skating officials have said they will soon face a decision whether 
to keep Harding on the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillooly did not speak publicly Wednesday, but he and his lawyer have denied 
he was involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Also arraigned Wednesday was accused attacker Stant, who was was extradited 
from Arizona, where he turned himself in. The fourth man charged in the crime, 
Derrick B. Smith, Stant's uncle, also confessed. Smith said he was paid $2,000 
to drive the getaway car outside the Detroit ice rink. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith told investigators the money was paid by Eckardt, who said it came from 
Gillooly. 
</P>

 Investigators said Harding and Gillooly returned from Detroit, where she won 
the national championship, and were met by Eckardt. 
</P>
<P>
 Eckardt told authorities Gillooly immediately began to worry about the trail 
of money and calls he had left. For three hours, the men plotted a cover-up 
story that Eckardt and Smith were "planning on entering into a business to 
provide security for ice skaters." They believed the money and calls could then 
shield them.

JIM MURRAY: A LOUD 6.6 ON THE MORAL RICHTER SCALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Well, my beloved L.A. burst its moorings. Went ape. Tired of being taken for 
granted. No more Mr. Nice Guy. Time to teach these strangers on the land a 
lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 It was more than an earthquake. It was a moral reawakening, a terrible 
warning, God, or Nature, stepping on the anthill we call the world. Nothing can 
trivialize human behavior more than a natural catastrophe. This was the real 
Super Bowl. That other one's just a football game. 
</P>
<P>
 Man and boy, I guess I've seen 200 earthquakes in my half-century here. I've 
never seen one like this one. 
</P>
<P>
 It's pernicious. It won't go away. It's not done with us yet. It's like a bad 
relative who comes to dinner and won't leave. It's almost as if it's trying to 
drive us out. 
</P>
<P>
 We expect earthquakes in Southern California. They come with the geraniums. 
But we expect them to come, do their mischief -- and get out of here. Your time 
is up, signal when through. 
</P>
<P>
 This one lurks. Aftershocks is a word the seismologists use to describe the 
offspring. But a quake measuring 5.5 is hardly an "aftershock." It's an 
earthquake in its own right. It has its own aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what is noticeable this time. The proliferation of aftershocks. This 
earthquake is a renegade. If it were human, you would institutionalize it. It's 
a runaway sociopath. We've always had a pact with our earthquakes -- you've 
made your point, now go away. 
</P>
<P>
 Not this one. To be sure, past earthquakes have had their aftershocks. But 
they've often been detectable only to seismographs and the people who read 
them. You don't need a seismograph for this one. Your eyes and ears (outer and 
inner) are instruments enough. 
</P>
<P>
 You never forget your first earthquake. Your first realization that Lotus Land 
is not the tranquil Eden that it appears. There's a snake in it, too. The palm 
trees have rats in them, the hills are tinder, and the beautiful scenery masks 
a malevolent presence that belies its angelic appearance and turns from 
choirboy to serial killer. 
</P>
<P>
 I was working on the old Examiner at 11th and Broadway when I had my first. It 
was in the 1940s and the room began to sway and pitch. The fluorescent lights 
crackled. I thought I would have a fainting spell when the city editor, Hicks 
Coney, looked over. I was going to describe him as "sadistic city editor" but 
that would be redundant for a Hearst paper. Coney looked at me, leered, "What's 
the matter kid? It's only an earthquake. We get one a month out here, but don't 
worry -- Mr. Hearst built this building so it can roll over three times!" 
</P>
<P>
 So, you learn to live with earthquakes. You're just happy you don't have to 
learn to die with them as well. Too many people have. 
</P>
<P>
 But until it gets offstage, fades out, retires, presumably to get ready for 
its next tantrum years down the line, it's not possible to care who wins a 
playoff, wins a World Cup, wins a pennant, gets a gold medal, or even hires a 
hitman to see that someone else does. We just wait until its paroxysms of rage 
subside. We just wait until the earth stops moving. How can you feel sorry for 
a football team because it has to play in zero temperature when you see 
children queued up for a glass of water in the cold and discomfort of a public 
park? And for whom the suffering will not be 60 minutes, but maybe six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 An earthquake humbled a World Series in 1989. It's no trick at all for it to 
upstage a playoff. Or any other human endeavor. 
</P>
<P>
 It will not go gentle into that good night. It loiters, lingers, plots, 
unsatiated, unappeased, it's terrible anger at full pitch (4.4 and 5.1 
Wednesday) until its own anger has exhausted it. It is like having an armed 
madman in your back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 But Californians cannot stay despondent long. The surf will be up, the sun 
will be high and hot, the palm trees will sway even with the rats in them and 
L.A. will take alternate routes cheerfully. Even the dark and dire prediction 
of the Caltech mavens (however correct they are) cannot long keep L.A.'s 
spirits down. 
</P>
<P>
 I'll know it's over, I won't need any Caltech seismographs, when I pick up the 
phone and the voice on the other end will be saying "Do you think Montana can 
do it?' And all of a sudden Montana will mean Joe, and not a state we should 
all move to.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI; WHY DID THEY MAKE A FEDERAL CASE OUT 
OF IT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The world, former Marquette Coach Al McGuire once observed, is run by C 
students. Of course, given the continuing fiasco involving the NCAA, the Black 
Coaches Assn., the National Assn. of Basketball Coaches, the university 
presidents, the Justice Department and the Congressional Black Caucus, it 
appears McGuire might have erred on the high side. 
</P>
<P>
 What a collection of strange bedfellows this is. Forget about these people 
being on the same page, most of them aren't even in the same book. 
</P>
<P>
 The thumbnail sketches: 
</P>
<P>
 --The NCAA: Bureaucrat central. An organization composed partly of 
well-meaning professionals who care deeply about college athletics and partly 
of arrogant nimrods who don't have a clue. 
</P>
<P>
 --The NABC: If you own a whistle and can diagram an inbounds play, you can 
join the NABC. Lots of members, lots of position papers, zero clout. In recent 
years the NABC has tried to assert itself, but without much success. It has all 
the bite of an old man who forgot his dentures on the bedside table. 
</P>
<P>
 --The Black Coaches Assn.: Passionate, but clumsy, the BCA has become the new 
power broker. Tired of watching the NABC get nowhere with the NCAA and 
university presidents, the BCA decided to take the initiative, threatened to 
boycott, and look where it got it: involved with the Feds, which is never a 
good thing. 
</P>
<P>
 --The university presidents: The grand poohbahs of college athletics. Some of 
them have actually seen a basketball game, while others think the Atlantic 
Coast Conference is a four-day seminar on seaweed management. They currently 
own a stranglehold on the NCAA cost-containment legislation that counts, 
including the controversial 13-scholarship limit for men's basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 --The Justice Department: A nice place to visit on a Washington field trip, 
but you don't want any of its officials involved in your business. The 
department's Community Relations Service has been designated as the mediator 
and arbitrator between the coaches and NCAA. Good luck. 
</P>
<P>
 --The Congressional Black Caucus: Politicians. Need we say more? A FINE 
MESS--PART II 
</P>
<P>
 Until the Justice Department intervened last weekend, the BCA was set to call 
for a widespread boycott of games. Rudy Washington, the executive director of 
the BCA, described the situation as "nuclear." USC Coach George Raveling, one 
of the BCA's more prominent members, invoked images of slavery. Temple Coach 
John Chaney, another BCA spokesman, accused everyone of not caring about the 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is, no one knew what the issues were. 
</P>
<P>
 Was it the presidents' refusal to restore the number of available scholarships 
from 13 to 14? Was it the alleged betrayal of the coaches by the presidents 
during the recent NCAA convention? Was it the BCA's concerns involving issues 
related to minorities? Was it a question of economics? Was it a question of 
ethics? Of being left out of the decision-making loop? Was it all of the above? 
</P>
<P>
 Even now, nearly a week removed from the planned boycott, there remains an 
obvious lack of unity among the coaches and an equally embarrassing lack of 
understanding and compassion among some NCAA administrators and university 
presidents. 
</P>
<P>
 This from Rhode Island Coach Al Skinner, a BCA member: "When the 14th 
scholarship was not reinstated, you kind of threw your hands up and said, 'What 
else do we have to do in order to be listened to, in order to be taken 
seriously?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The BCA's answer was to essentially ditch the NABC and threaten to boycott 
games. Thus, began the debate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not exactly sure what the (BCA's) tactics are," said St. Joseph's Coach 
John Griffin, whose school helped sponsor the legislation that called for a 
return to 14 scholarships. "I appreciate the calling of the attention to the 
issue. (The threatened boycott) was courageous and somewhat risky. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it may be better if it was a united front with all coaches. Both 
black and white coaches have concerns about minority players." 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line is this: The talk of BCA-sponsored boycotts isn't the result 
of failed legislation concerning the 14th scholarship. The coaches are smarter 
than that--we think. 
</P>
<P>
 For the BCA to walk out because of one fewer scholarship would have been a 
public relations disaster. According to the NCAA, only 122 of 288 Division I 
teams (the NCAA doesn't include Ivy League members) had the then-allowable 14 
scholarship players on their rosters last season. In fact, the national average 
was 12.54. The season before, it was 13.0. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I don't think 14 (scholarship players) is necessary," Louisiana 
State Coach Dale Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, that doesn't stop some coaches (i.e. Louisville's Denny Crum) from 
complaining about not having enough players to conduct practice or overcome 
injuries or illness. Our suggestion: Someone needs to explain to Crum the value 
of walk-ons, America's practice fodder. 
</P>
<P>
 And please, enough with the speeches about how the scholarship reduction 
lessens the number of opportunities for players, especially minority players. 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, since when was an athletic scholarship an inalienable right? 
Second, the reduction wasn't limited to basketball. All Division I men's sports 
underwent a 10% across-the-board cut. Third, statistics show that teams survive 
quite nicely with 13 scholarship players. Fourth, it could have been worse. At 
some schools, scholarships for minor sports were eliminated altogether. Fifth, 
this idea of precious opportunities loses a little steam when you consider how 
many scholarships are given to foreign players. For instance, eight of the nine 
teams in the Atlantic 10 Conference have players from foreign countries. So, if 
a coach has to choose between a star foreign prospect or an inner-city recruit 
of lesser talent, whom do you think he'll pick? 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly. A FINE MESS--PART III 
</P>
<P>
 St. Joseph's Griffin insists that the main issue isn't about money. And he's 
right. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the context of an athletic department budget, one scholarship is a drop in 
a bucket," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski insists that the main issue isn't about race. And 
he's right. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main ingredient in this whole thing is the student-athlete," he said. "We 
need to take care of the student-athlete." 
</P>
<P>
 And if they don't? LSU's Brown made this prediction: "I think someday, and 
this is looking into the crystal ball, it would not surprise me . . . that 
somebody's (going to be) getting ready for a Final Four game, the stadium is 
filled, the television cameras are on and the kids say, 'Hey, it's time we quit 
going under the sham of amateurism. We're not going out until we negotiate.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I think then you're going to see some quick-moving (NCAA) people." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the coaches and the university presidents need to kiss and 
make up. The sooner, the better, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an undercurrent here of a bigger issue," Griffin said. "It's 
unfortunate that it got to that point of who's running college athletics. Let's 
concede that college presidents are running college athletics. Let's agree to 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the whole point of this was to help the college presidents make informed 
decisions. And they interpreted this information in such a personal, kind of 
attacking way, that it degenerated into this Tarzan-like beating of the chest 
and 'We're calling the shots.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Added North Carolina Coach Dean Smith, who offered this suggestion to the 
presidents: "Just talk with the (coaches) like they would in the history 
department. If they had a problem, they'd talk to the faculty people in 
history." 
</P>
<P>
 The coaches--both in the BCA and NABC--thought they had a deal with the 
presidents at the NCAA convention. According to Krzyzewski, the coaches were 
given "an assurance" that the powerful Presidents Commission, which was headed 
by Greg O'Brien, "would look favorably" at reinstating the 14 scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened at the convention," said Krzyzewski, "was that Greg O'Brien 
spoke passionately against the 14 scholarships. So whether a promise was made, 
I doubt that could happen. But an assurance of support was made." 
</P>
<P>
 Or as Kansas Coach Roy Williams said: "They took all the things they wanted 
from us and gave us nothing in return. I think we did our normal bloodbath." A 
FINE MESS--THE FINAL CHAPTER 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, at least a boycott was averted. A boycott would have made for 
great headlines, but like all movements, there would have been a price to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 In all likelihood, it wouldn't have been a unified effort. Worse yet, there 
would have been further division between the BCA and the NABC, as well as the 
coaches and presidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Oklahoma's Billy Tubbs said he wouldn't have joined the boycott. "I'm not 
going to walk off the court and leave my players on the court all alone," he 
said. "I have to fulfill their needs first." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, who knows how many prominent white coaches would have stiffed the 
BCA? UCLA's Jim Harrick sounded relieved that he didn't have to make that 
decision. The same goes for Williams and also Krzyzewski, who later instructed 
his Duke players not to discuss the boycott with reporters. The reason: He 
didn't fully understand the inner workings of the planned action, so how could 
they? 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, that could be posturing. Despite his public proclamations, Tubbs 
supposedly contacted the BCA about joining the organization. And while they 
might do so reluctantly, it wouldn't surprise us if Williams, Krzyzewski, Smith 
and other high-profile white coaches joined a BCA boycott. According to a BCA 
official, that walkout will take place within three weeks if Justice Department 
intervention doesn't produce satisfactory progress with the NCAA and university 
presidents. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a danger to all of this. The boycott repercussions could be swift and 
painful. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you have here is the presidents of the universities run the NCAA," said 
McGuire, who moonlights as a college basketball analyst for CBS. "The NCAA 
works--and this is a utopia I'm talking about--at the convenience of the 
presidents of the universities. So, it becomes the coaches taking on their 
bosses. What are you, crazy? You don't take on your boss. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can take on your boss if you're John (Thompson of Georgetown), if you're 
Mike (Krzyzewski), if you're Dean (Smith)--if you have one word. You know one 
word? Like a real pro, an NBA star: Michael, Larry, Shaq. It's beautiful if 
you're a one-name person. But if you're two names, be careful. Solidarity's 
beautiful at the union hall. It's not too nice at home because you've got to 
pay the rent." 
</P>
<P>
 USC's Raveling would survive the fallout, McGuire said. So would have fellow 
BCA members Nolan Richardson of Arkansas and Chaney of Temple. But what about 
less-established black coaches such as Wyoming's Joby Wright or Air Force's 
Reggie Minton? 
</P>
<P>
 "Raveling, Thompson, Richardson, Chaney . . . they've cleared the trees," 
McGuire said. "But can you imagine Reggie Minton going in and telling the 
general he's going to boycott? They'd send him to Wiesbaden, Germany. They'd 
just move him out." 
</P>
<P>
 Here's hoping it never comes to that. Here's hoping for some A students. The

CSUN ATHLETICS CALLS FOR TIMEOUT TO REGROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge officials have postponed sporting events through Sunday 
to give quake-ravaged athletes an opportunity to regroup. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of our athletes have no place to stay, and to think about athletic 
competition at this time is secondary to our primary concern for their safety," 
Bob Hiegert, the school's athletic director, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the rescheduled events is a men's basketball game Northridge was to play 
Saturday night against No. 21 California in Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously they have some things to think about that are more important than a 
basketball game," said Kevin Reneau, a Cal spokesman. "The anticipation is that 
the coaches will get together and find another mutually agreeable date." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge also postponed swimming and diving meets Friday at USC and Saturday 
at UC Santa Barbara; a men's volleyball match Saturday at Northridge against UC 
San Diego; a track and field all-comers meet at Northridge on Saturday; a 
softball players' and coaches' clinic at Northridge on Saturday, and a baseball 
alumni game Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiegert's announcement was generally supported by most Northridge coaches, but 
baseball Coach Bill Kernen was an exception. 
</P>
<P>
 "Psychologically, one of the best ways to get through this kind of stuff is to 
get back to doing some normal things," said Kernen, whose team is scheduled to 
open Feb. 4 at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. "There's no question there's a need to 
get things together and put things in order, but once that's happened, why stop 
doing things? There's just so much fear you can give in to." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the campus was closed and its entrances roped off, Northridge 
pitchers were working out under Kernen's supervision at Matador Field on 
Wednesday afternoon. Less than a mile away, at Northridge Park, the rest of the 
squad took batting practice on a municipal softball diamond. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's better to be out here trying to do things on a regular basis than to be 
back home worrying and waiting for another (quake) to hit," said Keven Kempton, 
a senior pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Kernen said the team has missed only one day of practice -- on Monday, the day 
the 6.6 quake reduced some residences adjacent to the campus to rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Feb. 4 hits, no one is going to give us a couple of runs because we took 
a week off," Kernen said. "Besides, the safest place in the world to be is in 
the middle of a baseball field. There's nothing that can fall on you. Just the 
sky." 
</P>
<P>
 P.C. Shaw, an assistant coach, said baseball players displaced by the quake 
quickly took up temporary residence with family members, friends and teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Northridge athletes have not been as lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Strametz, the school's track and field coach, said about a dozen members 
of his team spent Tuesday night in a shelter at Granada Hills High. He has been 
unable to reach five athletes and he knows of three others -- sprinter Keisha 
Arnett, hurdler Eleanor Tolson and middle distance runner Dorothy Byron -- who 
sustained minor injuries when they were struck by falling debris. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge's next indoor meet is a Jan. 29 quadrangular event against UC 
Irvine, Southern Utah and Northern Arizona in Flagstaff, Ariz., but even then 
Strametz is not sure he will have a team together. 
</P>
<P>
 John Price, Northridge's volleyball coach, said nine of the 19 members of his 
team lost their homes. A few of the players, he said, might temporarily move in 
to his home in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiegert said school officials will be checking with the NCAA on the legality 
of such arrangements. Dan Dutcher, a director of legislative services for the 
NCAA, said, "Anything that is not beyond relief efforts for the general student 
body is not in violation" of that association's rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Dutcher was not specific, but he did say that if school officials provided 
food and housing for athletes, they must similarly supply other students. 
</P>
<P>
 "If one of my players needs a place to stay, I'm going to find a place for 
him," Price responded. "If they want to fine or suspend me for taking care of 
my athletes, then I'll take that chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Hiegert is scheduled to meet with Northridge coaches today. He said the school 
would announce preliminary plans for the coming weeks by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 On a quick tour of the school's athletic offices, gymnasium and outdoor 
competition surfaces Wednesday morning, Hiegert found less damage than he 
anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 The floor of the gymnasium was littered with debris from fallen lights and a 
toppled air-vent cover, but there did not appear to be crippling damage to the 
playing surface. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Several area junior college and high school basketball games were postponed 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 All Western State Conference men's and women's games were postponed and 
rescheduled for Monday. Games scheduled for Saturday were postponed until Jan. 
31. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this week's City Section events have been postponed as district schools 
remained closed. Wednesday's schedule of boys' and girls' basketball has been 
rescheduled for Feb. 7. Friday's games have been rescheduled for Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, gymnasiums at Chatsworth, Kennedy, Monroe, Reseda, Sylmar and 
Verdugo Hills will not be used for games because of either structural damage or 
because they have been deemed unsafe or because they are being used as 
shelters, City Section Commissioner Barbara Fiege said. 
</P>
<P>
 Boys' and girls' soccer matches scheduled for Wednesday have been rescheduled 
for Jan. 28. Wrestling matches scheduled for this week will be rescheduled on a 
case-by-case basis, Fiege said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Crowley, Southern Section commissioner, issued a statement saying, "When 
and if a cancellation is necessary will be up to the school principals." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Mission League, Crespi's game at Loyola was postponed and rescheduled 
for Saturday at 4 p.m.

A PIAZZA HOLDOUT IN STORE?

 A day after the Dodgers and Mike Piazza met regarding the catcher's 1994 
contract, Piazza did not attend the workout at Dodger Stadium for the first 
time this winter. Even though the workouts are voluntary, Piazza's absence is 
considered an indication that negotiations could lead to a spring-training 
holdout. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Gilbert, Piazza's agent, said both sides are using "different 
comparables." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think Mike wants to set new records or chart new waters with a 
contract, although his numbers entitle him to do it," Gilbert said. 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza batted .318 in 149 games with 35 home runs and 112 runs batted in, and 
was unanimously voted the 1993 National League rookie of the year. The Dodgers 
are using 1992 rookie of the year Eric Karros as a gauge, and have offered 
Piazza a little more than the $435,000 Karros received after his rookie year. 
Karros batted .257 in 149 games with 20 home runs and 88 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gilbert is comparing Piazza to Frank Thomas, the Chicago White Sox first 
baseman who received a multiyear contract worth more than $4 million after 
1991, his first full season. Thomas hit .318 in 158 games with 32 home runs and 
109 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's just say this is all part of the steps this time of year that we need 
to go through," said Fred Claire, Dodger executive vice president. "This is 
part of the structure we are working with, players in the 0-3 year categories. 
This isn't free agency. We are looking for a resolution of a salary. I hope we 
can do it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers have the option of renewing Piazza's salary at $126,000 if the 
sides do not come to an agreement by early spring training. Piazza's only 
option would be to hold out.

NO NEW COMMISSIONER NAMED AS OWNERS BLAME LABOR TALKS; BASEBALL: SELIG AGREES 
TO REMAIN INTERIM CHIEF THROUGH PLAYER NEGOTIATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Gearing up for a salary cap war with the players union, baseball's owners 
postponed action on a new commissioner Wednesday and influenced Bud Selig to 
remain as titular boss through duration of the labor negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 They also consolidated the power of chief negotiator Richard Ravitch and 
adopted a voting procedure that seems to strengthen Ravitch's hand and reduce 
the impact of any potential splintering among the owners during the talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodger President Peter O'Malley was disappointed with the decision to delay 
selection of a commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's time to get an outside, independent person," he said from Los 
Angeles, unable to travel because of the earthquake and represented in Ft. 
Lauderdale by finance directors Bob Graziano and Bill Foltz. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are other (important) issues besides the labor negotiations. The labor 
negotiations could take 12 months, and I think it's a mistake to go another 12 
months (without a commissioner). 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, there's a lot of emotion at those meetings and maybe in another 30 
days there'll be a fresh outlook." 
</P>
<P>
 Selig said he has encouraged owners to continue discussing the commissioner's 
vacancy. 
</P>
<P>
 "In no way shape or form do I want to be commissioner or will I be," he said, 
having ostensibly filled the role for 17 months as chairman of the executive 
council. 
</P>
<P>
 Selig had promised Congressional leaders considering repeal of baseball's 
antitrust exemption that a commissioner would be elected in January. 
</P>
<P>
 He agreed to stay through the labor talks, he said, because "people have a 
right to change their minds as events unfold and it became increasingly clear 
that a large number of owners were not ready to elect a commissioner" with the 
industry continuing to face assorted problems. 
</P>
<P>
 That explanation did not sit well with Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D.-Ohio), whose 
judiciary subcommittee has held hearings into the exemption and may hold more. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball owners are demonstrating that they don't want any check on their 
unlimited power," Metzenbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
 Search committee chairman Bill Bartholmay, chairman of the Atlanta Braves, 
said it was simply apparent that no candidate could get the needed 21 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid skepticism, he said his committee was prepared to make a recommendation 
but didn't after receiving a memorandum from 11 clubs saying they would not 
vote for a new commissioner until the labor issue was resolved. He said another 
five or six clubs signed it after he received it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The obvious sentiment is that we are best served by continuity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is believed his list was down to two: Arnold Weber, retiring president of 
Northwestern, and Harvey Schiller, executive director of the U.S. Olympic 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The next commissioner will have full authority over labor negotiations, Selig 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ravitch, meanwhile, insisted that he had not voiced an opinion on hiring a new 
commissioner, but it is known he strongly opposed it, fearing the meddling of a 
third party in labor talks. 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility of another mid-negotiations cave in was further diluted when 
Ravitch convinced owners to change the procedure by which they approve labor 
agreements or end a work stoppage. 
</P>
<P>
 Only majority approval was needed in the past. Now three fourths or 21 votes 
are required, underscoring a broader commitment by the owners to get what they 
want from a union that rejected a salary cap in 1990 and doesn't seem to have 
changed its thinking.

REALIGNMENT, NEW PLAYOFFS BECOME OFFICIAL IN BASEBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Realignment of the American and National leagues into three divisions each and 
adoption of an extra playoff round for 1994 became a reality Wednesday when 
owners accepted a union proposal on player compensation during the new 
five-game playoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Call it a goodwill gesture by the owners in preparation for the difficult 
attempt to get the players to agree to a salary cap in the impending collective 
bargaining negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was not the occasion for hard bargaining over a relatively small amount 
of money," Richard Ravitch, the owners' chief negotiator, said of the decision 
to accept the union proposal. "It's a time to be collegial and show we can 
reach agreement without a lot of acrimony." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Don Fehr, executive director of the union: "Dick can characterize it any 
way he wants. I'm just happy to have it resolved." 
</P>
<P>
 The players will receive 80% of the gate from the first three games of the new 
playoff round, about $9.6 million based on a $20 ticket, Ravitch said. They 
will continue to receive 60% of the gate from the first four games of the 
league championship series and World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 Since their new TV agreement calls for the owners to be paid on a per-game 
basis during the postseason, rather than receiving a lump sum, the players had 
hoped to be paid on the same basis but offered the higher percentage -- 80 
compared to 60 -- as an alternative, Fehr said. 
</P>
<P>
 The union also hoped to have the whole postseason pool renegotiated, but the 
owners elected to negotiate only the new round, he said. The agreement is for 
one year and will be renegotiated if the owners stay with the new alignment in 
1995. ROSS NEWHAN

INJURED LAKER PEELER OUT AT LEAST A MONTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Lakers, losers of 16 of their last 20 games and already without two key 
players, got more bad news Wednesday when tests showed that starting guard 
Anthony Peeler has a stress fracture in his lower left leg. It will sideline 
him for at least a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Peeler is expected to be put on the injured list in the next day or two, and 
the Lakers hope to sign someone to fill his spot on the roster. If that doesn't 
happen today, they will have only nine players for tonight's game against the 
Phoenix Suns at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Bowie is already on the injured list after undergoing arthroscopic surgery 
on his left knee Jan. 5 and is expected to be out at least four more weeks. 
Doug Christie, the starting small forward and the Lakers' leading scorer, has 
missed the last three games because of a sprained left ankle and will probably 
miss at least three more. Antonio Harvey will be sidelined another week or so 
because of a strained hip muscle. Neither Christie nor Harvey is on the injured 
list. 
</P>
<P>
 This will be Peeler's second stint on the injured list this season. He sat out 
the first five games of the season because of tendinitis in his right knee 
before returning to become the Lakers' second-leading scorer. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, he sat out the 103-88 loss at Seattle with what was believed to be 
shin splints. Upon further examination, a stress fracture of the fibula was 
discovered.

CIF COMMITTEE PLANS INCLUDE O.C. SECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first step toward the reconfiguration of California's high school athletic 
sections will be presented to the State Federated Council at its May meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 A CIF planning committee has devised three plans, according to committee 
member Jim Fleming, the superintendent of Placentia Unified School District. 
The plans, two of which include a separate Orange County section, call for 
regrouping the state's 10 sections. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will be asked for input but will not act on the plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are only some options," Fleming said. "Basically, it's a starting point 
for discussion." 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature renewed the CIF's authority over high school sports last year, 
but also required that it develop an overall strategy and implement it before 
1996.  
</P>
<P>
 Ideally, Fleming said, the plans would create sections that have no fewer than 
75 schools and no more than 300. The Southern Section, the state's largest, has 
489 schools. The Oakland Section is the smallest with six schools. 
</P>
<P>
 All three plans would eliminate the three city sections: Oakland, San 
Francisco (12 schools) and Los Angeles (49 schools). 
</P>
<P>
 The first option would create eight sections, including an Orange County 
section. Its main drawback is transportation; as distances and travel time 
could be increased in some areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you look at a map you don't know if there are mountains in the way," 
Fleming said. "There are schools in the Central Valley that can't get to the 
coast easily, so it's not simple." 
</P>
<P>
 The second option would create nine sections, including an Orange County 
section. Transportation problems would be decreased, but the Los 
Angeles/Coastal configuration would have 321 schools. The next largest section 
would have 161 schools. 
</P>
<P>
 A third option would be more drastic, with the state divided into four 
regions. Orange County schools would be in a region with schools from San 
Bernardino, Riverside, San Diego and Imperial counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Each region would be divided into conferences, headed by an assistant 
commissioner. The assistant commissioners would work under a regional 
commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 The reconfiguration, which will be phased in and is expected to be completed 
by the year 2000, would create a centralized governing system, with a Federated 
Council and State CIF assuming greater authority than they currently have. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each area would have control over its own destiny," Fleming said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Orange County officials said they are against the four-region plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of talk about the State CIF having more influence," said Ed 
Seal, superintendent of the Brea-Olinda Unified School District. "There's pros 
and cons to that. It would give the state more consistency, but take away some 
of the individual creativeness." 
</P>
<P>
 Seal said county officials will continue to develop their own section, with a 
target date of the 1995-96 school year. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee created to develop a section presented a rough draft to 
principals and superintendents in December. The plan calls for dues of 29 cents 
per student. The Southern Section charges 23 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan also includes $100,000 in corporate support the first year. Seal said 
no corporations have been approached because county officials agreed to wait 
until the CIF had secured its corporate financing. 
</P>
<P>
 The county section would have weighted voting. Schools that fielded 12 or more 
sports would have two votes. Schools that fielded fewer than 12 would have one. 
</P>
<P>
 Seal said an Orange County section proposal would be presented to the State 
Federated Council at the May meeting. A follow-up presentation would be made at 
the October meeting. If there are no problems, the plan would then be taken to 
the State Section Relations Committee for approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Seal said if the State CIF adopts a reconfiguration plan that included an 
Orange County Section, county officials would push back their start-up date to 
1996. But if a state plan is adopted that doesn't include an Orange County 
section, a county official who asked not to be identified said the county might 
secede from the State CIF. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather not talk about that," Seal said. "I don't want it to look like 
we're holding a gun to anyone's head. It's more prudent to cross that bridge 
when we come to it."

THOROUGHBRED RACING / BILL CHRISTINE; BUYING PIMLICO BRINGS HISTORY OF 
CHARACTER(S) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What Hollywood Park is getting from its imminent purchase of Pimlico Race 
Course is a track that throws a blanket of painted daisies over the Preakness 
winner every year, and calls them black-eyed Susans. The Maryland state flower, 
you see, is not in season in May. But everything else about the people of 
Pimlico and Baltimore is genuine. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1970s, I was at the races at Delaware Park with Herman Cohen, who 
then owned Pimlico with his brother Ben. 
</P>
<P>
 Herman Cohen, in his 80s, was an intrepid handicapper, and midway through the 
afternoon, he gave me a horse to bet. 
</P>
<P>
 "How much do you like him?" I foolishly asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Young man," Cohen said, "if I ever liked a horse that much, I'd only have to 
make one bet, lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
 Late in life, widower Cohen remarried. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're looking for a house near a school," said Chick Lang, who worked as 
general manager for the Cohen brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 One day Lang and I were watching ABC's "Wide World of Sports" when the show 
opened with footage of a skier almost breaking his neck and an auto racer being 
flipped in the air after hitting the wall at a speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reminds me of Herman Cohen, parking his car," Lang said. 
</P>
<P>
 One year at the Preakness, Ben Cohen was the victim of a pickpocket. It might 
have been the same year that someone stole the purse of the wife of Lynn Stone, 
the president of Churchill Downs, from a table in the Pimlico turf club. This 
was definitely a big year for thieves at Pimlico. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen sloughed off his losses. "I'm a millionaire," he said. "Before Sonny 
Hine started training my horses, I was worth about five million." 
</P>
<P>
 After a musician named Percy Barry died in 1944, his ashes were scattered 
across Pimlico's racing strip. That practice was repeated by dozens of 
families, and in 1950, Willie Doyle, the winning jockey aboard Effendi in the 
1909 Preakness, had his ashes spread across the the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1959, Pimlico reconfigured the track and the finish marker was moved 220 
feet down the stretch. Not long afterward, Lang's phone rang. It was Doyle's 
widow, asking that her husband's ashes be moved to the new line. Lang didn't 
flinch. Pimlico held a second service in honor of Doyle. 
</P>
<P>
 For many years, Pimlico's publicity director was Sam Siciliano. He was 
accustomed to seeing female turf writers in the press box and was certain he 
could spot a phony who didn't belong. 
</P>
<P>
 "Big hats," Siciliano would say. "You see a woman up here with a big hat, and 
you can bet that she isn't working." 
</P>
<P>
 I guess Siciliano would have barred Hedda Hopper from the Pimlico press box. 
</P>
<P>
 Lang once gave me a tape of Clem McCarthy's thrilling radio broadcast of the 
1938 match race at Pimlico, when jockey George Woolf outfoxed Charlie 
Kurtsinger as Seabiscuit beat War Admiral. Nine years later, McCarthy's 
Preakness call was not nearly as flawless. The infield crowd had been allowed 
to stand atop the starting gate after the race began, and when the horses 
reached the far turn, McCarthy's view was briefly blocked while Faultless and 
Jet Pilot changed positions. Their jockeys wore similar colors, and instead of 
Faultless, McCarthy called Jet Pilot on the lead all the way through the 
stretch. Faultless was the winner, and McCarthy didn't correct himself until 
after the race. 
</P>
<P>
 McCarthy recovered nicely. He had remembered that Bill Stern, doing a college 
football game on radio the year before, made up for having the wrong 
ball-carrier on a long touchdown run by saying that there was a lateral to the 
correct runner just before the goal line. "How do you lateral a race horse?" 
McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
 King Leatherbury, a Baltimore native who has won more than 30 seasonal 
training titles in Maryland, mostly with claiming horses, has been to the 
Kentucky Derby only once, with I Am the Game in 1985. Leatherbury heard about 
an odd press-box Derby pool and wanted to get in. The idea was to pick the last 
three finishers in the race, in order. Leatherbury was told that he could play, 
but because of ethical considerations, he wouldn't be allowed to include I Am 
the Game in his selections. 
</P>
<P>
 Leatherbury didn't win the pool and didn't have any luck in the race, either. 
I Am the Game finished last. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, after Codex won the Preakness, the owners of the filly he beat, 
Genuine Risk, appealed the outcome to the Maryland Racing Commission, which 
validated the finish after a three-day hearing. Some of the testimony seemed 
superfluous, but all of the witnesses were allowed to say what they felt they 
had to say. One of the Pimlico stewards spent 10 minutes explaining how he had 
bought his binoculars at a war-surplus store. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of the Preakness winner used to keep the Woodlawn Vase for a year. 
The three-foot-high, 29-pound vase, recently appraised at $1 million, was 
designed by Tiffany and Co. in 1860. In 1953, after Native Dancer won the 
Preakness, Pimlico shipped the vase to Alfred G. Vanderbilt's Long Island home 
at Oyster Bay, N.Y. Vanderbilt, a former president of Pimlico, didn't want the 
responsibility of caring for the trophy, so he sent it back. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the winning owner of the Preakness has received a Woodlawn 
replica, which is about half the size and costs $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The original vase has survived two fires, 72 years apart. Hollywood Park 
shareholders should be safe for a while. At that rate, the next fire at Pimlico 
won't be until the year 2038. 
</P>

<P>
 Best Pal, the high weight at 122 pounds, is expected to run Saturday in the 
$150,000 San Pasqual Handicap at Santa Anita. Other probables for the 1 
1/16-mile race are Ibero (119 pounds), Johann Quatz (118), Star Recruit (117), 
Lottery Winner (116) and Hill Pass (113). . . . Gary Jones, Best Pal's trainer, 
has recently returned from a 30-day suspension. . . . Best Pal was unable to 
add to his $4.7-million purse total, running 10th in the Breeders' Cup Classic 
in November. . . . In another stake on Saturday's card, Duca, who is Brocco's 
stablemate, is expected to run in the $75,000 Santa Catalina Stakes for 
3-year-olds. . . . Alex Solis, the meet's leading jockey with 20 victories, was 
on three winners Wednesday, including Waitryst in the feature. . . . David 
Sofro, who owned Interco, winner of the 1984 Santa Anita Handicap, died in his 
sleep Monday at his Glendale home. Sofro was 81. . . . "It will be a long 
process," trainer Wayne Lukas said of his son and chief assistant, Jeff, who 
continues to undergo treatment at Huntington Memorial Hosptial. Jeff Lukas, 36, 
suffered multiple skull fractures when he tried to stop a loose horse at his 
father's barn on Dec. 15 and was in a coma until last week. The horse, Tabasco 
Cat, is a candidate for Saturday's El Camino Real Derby at Bay Meadows.

 Ralphs supermarkets -- A story in Tuesday's editions about shortages of vital 
goods after Monday's earthquake incorrectly reported that a Ralphs store in 
Northridge sold a 2.5-gallon container of drinking water for $2, while a Ralphs 
in Granada Hills sold the same size container for $5. The grocery chain said $5 
was the price paid for a box containing two 2.5-gallon jugs. Ralphs said the 
two stores, which were damaged in the quake, were open only to sell emergency 
items as a service to the community.

 New judges -- A Jan. 11 article on new judges said that according to Justice 
Department officials, Judge Martha A. Vasquez of New Mexico was the first 
Mexican-American woman appointed to the federal bench. In fact, U.S. District 
Judge Irma E. Gonzalez, whose parents were both Mexican, was appointed by 
President George Bush and sits on the federal bench in San Diego.
