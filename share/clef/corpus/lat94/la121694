CLINTON OFFERS TAX CUT PLAN FOR MIDDLE CLASS; PRESIDENCY: HE CALLS FOR PACKAGE 
OF CHILD CREDITS AND SCHOOL-AID DEDUCTIONS BUT LEAVES OUT MEANS TO FINANCE IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 President Clinton, in an effort to reclaim the allegiance of middle-income 
voters, proposed a series of personal tax cuts Thursday but did not offer a 
detailed plan to pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's middle-class tax cuts include a $500-per-child tax credit for 
children under the age of 13 and tax deductions for as much as $10,000 a year 
in post-high school education costs. 
</P>
<P>
 He also proposed a more liberal individual retirement account savings program 
and consolidating all of the government's job training programs into a single 
plan that would provide training vouchers for those who lost their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 All the tax proposals, in what Clinton called his "middle-class bill of 
rights" would take effect Jan. 1, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 In an 11-minute address from the Oval Office, Clinton expressed sympathy for 
the millions of Americans who have not benefited from the current economic 
recovery and are "hurting, frustrated, disappointed, even angry." 
</P>
<P>
 However, since Clinton did not outline hard choices on spending cuts to 
compensate for the revenue loss that would result from the tax cuts, he is in 
the position of underbidding the Republicans on the size of his tax cuts 
without being able to claim that he is any more responsible than the opposition 
in holding down the federal budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 The major competing GOP plan, the House Republicans' "contract with America," 
calls for a $500-per-child tax credit for all dependent children, not just 
those under 13. Families with incomes of as much as $200,000 a year would 
qualify for the Republican tax credit, compared with a $75,000 income ceiling 
under Clinton's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton estimated that his plan would cost about $60 billion in lost revenue 
over its first five years. House Republicans have estimated that the five-year 
cost of their plan, which also includes a capital gains tax cut, would be $147 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Clinton had promised explicitly not to propose a tax cut that would 
increase the federal deficit, he offered only vague promises of future spending 
cuts as the means to finance the bulk of his tax package -- something that he 
has accused the Republicans of doing. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, Clinton called for these tax cuts: 
</P>
<P>
 * A $500 credit for each child under the age of 13 for all families with 
incomes of $60,000 or less. Families with incomes between $60,000 and $75,000 
would be entitled to a reduced credit. Families with more income would get 
none. 
</P>
<P>
 * A provision that would allow families with annual incomes of up to $100,000 
to deduct $10,000 in college tuition expenses from their taxable income each 
year. Families with incomes between $100,000 and $120,000 could take a smaller 
deduction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just as we made mortgage interest income deductible because we want people to 
own homes, we should make college tuition deductible because we want people to 
go to college," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 * An IRA deduction of $4,000 ($2,000 for a single taxpayer) for all couples 
with incomes up to $80,000. Couples earning up to $100,000 could take smaller 
deductions. Taxpayers would be permitted to withdraw IRA funds without penalty 
not only for retirement but also for education, catastrophic illnesses, the 
purchase of a first home or the care of an elderly parent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though the economic statistics are moving up, most of our living 
standards aren't," Clinton said in his brief talk. "It's almost as if some 
Americans are being punished for their productivity in this new economy. We 
have got to change that. More jobs aren't enough. We have to raise incomes." 
</P>
<P>
 Accordingly, the President said, he was proposing a "middle-class bill of 
rights" to provide tax relief and federal assistance for education and job 
training. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Republican response to the Clinton speech, newly elected Sen. Fred 
Thompson of Tennessee mocked Clinton for having said before the November 
election that tax cuts were unjustified and irresponsible. 
</P>
<P>
 "From what we heard tonight, the President's vision for the future now looks a 
lot like what Republicans just campaigned for," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We welcome the President to help us lead America in a new direction, but if 
he will not, we will welcome the President to follow -- because we are moving 
ahead," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said that the money to compensate for the tax cut 
would come from streamlining five government agencies and from extending a 
freeze on "discretionary" spending for two additional years, 1999 and 2000. The 
agency consolidations would provide about $24 billion over five years, while 
Clinton claimed that the extension of the discretionary cap would bring in $52 
billion in savings in 1999 and 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Aides said that the $16 billion in excess savings would be used to reduce the 
federal budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite earlier discussions about reductions in spending for Medicare, Clinton 
said emphatically that the federal health care program for the elderly would 
not be touched. 
</P>
<P>
 Discretionary spending is a broad category that covers programs from defense 
spending to highway construction that can easily be adjusted, year by year. It 
excludes programs, including Social Security and welfare, that entitle certain 
individuals to federal benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials acknowledged that calling for a discretionary 
spending cap falls short of proposing specific spending cuts to comply with 
that cap. In effect, Clinton was saying that he would propose a lower level of 
overall discretionary spending in future years -- and would decide how to 
reduce that spending in those years. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, the spending reductions would not go into effect until three 
years after the tax cut first kicked in -- and in the final two years of a 
second Clinton term in office. 
</P>
<P>
 In his bid to save $24 billion by consolidating and streamlining agencies, 
Clinton would not eliminate any departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, he has ordered a "major restructuring" at the departments of Energy, 
Transportation and Housing and Urban Development. The General Services 
Administration and the Office of Personnel Management also would be subject to 
sizable cuts, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The President also would turn over to private industry the air traffic control 
system run by the Federal Aviation Administration and the Energy Department's 
emergency petroleum reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Clinton would consolidate roughly $12 billion in job training 
programs administered by the Labor Department into a single program that would 
funnel grants of $2,000 to $3,000 to those who had lost their jobs or wanted to 
change careers. They could then spend the money on a broad array of programs 
without having to deal with a federal or local bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Some senior Administration officials conceded privately that they were 
"uncomfortable" with the President's proposal. Some said that they see 
potential damage from the proposal to the Administration's credibility on 
deficit reduction. 
</P>
<P>
 White House Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta repeatedly has argued that the GOP 
approach to paying for the "contract with America" tax cut proposal -- a cap on 
spending for entitlement programs coupled with a constitutional amendment 
requiring a balanced federal budget -- represented "policy gimmicks" because 
cuts were not specified to comply with their spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as last Sunday, Clinton promised to avoid such budgetary sleight 
of hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I intend to propose (a middle-class tax cut) as long as I can pay for it," 
Clinton said Sunday in his last public appearance, a press conference at the 
close of the hemispheric summit in Miami. "I do not want to see this deficit 
start going up again." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposals were the product of weeks of furious debate within the 
Administration over how to respond to the shellacking that the Democrats took 
in the November elections and how to make viable the remainder of the 
President's term in office. 
</P>
<P>
 Beset by rambunctious Republicans, mutinous Democrats and a wary public, 
Clinton concluded that he must offer some sort of tax relief to beleaguered 
middle-class families and try in other ways to address their economic anxiety 
and political alienation. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and his advisers were scrambling all day Thursday to make major, 
last-minute changes in the shape of their tax plan, apparently to position the 
President's package in between the Republican alternative and a third proposal 
from Rep. Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), who will be House minority leader in the 
next Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Clinton unveiled a plan that was slightly different from one his 
aides had discussed as recently as Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours before Clinton spoke on national television, Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) 
offered his own proposal for a tax cut, calling for an immediate doubling of 
the income tax exemption for children from $2,500 to $5,000 per child. 
</P>
<P>
 Gramm, an all-but-declared candidate for the 1996 Republican presidential 
nomination, said that he would compensate for the $124-billion tax cut with a 
like amount of spending cuts over five years. The reductions would come from 
the discretionary budgets of the departments of Health and Human Services, 
Energy, Education, Labor, Transportation and Housing and Urban Development, 
amounting to a 16%-budget reduction across the board. 
</P>
<P>
 If enacted, he said, the tax cut would "dramatically" reverse what he called a 
40-year trend in which the federal government "has spent more and more of the 
income of working American families." 
</P>
<P>
 Gramm said dismissively of the President: "I am glad that the President is 
beginning to at least hum along as we sing our song of less government and more 
freedom. . . . (But) the President is more than a day late and more than a 
dollar short." 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the stampede to enact tax cuts came a lonely voice of dissent. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Russell D. Feingold (D-Wis.) deplored the "bidding war" that seemed to 
have developed at the White House and on Capitol Hill. "This rush . . . to put 
new tax cut proposals on the table is going to take the focus off of deficit 
reduction and the result is going to be that we will be heading, again, in the 
wrong direction on getting the federal budget back into balance," Feingold 
said.

3 MERRILL LYNCH BROKERS LED INVESTMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A trio of wealthy Merrill Lynch bond brokers, operating out of a pink marble 
office tower in the heart of this city's upscale financial district, became 
Orange County's main conduit for high-risk investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron was self-assured and 
outspoken in his investment strategy, but Merrill Lynch's team was ready to 
back Citron's every instinct and earn multimillion-dollar fees in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 The team was lead by the savvy but hard-edged Michael Gus Stamenson, 54, a 
silver-haired former Marine with a taste for expensive antiques, old wine and 
fine cars. 
</P>
<P>
 With his two junior partners, Debra Harris and Duane Canaga, the trio were 
known throughout California's local treasurers offices and local finance 
agencies. When treasurers associations would meet, Stamenson would impress the 
groups with his sophisticated Wall Street views. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the treasurers had an inflated view of the Merrill brokers' business 
acumen, however. Canaga came to the firm after his construction business was 
forced into bankruptcy in 1985. He also flunked one of his brokerage exams in 
1991, company records show, although he passed the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 All three brokers declined to comment, but a Merrill Lynch spokesman said all 
remain employees in good standing. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill's San Francisco office came to dominate the lucrative field of 
brokering and underwriting securities for local government agencies over the 
last decade. The influence they wielded would be hard to minimize.  
</P>
<P>
 Merrill Lynch officials, for example, supported Orange County's disastrous 
investments that bet on a decline in interest rates this year, supplying Citron 
with company reports that projected rates would drop. The majority of Wall 
Street economists had an opposite view. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill Lynch is the subject of federal and state investigations into whether 
its brokers properly marketed high-risk securities to Orange County. Stamenson, 
Harris and Canaga were named in subpoenas for records served Wednesday by the 
federal Securities and Exchange Commission on members of the Orange County 
Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The subpoenas are seeking a lengthy list of official and personal records amid 
allegations that Merrill Lynch's influence in Orange County was abetted by 
personal gratuities and gifts that found their way to government officials, 
according to sources close to the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Stamenson could charm and intimidate those he touched: Neighbors describe him 
as gracious, but a local building contractor, Paul Barendregt, who worked on 
Stamenson's $1.1-million home, says he is a "little bit of a Napolean (in) his 
height and his attitude toward people." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Stamenson, 54, demonstrated just how tough he could be in 1988 when 
be bared fists with a lobbyist and walked away with a bloody nose, he also has 
a capacity to ingratiate. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came over the very first day we moved in to say hello, very casual and 
friendly," said Mary Ann Tataseo, his next-door neighbor of several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Stamenson invited Tataseo to his annual Christmas bash, where he has hosted 
more than 100 guests in past years at his 13,000-square-foot mansion with a 
water fountain in the front yard and a late-model Mercedes in the driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris, 39, and Canaga, 51, also appear to be well-rewarded for their work. 
Harris, who has worked at Merrill for 14 years, lives in a $1.2-million home in 
the San Francisco suburb of Lafayette, according to property tax records. 
</P>
<P>
 Canaga owns a $368,500 condo in a hilly section of San Francisco. Canaga's 
construction business went bust after a partner in a project ran into financial 
difficulties, according to National Assn. of Securities Dealers records. Asked 
for comment, Canaga hung up on a reporter Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The trio of brokers was able to cement a trusted relationship with government 
employees. Even today, treasurers in such counties as Monterey and Contra Costa 
continue to vouch for Stamenson, Harris and Canaga, saying the Merrill team has 
gotten a bum rap and that the leveraged investment strategies they sold in 
Orange County and around the state should not be outlawed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not some flaky firm from Texas or Arkansas," Monterey County 
Treasurer-Tax Collector Louis Solton said. "I am comfortable with Merrill. I 
would have to be compelled to deal with another investment house. They have a 
reputation, as a firm, that precedes them." 
</P>
<P>
 Monterey has a $237-million pool of derivative securities, brokered 
exclusively by Harris. Solton said that Harris shares a mutual understanding 
with him about the county's investment view -- which is that derivative trading 
is a low-risk, high-return strategy despite Orange County's disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonoma County Treasurer Don Merz said his dealings with Stamenson and his 
staff for 14 years have left him believing that they are getting a bum rap in 
the Orange County disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of Mike's presentations were on the pitfalls in terms of investment 
practices," Merz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The loyalties between the Merrill brokers and their clients went remarkably 
far. An audit in Orange County disclosed that Citron bought and sold securities 
in 1991 to help Merrill Lynch meet certain federal requirements on its 
finances. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, all three brokers contributed to Citron's election campaign this 
year, in which he defeated a Republican candidate who charged that Citron had 
mishandled county investments. 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt Merrill's brokers valued their close relationship with the 
treasurers. Orange County's business with Merrill Lynch generated millions of 
dollars of fees and commissions annually. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, Stamenson, the son of a Greek immigrant, became a very wealthy 
man. Stamenson earned $769,000 in 1991, according to a divorce filing by his 
former wife, and industry sources say that his earnings rose sharply in 1992 
and 1993 -- possibly as high as several million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, according to property tax records, Stamenson paid off the 
$937,000 mortgage loan on his home, a brick Tudor on the most prestigious 
street in the wealthiest gated section of the affluent East Bay suburb of 
Moraga. 
</P>
<P>
 When a reporter knocked on the home's massive oak doors earlier this week, 
Stamenson's wife peered from a crack in the door and said the couple would have 
nothing to say about the Orange County investment crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Stamenson's wife listed her occupation on their marriage certificate as a 
restaurant hostess. They were married after a messy divorce from his wife of 24 
years. In the settlement, Stamenson kept the couple's mansion, along with 
antiques, a wine collection and a boat. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Lomeli, Contra Costa County treasurer, acknowledges that Stamenson has 
money, but he "never rubs it in your face." Lomeli invited Stamenson to his 
wedding and attended Stamenson's wedding. 
</P>
<P>
 As Orange County fell deeper into financial trouble, Citron made ever riskier 
bets structured by Merrill Lynch and other brokers. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC and the California Department of Corporations are investigating 
whether Merrill Lynch and Stamenson violated their duties to sell investments 
with risk that is appropriate for taxpayers' money. 
</P>
<P>
 One November trade has attracted particular interest. Merrill underwrote a 
10-year note issued by the Student Loan Marketing Assn., or Sally Mae. Merrill 
sold the entire $600-million issue to Orange County at a price of $100.628 for 
each $100 face value of the notes.  
</P>
<P>
 But the same day, Bloomberg financial service assessed the value of the notes 
at $96.897 for each $100 face value, suggesting that Citron paid too much for 
the securities. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal netted Merrill fees and profits of $2 million to $6 million, 
according to bond experts and financial advisers who have said the trade was 
among the most unusual that Citron made. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill Lynch officials say that Citron and others were sophisticated 
investors, well aware of the risks. 
</P>
<P>
 But that is the same losing argument that Merrill Lynch and other brokerages 
used in a suit brought by San Jose after that firm sustained a $60-million loss 
in 1984, according to the city's attorneys who now represent Orange County 
bondholders. Citron's attorney David Wiechert said: "As treasurer for the 
county of Orange, Robert Citron relied on the advice of securities 
professionals in making investment decisions, none more so than representatives 
of Merrill Lynch. The suggestions . . . that Mr. Citron was on some uncounseled 
frolic and detour or that he had the same level of expertise as his financial 
advisers is mere sophistry." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Alan Bromberg, a professor of securities law at Southern Methodist 
University in Texas, said: "Everybody who sues claims they are unsophisticated 
and everybody claims that investments are unsuitable. That may succeed in some 
of the exotic securities, but it is almost impossible to prove on the general 
issue of over-leveraging." 
</P>
<P>
 Citron took out short-term loans and invested those funds in long-term 
securities, which meant he was betting that interest rates would stay level or 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill Lynch brokers provided reports that lent at least some comfort to 
Citron in laying those bets. The firm provided one investment report that 
proclaimed, "The . . . case for lower rates is intact, even with a recovery." 
</P>
<P>
 But in that same time period the majority of economists were warning that 
rates would head upward, though almost all economists failed to predict the 
steepness of the increases.

 PAY UP: More than 12,000 Ventura County residents neglected to file state 
income tax returns for 1993. . . . You know who you are. . . . But just in case 
you don't, the state Franchise Tax Board in January will mail "friendly 
reminders" to you and more than 600,000 other residents across the state who 
failed to file. Tardy taxpayers will be given 30 days to fork over any amount 
owed or face fees and a minimum penalty of $114. . . . Or, they should send a 
letter to the state explaining why they don't have to file.

 PINK DEATH?: It's been a trusty heartburn remedy for years. . . . Now, 
Pepto-Bismol may be useful on an entirely different front: in the war against 
the Medfly. Scientists have concocted a spray, made from a dye found in the 
bright pink liquid, that zaps the insects dead (A3). The spray could eventually 
replace malathion, a pesticide being doused on Camarillo in the effort to wipe 
out a Medfly infestation. . . . Malathion opponents are tickled pink. "We're 
delighted by the whole idea," said Leonard Mehlmauer of GASP, or Group Against 
Spraying People.

 AMGEN ARRESTS: Two men have been charged in a Boston industrial-espionage case 
involving Epogen, a genetically engineered drug produced by Amgen Inc., the 
Thousand Oaks-based biotechnology giant (D2). . . . The men allegedly tried to 
sell the drug, which stimulates production of red blood cells and is widely 
used by kidney dialysis and AIDS patients, to an FBI agent posing as a Russian 
government official.

 LIGHTING THE WAY: If a police car with its headlights on pulls up behind you

Authorities across the county are taking part in "Lights On for Life." The 
annual observance honors people killed or injured in drug- and alcohol-related 
accidents -- and aims to caution drinkers not to get behind the wheel. Drunk 
drivers are "always a problem" during the holidays, the California Highway 
Patrol said. Tax Bite

DEMOCRACIES FACE THREATS TO FREEDOM; HUMAN RIGHTS: GROUP WARNS OF RISKS FROM

 Although world changes in 1994 have contributed to a record 114 democracies, 
many of those societies face critical threats from ethnic tensions, runaway 
corruption, excessive powers of the military or destabilization from abroad, 
says a Freedom House report released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many democracies face serious challenges to their stability and are incapable 
of guaranteeing the basic rights of their citizens," warned Adrian Karatnycky, 
president of Freedom House, a nonpartisan, nonprofit human rights group based 
in New York.

 Its annual survey of the world's 191 countries is the only respected, 
independent survey rating freedom worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Among key examples cited in the report are Russia and Ukraine, world players 
undergoing "wrenching transitions." 
</P>
<P>
 Both are only partly free because of the absence of effective civic 
institutions, a truly free press or an independent judiciary, the report says. 
Russia also "now threatens some neighbors and colludes in efforts to topple 
certain indigenous authorities," it asserts. Both countries risk serious 
regression. 
</P>
<P>
 They are among 38 of 114 formal democracies that are not fully free, Freedom 
House's rating system shows. It divides all 191 countries into three 
categories: free; partly free or lacking some human rights or civil liberties; 
not free and lacking most or all rights and liberties. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, major democracies such as India and Turkey, as well as some new 
African democracies, have witnessed a "substantial" erosion of liberties 
because of ethnic and inter-sectarian strife. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Latin American democracies -- including Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela -- 
now face debilitating problems from chronic corruption and influential drug 
cartels. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnia-Herzegovina is the only formal democracy rated not free, because of its 
inability to provide civil order as it copes with ethnic strife and external 
destabilization. 
</P>
<P>
 Freedom, the report concludes, "continues to elude the vast majority of the 
world's people, with nearly 80% living in partly free and not free states." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the world's 191 states, 54 are without civil liberties and human rights -- 
compared to 61 that have varying but limited degrees of freedom and 76 rated as 
fully free. Being a democracy does not mean that a country is fully free. And 
non-democratic states can have some freedoms, such as free markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey also issued warnings about future world flash points. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rwanda's ethnic holocaust provided the archetypal nightmare that could occur 
elsewhere," it says. Somalia, where clan warfare rages on, faces partition. In 
India, military atrocities in Kashmir are an "underreported human rights 
debacle," while tensions are also mounting within the Hindu community and 
between Hindus and Muslims, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Middle East, Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein is engaged in an open 
campaign to "annihilate" the southern Shiite Muslim community and a covert 
campaign against northern Kurds. 
</P>
<P>
 Regionally, Africa is the most volatile part of the world because of the 
weakness of civil society, the private sector and trade unions, as well as the 
"overarching influence of military elites" in African political life, the 
report says. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the problems facing new and old democracies, the report struck an 
optimistic note. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost 20% of the world's population now lives in societies with a complete 
range of freedoms. Seven new democracies this year -- South Africa, Haiti, 
Ukraine, Mozambique, Malawi, Guinea-Bissau and Palau -- account for an increase 
of about 70 million people. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Africa has shown dramatic progress. Over the last five years, formal 
democracies in sub-Sahara Africa have mushroomed from three to 19. But only 
eight of those democracies are rated as free.

TROOPER ACCUSED OF DETAINING PAIR GOING TO ABORTION CLINIC

<P>
 A state trooper accused of giving a couple a lecture against abortion after 
pulling them over for speeding on their way to a clinic was charged Thursday 
with unlawful imprisonment and official misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Lane W. Jackstadt, 34, stopped Deanna Thomas, 18, and Justin Cooper, 20, for 
speeding on July 27.The couple said Jackstadt then held them against their will 
for about 45 minutes and led them to a church-run counseling session after 
learning they were on their way to an abortion appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackstadt told the couple he was a devout Christian and sternly lectured 
Thomas against having an abortion, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trooper also allegedly told the couple he could hold them there on the 
shoulder of Interstate 90 east of Seattle to make sure they missed their 
appointment at the Planned Parenthood clinic in suburban Kirkland. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackstadt said "he would see what he could do about taking care of the 
speeding ticket if they would agree to come with him to meet with the people 
from his church," prosecutors said in court papers. 
</P>
<P>
 After Jackstadt led them to the counseling session, the couple left. The woman 
later had an abortion.

LANDING CALLED POSSIBLE DESPITE LOSS OF 1 ENGINE; CRASH: VETERAN PILOTS SAY 
AMERICAN EAGLE CREW PROBABLY COULD HAVE CONTINUED SAFE DESCENT. ONE SAYS THERE 
MAY HAVE BEEN COCKPIT INDECISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Barring unexplained circumstances, the cockpit crew of an ill-fated American 
Eagle commuter plane probably should have been able to land safely after one of 
the plane's two engines failed, veteran pilots said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The British-built Jetstream Super 31 apparently was about 1,000 feet above the 
ground Tuesday evening, descending for a landing at Raleigh-Durham 
International Airport, when the crew started talking about an engine 
"flameout," according to a cockpit recording recovered by the National 
Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Seconds later, after the crew discussed the possibility of aborting the 
landing and going around for a second attempt, Flight 3379 crashed belly-down 
into a wooded area about four miles southwest of the airport, killing 15 of the 
20 on board. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane is designed to fly and land on one engine, and much of the regular 
retraining that the cockpit crew of multi-engine planes must undergo -- either 
in flight simulators or in actual aircraft -- centers around what to do in the 
case of engine failure, according to several turboprop pilots who asked not to 
be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it sounds like there may have been some indecision in that cockpit," one 
of the pilots said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any discussion about going around after a power failure is chancy," said 
another pilot. "There's absolutely no reason I can see that they would not have 
continued on in for a landing." 
</P>
<P>
 While descending toward a runway for a landing, as American Eagle Flight 3379 
was doing, relatively little power is needed to keep a plane on its intended 
flight path, aviation sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 And although the failure of one engine gives the plane asymmetrical thrust, 
that problem can be corrected by use of the rudder and by feathering the 
propeller on the failed engine, either automatically or manually. 
</P>
<P>
 When a turboprop engine fails, the whirling propeller provides a sort of 
resistance, or drag. To reduce this drag, the propeller blades are twisted, or 
"feathered," so their edges are parallel to the air flow. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the pilots analyzing the crash said the sort of flameout discussed by 
the cockpit crew is "very unusual" for turboprop engines, which are generally 
known for their reliability. 
</P>
<P>
 On a turboprop plane, a jet engine spins a turbine that is attached to a 
propeller. A "flameout" is said to occur when the fire in the jet engine goes 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Flight 3379, kerosene soaked the crash site, so it is believed 
that the plane did not run out of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said the flameout could have occurred because of a defective fuel pump 
or some other failure in the fuel-delivery system, or -- far less likely -- 
because the engine sucked in a large amount of water. 
</P>
<P>
 While it was drizzling lightly as the plane approached the airport, "It 
generally takes heavy, heavy rain" to cause that sort of problem, one source 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The source said that any attempt to restart the engine as the plane neared the 
runway "should not have been considered. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "The whole procedure for restart is fairly complex and lengthy," he said. 
"There wasn't enough time." 
</P>
<P>
 The crash site was a subdued scene of tragic devastation on Thursday as the 
investigation to determine the official cause of the crash continued. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a couple of sheriff's deputies standing there silently," said 
Chris Sullivan, a pool reporter who was one of four members of the news media 
allowed access to the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were some (NTSB) investigators working there in white 'biols' suits 
(special clothing to protect against possible contamination from blood-borne 
pathogens)," Sullivan said. "It was very quiet." 
</P>
<P>
 The three main chunks of wreckage extended in a line beyond the swath cut 
through a stand of trees as the plane descended. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sections were out of order," Sullivan said. "First the cockpit, then the 
tail, then the fuselage. There were pine needles stuck in the cracks in the 
metal . . . There was charring on some of the pine trees, one all the way to 
the top. Cables (from the plane) were draped around it. . . . Wooden stakes, 
about 18 inches tall, mark where the bodies were found. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "It was an awesome thing to see. . . . You can judge the terror. . . . It's 
hard to see how anyone could have gotten out alive."

TESTIMONY FOCUSES ON JAIL PRIVACY; SIMPSON TRIAL: COMMANDER OF THE FACILITY 
APPEARS TO BOLSTER LAWYERS' CONTENTION THAT THE DEFENDANT'S OUTBURST TO A 
MINISTER, WHICH A DEPUTY OVERHEARD, SHOULD NOT BE USED BY PROSECUTORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The commanding officer of the Men's Central Jail, where O.J. Simpson has been 
housed for almost six months, testified Thursday that the room where Simpson 
allegedly blurted out an emotional comment to the Rev. Rosey Grier was in an 
area where, the defense team had been assured, confidential conversations could 
be held. 
</P>
<P>
 Called to the stand by defense lawyers, Capt. Albert A. Scaduto appeared to 
bolster the claim that Simpson's remarks should remain out of reach of 
prosecutors, who are seeking access to them because they believe the comments 
might tend to incriminate the football great in the double murder of his 
ex-wife and her friend. A deputy working in the jail said he overheard the 
remarks Nov. 13, and he subsequently wrote a memorandum detailing what he 
allegedly heard. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito has that memo, but neither prosecutors nor 
defense attorneys have been allowed to read it while the judge considers 
whether the conversation should remain privileged because it was between an 
inmate and a clergyman. One issue before Ito is whether Simpson and Grier had a 
reasonable expectation of privacy during their conversation, even if Simpson 
raised his voice loud enough to be heard by a deputy working in a nearby 
control booth. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson, who has pleaded not guilty to the June 12 murders of Nicole Brown 
Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman, has listened to several days of testimony and 
argument about the conversation, conveying little sense that he is concerned 
about the outcome. As Scaduto testified Thursday, Simpson frequently smiled and 
arched his eyebrows in apparent bemusement. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources have said the remarks by Simpson could be construed as incriminating 
but are ambiguous. The deputy who overheard them has conceded that he did not 
hear the full context of the comments, only a three- to five-second snippet 
from Simpson and a brief retort from Grier. 
</P>
<P>
 "Judge Ito approved of the . . . visiting area as a place for confidential 
communications?" Simpson lawyer Robert L. Shapiro asked the captain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, sir, he did," Scaduto responded. 
</P>
<P>
 "And those confidential communications extended not only between the lawyer 
and the client but to any material witnesses . . . as well as any parishioner?" 
Shapiro continued. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, sir," Scaduto said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Scaduto later added under cross-examination that Simpson had never 
been promised that deputies would not staff the control booth while he held 
conversations nearby, his testimony about the assurance of privacy strengthened 
the Simpson team's contention that their client's remarks were made privately 
to his minister and thus should not fall into prosecutors' hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito did not resolve the matter Thursday because Deputy Dist. Atty. William 
Hodgman was out sick, leaving prosecutors unprepared to argue the matter. But 
the judge scheduled a hearing for this morning in the hopes of finally settling 
an issue that has lingered at the margins of the case for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito also delayed a hearing, potentially of far greater significance, on the 
admissibility of evidence relating to domestic discord between Simpson and his 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's attorneys complained that they were deluged by 1,044 pages of new 
prosecution documents -- including statements from a dozen new possible 
witnesses -- on the eve of that hearing. Gerald F. Uelmen, one of Simpson's 
attorneys, called that a "deliberate and calculated move" to leave the defense 
unprepared for the session. 
</P>
<P>
 As he outlined the defense team's complaint about the late disclosure of 
documents, Uelmen revealed the names of 12 new potential witnesses from whom 
prosecutors have taken statements regarding the relationship between Simpson 
and his ex-wife. The couple divorced in 1992, and prosecutors are expected to 
try to introduce evidence of several violent confrontations between the two. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those from whom prosecutors have taken recent statements are former 
Dodger star Steve Garvey and his wife, Candace -- who are friends of Simpson -- 
and Faye Resnick, who co-wrote, with a National Enquirer columnist, a splashy 
book about Nicole Simpson's final months of life. 
</P>
<P>
 One source said the list of witnesses was culled, at least in part, from 
notes, legal records and other information gathered for Resnick's tell-all 
best-seller. Resnick, who has said she believes O.J. Simpson is guilty, wanted 
to cooperate with the prosecution and has been turning over background material 
to them for at least two months, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 The book describes several scenes of alleged domestic violence between the 
Simpsons that Resnick says she either witnessed or heard about from Nicole 
Simpson. One involved a 1993 Christmas party given by Chris and Bruce Jenner. 
Resnick wrote that Simpson attended the party with his ex-wife and children, 
but caused a scene and stormed out when one of Nicole's purported lovers showed 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Candace Garvey said Wednesday that the prosecution had wanted to corroborate 
that incident and other portions of Resnick's book. She said she had witnessed 
the disagreement but had "not been a witness" to any physical abuse. "That was 
a verbal fight," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, meanwhile, said he had been questioned on matters ranging from 
discord between the Simpsons to what transpired at a June 12 dance recital 
hours before Nicole Simpson was stabbed to death. The Garveys were at the show 
because their daughter was in the same program as the Simpsons' daughter 
Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
 But Steve Garvey said he saw little that would have been useful to 
investigators. "I was there, briefly exchanged hellos with O.J. and then spent 
the time videotaping the recital," Garvey said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Statements were taken from Garvey, Resnick and the others in October and 
November, said Uelmen, who accused prosecutors of sitting on the information 
and only turning it over when it was too late for the defense to study and 
prepare for the scheduled hearing Thursday. Uelmen accused prosecutors of 
holding back on the information intentionally and asked Ito to sanction them 
for their actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher Darden, a veteran prosecutor whose appointment 
to the Simpson prosecution was fought by Simpson's attorneys, retorted by 
accusing Uelmen of hyperbole and by noting that prosecutors have turned over 
18,060 pages of material to the defense. For the most part, Darden said, the 
latest batch of transcripts are merely typed versions of tapes that the defense 
has long had in its possession. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't been hiding the ball," Darden said. "There really isn't anything 
new. We've pretty much exhausted everything we have." 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with such voluminous material handed over on the eve of the hearing, 
Uelmen urged Ito to press ahead with opening statements in the trial on Jan. 4 
and to force prosecutors to delete any reference to domestic abuse from their 
initial comments to the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the second time this week that defense attorneys have proposed a 
scheduling alternative that could force a curtailment of the prosecutors' 
opening remarks; a defense motion for addressing the issue of DNA evidence, if 
accepted by Ito, also could have the effect of forcing prosecutors to avoid 
commenting on DNA test results in their opening remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts said that asking prosecutors to curtail their opening statements 
was highly unusual and probably unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 "The prosecution should know what evidence is likely to be admitted and to 
take full advantage of it," said Erwin Chemerinsky, a USC law professor. "Each 
side, as much as possible, should know the evidence that's going to be 
admissible before they deliver opening statements." 
</P>
<P>
 Ito has yet to rule on when he will hold hearings on the DNA test results and 
domestic abuse. He is expected to discuss both issues this morning.  
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Ito ordered prosecutors to turn over any remaining material 
in their files to defense attorneys by the end of business today. The only 
material that prosecutors are allowed to hold back are documents relating to 
ongoing investigations, Ito said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his remarks, Darden hinted that authorities continue to ferret out new 
information. In addition to photographs discovered in a safe deposit box kept 
by Nicole Simpson, Darden said, authorities "intend and expect that we will 
seize additional items" before the trial is over. 
</P>
<P>
 The on-again, off-again set of hearings has played havoc with the trial 
schedule in the Simpson case. But Ito, who has described himself as an 
optimist, said Thursday that he remains hopeful that jurors will soon begin 
hearing evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 With luck, he said, "we can bring this case to trial sometime in early 
January."

TAXI FIRM WINS APPROVAL TO ABSORB 250 'BANDIT' CABS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Bell Cab Co., which recently agreed to pay a $40,000 fine to settle 
charges of campaign money laundering, received approval Thursday to absorb 250 
illegal "bandit" cabs, a move that will make it the largest operating taxi firm 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The city Transportation Commission voted unanimously to allow Bell Cab to more 
than triple its 100-car operation by taking in drivers from the Union de 
Taxistas Independientes, a group of unlicensed Latino cabbies. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners said the decision will reduce the city's bandit cab problem by 
putting the illegal cabs under the city's authority. The action comes two weeks 
before a new state law gives city officials the power to impound the cabs of 
unlicensed drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission voted at a hearing in which it was also scheduled to consider 
penalizing Bell Cab for making illegal campaign contributions totaling $10,500 
to City Council members and candidates in 1990 and 1991. The penalty hearing, 
however, was postponed a month. 
</P>
<P>
 The contributions were made at the same time that the firm was trying to 
obtain a lucrative city permit to operate at Los Angeles International Airport. 
In July, 1990, the council gave Bell Cab the permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell Cab admitted in October to 54 counts of campaign money laundering and 
agreed to pay a $40,000 fine under a settlement with the city Ethics 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 As a further penalty for the laundering scheme, the city Department of 
Transportation has recommended that the Transportation Commission ban Bell Cab 
from LAX for 30 days -- a severe penalty, considering the profitable fares 
generated by airport passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 Schaffer said he asked the commission to delay the penalty hearing so that it 
would not influence the panel's decision on the expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Lobbyist and former City Councilman Art Snyder, who represents Bell Cab, said 
he was glad that the panel did not reject the expansion because of the campaign 
violations. "One has nothing to do with the other," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Snyder vowed to fight the proposed penalty because he said a punishment 
should come from ethics officials, not transportation officials. He conceded 
that a previous Bell Cab president "did something wrong" but he said the firm 
has changed management since then.

GOVERNMENT DEADLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The deadlock in the state Assembly should be seen as an opportunity, not a 
crisis. Now is the time to start an initiative petition to dissolve the 
Assembly permanently. A generation ago, the purpose of the Assembly was to 
represent population, but since the U.S. Supreme Court in Reynolds vs. Sims 
(1964) dictated that the state Senate also has to represent population (not 
counties) both houses of the state Legislature have represented population. So, 
for a generation, one of these branches has been superfluous. 
</P>
<P>
 Now with the Assembly deadlock, the one to be done away with has identified 
itself. Happily, it is the larger of the two bodies, so more money will be 
saved by its demise. The action will put us one step closer to getting our 
fiscal house in order. The elimination of the Assembly will not be a partisan 
measure, as both parties share equally in the deadlock.

</P>
<P>
 The photo (Dec. 7) shows a smiling, very-pleased-with-himself Willie Brown 
leaving the Assembly floor while the caption refers to the house's paralyzed

Democrats and Republicans. Nothing is happening, elected officials are not 
doing their job and I see nothing to smile about.

 This same kind of drill is being carried out in Washington by Sen. Bob Dole 
and company and what remains of the Democratic Party. Needed health care reform 
went in the dumper this year not because it was a bad idea, but because it was 
an idea from the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 I am still searching for someone that can give me one good reason why we need 
a two-party political system since so much time and money is wasted in fighting 
for control and power. I find it absolutely astounding that the American people 
sit by and allow this kind of self-serving behavior on the part of our 
country's "leaders."

 * On Dec. 5 I flew to Sacramento and, by chance, shared a shuttle van from the 
airport to downtown with four Republican Party workers -- advisers to 
assemblymen. They had all come to be part of "this historical day," as one of 
them put it. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously the day was not historic in the way they wanted it to be. But after 
hearing them talk about "all the things Jim (Brulte) is going to do for us" and 
the lucrative jobs they and their friends were going to get and what they were 
going to do to the people they didn't like, I'm glad Monday didn't go the way 
they wanted. There was not one word about the future of California or the 
welfare of the people. It was all "me me me" and "us us us." 
</P>
<P>
 Then I realized that, given the circumstances, Democrats would probably act 
the same way. It's too bad that term limits would only affect the elected and 
not those in the back rooms.

joke. Where does the "acting" Speaker think he'll find respected elected types 
in Sacramento?  
</P>
<P>
 Under the leadership of Brown in the past, California, and especially the

STOPPING A MONSTER CAMEL IN ITS TRACKS; BLOCKAGE OF PROP. 187 WAS PREDICTABLE 
-- AND RIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A camel has been described as a horse designed by a committee. By that 
standard, Proposition 187 may be the monster camel of all ballot propositions. 
</P>
<P>
 That certainly was the message heard in the courtroom of U.S. District Judge 
Mariana R. Pfaelzer, who issued a preliminary injunction Wednesday enjoining 
implementation of the November measure's a) health care, b) social services and 
c) educations provisions. 
</P>
<P>
 That is to say, the judge blocked about 90% of it. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge's action was scarcely a surprise. Before the election, serious legal 
observers had analyzed the "Save Our State" initiative and concluded that it 
had so many inconsistencies and ambiguities that it could well have been 
redubbed "Save Our Lawyers." For the only people clearly benefiting from its 
passages would be the many public and private attorneys arguing for and against 
Proposition 187 in various district and appellate courts. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's exactly what is happening. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, two other judges -- Stuart R. Pollak in San Francisco and W. 
Matthew Byrne Jr. in Los Angeles -- had issued orders blocking various major 
portions of the measure pending legal hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 The rocky legal status of the illegal-immigration measure is also hardly 
mysterious. Some of Proposition 187's more vociferous proponents may see a 
conspiracy among "liberal" judges to thwart the will of the people, who on Nov. 
8 voted 59% to 41% in support of the measure. But many other 
"send-'em-a-message" initiatives have met a similar fate.  
</P>
<P>
 The problem is threefold. The largest and most ambitious initiatives tend to 
be put together, literally, by a coalition of forces and interests. Thus, by 
the time they reach the ballot they read more like a party platform than an 
amendment to the Constitution. The second aspect is that many of the authors do 
not have the legal or legislative background to prune out at least the most 
glaring inconsistencies or, worse yet, unconstitutionalities. Passed by the 
voters largely in the form they were written, these measures become rich fodder 
for lawyers once they hit the courts. And the third stumbling block is simply 
one of scope: The authors try to do too much in one fell swoop. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why it would be far better if California adopted an oft-suggested 
reform measure of vetting ballot initiatives before putting them on the ballot. 
This would be in everyone's best interest, including sponsors of future 
initiatives, who presumably would like to see their measures implemented. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, until the courts sort this mess out, the best thing 
Californians can do is to sit tight and not try to implement the legally 
disputed portions of Proposition 187 piece by piece, locality by locality. Let 
the courts work through the difficult and complex issues it raises and render 
their final judgments; only then can it be conceivably administered and 
enforced with prudence, precision and fairness. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Congress would be very ill-advised to try to pass anything like a 
federal version of Proposition 187. Instead, those who are seriously concerned 
with reducing illegal immigration while not trampling on people's 
constitutional rights, much less throwing children out of schools, or sick 
people out of hospitals, should proceed apace with other, more sensible 
measures. These would include beefing up border enforcement and working with 
other countries, including but not exclusively our NAFTA neighbor to the south, 
on bilateral measures to reduce the economic pressures that cause illegal 
immigration.

BREAKFAST FOOD FOR THOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 West Covina's poorest schoolchildren won't have to sit much longer hungry and 
inattentive in class because their parents cannot always provide breakfast. 
Their hunger pains, documented in a recent "Hunger in America" series by Times 
Staff Writer Sonia Nazario, will ease and their ability to learn will increase. 
That's because a majority of the school board finally voted to put the health 
of low-income students over board members' political ideology. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board had balked at providing a government-subsidized breakfast for 
poorer students. A majority of members had argued that supplying the free 
breakfast would usurp parental responsibilities. They have a point: Parents 
should make sure their children get the nutrition they need to thrive and 
succeed. But when parents can't provide, children should not suffer. 
</P>
<P>
 The board made the right decision, although Board President Mike Spence clung 
to his contention that subsidized school breakfasts are anti-family. He is 
entitled to his opinion, but allowing children to go to school hungry is 
counterproductive. 
</P>
<P>
 Poor children have done without breakfast for years in West Covina. The Times' 
articles calling attention to their plight sparked a generous outpouring of 
donated goods and checks, which volunteers have used to start a free breakfast 
program independent of government assistance at the Edgewood Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
 The generosity continues unabated. The Good Samaritans feed 200 hungry 
children every morning. On Tuesday, the Kaiser Permanente Foundation donated 
$5,000. The parent company of Queen of the Valley Hospital in West Covina also 
donated $5,000. Another $2,500 has arrived and $10,000 more is pledged. 
</P>
<P>
 West Covina wasn't the only Southern California school district guilty of 
failing to take advantage of the federal government's longstanding breakfast 
program for poor students. Nazario documented 193 schools that refused to 
participate although they enrolled a high percentage of needy children. In the 
wake of Nazario's series, at least 60 districts have rushed to apply for the 
breakfast program. As a result, fewer children will fail because they are too 
hungry to learn. 
</P>
<P>
 In West Covina, the new breakfast program is expected to start passing out the 
milk and cereal by Feb. 1. Unfortunately, the reprieve may be short-lived 
because of a change in the political climate in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The House Republicans' "contract with America" includes the Personal 
Responsibility Act, which proposes changes to the federal nutrition programs, 
including the school breakfast program. The GOP approach would turn the 
programs over to the states, and also proposes a 5% cut in the grants. Congress 
needs to save money wherever it can -- but not at the expense of poor children 
too hungry to keep their minds on schoolwork.

HERE'S A FIRE THE CHIEF DOESN'T SEE; MANNING'S APOLOGIA ABOUT AN OFFENSIVE 
VIDEOTAPE RAISES EVEN MORE QUESTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles city fire chief has apologized for his initial, inaccurate 
explanation about the videotape of female recruits struggling futilely to 
perform basic training exercises. But Chief Donald O. Manning's latest 
explanation for the existence of this demeaning tape is no better than his 
first. And his statement to the Fire Commission on Tuesday unfortunately raises 
yet more questions than it answers about the department's personnel policies 
and its leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 When the videotape first came to light last week, Manning characterized it as 
"blooper type" tape. It was meant to be humorous, the chief testified, and not 
intended to ridicule women recruits. This week Manning says that he had not 
been fully briefed by his staff on the results of an internal Fire Department 
probe of the tape. That investigation concluded that the tape was made on 
orders from Capt. Donald M. Carter specifically to protect the department in 
event of sexual-harassment complaints and lawsuits by female trainees who were 
allegedly performing poorly. Carter testified Tuesday that many female recruits 
in the academy (and some males) were not physically capable of battling blazes. 
But all individuals must pass an extremely rigorous physical test in order to 
even gain admission to the academy. Does the captain's comment indicate he and 
others think that test is not rigorous enough? Or is the department going out 
of its way to make sure that women who passed the test don't graduate from the 
academy?  
</P>
<P>
 In his comments on Tuesday, Manning apologized "if there is a feeling that I 
did not provide all the information." But the question aside of whether the 
chief has been candid, either explanation for the tape -- that watching women 
recruits struggle and fail was sport for some or that the department expected 
certain women to fail and laid a tape trail in advance -- is appalling. Both 
lend credibility to charges of racism and sexual harassment in the department. 
Manning's statements indicate, as well, a stunning lack of full understanding 
of his department's problems. 
</P>
<P>
 During last year's devastating wildfires, the men and women of the Los Angeles 
Fire Department demonstrated they are first class firefighters. They deserve 
leaders who will build on that tradition, both on the fire lines and off. But 
each new revelation and each new hearing before the Fire Commission or the City 
Council further polarizes the department and reveals the current leadership as 
wanting in that task.  
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the Fire Commission appointed an independent panel to determine 
whether charges of widespread racism and sexual harassment leveled in a city 
audit are true. If that study corroborates the audit's findings, Chief 
Manning's hold on his job will become yet more tenuous.

SUICIDE FOR THE TERMINALLY ILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Death Emerges as a Civil Liberty," by Derek Humphry, Commentary, Dec. 1:  
</P>
<P>
 Humphry's view that everyone has the right to suicide and the right to call in 
members of the medical profession as executioners is way off base. As nurses, 
we work hard every day to ensure physical and psychological comfort for our 
patients facing terminal illnesses. Adequate pain control, recognition and 
treatment of depression, family support services, hospice, etc. are but some of 
the tools we have to ensure a dignified and meaningful death for our patients. 
There is no dignity in being killed. 
</P>
<P>
 It is false to portray euthanasia as a choice between a painful death 
prolonged by medical technology or a quick, painless death by lethal overdose. 
Pain relief does not prolong death but rather enhances the quality of life at 
its end. Refusal of futile or burdensome medical treatment is a well-recognized 
and ethical right of everyone. Ethical health care professionals reject both 
unnecessary treatment as well as euthanasia. 
</P>
<P>
 Our society has long provided suicide prevention programs out of the 
recognition that killing oneself is a tragic mistake. We do not accept 
financial difficulties, failed relationships and the like as justifications for 
suicide. How callous and discriminatory it would be to now tell terminally ill 
people that we don't really care if they kill themselves. Euthanasia is not 
about suicide or personal choice but rather about abandoning vulnerable people 
and requiring doctors and nurses to suspend the most basic principle of the 
healing professions: "Do no harm."

 * Every living thing will die! The question is when? How? Where? In many cases 
it is a question of mercy and love and kindness! 
</P>
<P>
 My father died a few months ago. We buried what was left of him . . . about 75 
pounds of bone and skin. For about two years he lay in his own bed, blind, and 
cared for by a loving wife and a full-time care person to tend the bedsores, 
feed and change him much like a helpless baby. 
</P>
<P>
 The prostate cancer nibbled away at his body like invisible maggots until he 
was too weak to move. The morphine stopped the pain in his body, but this 
once-proud and independent spirit became twisted and tormented, for the clarity 
of his mind made his situation unbearable. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice I've made the choice to put my dearly loved dogs out of their misery 
when there was no hope for recovery. I held them close in my arms while the 
veterinarian administered a painless shot and they drifted off to a final rest. 
</P>
<P>
 How I wish my father had been given this choice -- a right not to end life but 
to shorten the agony of the dying process. I will fight to have this most basic 
of freedoms for myself.

FOREIGN STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While I commend FBI Director Louis J. Freeh's overall anti-terrorist objective 
as pointed out in your Dec. 3 editorial, I am troubled by your focus on the 
report's attention to international students and scholars. Our government must 
be concerned with all who abuse our laws, whether they be tourists, asylum 
seekers, students or any others.To imply, however, that foreign students -- 
including those who improperly prolong their stay in this country -- are 
disproportionately likely to be or to become terrorists is reckless and, as far 
as we are aware, totally unfounded. If Freeh has facts or figures to justify 
focusing on foreign students, he should make this clear. 
</P>
<P>
 By publicly singling out not individual malefactors but international students 
as a whole for "additional scrutiny," Freeh encourages ill-will toward an 
extremely important group of people. Foreign students, who make up only 
one-tenth of 1% of the non-immigrant admissions to the U.S. each year, 
represent many of tomorrow's world leaders. International students increase 
diversity in the student body of our colleges and universities, helping our 
young people overcome insularity. Further, these ambassadors of the world 
contribute $7 billion to our local communities annually and represent 
geographical areas that will be important business partners of the U.S. in the 
future.

U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am outraged with a proposal to do away with the U.S. Geological Survey (Dec. 
6), especially after still feeling the effects of the recent Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 I regularly wake up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat after dreaming 
another large quake has struck.I cannot describe the terror that this causes, 
the pain and the horror associated with it. I have friends and family members 
who tell me the same thing is happening to them. Many of them still haven't 
even completed repairs on their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio GOP Rep. John Kasich's idea to get rid of the Geological Survey makes no 
sense at all. The agency has many research projects under way, including 
studies to one day predict quakes. Other work involves an early-warning system 
based on ground sensors that alerts a population. This agency has as one of its 
main missions to help us understand more about quakes. No other agency performs 
such a function. If we can better understand these terrible geological events, 
we could save lives and billions of dollars in property damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, it would be wrong for Kasich and others to think that earthquakes are 
isolated to the West Coast. North America's largest recorded quake hit the 
Eastern portion of the continent, not the West, as most people would assume.

DON'T BLAME CLINTON'S TROUBLES ON GAYS; POLITICS: THERE ARE LOTS OF REASONS FOR 
THE NOV. 8 DEBACLE, BUT THE 'DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL' POLICY ISN'T ONE OF THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID M. SMITH, David M. Smith, a consultant in Washington, was 
communications director for the Campaign for Military Service, the 1993 effort 
to persuade Congress to drop the ban on gays in the military. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The words "gays-in-the-military" are being hung around President Clinton's 
neck like a hangman's noose as a direct result of discrimination that lesbians 
and gay men face. 
</P>
<P>
 In the frenzy of post-election finger-pointing, the history of efforts to lift 
the gay ban are being rewritten by journalists, happy-to-pile-on Republicans 
and eager-to-blame Democrats to illustrate President Clinton's perceived 
culpability in the Democratic debacle of Nov. 8. It would be another thing if 
the President actually did make lifting the ban his first priority. He didn't. 
"Don't ask, don't tell" is the same ban, and poor management of the issue has 
caused a public-relations quagmire for the White House from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 The phrase "gays-in-the-military" is slowly but surely experiencing a 
metamorphosis from a simple campaign promise to treat people fairly to the 
monster that could kill a presidency. Each time it appears in print or is 
spoken on radio or television to describe "where the Clinton presidency went 
wrong" it becomes a form of gay-bashing. The President becomes a victim of 
anti-gay discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave McCurdy, the former Oklahoma Democratic congressman, and chairman of the 
Democratic Leadership Council, subscribes to the theory that the President's 
effort to end the ban contributed to his own loss to Republican James Inhofe in 
the race for David Boren's Senate seat. Presidential pollster Stan Greenberg in 
a widely quoted post-election survey for the Democratic Leadership Council said 
54% were disappointed in President Clinton, and 51% of that number indicated 
they were disappointed because he "pursued a liberal agenda like gays in the 
military." A computer search of the phrase "gays in the military" produces 
hundreds of references since Nov. 8, as pundits of every stripe grope for their 
own analysis of the Republican upset. 
</P>
<P>
 It's time to get real. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Chuck Robb (D-Va.) supported lifting the ban, and supports the Employment 
Non-Discrimination Act banning job discrimination against gay people. Oliver 
North, a notoriously anti-gay zealot, tried to use the issue against Robb and 
it failed. Virginia is hardly less conservative than Oklahoma. While it can be 
said that North had other baggage that might have overshadowed Robb's support 
for gay rights, the bottom line remains that North's anti-gay positions did not 
prevail. 
</P>
<P>
 When you crunch the numbers in Greenberg's poll, you find that about 26% of 
all respondents felt that "gays-in-the-military" was a source of disappointment 
in Clinton. This is consistent with other polls that show less than one-third 
of the voting public is solidly anti-gay. But two-thirds are not, consistent 
with polls commissioned by the Human Rights Campaign Fund, the nation's largest 
gay political group, that show more than 70% opposing job discrimination 
against gays. 
</P>
<P>
 Pundits and politicians should stop and realize the harm they are causing 
thousands of gay men and lesbians in the U.S. military and throughout the 
country by continuing to create a mythological monster out of a then-new 
President's efforts to do the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
 The question now is whether the newly Republican-dominated Congress will 
continue the myth-making and use gay issues to bludgeon, or will it agree with 
most Americans and reject policies that institutionalize discrimination? Will 
Speaker-to-be Newt Gingrich overcome the inevitable pressure from the extremes 
of his party to capitalize on the anti-gay prejudice of a vocal minority? Early 
in 1992, Gingrich said there was no reason to expel people from the military 
"for purely private behavior that's sexual." But a year later, he changed his 
position, saying "I've decided to go with the guys (generals) who won the wars 
in Panama and the Gulf." 
</P>
<P>
 "Gays-in-the-military" must stop being used by political opportunists and 
analysts searching for easy answers to the vexing outcome of Nov. 8. If it 
continues, it will be at the expense of American citizens who are gay or 
lesbian.

PERSPECTIVE ON L.A. CITY BUDGET; PAY FOR POLICE, NOT ILL-FATED PROJECTS; 
MUNICIPAL PRIORITIES ARE SKEWED WHEN PEOPLE ARE ASKED TO GIVE TO A FUND FOR 
SERVICES THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN CARE OF BY TAXES.

 Last month, voters demonstrated a serious dissatisfaction with big governments 
and the people elected to run them. Mayor Richard Riordan's election more than 
a year ago may have foreshadowed this. But in Los Angeles, entrenched 
bureaucracies with vested interests and a charter system that "protects" 
citizens by giving everyone and no one power continue to hamstring a city now 
led by people who may be tuned in to the electorate's wishes but still can't 
act.  
</P>
<P>
 The need to establish the Mayor's Alliance for a Safer L.A. to raise $15 
million to address pressing public-safety needs is a perfect example of 
government not working. Crime is the greatest concern of most people. Although 
free market, privatization advocates can argue that many current government 
functions could be better handled in the private sector, crime prevention 
clearly is a government responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The city budget is now $3.98 billion, with the Police Department taking $1.07 
billion. Thus, the $15 million sought by the alliance amounts to less than 
two-fifths of 1% of the city budget. Yet the mayor and the police chief have 
been unable or unwilling to shift or cut to find the $15 million.  
</P>
<P>
 Policing is a public good because, for example, when an officer is patrolling 
in front of my store he or she also is protecting neighboring stores. Thus if 
individuals had to purchase their own crime-prevention services, they would 
consider only the personal benefits, not the benefits to others. Moreover, if 
crime rates fall, more businesses will stay in or move to Los Angeles, thereby 
expanding jobs and the tax base. In other words, crime also imposes on city 
social costs in the form of reduced economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared with other large cities, Los Angeles has relatively few police 
officers. Riordan and Police Chief Willie Williams are seeking to improve 
policing services in the city with $15 million in private funds for some 
short-term needs, including a departmentwide computer network and personnel 
training recommended by the Christopher Commission. After the first year of 
implementation of the alliance's goals, the computer system will save the LAPD 
more than 640,000 hours of desk work annually, freeing the equivalent of more 
than 350 full-time officers for real police work. 
</P>
<P>
 The alliance, to its credit, has raised more than half of the required amount. 
Think of what this means. With business taxes and fees already among the 
highest in the nation, Angelenos are being asked to contribute voluntarily to 
support a function that should be covered by the taxes they already pay. 
Additionally, is the alliance going to continue to pick up this bill? If 
modernization is a top priority and a solution to many of our crime problems, 
why isn't the mayor including it in his 1995-96 budget? 
</P>
<P>
 Where do our tax revenues go? To maintain the city's duplicative 911 service 
where one operator listens to the caller's problem and then sends the call to 
either a police or fire department dispatcher? If the first operator could 
dispatch the necessary help directly, we would save the required $15 million 
many times over and also provide quicker responses. To maintain a bloated 
engineering department so City Council members can appear responsive to 
constituents by drawing plans for new bridges or stoplights -- even though 
there are no capital funds to actually implement the designs? 
</P>
<P>
 Should we be surprised that citizens have lost faith in the ability of their 
government to spend their tax dollars wisely? This will continue until we give 
our city executives power to act and then hold them responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many city activities that might be best paid for by private 
contributions, but crime prevention is not one of them. Given how tightly the 
mayor's and police chief's hands are tied, their alliance is a noble effort. 
But the better solution is to make certain our elected city leaders are able to 
put the city's tax revenues to uses that will best serve their constituents' 
needs.

OWNERS KEEPING THE LID ON THEIR CAP -- FOR NOW; BASEBALL: THEY GIVE EXECUTIVE 
COUNCIL APPROVAL TO DECLARE AN IMPASSE IF THERE ISN'T A NEW AGREEMENT WITH 
PLAYERS BY DEC. 22. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Baseball owners didn't push the salary cap button Thursday, avoiding for at 
least a week a chaotic winter filled with lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 In what was a sign either of hesitation, posturing or genuine desire to make a 
deal, owners gave the ruling executive council authority to declare an impasse 
in talks and impose the cap if there isn't an agreement by Dec. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to reach a negotiated settlement, and we say that with every ounce of 
sincerity we can put forth," management negotiator John Harrington said. "And 
this gesture is just that, it's the olive branch to say, listen, let's make 
peace for now and many years to come." 
</P>
<P>
 Union head Donald Fehr said talks probably will resume Monday in the 
Washington area, but he wouldn't predict if players would make a new proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "While we do not agree that we are at an impasse, we do agree that it is 
appropriate to continue talking, and we are encouraged by that." Fehr said by 
telephone from his office in New York. "Obviously, if they are willing to 
negotiate, so are we." 
</P>
<P>
 Talks broke off Wednesday at Rye Brook, N.Y., and mediator W.J. Usery 
predicted then that the sides might return to the table as soon as this 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'd be a nice Christmas present to the fans to give them back baseball, to 
open the camps and have spring training," Usery said from Alexandria, Va. "I'm 
very happy with the decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Owners approved a resolution that gave the executive council the power to 
impose the salary cap if there isn't a settlement by Dec. 22. The vote was 
25-3, according to several participants, with the Baltimore Orioles, New York 
Mets and Toronto Blue Jays in opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the union really wants to reach an agreement, we're going to give it more 
time," acting commissioner Bud Selig said. "But it must address ... our central 
issue: establishing a relationship between revenues and salaries." 
</P>
<P>
 Owners, who are threatening to open the 1995 season with replacement players, 
want players to accept a predetermined percentage of revenue or agree to a tax 
mechanism that will penalize clubs with high payrolls. The union, which won 
free agency prior to the 1976 season, says caps and punitive taxes would crush 
the market for players. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was done in the spirit of trying to open one more window of opportunity 
for both management and the players to create an agreement," Harrington said, 
"and we're making an appeal to the players and their wives and their families 
to truly understand that implementation is not in our minds and our hearts." 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides appear to be posturing for possible litigation. Atlanta Braves 
president Stan Kasten has accused players of stalling at the bargaining table. 
The union would challenge an imposed cap before the National Labor Relations 
Board and hope the agency would seek an injunction against owners in federal 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 Management would have to defend its declaration of impasse, and owners 
certainly would cite the one-week delay as evidence of its good faith. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we wanted to implement, we could have implemented some time ago," Selig 
said. "Taking unilateral action is a last resort. If we do so, it will be done 
very reluctantly, only when we have exhausted all of our options." 
</P>
<P>
 During a four-hour meeting of the negotiating committee and the executive 
council, management lawyer Chuck O'Connor made the recommendation that owners 
adopted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, there were those of us that thought implementation should have been 
passed and approved today and that's it," Minnesota Twins owner Carl Pohlad 
said. "But on the other hand, as long as there is a chance that we might reach 
agreement with the players, we felt it was in the best interest of everybody 
that we extend it." 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado Rockies chairman Jerry McMorris called the decision "a very positive 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
 "I just hope we can get back to playing ball. We want to make a deal. We want 
to have our major league players out there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners' decision to delay imposition of a cap was contingent on the union 
agreeing to push back the deadlines of baseball's business calender. 
Originally, owners said they had to have a deal by Dec. 7, the deadline for 
clubs to offer salary arbitration to their former players who became free 
agents, but the sides agreed to push that deadline back 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr said he would ask the union's executive board to push back that date 
again, along with the Dec. 20 deadline for offering 1995 contracts to unsigned 
players. Clubs don't want to tender contracts under the current system and 
commit themselves to another winter of salary arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will recommend to the players that we do so, and I'm sure they'll go 
along," Fehr said. 
</P>

MOMENT OF TRUTH FOR NHL; HOCKEY: IF THE SHOW IS TO GO ON THIS SEASON, OWNERS 
AND PLAYERS WILL HAVE TO CONCLUDE THEIR NEGOTIATIONS THIS WEEK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As it has been pointed out over and over during the lockout, hockey is a big 
business. Well, this is the week the crops come in and there will have to be a 
deal -- or else. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it comes to farming, you don't really have a problem that you can't 
solve unless there is no market, no buyer for your product," says New York 
Rangers Coach Colin Campbell, who owns a tobacco farm in Tillsonburg, Ontario. 
"We have a lot of fans out there who have been anxious for more than two months 
to see hockey games. And since that's what we like to do in the first place, we 
ought to be able to find ways to provide a product that is very much in demand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know there are some complicated issues, but if we aren't playing by Jan. 3, 
those guys (Commissioner Gary Bettman and union boss Bob Goodenow) are screwy." 
</P>
<P>
 Old-fashioned common sense. That's what finally will take over this week when 
the owners, faced with losing the season, back down on their tax-issue demand. 
They will drop the tax and negotiate until their pre-set deadline (probably 
Dec. 22) to get the best possible deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's a situation where it can't get done, then we have to step in there 
and rattle some people up," Detroit Red Wings Owner Mike Ilitch says. 
</P>
<P>
 That means accepting gains in entry-level salaries and salary arbitration, as 
I have proposed for months. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no way we can do a deal if the tax is part of it," Pittsburgh 
Penguins defenseman Larry Murphy says. "If they drop the tax proposal, there is 
a deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Several owners told The Sporting News that reintroducing the tax was a 
"face-saving tactic to show small-market teams the league had not sold them 
out. But the charade was part of a natural process." 
</P>
<P>
 And so was the reaction of the players, who threw the tax proposal on the 
floor and walked out of last week's meeting in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why the tax will disappear this week and the Edmontons and Winnipegs of 
the NHL will have to make it on their own. Seventy-five percent of the owners 
will not vote to cancel the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know it's not good to not have hockey," Philadelphia Flyers General 
Manager Bobby Clarke says. "We'll be cutting their throats and they'll be 
cutting ours." 
</P>
<P>
 Canceling the Jan. 21 All-Star Game at San Jose, Calif., was inevitable 
because the league will need the dates for a modified schedule. Of more 
importance is the fact the All-Star Game was supposed to mark the beginning of 
the NHL's television alliance with the Fox network. 
</P>
<P>
 As of now, Fox can have the rest of the NHL's regular-season and playoff 
package, but the network has let it be known it would ask for a rebate on its 
five-year, $155-million deal should any more games be canceled. That's money 
most teams already have spent. 
</P>
<P>
 So, you've got owners borrowing money to pay bills. And you've got owners 
spending television money they may have to return. More important, you've got 
the two sides close to a deal -- as long as there is no luxury-tax plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the scoop on the three major issues: 
</P>
<P>
 -- You've got an agreement in principle on free agency, where players become 
unrestricted free agents at age 30 -- no franchise-player designations at 28. 
Owners have proposed a draft-choice compensation scale on free agents between 
24 and 29 based on player salaries ranging from $400,000 to more than $2 
million, with compensation ranging from a third-round draft choice to three 
first-round draft choices. The players would like to reduce the top 
compensation to two first-rounders and a second-round choice, which should be 
acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 -- You've got an agreement on two-year arbitration awards, unless the team 
elects to go with a one-year period before the arbitration hearing. The sides 
agree that unrestricted free agents' salaries cannot be used to determine a 
player's salary in arbitration. Owners want non-binding arbitration; players 
oppose because 65 to 70 percent of the 700 association members are 24 to 29. 
The owners may insist on non-binding salary arbitration to get the tax issue 
off the table. 
</P>
<P>
 -- You've got an agreement on a $1-million rookie salary cap, including 
bonuses. The players want a cost-of-living index in this provision; the owners 
oppose that concept. The giving point is that players propose a draft reduction 
from 11 rounds to 10 for players 18 and older. Owners propose an eight-round 
draft for players 20 and older, with some exceptions for superior 18- and 
19-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
 Because veterans are so afraid the league will replace them with 
less-expensive young talent, the 20-year-old draft concept should make sense to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got the blueprints and we're working on the footings, but we're a long 
way from having a house built," Edmonton Oilers G.M. Glen Sather says. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are a lot of players and owners who are willing to pitch in and 
build that foundation for a strong future. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 New York Rangers center Mark Messier says the players will start a league of 
their own "in two months" if the owners cancel the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Phone calls to the players association uncovered no knowledge or any 
foundation for such a plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Quebec Nordiques G.M. Pierre Page has a great idea. "Give the next 
expansion team to the players," he says. "I'm sure their philosophy of what to 
pay players would change. I know Pierre Lacroix's philosophy changed 
dramatically over a few months after he went from agent to general manager in 
Quebec." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Washington Capitals left wing Kelly Miller says he has given up enough. "The 
way I look at it, I've already given them my keys. Then I gave them my wallet. 
Then I gave them my car. At some point you have to say you can't have my kids 
and my wife." 
</P>
<P>
 When you make $1.8 million and get only 14 goals and 25 assists, you probably 
should expect some form of reprisal for your robbery. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Toronto Coach Pat Burns told his players to be ready to play Dec. 29. So did 
Montreal Coach Jacques Demers and Winnipeg Coach John Paddock. Each was told 
that's the deadline for a 54-game schedule. Plan B calls for 50 games, which is 
more likely because a 14-day training camp is a must.

 Major league baseball owners Thursday gave the go-ahead for television 
producer Tom Werner to sell the San Diego Padres to Texas computer software 
millionaire John Moores, who generated his fortune off a $1,000 stake in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale is expected to be completed in the next few weeks, said Larry 
Lucchino, a former Baltimore Oriole president who is assisting Moores. 
</P>
<P>
 A source said Moores will pay about $80 million to be majority owner of the 
worst team in the big leagues during the strike-interrupted 1994 season. Werner 
and 14 other Southern California businessmen bought the Padres from Joan Kroc 
for $75 million in 1990 and are expected to retain a minority interest.

MERGER OF INVESTMENT GIANTS COLLAPSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A deal that would have created the world's largest investment bank collapsed 
Thursday when U.S. investment house Morgan Stanley Group Inc. and its British 
counterpart S.G. Warburg Group called off merger talks. 
</P>
<P>
 But analysts said the main sticking point in the $7.8-billion deal -- how 
Warburg's 75%-owned Mercury Asset Management Group would be treated -- could be 
overcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "Remember, the two companies we're talking about here are world leaders in 
(mergers and acquisitions). So they know all the negotiating tactics," said 
Sanford Bernstein analyst Guy Moszkowski. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed merger stumbled over the price demanded by the minority owners of 
Mercury, the jewel in the Warburg crown, according to analysts and a source 
close to the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hang-up was the fairly high price tag attached to the minority interest 
in Mercury," Moszkowski said. 
</P>
<P>
 That stake is largely owned by Mercury managers, and "they wanted to be bought 
out at a high multiple," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed deal, Morgan Stanley would have ended up with two-thirds of 
the combined entity and Warburg with one-third. It would have merged the 
strongest London merchant bank with the old-line establishment firm of Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
 While Morgan would have given Warburg clients entree to the U.S. market, 
Warburg would have given Morgan an extensive shot at expanding its global 
business. Warburg's client list includes more than half the companies listed on 
Britain's Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Index. 
</P>
<P>
 "While the discussions between Morgan Stanley and S.G. Warburg were proceeding 
on the basis of a market-for-market merger, the price and terms on which 
Mercury Asset Management Group indicated it would be willing to participate in 
the transaction were unacceptable to Morgan Stanley," Morgan Stanley said. "For 
its part, Morgan Stanley was unwilling to proceed with a transaction excluding 
Mercury." 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the talks were called off, the treatment of Mercury, and in 
particular the minority 25% holding, had been identified as a possible deal 
breaker. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed likely that the British watchdog Panel on Takeovers and Mergers 
would have required an offer to be made for the minority holding on the grounds 
that Mercury was the main reason that the merger was taking place at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said that despite its excellent British and European client list, 
good market-making operations and high profile in corporate finance, Warburg's 
investment banking operation is making no money and has serious problems. 
</P>
<P>
 In its latest half-year results, Warburg made $97.54 million, of which $88.96 
million came from Mercury. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without the asset management, Warburg becomes a much less valuable property," 
Sanford Bernstein's Moszkowski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercury's managers know this and are playing off it in their demands, he said. 
But, he added, "There are limits." 
</P>
<P>
 Said one arbitrager who asked not to be named: "The cultures of the two firms 
are very different. There wasn't a compelling need in terms of adding new 
businesses or geographic expansion. They overlap to some degree. 
</P>
<P>
 "This to me was a recipe for a thing blowing up in a few days." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, the strategic fit between Morgan and Warburg may be good enough to lure 
the two back to the table, said Marty Wasmer, principal of First International 
Asset Management. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our feeling is that Morgan will find a way to get it done," he said. "It may 
be dead for now, but we feel it might be revisited." 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan shares closed down 37.5 cents to $61 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Warburg and Mercury both closed sharply off in London.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; SEC CHAIRMAN URGES VOTERS TO OUST BOARD OF 
SUPERVISORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a harsh rebuke to Orange County officials, Securities and Exchange 
Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. suggested voters throw out the officials 
who let the county's financial crisis happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Levitt said the county board of supervisors failed to adequately supervise 
former Treasurer Robert Citron, who lost $2 billion in taxpayer money wagering 
that interest rates would fall this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors never challenged the wisdom of Citron's investments, which 
included derivatives that lose value quickly when interest rates increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "If your supervisors are so lax that they allow you the unique power, without 
oversight, to make that kind of speculation, I think the voters of that 
community should throw the whole bunch of (them) out of office," Levitt said. 
The chairman made his comments to a luncheon meeting of the Town Hall of Los 
Angeles on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Levitt's comments came less than a week after the county's top administrator 
accused him of turning a deaf ear to the county's financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Ernie Schneider, the county's chief administrative officer, 
complained that despite "a major pitch to the SEC" for help, "they just weren't 
interested in helping us at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Levitt said he refused the county's request for him to impose a moratorium on 
collateral sales by brokerage firms that lent the county billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 The county filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 6 after CS First Boston seized about 
$2 billion of securities held as collateral for loans to the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him at that time I felt that would be an inappropriate interference in 
the market process that would be tantamount to closing the stock markets," 
Levitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said he did his best to help the county, calling the brokerage firms, 
and asking them to be more cooperative with the county.

<P>
 Stocks posted strong gains Thursday, led by economically sensitive issues, as 
worries about higher interest rates receded. 
</P>
<P>
 The rate outlook was helped by a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Philadelphia saying that area manufacturing growth declined in December. The 
survey also shows a decline in prices paid and received and in new orders and 
shipments. 
</P>
<P>
 The report led to a drop in yields on short-term Treasury securities, though 
the 30-year bond edged up from 7.86% on Wednesday to 7.87%. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, data showed modest increases in wholesale and consumer 
prices. Taken together, the reports encouraged investors to conclude that the 
Fed will not raise interest rates at its policy meeting Tuesday, especially in 
the wake of its 0.75 percentage point increase last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Fed moved very heavily in November; they'll probably lay off next 
Tuesday," said Larry Wachtel, market analyst at Prudential Securities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 19.18 points to 3,765.47, its highest 
level since before Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
 Advancing issues led decliners by nearly 13 to 7 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. Big Board volume was strong at 332.79 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow outperformed broad market indexes as cyclical stocks, which are well 
represented in the industrial average, led the market higher. The 30 Dow 
components were led by International Paper, up 2 1/4 to 74 3/4; Alcoa, up 1 3/4 
to 81 5/8; United Technologies, up 1 1/2 to 61; Caterpillar, up 1 to 53 3/8, 
and Bethlehem Steel, up 7/8 to 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Market indexes were pushed higher by several waves of computerized buy 
programs tied to today's double expiration of options and futures. Traders and 
analysts also said the market was bouncing back from last week's selloff, which 
took 54 points off the Dow. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a tremendous amount of program buying," said Jon Groveman, president 
of Ladenburgh, Thalmann & Co. "You're getting a year-end oversold rally, and 
the expiration is fanning it." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology stocks boosted broad market indexes after 3Com, a computer 
networking company, released a strong second-quarter earnings report. 3Com 
added 6 1/4 to 48 3/8 in heavy Nasdaq trading. The news sparked some ratings 
upgrades and a general rise in networking and technical stocks. Companies have 
found connecting computers to be productive and are buying them at a fast clip, 
startling analysts. Stocks of other network device companies also rose: San 
Jose-based Alantec jumped 21% and Milpitas, Calif.-based Network Peripherals 
surged 12%. Cisco Systems, Cabletron, Bay Networks and Chipcom all jumped 
several percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sprint fell 3 7/8 to 26 7/8 on the Big Board. The long-distance telephone 
carrier told analysts that its fourth-quarter results will probably fall well 
below expectations.  
</P>
<P>
 Overseas stock markets were mixed. Tokyo's Nikkei average rose 1% and 
Frankfurt's DAX index finished up 1.4%. But the FTSE 100 index in London fell 
0.24%.  
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican peso fell to a record low against the dollar as concerns about the 
Chiapas rebellion weakened financial markets and Mexicans bought the U.S. 
currency for Christmas travel and shopping. In Mexico City, the dollar was 
quoted in late trading at 3.4625 pesos, up from 3.4565 on Wednesday. Mexico's 
Bolsa stock index fell 0.95%. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil prices fell to three-month lows as moderate weather eased energy demand, 
but prices of several other industrial commodities rallied based on demand or 
export prospects, analysts said. January crude oil closed 26 cents lower at 
$16.73 a barrel, near last week's eight-month low of $16.42.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Shorter-term interest rates tumbled for a second consecutive session Thursday, 
indicating that Wall Street increasingly doubts the Federal Reserve Board will 
raise interest rates next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, longer-term yields inched up, while stocks rallied strongly for a 
second day. The Dow industrial average gained 19.18 points to 3,765.47. 
</P>
<P>
 The interest rate outlook was helped by a report from the Federal Reserve Bank 
of Philadelphia, which indicated that that region's manufacturing growth has 
declined in December. The survey also showed a decline in prices paid by 
manufacturers, and smaller new orders and shipments. 
</P>
<P>
 Regional Fed surveys can foretell shifts in the national outlook. 
</P>
<P>
 The Philadelphia Fed report provides new evidence that the economy is growing 
without a meaningful rise in inflation. Earlier in the week, the government 
said consumer and wholesale inflation remained restrained in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Combined, the economic reports suggest the Fed can delay additional hikes in 
short-term interest rates. Central bank policy-makers, who are to meet Tuesday, 
have raised rates six times this year in an effort to slow the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 With pressure seemingly off for another rate increase, shorter-term bond 
yields sank Thursday. The yield on three-month Treasury bills slid to 5.70% 
from 5.84% on Wednesday and 5.94% on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-year T-note yield dropped to 7.65% from 7.70% on Wednesday, 7.80% on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The decline in yields helped Orange County, whose bankrupt investment fund 
Thursday began liquidating bonds maturing in 2 1/2 to four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Longer-term yields were slightly higher, which traders said indicated some 
investors are selling longer-term issues to buy shorter-term bonds. The yield 
on the 30-year T-bond edged up to 7.87% from 7.86% on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the stock market rallied powerfully, with the Dow reaching 
pre-Thanksgiving levels. In the broad market, rising stocks outnumbered losers 
by 15 to 8 on the New York Stock Exchange in continued heavy trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts said computerized program buying was skewing the market. Some of 
those trades are technical in nature, tied to today's quarterly expiration of 
key stock index futures and options. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thomas Schlesinger, a strategist at brokerage A.G. Edwards, said "the 
overriding factor (in stocks' gains) has to be people thinking year-end rally. 
Part two would be the options expirations." 
</P>
<P>
 Among Thursday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Industrial stocks, many of which have been hammered in recent weeks on 
worries about rising interest rates' effects on the economy, rebounded sharply. 
International Paper leaped 2 1/4 to 74 3/4, Alcoa gained 1 3/4 to 81 5/8, 
United Technologies added 1 1/2 to 61 and Bethlehem Steel rose 1 to 19. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tech stocks also rallied, helped by a strong earnings report from computer 
networker 3Com, which rocketed 6 1/4 to 48 3/8. Other winners included Cisco 
Systems, up 1 11/16 to 33 7/16; Cabletron Systems, up 1 to 47 1/2; DSC 
Communications, up 2 1/2 to 32 5/8, and FileNet, up 1 1/2 to 25. But Sprint 
fell 3 7/8 to 26 7/8 after warning about weak near-term earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gannett surged 3 7/8 to 51 after investor Warren Buffett said he owns 4.9% 
of the stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, London's FTSE-100 index eased 7.2 points to 2,973.4, while 
Frankfurt's DAX index shot up 27.82 points to 2,052.59. Tokyo's Nikkei-225 
index rose 189.63 points to 19,121.12. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City's Bolsa index slumped 22.89 points to 2,378.66 as the Mexican peso 
fell to a record low of 3.4625 against the dollar, hurt by concerns about the 
ongoing rebellion in Chiapas state.

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; SEARCHING FOR ANSWERS AND 'SPIRIT LITE'; RUNNING FROM 
SAFETY BY RICHARD BACH , MORROW, $23, 274 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN FAIR BERKEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Running From Safety," which is billed as a novel, is narrated by Richard 
Bach, a successful writer who is visited one day by a "teaching angel." 
</P>
<P>
 This being tells him that "In 1944 . . . you promised for the boy you were, 
everything you know. What to look out for, how to be happy, knowledge to save 
your life, things you wish you'd known when you were him." 
</P>
<P>
 Bach is also, of course, the author of the book under review, which more or 
less functions as his reply to the angel: a book written to his 9-year-old 
self. (Bach has published a number of other books too, the most famous of which 
is "Jonathan Livingston Seagull," which sold so astronomically that it became a 
genuine cultural artifact. (Eventually it became a movie, with a Neil Diamond 
soundtrack.) 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, the Bach character, confronted with the drag of having to write 
another book, muses to himself on the mysteries of his craft: "Does anybody 
learn writing, or do they just touch someone who lets them see the power of the 
deleted word?" 
</P>
<P>
 He refuses the Teaching Angel, telling him, "Books are written on years turned 
inside out by ideas that never let go until you get them in print, and even 
then writing's a last resort. . . . Wonderful when it's over and everything I 
ever had to say I have already written. . . ." Indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 But soon enough, Bach has a face-to-face meeting with his younger self: a 
vision, if you will. This earlier version of Bach (referred to as "Dickie," to 
avoid confusion) is in a rage, having waited all this time to hear from his 
older self. The author creatively indicates this by arming Dickie with, well, a 
flamethrower. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tenth of a second," goes the sentence that conveys this information, "and the 
place lit up with fire and scarlet fury." Richard the Elder, who happens to be 
para-gliding during this visitation, is absolutely stunned: "Whuff! I thought. 
Is my mind loading rockets for me?" 
</P>
<P>
 Since Richard was supposed to revisit his younger incarnation in exactly 50 
years -- which he does -- then it might seem mystifying that Dickie should be 
so furious at being kept in a "dungeon cell-block" for the promised length of 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 But soon enough it becomes apparent that the Dickie-construct is just an 
inner-child stooge, a flimsy pretext for "Richard Bach" (the one who got paid 
by his publisher) to propound various Deep Thoughts: "Remember that this world 
is not reality. It's a playground of appearances on which we practice 
overcoming seems-to-be with our knowing of Is." 
</P>
<P>
 I obviously have my own spiritual beliefs; I think there is a recognition of 
the vast difference between what can be perceived by the senses, and what 
can't, and the relative value of each. I'm a decided believer in the essential 
mysteriousness of our world. But that doesn't mean I have to take this kind of 
drivel seriously, even when the book in question is subtitled "An Adventure of 
the Spirit." Spirit Lite, maybe, were it not so leaden and smug. 
</P>
<P>
 In my view, the true pilgrim walks a frequently indistinct path. He seeks his 
destination, but knows he may not ever reach it, knows, too, that his final 
arrival is not necessarily the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Bach, however, has clearly figured out the map, reached Enlightenment, 
and already stocked the refrigerator with carrot juice. Of course he parades a 
false humility -- the big plot twist at the end is his realization that it was 
really Dickie teaching him, all along -- but the whole book stinks of 
sanctimony and certitude. (And the prose is atrocious, as you may have 
noticed.) 
</P>
<P>
 So what is it, then, that makes books like this so attractive, to the sort of 
people who attend workshops where the word share is used much too frequently? I 
think it must have to do with the portrayal of spiritual quest as something 
free of struggle: the weekend retreat as Inner Peace drive-thru window. 
</P>
<P>
 But it seems to me that this Life of ours, besides being the source of love, 
joy and wonder that it is, also happens to be unfair, painful and unknowable at 
the same time. It requires commitment and work and that thing we so casually 
call "faith" to reconcile the two. The world I live in bears no resemblance to 
the one found in this book; I doubt if yours does either.

TUNING IN TO A DREAM; THE DUO CELESTIAL WINDS, WHICH PERFORMS REGULARLY AT 
CITYWALK, IS GAINING FANS AND THE PRAISE OF REVIEWERS. 
</P>

<P>
 If this were a record industry fantasy, David Young and Lisa Franco would draw 
large crowds every time they played along CityWalk. During breaks, they would 
sell armfuls of their cassette tapes and compact discs from cardboard boxes. 
Then, a record company executive would offer them a contract. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, all of that happened. Except that when the industry called, the 
flute-and-harp duo said no. It seems Young and Franco have written their own 
version of the fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling themselves Celestial Winds, they have sold 30,000 copies of their 
self-produced album and have worked their way onto the playlist at New Age 
radio stations across the country. They have performed at events for Elizabeth 
Taylor and Hillary Rodham Clinton and at the wedding of Guns N' Roses drummer 
Matt Sorum. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, the duo signed with an agent, a publicist and a distribution company 
to put their albums in record stores nationwide. But all of these entities work 
as subcontractors. Young and Franco retain control of everything -- music, 
promotion, scheduling. They just finished a tour of college campuses and music 
festivals and returned to CityWalk, reclaiming a patch of concrete beside the 
Wolfgang Puck Cafe where they have forged a busker's dream. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to think we are contributing to a new Renaissance," Franco said. "We 
spread out and play. We see the peoples' faces. We see the couples. We hear the 
stories." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in billowing clothes, in purples and blues and jangling jewelry, the 
duo weaves a peaceful blend of New Age and classical music. Crowds inevitably 
draw closer. When the music stops, people reach for their wallets. Cassettes 
sell for $9, compact discs for $14. On a weekend night, Celestial Winds will 
earn as much as $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're from Canada, and all day long I've been complaining about how people 
move so fast here," said Deborah Dusseault of Victoria, British Columbia, one 
of the customers on a recent night. "Listening to this was nice. It was 
relaxing music." 
</P>
<P>
 But this tale concerns more than music. It speaks to the pursuit of success, 
how dreams can change people and how, sometimes, the dream itself can change. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Young and Franco took to music at a young age, he on the recorder and she 
on the harp. Both forsook their childhood instruments for visions of stardom. 
As a young man, he played rock 'n' roll guitar while she toured Europe in jazz 
bands. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many musicians envision that some guy is going to pick you out of a crowd 
and make you a star," Franco said. "I was that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Young's dreams, as well, were written on the parchment of a big-money record 
contract, in the flash of paparazzi cameras. And, like Franco, he ended up 
broke in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did what I never, ever thought I would do," he recalled. "I took my 
recorders down to Venice Beach and I played for two hours and didn't make one 
dollar. I felt like a loser." 
</P>
<P>
 That same afternoon, Franco showed up with her harp. She and Young had met 
before and they decided to jam. She played chord progressions while he 
improvised leads. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before we knew it, we had a huge crowd around us and there was a couple 
there, 65 years old, white hair, they slow-danced in front of us," Young 
recalled. "And we had a basketful of money." 
</P>
<P>
 The same thing happened the next day, and the next weekend. Franco then talked 
Young into spending his last $100 to rent a recording studio. They cut an album 
in six hours and spent the last of his money on a pizza. Young persuaded a 
friend to make 50 copies of the tape on credit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can remember Lisa and I driving to Venice Beach with the tapes," he said. 
"We were praying that people would like the music and buy it." 
</P>
<P>
 They sold all 50 tapes in one weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 On a Friday night, with crowds thrumming along CityWalk, the music echoes as 
if from a distance. A group of high school kids stop to listen. Couples stand 
arm-in-arm. Joey Van Son III and his little brother, Chris, slump on a nearby 
bench, holding their pet boa. 
</P>
<P>
 "She gets good vibes from this music," Joey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The melodies are disarmingly simple. Even the people who promote Celestial 
Winds -- the group's new distributor and publicist -- cannot say what draws 
people to the songs. At first listen, it sounds like elevator music. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is something more. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sitting there and in one hour I (see) 400 people buy their tape," said 
Harvey Cooper, who now handles marketing and promotion for the duo. "Being in 
the record industry, I thought you couldn't sell anything that way. I was 
knocked out." 
</P>
<P>
 The duo has also earned positive reviews. Most have come from New Age critics. 
But Minneapolis' Request Magazine recently praised Celestial Winds for carving 
a "unique niche in the music business" and displaying a street savvy 
reminiscent of punk rockers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just get caught up in it," said Jennifer Greene of Las Vegas, who saw the 
duo at CityWalk. "I usually listen to classic rock. This was just pretty." 
</P>
<P>
 A year and a half ago, when talent scouts raided Venice Beach to hire acts for 
the newly opened CityWalk, Young and Franco weren't there. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were playing a wedding," Young said. "Lisa loves doing weddings. I hate 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Six months passed before puppeteer Lee Zimmerman, one of the Venice acts that 
got recruited, talked CityWalk management into auditioning Celestial Winds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought they were good," said Ricky Day, the mall's special event manager. 
"But it's hard to know what the public is going to be into." 
</P>
<P>
 Again, Celestial Winds had drawn a lukewarm reaction. Even Young considered 
the duo a sideline, a weekend gig that paid the bills while he pursued rock 'n' 
roll stardom. But playing at CityWalk made for bigger crowds and, soon, he and 
Franco were earning $1,000 a night. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so overwhelming," Young recalled. "I said, 'I'd have to be nuts to 
leave this.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Once he and Franco turned their full attention to Celestial Winds, the rest 
fell into place. 
</P>
<P>
 Do not be mistaken -- if a record company offers Celestial Winds big money, 
the duo will jump at the chance. But Young and Franco are doing well enough to 
turn down the modest contracts that have come their way. And they keep in mind 
that a grass-roots approach got them where they are. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being a talented musician is not always the same as being an entertainer," 
Young said. "The way to succeed in the music business is to create a unique 
product and keep doing that one thing." 
</P>
<P>
 So the two continue to spend their days with tasks that musicians usually 
leave to managers -- the phone calls to record stores and concert venues. They 
take pride in the music they make and continue to play it on the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope we never lose that," Franco said. "When I started doing music that was 
closest to my heart, that was when the success came."

DRUMMER STOKES THE FIRE; A PROFESSIONAL MUSICIAN SINCE AGE 16, ROY MCCURDY 
STRIVES FOR INTENSITY WHEN HE PLAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Zan Stewart writes regularly about jazz 
for The Times. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sitting up spine-straight at his drums, lean, muscular Roy McCurdy cuts quite 
a figure and makes a joyful sound. His sticks create a sizzling snap-crackle 
that has inspired musicians such as Sonny Rollins, Cannonball Adderley and 
Nancy Wilson for more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Saxophonist Charles Owens, who lately has worked with the drummer, had this 
high praise: "McCurdy is never going to rush, he's never going to slow down. He 
doesn't waste any motion and yet he's exciting and progressive. His time is so 
exact, it's like looking at a diamond." 
</P>
<P>
 McCurdy, a 58-year-old who looks 40, says that behind his playing is a desire 
to play with intensity. "I'm a fiery drummer," he says. "A lot of people say 
that's loud, but I'm just trying to be intense." 
</P>
<P>
 Describing "fire" is not easy for McCurdy. "I do it all naturally, I don't 
think about it. You have to listen to it to hear it," begins the Rochester, 
N.Y., native who lives in Altadena with his wife, Pat, to whom he's been 
married since 1971. "Maybe it's something that makes you come up off of your 
seat, or makes whoever's soloing want to do more, or gives them something to 
play off. It's about the way I feel, my touch, and my touch happens to give you 
that thing called 'fire.' " 
</P>
<P>
 McCurdy makes an infrequent L.A. appearance as a leader Wednesday when he 
fronts a trio at Chadney's with pianist John Beasley and bassist John B. 
Williams. These days, McCurdy is usually heard in the trio, with pianist Llew 
Mathews and bassist Bruce Lett, that accompanies singer Wilson. He's worked 
with the singer since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Backing up a singer and a horn man like Rollins require, surprisingly, similar 
types of playing, McCurdy says.  
</P>
<P>
 "With Sonny, my role was to push him, and I push Nancy too," he says. "I just 
have to be a little more sensitive with her, not playing too hard so that I 
don't cover her up. But I keep the intensity going . . . swinging things, but 
kept it more subtle." 
</P>
<P>
 McCurdy has been fortunate to play with jazz's finest. With Rollins, he 
performed in the early '60s, appearing on such albums as Rollins' 
"Alternatives" on RCA. Then, in 1965, he began a 10-year stint with Adderley 
that ended when the great saxophonist died in 1975. With Adderley, McCurdy made 
such memorable albums as "Mercy, Mercy, Mercy!" (Capitol, 1966). 
</P>
<P>
 McCurdy talks about what the music is like at its best. 
</P>
<P>
 "If everybody is playing together, if it's happening right, then it would get 
to such a level that you would feel like you were floating, almost out of your 
body so that you could look down and watch yourself play. It's a beautiful peak 
to get to." 
</P>
<P>
 Starting on drums at age 9, McCurdy was a professional by the time he was 16. 
After attending the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, N.Y., and serving in 
the Air Force, McCurdy became a full-time musician, and his first major job was 
with Art Farmer and Benny Golson's Jazztet. Trumpeter Farmer wired the drummer 
in Rochester in 1961, telling him to meet the band in New York City. That 
engagement took McCurdy into a select circle of jazz players. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were playing at Birdland -- the famed jazz club at 52nd Street and 
Broadway in Manhattan -- and opposite was drum great Art Blakey," the drummer 
recalls. "Art had just finished a set and we went on, and I noticed another 
drum master, Philly Joe Jones, in the crowd. I was nervous for the first couple 
of tunes, but then I relaxed and really enjoyed myself. Later, Philly and Elvin 
Jones came in and gave me encouragement. It was like being brought to another 
level of playing. I knew I wasn't in the league of Elvin and Philly yet, but I 
was in. A door had been opened for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Playing with Rollins a year later was another career boost. "Sonny was one of 
my heroes," he says. "He would play tunes that would last an hour or longer," 
he says. "It was incredible, and my time feeling and playing in general became 
very strong." 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, McCurdy has not always been the 160-pound model of fitness he 
is today. "I used to be thin as a rail, weighing no more than 120," he says. 
Then, while he was with Adderley, he started weight training. "I got bigger and 
bigger, at one point up to 180 pounds. I've kept the lifting up over the years. 
Now, no matter what time I get off work, I'm at the gym by 8:30 a.m. Drums are 
a physical instrument and you should be strong. Plus the road takes a lot out 
of you, so it helps to be healthy."

MERRY AND MOVING; GAY MEN'S CHORUS CONCERT RANGES FROM CAROLS TO SPOOFS IN A 
PROGRAM MEANT TO TOUCH HEARTS AND TICKLE FUNNY BONES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Whether it is a poignant rendition of "Silent Night" in which the last verse 
is not sung, but signed for the hearing impaired, or a salute to Christmas 
carols where the "carols" are men dressed as Carol Burnett, Carol Lawrence and 
Diahann Carroll, expect holiday music with a twist at Saturday's Christmas 
concerts by the Gay Men's Chorus of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Titled "Don We Now . . . ," the two performances at the Alex Theatre in 
Glendale offer a mixture of the traditional and unconventional. "We try to stay 
away from the hyper-religious," says Jon Bailey, artistic director of the 
150-member ensemble for the past seven years, and Pomona College music 
department chairman and director of choral activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Irreverence wouldn't be the right word, but we do play a spoof on the secular 
side. This is a family show -- there is nothing offensive about it. It's a show 
you can bring your children or your grandmother to." 
</P>
<P>
 The program is divided into four sections. The opening set, "Christmas in the 
Southwest," features a collection of 10 Basque, Catalan, Spanish and Mexican 
carols and lullabies adapted by Conrad Susa -- who recently came to prominence 
with his operatic version of "Dangerous Liaisons." The singers will be 
accompanied by marimba, harp and guitar. Also on the bill are the 16th-Century 
Spanish carol "Riu Riu Chiu", and "Peace Peace" by Rick and Sylvia Powel. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey, 55, chose a Latino theme because, he says, "living in Los Angeles and 
not speaking the language of the city seems criminal. This is part of the 
cultural heritage." 
</P>
<P>
 The second section features a work called "A Christmas Dinner," representing 
what Bailey calls the "Family Values Holidays" section, which he says, "is 
appropriate, given all the right-wing fever in the country." A spoof on a Bach 
cantata, with lyrics by Craig Sturgis and music by Bach and Larry Moore, the 
piece is about a man who takes his lover home to Peoria for a Christmas dinner, 
uncertain if he should reveal the true nature of their relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's what every gay man goes through," says Bailey. "The outcome is, of 
course, that the family knew all along and that the lover was quite welcome. It 
shows the love and respect appropriate to the holidays." 
</P>
<P>
 After intermission, the second half kicks off with "Carol's Cabaret," a 
takeoff on customary holiday tunes in which choristers dressed as famous women 
named Carol -- as well as actor Carroll O'Connor -- sing "Wishing You a Drag 
Queen Christmas." Other selections are "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" 
and "Going on a Sleigh Ride." The latter is danced by a chorus line. At the end 
of this section, chorus members surround the audience for a sing-along. 
</P>
<P>
 The last section, "Masters in This Hall," features English carols and takes 
place in an English manor hall setting, wherein Father Christmas welcomes the 
singers to a grand banquet. Songs include "Deck the Halls," arranged by Libby 
Larson, "O Little Town of Bethlehem," sung by a chamber chorus, and a version 
of "God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen." 
</P>
<P>
 In this section, too, is "Silent Night," performed first in English and 
Spanish and concluding with the chorus using sign language instead of singing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's quite moving to see," according to Bailey. "We've had a number of our 
concerts signed because we've had deaf people in the audience." 
</P>
<P>
 The Christmas concerts mark the chorus' third time at the Alex, and they'll be 
performing for an audience that Bailey estimates is 80% gay. While theater 
personnel have been supportive, the group's presence has elicited some 
controversy in the community, Bailey notes with frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Glendale is not a liberal city," he says. "We've sung at the Dorothy Chandler 
Pavilion, the Orange County Center for the Performing Arts. What's wrong with 
singing at the Alex Theatre? We're a legitimate arts organization, and we're 
paying good money to sing there." 
</P>
<P>
 But, he adds, "we certainly have an agenda -- of gay people reaching out 
through our music, building bridges through the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, such a mission can enhance performance quality, says Bailey's 
colleague Dr. Stan Hill, director of the San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus. "Jon 
is a respected conductor and gets a fine sound out of the chorus, beyond just 
tone and diction," he says. "There's a heightened sense of self, of purpose, a 
good sense of getting the message out that, 'It's OK. We're not freaks. This is 
who we are and we happen to do what we do very well.' I listen to them as a 
musician and I hear an enthusiasm, a vibrance." 
</P>
<P>
 Agenda or no, Bailey also has a goal particularly befitting the season. 
"People bring all sorts of baggage to a concert like this -- their own 
expectations and needs," he says. "This is the hardest concert of the year to 
program -- it should be a 'warm fuzzy.' I want to give the people something. My 
hope is that they'll go away from the concert feeling really fed in their 
hearts."

REALM OF FREE SPIRITS; CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE IS DISPLAYING 102 COSTUMED PUPPETS 
FROM AROUND THE WORLD AT THE ART ANNEX. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY KAPITANOFF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Nancy Kapitanoff writes regularly 
about art for The Times.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Throughout the ages, people have turned to puppets to express what they have 
been unwilling or unable to say and do on their own. For in the realm of 
puppetry, nothing is off limits. 
</P>
<P>
 A statement that accompanies the Cal State Northridge Art Galleries' current 
exhibit, "The World of Puppets," aptly conveys the free-spirited nature of this 
performance art: "The puppet is free from human limitations: It can throw 
itself to the ground in a way no human actor or dancer could do. It can speak 
the unspeakable and deal with taboos, deal with all our dark sides; it can 
portray an ideal or emotions which cannot be expressed in any other way. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 One can readily imagine what the 102 puppets from almost 25 countries on 
display in the campus' Art Annex have said in their "lifetimes." Although they 
are inanimate here, their expressive faces, vivid, authentic costumes and the 
careful way they are positioned on puppet-size stages richly evoke the joys of 
their performances. 
</P>
<P>
 Puppets on display date from the early 20th Century to the present, and almost 
all are from the collection of puppeteer Alan Cook of Altadena. There are 
string puppets, also known as marionettes, that are operated from above; hand 
puppets, rod puppets or a combination of the two, that are controlled from 
below; and shadow puppets -- flat puppets illuminated from the back, creating a 
shadow. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook started collecting puppets shortly before his fifth birthday. He has been 
doing puppet exhibits since the 1950s and has more than 2,000 puppets in his 
collection. Indeed, an ongoing exhibit at Palos Verdes Art Center features some 
of Cook's puppets. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is as educational as anything gets. This was multicultural before it was 
fashionable," Cook said, pointing to his cornucopia of small, colorful figures. 
 
</P>
<P>
 He took his first class in puppetry when he was in the second grade. According 
to Cook, "Puppetry gives you the impetus to learn math, English, art, a foreign 
language. It is a way of making the language interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was also interested in animation when I was little -- things moving. You 
can learn a lot from animals -- how they move. You can use it in puppetry." 
</P>
<P>
 Puppets are also "a way of reminding us of history," Cook said, showing off 
one from Japan that once helped keep a local Japanese family in touch with its 
Japanese culture. They had to store it in a garage during World War II. 
Puppets, Cook believes, can fulfill the "need to emphasize and share good 
things when things are bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Among others from Cook's collection, a "Pink Poodle Ballerina" is the creation 
of widely known American puppeteer Frank Paris. Another puppet-maker, Don 
Cordry, was an American who lived in Mexico but made the Russian puppets 
"Smirnov," "Elena Popova" and the "Maid" -- characters from a Chekhov play -- 
in 1929. Also on display are puppets from a Mexican puppet theater company, 
which date from the 1930s to the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit was organized by Phil Morrison, a CSUN professor of art history 
and a puppeteer. He attended his first puppet show when he was 7, and he's been 
fascinated with puppets since. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a little theater in someone's garage," Morrison said. "It was 
before TV. I had never seen any live entertainment. The next summer, the fellow 
who did the puppet show taught kids how to build marionettes." 
</P>
<P>
 Morrison attended that class and started performing with puppets while still 
in elementary school. He designed CSUN's first puppet program, which he taught 
for four years. One of the puppets he has made, a clown, is in the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Puppets are an exaggeration of a feature or a character," Morrison said. 
"They are very small, very intimate. They need to be seen up close. With puppet 
shows and performances, there are always wonderful things that will happen."

COVER STORY; THE CURE FOR MALL WITHDRAWAL AND BOUTIQUE ENVY IS JUST AROUND THE 
CORNER. THE VALLEY IS HOME TO A NUMBER OF . . .; GREAT FINDS

 Since the walls of several local malls came tumbling down in January, some 
Valleyites have been suffering from shopping envy. You know what that is: the 
conviction that there are people out there having more fun than you are because 
they can walk to the shabby chic boutiques of Santa Monica's Montana Avenue or 
shop to satiety in South Coast Plaza. But not to worry. Although Northridge 
Fashion Center and other retail venues are still recovering from the quake, the 
San Fernando Valley remains home to a host of first-rate shops. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are eight of the best, from a choice gift shop in Studio City to a store 
in Burbank that gives new meaning to the term weird science . Some vast, some 
so tiny they could use traffic control, each offers something more for your 
money than the goods you walk out with. They are listed geographically, from 
west to east. Best to call for hours, especially during the holidays. And, 
Westsiders, eat your hearts out. Pages Bookstore 
</P>
<P>
 What most distinguishes this Tarzana children's bookstore from so many others 
is its staff. As owner Darlene Daniel explains (in a voice so soft she makes 
Mister Rogers sound like a fishmonger), Pages is staffed by former teachers and 
others with child-development backgrounds. Each is trained in-house to direct 
customers, large and small, to those books most likely to inform them, thrill 
them, comfort them -- in short, do all the things that only books can do. 
</P>
<P>
 How different is Pages from some discount stores? "When we go to recommend a 
book, many times we've read it," says manager Marge Kassorla, who retired from 
teaching English at Millikin Middle School and Grant High School and often 
recognizes the names of former students on the checks they write to the shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Pages stocks more than 18,000 titles, everything from picture books to young 
adult titles, including fantasy and books dealing with sex and other issues. 
Daniel thinks it's vital to provide teen-agers with books that will keep them 
reading for pleasure. "That's a stage where it's very easy to lose them from 
reading," she says grimly. 
</P>
<P>
 Pages publishes a quarterly newsletter that recommends new titles and 
announces its story hours, signings by authors and illustrators, concerts and 
other activities. The staff can help you choose a year's worth of books for a 
favorite young person, then wrap one up and send it off each month. And the 
store collects "wish lists" from local teachers and librarians so you can 
donate a book to the school on your child's birthday or some other occasion. As 
Kassorla says, "It's a nice alternative to cupcakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Pages Books for Children and Young Adults, 18399 Ventura Blvd., Tarzana, (818) 
342-6657. Gus' Smoke Shop  
</P>
<P>
 This Sherman Oaks shop is a Valley institution. According to owner Jim 
Hurwitz, it has been in the same spot since 1927, making it the oldest business 
still on Ventura Boulevard. Gus' is definitely a guy thing, filled with men 
staring like jack-lighted deer at sweet-scented boxes of Macanudos and other 
high-end cigars. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurwitz himself was a customer for 10 years before he bought the shop in 1985. 
Ever since, he has been riding the wave of the cigar's remarkable resurgence. 
Gus' doesn't stock coffees or other stuff that will distract from a good smoke, 
which can cost $10. "Our philosophy is to smoke better, but fewer," Hurwitz 
counsels. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohibas and other contraband Cuban cigars still have the most panache among 
aficionados, although Hurwitz warns that many smuggled into the United States 
are inferior knockoffs. Right now, premium cigars from the Dominican Republic 
are selling so well he can't keep up with demand. Regulars (who include actors 
Joe Montegna and Joe Pesci) can season their cigars in lockers in Gus' 
climate-controlled humidor. And on Oct. 1, the shop opened a private club next 
door, called the Back Room, where members can watch sports, play cards and, 
above all, "smoke in peace." Annual membership: $500. 
</P>
<P>
 Gus' Smoke Shop, 13420 Ventura Blvd., Sherman Oaks, (818) 789-1401. Star 
Restaurant Equipment and Supply 
</P>
<P>
 For a serious foodie, a restaurant supply store is a field of dreams. These 
are places where it is possible to imagine the pleasure of constructing a 
cassoulet without ever having to determine the precise nature of potted goose 
or even whether you can make it in an average lifetime. Instead you cruise the 
aisles, visions of rapid-fire mincing, precision dicing and doing unspeakable 
things with pastry bags dancing in your head. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooks feel about restaurant supply stores the way writers feel about 
stationers. But for the non-pro, the first hurdle may be getting through the 
door. Some of these places sell only to the trade. "Out! Out!" one of those 
exclusive proprietors yelled at an acquaintance when he confessed he had no 
restaurant affiliation and only made timbales on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The people at Star in Van Nuys won't scream at you even if you've never worn a 
toque. Recently, for instance, Mickey Crocker emerged from the store bearing a 
brown plastic cocktail tray with a non-skid cork surface. An actress, Crocker 
remembered this kind of tray from her cocktail-waitressing days and had bought 
one for $12.55 to use when she serves hot chocolate while playing Mrs. Claus in 
a children's musical called "Santa Claus Conquers the Martians" in La Mirada. 
</P>
<P>
 As manager Les Birken explains, Star has been in the Valley for more than 30 
years. The store stocks or can order everything a restaurant or home cook 
needs, from professional stoves to sink-size salad bowls. Star has plastic 
cafeteria trays, $500 hot dog rotisseries, industrial-strength aprons, those 
great stainless-steel-and-glass sugar dispensers that coffee shops favor and 
serious knives. Currently, professional muffin tins are selling like crazy. 
Birken hasn't the foggiest idea why. 
</P>
<P>
 Star Restaurant Equipment and Supply, 6178 Sepulveda Blvd., Van Nuys, (818) 
782-4460. Emerald Forest  
</P>
<P>
 On a recent trip to Emerald Forest, a tiny gift shop in Studio City's 
Coldwater Curve, a customer mentioned that she had come into the store because 
there was nothing like it where she lives -- in San Francisco. Owner Michelle 
Rack looks for the unusual, the charming, the finely crafted. This is high-end 
Valley shopping. Rack's regulars don't grow pale at the thought of paying $17 
for a cake of handmade soap that smells like Christmas and would make a darling 
hostess gift. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides cachepots, picture frames, bath things, pretty baskets and other 
gifts, Rack has lots of jewelry. She is especially proud of a line she and 
jeweler friend Julia designed and produce themselves, called the Gingerbread 
Family (they've trademarked the name). Custom-made of silver or gold, these are 
little gingerbread men and women, boys and girls, even pets, personalized with 
the names of family members and fashioned into bracelets, pins and other 
pieces. Items start at $42, and Rack says she gets orders from as far away as 
Japan, from people who have admired a piece and asked where they could get one. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, Emerald Forest opened an annex a few stores up devoted to 
personalized stationery, custom invitations, pens, journals and other mostly 
paper objects. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerald Forest, 12638 Ventura Blvd., Studio City, (818) 509-8529. The 
stationer is at 12660 Ventura Blvd., (818) 509-0798. The Harmonica Store  
</P>
<P>
 Many a shop owner will claim their establishment is unique. The Harmonica 
Store really is. According to Hohner, the German manufacturer that sets the 
standard for the industry, this North Hollywood shop is the only one in the 
United States devoted entirely to promoting and selling harmonicas. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners Marv Wolfe and Mickey Milgrim-Wolfe opened their doors in May, 1993. As 
Marv explains, he noticed that harmonicas got short shrift in ordinary music 
stores. But Marv, who turns 86 on Dec. 30, remembered the great harmonicists of 
his salad days, people like the irrepressible Borrah Minevitch, and thought, 
"That's a great little instrument. Why are they treating it like a stepchild?" 
</P>
<P>
 Marv became a man with a mission, especially after he verified at the library 
that the world wasn't glutted with harmonica stores. A violinist and seasoned 
businesswoman, Mickey agreed to do the buying and decorating, choosing 
"black-and-white tile to look like a piano." 
</P>
<P>
 The shop carries toy harmonicas for kids and a $10 Hohner for anyone who 
dreams of unleashing the Borrah Minevitch within. The store also offers 
classes. But this is, above all, a serious specialty shop. Staffer Stephen 
Close, who plays under the name Grievin' Stephen, is there to answer the 
questions of musicians looking for instruments, amps, microphones and those 
neck harness things that Dylan wears so he can play the harmonica and the 
guitar at the same time.  
</P>
<P>
 Nearby music studios help fuel the business. Not long ago, says Close, country 
singer Clint Black, who was recording around the corner at Lighthouse, whizzed 
by on his skateboard, saw the sign, then came in and ordered 20 harmonicas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Harmonica Store, 5151 Whitsett Ave., North Hollywood, (818) 787-9457. Arte 
de Mexico  
</P>
<P>
 Arte de Mexico may be the most remarkable thing in North Hollywood. Its 
75,000-square-foot complex of warehouses is packed with handcrafted furniture, 
lighting and tchotchkes, from Mexico, yes, but also from Morocco, Nepal, 
Pakistan, the Philippines and South Africa. This is the place to come for your 
armoire hand-painted with palms and parrots, your table made from a 
wrought-iron grill, your decorative ostrich eggs.  
</P>
<P>
 Vice President David Stoffers, son of founder G. J. Stoffers, helps move the 
product by creating theatrical vignettes. As a result, the store has the feel 
of an enormous sound stage where a thousand movies are being shot at once. 
"It's a visual venue," says Stoffers. "It's a Disneyland for designers." 
</P>
<P>
 Custom work is Arte de Mexico's specialty. Someone (let's call him a rock 
star) spots a wooden door from an ancient temple, and for $12,000 Arte will 
turn it into the headboard of an enormous bed with recessed lighting. The 
store's line of handcrafted antler furniture is really hot right now, says 
Stoffers, who notes that all those moose and deer horns were naturally shed, 
then collected by Boy Scouts and other gatherers. No wonder people bring 
out-of-town friends and relatives here to gawk. "It's an adult toy store," 
Stoffers says. "Anyone who's looking for a full-sized horse -- in wood -- we 
have it." 
</P>
<P>
 Arte de Mexico, 5356 Riverton Ave., North Hollywood, (818) 769-5090. 
Geographia  
</P>
<P>
 Since this Burbank shop opened in 1986, it has become a magnet for Valleyites 
who think travel is what God created as penance for creating work. 
</P>
<P>
 Going to Kuala Lumpur? Geographia has a wide choice of books by visitors who 
have gone before, plus reference and coffee-table books and guidebooks, 
including the hip Lonely Planet series and the stylishly written Cadogan 
guides. Best of all, you can get maps here as well and begin learning the new 
turf long before there's any real chance you'll get lost on it. "We're real 
serious about maps," says owner Brian Draper, who majored in geography at Cal 
State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Geographia stocks many of the accessories that make travel more comfortable, 
including security items for scaring off hotel intruders and for stashing money 
in your underwear. It has globes, atlases, language tapes. Interested in 
cybertravel? You can get software, such as Thomas Brothers guides on CD-ROM. 
Draper also stocks GPS (for Global Positioning System) receivers. These allow 
you to determine exactly where you are anywhere on earth by reading signals 
from orbiting satellites. Industry people use the devices to scout locations 
and pinpoint where the sun will be before the cameras start rolling. "I've also 
sold them to people interested in exploring in the desert and up in the 
mountains," says Draper. "They're a lot more sophisticated than a compass." 
Pricier, too, starting at about $800. 
</P>
<P>
 Geographia Map & Travel Bookstore, 4000 Riverside Drive, Burbank, (818) 
848-1414. Tri-Ess Sciences 
</P>
<P>
 You have to see this place to truly understand it. Located in an industrial 
area of Burbank, Tri-Ess is really several businesses in one. It is a 
special-effects business that supplies smoke, some of it developed by founder 
Ira Katz, and other products, including makeup materials, to the entertainment 
industry. That's why Tri-Ess recently sent a large shipment of violet smoke to 
a film company in Sydney, Australia, that is shooting a Mighty Morphin Power 
Rangers movie. (You read it here first.) The company also fabricates and rents 
props. But the reason it is on our list is because of its showroom, open to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 Think of Tri-Ess as Wal-Mart for Dr. Frankenstein. Need a $400 life-size 
plastic skeleton? You can get one here, as did the man who put one under the 
Christmas tree for his artist wife. (Personal-injury attorneys also shop here 
for plastic body parts that will make juries sit up and take notice.) Need half 
a cup of hydrochloric acid or a single test tube or a dead frog suitable for 
dissecting? Tri-Ess is the place. 
</P>
<P>
 For decades, explains Katz's daughter, Kim Greenfield, the store has been 
catering to schoolchildren. "We have something we call science-project season 
when the little darlings come in with not a clue as what to do." Tri-Ess offers 
advice and an extensive selection of science books and kits. And Tri-Ess will 
be happy to sell you the electrical switch or preserved sheep's eye that could 
set your child off on a trajectory to the Nobel Prize.

ENTERTAINMENT NEWS; BACK IN THE SADDLE; SINGER FREDDY FENDER WILL MAKE A RETURN 
APPEARANCE AT THE PALOMINO, WHERE COUNTRY MUSIC ONCE AGAIN REIGNS SUPREME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES E. FOWLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For more than 30 years, the Palomino Club in North Hollywood was the center of 
the Los Angeles country-western music scene. Started in 1952 by brothers Tommy 
and Billy Thomas, the venue was not only a showcase for country music acts, it 
was also a hangout for local and touring artists and record-company people. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the deaths of the Thomas brothers, the club changed into a rock 
venue in the early '90s and only since Sherry Thomas, Tommy's widow, took 
control in May has the club returned to the style of music that was its 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 Adhering to that new policy, Tex-Mex singer Freddy Fender will appear at the 
Palomino on Dec. 23 and 24. National country acts like Fender used to be a 
staple at the Palomino in the 1960s and '70s, along with local upcoming 
artists. Fender first played the Palomino in 1975, the year he started scoring 
hits with such tunes as "Before the Next Teardrop Falls" and "Wasted Days and 
Wasted Nights." 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the Universal Amphitheatre, major acts came here to play," Thomas 
says. She acknowledges that it's more difficult today to schedule national 
acts, but "you can come in here seven nights a week and hear good quality, live 
music. Dwight Yoakam came back. Freddy Fender is coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 Born Baldemar Huerta in Texas in 1937, Fender began his musical career in 
1956, took a three-year detour to prison in 1960 for a marijuana arrest and 
finally achieved stardom in 1975. During the 1980s, he battled money and 
substance-abuse problems, and lost his record deal. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, Fender has come back into the musical spotlight as a member of 
the Texas Tornados, along with Doug Sahm, Flaco Jimenez and Augie Meyers. The 
Tornados won a Grammy in 1990 for best Mexican-American performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Fender fondly remembers the better times at the Palomino. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that Sherry has taken over," Fender said by telephone from Texas, "I 
wanted to be part of the Palomino's coming back. Once you play at the Palomino, 
you want to play there again." 
</P>
<P>
 Freddy Fender will perform at 9 p.m. Dec. 23 and 24 at the Palomino, 6907 
Lankershim Blvd., North Hollywood. Tickets are $15 Dec. 23 and $10 Dec. 24. 
Call (818) 764-4018.

 ON THE RADIO: Funk / blues performer Johnny (Guitar) Watson's concert Saturday 
night at B. B. King's Blues Club on Universal CityWalk will be the first 
installment of a new radio concert series that will be broadcast to more than 
70 stations nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The "B. B. King Blues Hour," which will originate each month from the 
Universal City club, will be broadcast over the ABC Radio Network. Glenn Cosby, 
ABC Radio Network program director in Dallas, says the initial program 
featuring Watson will be taped for broadcast in early January, but subsequent 
shows will be broadcast live. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be a forum for real artists," Cosby says, "people who can perform 
without recording wizardry." Cosby says several artists have already expressed 
interest in performing on the new program, including Al Jarreau, Chante Moore, 
Howard Hewitt (formerly of Shalimar) and Johnny Gill. 
</P>
<P>
 The radio show does not yet have a Los Angeles radio outlet. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson, 59, had a string of funk hits in the mid-1970s, including "Superhuman 
Lover" and "A Real Mother for Ya." But it was as a blues guitarist that he 
originally made his mark in the music business in the early 1950s. His song, 
"Gangster of Love," was covered by Steve Miller in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bow Wow," his first album in more than 12 years, was recently released. 
Watson's music has been exposed to a new generation of listeners because it has 
been electronically sampled by such rap artists as Snoop Doggy Dog, Dr. Dre and 
Ice Cube. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's exciting to be back in the mainstream," Watson says. "Fortunately, a lot 
of rappers and young people are sampling my catalogue. I've always had a fan 
base, but now I'm getting a lot of new people. It's really wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny (Guitar) Watson will perform at 9:30 p.m. Saturday at the B. B. King 
Blues Club, Universal CityWalk. Sold out. Call (818) 622-5464.

 MOVIN' ON: The adopted motto of American Renegade Theatre, festooned on a 
banner outside the space at 11306 Magnolia Blvd. in North Hollywood, is "Come 
and Enjoy the Magic of Live Theater." 
</P>
<P>
 But a better one might be: "If You Can't Get It Fixed, Get Out." After 
suffering some of the worst damage of any San Fernando Valley theater from the 
January earthquake (which forced the closure of the larger of its two theater 
spaces), and after being unable to gain government funding to pay for an 
estimated $100,000 in repairs, Artistic Director David Cox and his staff was 
informed in October by landlord Nicholas Papanicolaou that the building complex 
American Renegade occupies would be demolished. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox, as a founder of the Valley Theatre League and a key promoter of the NoHo 
Arts District, wanted to remain in the neighborhood and already knew what 
viable properties were available. On the same day that Papanicolaou told him 
the news, Cox and administrative assistant Dawn Mari found a vacant former 
musicians rehearsal space at 11136 Magnolia Blvd. that both believed could be 
converted into a theater. Quickly closing the deal, American Renegade agreed to 
assume the mortgage with no money down and $21,000 in escrow costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're totally gutting the building," says Cox, who found Simi Valley-based 
architect Dudley Wynkoop to build the new theater to the company's 
specifications. Plans include a "London Soho-style facade and marquee," cafe 
and foyer, a 99-seat theater featuring a 34-seat balcony in a space with a 
23-foot ceiling, backstage green room and an upstairs rehearsal-workshop space 
convertible to a second theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Although fund-raising for the move is paramount, Mari says, "there's some key 
funding we're waiting on right now that will affect what we do." 
</P>
<P>
 Further funding may be provided by the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment 
Agency, which is involved with housing and building renewal in the arts 
district.

BEAUTY BY THE STEM; A TRIP TO A FLORAL SHOP CAN BE ONE OF LIFE'S SWEETEST 
PLEASURES. THE VALLEY OFFERS A BOUQUET OF STORES WITH A DAZZLING ARRAY OF 
CHOICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

gardening for The Times.

<P>
 For many people, flower shopping is seldom the big event it used to be. A 
mixed bouquet may be had for a few bucks at a grocery store or farmers' market 
(there are three certified in the San Fernando Valley). Or you can stay in your 
pajamas and order the same thing via phone. But anyone who doesn't visit a 
flower shop once in a while is missing one of life's pleasures. 
</P>
<P>
 A good shop carries a dazzling array of fresh-cut blooms. Salespeople can help 
with floral choices -- whether for a holiday feast or a beloved's birthday -- 
and arrange to have your picks delivered, wrapped and tied with a bow. 
</P>
<P>
 Price tags, of course, are higher on shop flowers, but their longer vase-life, 
coupled with the selection florists offer, can make them worth it. To ensure 
value, though, it doesn't hurt to inquire about when flowers were bought and 
how long they're likely to last. 
</P>
<P>
 The following shops are known for the freshness and quality of their blooms as 
well as for their often unusual selections. 
</P>
<P>
 Dried garlands festoon the walls of the Enchanted Florist, a Burbank shop done 
to the nines in French country style. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimberly Randolph, who owns the store, buys her flowers fresh daily from small 
Ventura County growers and displays them on tables and in a cooler open to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 She carries a good selection of imports -- Dutch dahlias and tulips, Hawaiian 
dendrobiums and the huge Ecuadorean roses that are so popular now. Lilies of 
the valley and La Reve lilies are among her less common offerings, which also 
include novel greenery: maple leaves, fresh wheat, seeded eucalyptus. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices fluctuate with availability and season, but Dutch tulips sell for about 
$1.95 a stem, spray roses and colored calla lilies about $2.95 a stem, and more 
exotic items such as dendrobiums, $6.95. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A bit downscale but equally charming is A Touch of Romance, a former gas 
station reborn as a flower shop. Owner John Glebocki's Sherman Oaks operation 
is simple: no refrigeration, less overhead, lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
 But lest this conjure up the daisy buckets of volume flower stores, Glebocki's 
wares arrive daily from small growers around the world. Tiger lilies from New 
Zealand, pine boughs from Japan and proteas from South Africa join Latin 
American and local roses in his shop. In addition to unusual greens -- 
horsetail and bear grass, New Zealand flax -- there are gingers and heliconias 
in neon colors, as well as spray cymbidiums and Dolce Vita lilies. Again, 
prices vary, but Ecuadorean roses that sell for $60 elsewhere average $30 here, 
and orchids, lilies and other favorites also tend to be priced at a few dollars 
less than the competition. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 At Sassafras Nursery in Topanga Canyon, the rustic garden shed where blooms 
are sold is an extension of the English cottage world outside. Indoors, cut 
delphiniums, lilies, lisianthus and Queen Anne's lace suggest the beloved 
groupings around someone's picket fence. 
</P>
<P>
 But in addition to such romantic picks, brought in from the Downtown flower 
market, the nursery offers its own home-grown surprises: cut water lilies, 
violets and David Austen roses. Although the first two don't appear till 
spring, the roses (priced from $1 to $3 a stem) are more generally available, 
except during winter frosts. Sassafras also grows a lot of bulb flowers, which 
can be had from fall through winter by the stem or in potted form. Cut 
narcissus sell for about $1 a stem, or $10.50 and up by the pot. Late-winter 
tulips begin at $15 by the pot and $1.50 to $5 by the stem.

 A hot-pink sign marks the Encino corner of Casa de Flores, a floral emporium 
of the old school. Owner Jack Hasson buys almost every day from farms in Santa 
Barbara, Ventura and Oxnard, as well as from Mayesh Wholesale Florist in Van 
Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is a dizzying spread, from tuberoses (usually about 99 cents a 
stem) to freesias (about $7.95 a bunch) to extra-large Hawaiian gingers (about 
$4.95 a stem) to the requisite Ecuadorean roses ($49.95 a dozen). On any day, 
the shop might feature roses from seven countries in addition to unusual 
fillers and potted plants.

 At the other end of the style spectrum is Jasmine Blue on the edge of 
Universal City. Here, relaxed naturalism meets contemporary cool in a 1932 Art 
Deco building. White walls hung with plants, a cement floor and a wooden hutch 
filled with Indonesian vases set the tone for the shop. Owner Dokhi Chambers 
not only specializes in the unexpected -- huge, jewel-colored peonies, nosegays 
of flowering basil -- but she also tucks in oak leaves, eucalyptus pods and 
pepper berries and wraps bouquets in tissue paper and ribbon. She buys 
regularly from Ventura County growers and carries local and imported roses ($25 
to $85 a dozen) and a wide range of field flowers (usually 99 cents to $2.50 a 
stem). The latter include anemones in vivid shades and deep maroon dianthus 
edged with white. She also stocks dried flowers, which she dries herself and 
sells for about 25 cents to 50 cents more per stem than the same flowers fresh.

 Buying from a farmers market drastically cuts the price of flowers. Unlike a 
florist, who has the overhead of a shop, a grower can fill a truck with 
just-picked flowers, drive to an open-air event and sell fistfuls for the price 
of a florist's single bloom. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent visit to the Calabasas Certified Farmers Market -- where two Oxnard 
growers, Sunrise Ranch and Skyline Flowers, had stalls -- yielded these prices: 
$3.50 to $4 for a six-stem bunch of sunflowers (often $2 to $4 a stem at 
florists); $4 for a large bunch of stargazer lilies ($5 a stem and more at a 
shop); $6 for a dozen red roses (shop prices begin two or three times higher). 
</P>
<P>
 There are no amenities, of course. You can't pick and choose among the stems, 
your purchase is wrapped in a newspaper and you can't have it delivered. And 
since these markets are held in the Valley only once a week, you're out of luck 
if you need posies on a weekday.

BARGAINS / GERI COOK: SAVINGS AND SPARKLE; BITAR JEWELERS IN SHERMAN OAKS IS A 
TINY STORE THAT OFFERS EXPERT CRAFTSMANSHIP AT EXCEPTIONALLY LOW PRICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 At gift-giving time the average consumer turns to fine jewelry more than ever. 
But finding a trust worthy jeweler can be tricky; add artistic and reasonable 
to trustworthy and it becomes twice as hard. 
</P>
<P>
 For almost 10 years I have been dealing with a small jewelry shop in Sherman 
Oaks owned by two cousins -- Albert and Emile Bitar, both master jewelers -- 
who design and supervise a team of craftsmen to carry out their creations. 
</P>
<P>
 The actual store is tiny -- if 10 shoppers are in the store at one time, 
they're bumping into each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the display and sales area is the workroom, twice the size of the 
store, where the manufacturing takes place -- so you are actually shopping at 
the factory. The workmanship is top caliber and the quality of gemstones is 
excellent. 
</P>
<P>
 On a television commercial that's currently airing, a jewelry manufacturer 
claims to have the best prices in town. Not true. Bitar's prices on tennis 
bracelets, for example, are much better. 
</P>
<P>
 A one-carat diamond tennis bracelet set in 14-karat gold that sells at many 
stores for around $600 and at a few discounters for $450 to $500 is $325 here. 
A two-carat bracelet would retail for $1,000 to $1,200, but Bitar's price is 
$525. If you want to splurge and go for three carats it's $625, compared to 
$1,400 to $1,600 elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 But are tennis bracelets still in? The answer is a resounding "yes." They are 
now classics that any woman would love. 
</P>
<P>
 This is also the time of year when many a gentleman pops the question and, to 
underscore his commitment, has a sparkler in his pocket. If he bought that 
sparkler at Bitar's, he'd make a big impression for a lot less money. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, engagement rings and wedding sets are discounted an additional 
20% on top of prices that have already been reduced 40% to 60%. A yellow gold 
engagement ring with a solitaire marquis diamond, surrounded by two marquis and 
six baguette diamonds, channel set, has a total weight of 1.04 carats. 
Regularly, this would sell for $3,200 here, compared to an an average retail 
price of $5,000. With the extra 20% discount, it's $2,560. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All rings are on sale with the same 20% reduction. A diamond and round-cut 
sapphire cocktail ring surrounded by four marquis diamonds and round diamonds, 
channel set, sells for $1,150, but with 20% off it comes to $920. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale price on a 14-karat gold man's ring with one beveled-set round 
diamond on one corner and an angled onyx on another is $620. At many stores 
this ring would be at least $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
 A nice selection for children includes 14-karat gold bangle bracelets for 
little girls at $65 to $90 (average retail $125 to $190) and 14-karat gold ID 
bracelets at $45 to $90 (average retail $85 to $150) for boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Citizen, Seiko and Julius Jergenson watches for men and women are always 
discounted 35%. Currently, there also is a 50% reduction on sterling pieces, 
which includes bracelets, chains, charms ($5 to $30), rings, money clips ($35) 
and key holders ($35). 
</P>
<P>
 There are definitely some sparkling gifts at some dazzling prices.

PROMOTING HARMONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HAMMERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first year of a divorce or separation is the toughest on both parents and 
children. Here are some suggestions to get through that first Christmas: 
</P>
<P>
 * Take your children shopping to purchase a gift, or help them make a gift for 
their other parent. "That sends the message that it is OK to love and care 
about both parents," says Stefanie Somers, a family mediator with Los Angeles 
County's Parents & Children Together program. 
</P>
<P>
 * Encourage children to talk about their feelings. "Christmas is the strongest 
emotional time of the year," said Woodland Hills psychologist Diane Ross 
Glazer, who specializes in children's issues. "Children mourn the loss of 
having a picture-book Christmas with one, big, happy family sitting around a 
fire. Allow them to express how sad they are." 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep holiday rituals as intact as possible. If some family customs cannot be 
maintained, replace them with new, equally wonderful rituals. Theresa DePaolo, 
for instance, will no longer host an annual Christmas party, as the gala was 
primarily attended by her estranged husband's business associates. Instead, she 
is planning an informal, potluck supper "caroling party." "We are going to hire 
someone with a keyboard and invite people and their children and do a sing," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Newly divorced couples should celebrate the holidays separately. While 
getting together for the sake of the kids sounds like a nice idea, it actually 
confuses youngsters. "Children frequently harbor a fantasy of Mom and Dad 
getting back together," said Rob Kaufman, an Encino licensed clinical social 
worker. "If you come together for the holidays, you give children a false sense 
of hope." 
</P>
<P>
 * If your children will spend Christmas with their other parent, make plans 
for yourself. Spend the day with friends or family; volunteer for charity; take 
a trip -- but don't spend the day alone, wallowing in loneliness and sorrow. 
"All too often, parents put their own needs aside and throw themselves into 
their children," Kaufman said. "But it is important for them to activate their 
own support network to get through this time. After all, a parent who is not 
emotionally healthy will not raise a healthy child." MARYANN HAMMERS

TRYING TIME AGAIN; CHRISTMAS CAN BE DIFFICULT FOR CHILDREN OF SEPARATED OR 
DIVORCED PARENTS. KEY TO COPING IS COOPERATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

The Times.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Last May, when Theresa DePaolo and her husband broke the news to their 7- and 
2-year-old daughters that the couple was separating, the oldest girl had two 
questions. "Is it my fault?" she first asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Her second question was: "What about Christmas?" 
</P>
<P>
 At that moment, DePaolo said, she was so overcome with sadness that she "could 
barely stand up straight," much less fret about a holiday several months away. 
"But ever since then, I have been giving a lot of thought to it. Christmas is 
an incredibly important holiday for little kids. I will not let our personal 
problems and differences -- which are very great -- get in the way of parenting 
our kids." 
</P>
<P>
 DePaolo plans to help her daughters make a gift for their dad, and she has 
invited him over to watch the kids open their presents. "The day is not 
complete if they don't spend a part of it with him," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The holidays are stressful -- and often depressing -- for just about everyone, 
but the season is particularly trying for children of parents who are separated 
or divorced. Children are likely to feel the brunt of the pain, especially if 
they become enmeshed in their parents' conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first holiday after a divorce or separation is the most difficult for 
children because it validates the reality that the divorce is real, and they 
will never live with Mom and Dad again," said Rob Kaufman, an Encino licensed 
clinical social worker who leads divorce support groups. "To help their 
children deal with divorce, parents can put aside their hurt and anger toward 
their spouse. They can do their best to get along for the sake of the 
children." 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Anderson of Agoura, for example, says he and his wife, Nancy -- who have 
been separated for four years -- attempt to "maintain a cooperative spirit" 
over the holidays. He keeps the longstanding family tradition of taking their 
two daughters, Genessa, 13, and Ashley, 16, to Disneyland on Christmas Eve, and 
the girls usually spend Christmas Day with their mother. Last year, the 
estranged couple even gave their daughters joint Christmas gifts. "Neither of 
us wants to short the other during this precious time of the year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Andersons' mutual cooperation is rare. "When people separate," Kaufman 
said, "they do so because they can't get along." He added that divorced parents 
often use the holidays as ammunition in the battle against each other. A 
mother, for example, may tell her children, "I can't buy you as many gifts as 
I'd like because your dad doesn't give us enough money," while the father may 
say, "I give all my money to your mother, so I can't buy you Christmas 
presents." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But such talk is painful for the child to hear. "It is harmful and 
uncomfortable to children when parents downgrade each other," said Nancy 
Satenberg, a licensed clinical social worker and family mediator with the Los 
Angeles County court system. "It is important for parents to be sensitive to 
their child's feelings about the other parent." 
</P>
<P>
 Melody, for example, says she hates it when her mother and father "talk trash" 
about each other. "If one is mad at the other about something, I don't want to 
know," said the Santa Clarita teen-ager who asked that her real name not be 
used. 
</P>
<P>
 But even parents who try to minimize conflict can inadvertently make things 
tough on kids, Kaufman said. "If a child is supposed to spend Christmas with 
Dad, for example, Mom may say, 'I know you have to go,' but she will have tears 
in her eyes. . . . As hard as it is, the parent has to put a smile on his or 
her face and give the child permission to have a good time on the holiday with 
the other parent." 
</P>
<P>
 Satenberg also cautions against allowing children to decide which parent to 
spend the holidays with. "It's really important for parents to have a plan and 
tell children -- even teen-agers -- where they are going to be." she said. "It 
is very difficult for children to choose one parent over another." 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line, said Satenberg, is that each parent should support and 
encourage the relationship the child has with the other. "That is the child's 
parent for the rest of his or her life," she said, "and part of the child is 
that other parent."

RESTAURANT REVIEW; WITH PLATES PILED HIGH; BURBANK'S CHEERY WILD THYME CAFE AND 
BAKERY OFFERS DISHES THAT APPEAL MAINLY BECAUSE OF THEIR MONSTROUS PORTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's getting to be cafe row up here in thoroughly modernized downtown, what 
with Crocodile Cafe, Market City Caffe and now Wild Thyme Cafe and Bakery, all 
within shouting distance of one another. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the three, the cheery, low-slung place called Wild Thyme is the most 
resolutely American. The interior is dominated by bright, almost futuristic 
wallpaper covered with red flowers, which contrast in curiously seasonal 
fashion with green booths the exact color of a certain popular toothpaste. The 
narrow tables are covered in butcher paper. A small market and bakery case sit 
near the front door, selling all-American balsamic vinegar and tiramisu. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the same lines as that culture-shock market, the menu is a mix of 
American-style comfort food entrees, such as a grainy turkey meat loaf, with 
wood-fired pizzas and complex pastas, plus a few non-controversial Pacific Rim 
shots. This makes sense -- one of the owners here is David Yost, from the 
family that brought you the Shakers chain and used to run the Bouzy Rouge Cafe, 
an innovative wine bar/restaurant down in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Yost is clearly trying hard; he has just put in a new menu that is more 
intelligent than the old one. But despite the good cheer and intentions, more 
effort is needed before most of these dishes will appeal on any level but 
portion size. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, that's what Wild Thyme gets by on. It may serve the very largest 
portions in the Southland. Salads big enough for four. A monstrous half-pound 
burger with trimmings galore. Enormous stuffed crepes lined with melted cheese 
and filled with meat. Carbo-happy side dishes like a corn- and pea-laced pasta 
salad (accompanying pizza , for goodness' sake). 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the pizzas are a good starting point, because they're probably the 
most reliable items. Their bubbly, well-kneaded crusts have an appealing hint 
of ash from the wood-fired brick oven. Avoid the gooey, overboard four-cheese 
pizza and the sticky-sweet Thai pizza, with its jam-like peanut sauce, and you 
should be happy with what you get. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of the stars of the new menu is the goat cheese pizza, which is unusually 
restrained for this place: a light sprinkling of goat cheese and bacon bits 
complementing the topping of red onion and Roma tomatoes. Pepperoni lovers 
can't go wrong ordering the pepperoni pizza, either, covered with a monster 
portion of that spicy sausage. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the other appetizers or salads I tasted, though, was worth a second 
bite. The watery, insipid Mediterranean chopped salad is a total loss. Another 
new item, a romaine and mixed-leaf salad with Gorgonzola cheese and crushed 
walnuts, comes closer to the mark, but though the concept is good, in the end 
it's done in by the overdose of cheese and nuts, plus an obscene amount of 
balsamic vinaigrette. 
</P>
<P>
 The deep-fried Southwest ravioli are no longer on the menu. I will not miss 
them, nor will I again order the flaccid chicken won tons as a substitute. As 
for the deep-fried spicy chicken wings, they are purely one-dimensional kid's 
food, and the wings themselves are so uniform in size the effect is positively 
industrial. 
</P>
<P>
 The entrees are better. The hamburger is good, though if I order it a second 
time -- it contains a half pound of meat -- I'll have the kitchen leave out the 
Swiss cheese and Thousand Island dressing (whew!). Even by Wild Thyme's 
standards, the restaurant's imposing and satisfying mixed grill -- two huge 
herbed sausages, a small slab of tender baby back ribs and a half chicken 
breast -- is huge. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm quite fond of the way the batter in the restaurant's fish and chips is 
herbed. The crunchy batter around flaky fish is one of the best values on the 
menu. 
</P>
<P>
 One more dish I'd order again is called white chili. This mildly seasoned 
white-bean chili is really a poor man's cassoulet, rich with pieces of cooked 
chicken and topped with a dollop of sour cream. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm betting you can deduce what a few of the desserts are like. Yep, gigantic 
things, all long on sugar and flour, short on taste. 
</P>
<P>
 You can get a huge, sugary slab of chocolate cake, lots of sweet, gummy 
cheesecakes or a buttered grilled pound cake with raspberry sauce and vanilla 
ice cream.  
</P>
<P>
 I'd almost like this last one, crazy as it sounds, were it not buried under a 
snowdrift of heavily aerated whipped cream. But then plain old hand-whipped 
cream wouldn't be true to Wild Thyme's huge-portions concept.

AT O.C. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, LOSSES AREN'T JUST ON PAPER; FALLOUT: TWO FAVORITE 
EMPLOYEES AT A MISSION VIEJO CAMPUS ARE LET GO. THEY ARE AMONG 47 DISTRICT 
LAYOFFS.

<P>
 The children of Glen Yermo are among the first to feel the pinch. 
</P>
<P>
 The little elementary school in Mission Viejo is losing two of its favorite 
people today, an office aide and a remedial reading instructor. Both were laid 
off by the Saddleback Valley Unified School District, along with 45 other 
unlucky employees whose paperwork didn't get approved before Orange County's 
"paper losses" were discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said Thursday that they were forced to terminate the newly 
hired teachers' aides, clerks and custodians because of Orange County's 
investment losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone used to say it's just on paper," said Pam Bragg, who did everything 
at Glen Yermo from taking attendance to taking temperatures. "Well, guess what? 
It's not on paper anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Letting Bragg and others go will save the district $50,000 a month, said 
Saddleback's executive director of personnel, Jennifer Huff. The district, 
which has 29,000 students and 1,200 teachers, had no choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why did Saddleback do this when several other districts did not?" Huff said. 
"It was because we were trying to be prudent and look at the big picture and 
not commit the district to any additional expenditures." 
</P>
<P>
 She stressed that district officials don't consider the action a layoff, but a 
"hiring freeze." 
</P>
<P>
 All Carol Harkins knows is that if she'd been hired one week sooner, she 
wouldn't be "frozen" now.  
</P>
<P>
 Harkins, who's been teaching remedial reading to nearly 40 children at Glen 
Yermo for the last six weeks, said she's not worried about herself, though her 
husband is also out of work. She's worried about the boys and girls in her five 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
 As the only person teaching one-on-one, intensive phonics at Glen Yermo, she 
fears there is now a void into which some slower students may tumble. 
</P>
<P>
 "Working with them in second and third grades makes a huge difference in how 
they read when they get to fourth and fifth grades," she said, moments after a 
school district clerk told her not to bother attending a big meeting for new 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Harkins nor Bragg admits to feeling any bitterness. Both hope to 
rejoin the district soon, and Harkins wonders if she can stay at Glen Yermo as 
a substitute. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was impossible Thursday to plan for the future when the present was a 
minefield of difficult goodbys. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as the children were concerned, Harkins couldn't bring herself to tell 
them she was leaving. Not when they were busy giving her homemade Christmas 
presents and candy. And certainly not during their Christmas party. 
</P>
<P>
 The students will have to discover in their own way and their own time that 
Mrs. Harkins is gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love my job," she said, smiling bravely. "We make nothing, although you get 
used to making nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Bragg's thoughts exactly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love my job," she said as her fellow office workers looked on sadly. "If 
you have to work, you want to be in a job you enjoy. They just made me feel 
right at home from the onset. It was nice, feeling you were doing something 
important. Even if it wasn't pulling in a hundred grand." 
</P>
<P>
 Directly across from Bragg's desk was a colorful wall display: a tree with 
pictures of Glen Yermo employees sprinkled throughout its branches. Beneath the 
tree, handcrafted letters read, "Glen Yermo Family." 
</P>
<P>
 When the women of the office noticed that Bragg's face was not part of the 
display, they told her she is part of the family, and vowed to add her picture 
at once. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a sign that you're coming back," one of the women told her. 
</P>
<P>
 Bragg smiled sadly. 
</P>
<P>
 With nothing to do Thursday afternoon, Harkins thought she might go to the 
malls. She wore a red Christmas sweatshirt, the word "JOY" embroidered across 
its front, a jarring contrast to her mood. 
</P>
<P>
 It would not be the shopping spree she anticipated only a few days ago, she 
said: 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a completely different Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 Every gift needs to be considered a little more carefully, said Bragg, who'd 
never been fired or laid off before this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think anyone in this position, that is counting on a job and doesn't have 
it, it's going to be difficult. When you're talking 20 hours a week, it's not 
that much, but it's that extra little padding. . . . The more I digest it, the 
angrier I get."

OFFICIALS SAY THEY'LL COMPLY WITH SEC PROBE 
</P>

<P>
 Orange County officials, shaken by an unprecedented demand for records from 
federal agents, pledged Thursday to comply with this week's subpoenas but 
rejected suggestions of wrongdoing involving county supervisors and Wall Street 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel absolutely confident that, as far as I'm concerned, I can sleep very 
comfortably," said Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley, who was 
issued a subpoena late Wednesday along with the county's other four 
supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The subpoenas, issued by the federal Securities and Exchange Commission, 
demand access to a wide range of records related to the board's financial 
connections to Merrill Lynch and three of its California brokers. Sources say 
the SEC wants to determine whether brokers were effectively giving county 
officials "kickbacks" in exchange for lucrative county business. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators have served subpoenas on individual supervisors' offices as part 
of previous probes, including the infamous county corruption cases of the 1970s 
and the Don R. Roth influence-peddling investigation in 1992. But longtime 
county observers said they cannot recall a time when all five supervisors were 
served. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal maneuver intensifies the spotlight on the supervisors, who declared 
the county bankrupt Dec. 6 in the wake of portfolio losses now totaling more 
than $2 billion, said Eileen Padberg, a prominent political consultant in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't heard any of the board members stand up and take any responsibility 
for what happened to the people of Orange County," she said. "They're driving 
the bus. They're elected to take the responsibility . . . yet they shirk it 
when it comes time to pay the piper." 
</P>
<P>
 Padberg said talk of recalls has already begun. Padberg said she believes 
Supervisors Roger R. Stanton and Gaddi H. Vasquez -- who will become the 
board's most senior members when Riley and Harriett M. Wieder retire next month 
-- could be most vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez, Stanton and Supervisor William G. Steiner refused comment on the 
subpoenas Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Wieder said the task of of compiling mounds of campaign reports and gift 
statements involving Wall Street brokers is an "onerous" one, but she said it 
should help show regulators the "big picture" as they try to determine how the 
political process works. 
</P>
<P>
 Wieder was confident of the outcome, saying that former Treasurer-Tax 
Collector Robert L. Citron was the official chiefly responsible for maintaining 
contact with the county's brokers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no implication that there were kickbacks," Wieder said. "I don't even 
know those Merrill Lynch people (named on the subpoenas). Those names are 
foreign to me. And another thing -- they didn't need to lobby (the supervisors 
on) the 5th floor. They had Citron." 
</P>
<P>
 Riley, meanwhile, said he too was sure that federal investigators would not 
find any evidence of wrongdoing, adding that he would never do anything to 
"embarrass" the county. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as top elected officials sought to minimize fallout from the 
subpoenas, several staff members in the Hall of Administration said aides were 
clearly on edge Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 One staff member who asked not to be identified characterized the subpoenas as 
a "sober and serious concern," adding that even the word "subpoena" carries a 
negative connotation. Another said: "It certainly doesn't make (the 
supervisors) happy." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials have until Dec. 29 to provide the SEC with income tax 
returns, checking and savings account statements, campaign finance forms, 
information on their personal securities holdings, gift and loan reports and 
data showing financial ties to Merrill Lynch and other brokers, among other 
items. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency is seeking specifically to review any material connected to three 
Merrill Lynch employees in California: Michael Stamenson, Debra Harris and 
Duane Canaga, each of whom donated $1,000 to Citron's campaign on June 13 -- 
six days after he was reelected. Campaign statements show that Stamenson's wife 
also gave Citron's campaign a $1,000 donation the same day. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, June 14, the Board of Supervisors approved Citron's 
recommendation on the issuance of $600 million in taxable notes, with Merrill 
Lynch as the underwriter. 
</P>
<P>
 Records also show that Merrill Lynch and its employees have contributed more 
than $15,000 to county supervisorial candidates since 1986. A major player in 
Orange County's bond market, the firm has underwritten hundreds of millions of 
dollars in county notes in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Investment firms have represented a substantial source of campaign income for 
top Orange County elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen of the biggest financial service firms that have done business with 
the county donated more than $15,000 to the five supervisors and Citron during 
1993 and the first half of 1994, the period covered by the subpoenas, according 
to public records. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill Lynch led the way with $4,500 in contributions. Leifer Capital, which 
has served for more than a decade as the county's financial adviser on major 
bond issues, was second with $1,775 in contributions. Smith Barney placed third 
at $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
 The International Brotherhood of Teamsters has charged that the June 13 
contributions from Merrill Lynch employees violated an SEC-approved policy 
banning donations to local officials from underwriters seeking contracts for 
two years after the contributions are made. The policy took effect earlier this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you look at the 'pay to play' scandals around the country," said Bart 
Naylor, a national coordinator for the union, "there are other firms that are 
culpable. But Merrill Lynch is unavoidable. You stumble over them wherever you 
look, and the evidence is damning." 
</P>
<P>
 But Merrill Lynch officials said Thursday the Teamsters are pursuing a 
vendetta against the firm because of unrelated labor tensions involving a 
business courier service. Spokesman Richard Silverman said Thursday that 
Merrill Lynch had acted "professionally and properly" in all its dealings with 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that the firm would "cooperate fully" with all SEC requests, but he 
refused to discuss any details about the Orange County investigation or to 
release any information on about the three employees named in the subpoenas. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with several special districts and other county agencies that have 
done business with Merrill Lynch said Thursday that they had not been served 
with any subpoenas in the case. But Peer Swan, who serves on both the Irvine 
Ranch Water District and the Orange County Sanitation District, said he 
wouldn't be surprised if they come later.

SEC INVESTIGATING POSSIBLE KICKBACKS IN ORANGE COUNTY; BANKRUPTCY: RELATIONSHIP 
OF BROKERS TO OFFICIALS IS UNDER SCRUTINY, SOURCE SAYS. SUPERVISORS DENY 
WRONGDOING AS LIQUIDATION OF PORTFOLIO BEGINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a broad investigation of 
possible influence peddling in the top reaches of Orange County government, 
looking specifically to determine whether brokers paid kickbacks to elected 
officials, a high-ranking source close to the investigation said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The probe has focused on "campaign contributions and kickbacks, things of that 
nature, and the relationship of broker-dealers to those officials," the source 
said. "When someone is making a lot of money on you, is there a quid pro quo? 
It's happened in the area of municipal securities before." 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear whether any evidence of wrongdoing has surfaced. The Times 
reported in some editions Thursday that the SEC had issued subpoenas to members 
of the Board of Supervisors and former Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron 
demanding that they turn over a huge array of documents -- including their 
federal and state tax returns, personal diaries and calendars, checking and 
savings account statements and records of any gifts or loans from investment 
brokers. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation focuses primarily on brokerages -- particularly Merrill 
Lynch, Wall Street's biggest investment house, which has handled millions of 
dollars worth of bond transactions for the county's investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday in Los Angeles, SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. suggested that 
Orange County voters oust the elected officials who allowed the debacle to 
occur. 
</P>
<P>
 "If your supervisors are so lax that they allow . . . that kind of 
speculation, I think the voters of that community should throw the whole bunch 
of (them) out of office," Levitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill Lynch spokesman Richard Silverman said Thursday that the firm would 
"cooperate fully" with the SEC. He declined to discuss the subpoenas, except to 
reaffirm that the brokerage acted "professionally and properly" in all its 
dealings with the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County supervisors, stunned by the unprecedented demand for records 
from the SEC, pledged to comply with the subpoenas but reacted angrily to any 
suggestion that the board may have been too close to Wall Street investment 
bankers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel absolutely confident that, as far as I'm concerned, I can sleep very 
comfortably," said Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's no implication there were kickbacks," said Supervisor Harriett M. 
Wieder. "I don't even know those Merrill Lynch people. Those names are all 
foreign to me. Besides, they don't need to lobby (our offices on) the fifth 
floor. They had Citron." 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Thursday: 
</P>
<P>
 * The county auctioned $483 million worth of securities from its investment 
pool, the first step toward liquidating the fund, which has dropped $2.02 
billion -- about 27% -- in value this year. Officials of Salomon Bros., the 
county's financial adviser, expressed satisfaction with demand for the bonds on 
Wall Street, but they fetched less than the average value Salomon had 
attributed to the fund's less risky holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Officials unveiled an interim plan to divide the pool's revenues as the fund 
is liquidated, a process that could take from one week to six months. The 187 
cities, school districts and other agencies that invested in the pool -- along 
with youngsters whose damages from private lawsuits were deposited in the fund 
-- initially would receive 30% of the money they put in, a total of $2.24 
billion. The government agencies could then use the money to pay salaries and 
other bills. 
</P>
<P>
 * Administrators of nonprofit agencies that contract with the county said they 
were becoming increasingly alarmed about delays in payment for services such as 
child-abuse treatment and refugee vocational training. Some began to make 
emergency plans and held staff meetings to discuss layoffs, furloughs and even 
closure.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to pare down everything we can until the county finds its feet 
-- and its head -- and finds the resources to keep us going," said Hank Paris, 
executive director of the Fullerton-based Child Guidance Center. 
</P>
<P>
 * Leaders of PTAs and educational foundations said the county's fiscal crisis 
could mean that thousands of dollars they raise each year for extras such as 
computers, music and art might go instead to pay for basic items and day-to-day 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 * State Controller Gray Davis blamed the Board of Supervisors for the 
financial crisis, saying they delegated too much authority to Citron. "The 
responsibility lies with the supervisors," Davis said, noting that the board 
essentially had rubber-stamped the treasurer's plans. "Now all of the citizens 
are going to pay a price for all of the excesses," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Assemblyman Willie Brown said he would support lending state money to Orange 
County, if necessary, to gas up police cars and keep schools open. But the 
Democratic leader of the lower house said he gleefully awaits begging by some 
Orange County legislators who refused to help out other areas in need -- 
including his hometown of San Francisco after the 1989 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gov. Pete Wilson directed state transportation officials to expedite a 
$15-million advance to the Orange County Transportation Authority, which has 
more than $1 billion tied up in the county's fund. The money is for road 
improvements, including the massive Santa Ana Freeway widening project. 
Repercussions Spread 
</P>
<P>
 The financial crisis was apparent on the streets of Orange County and in the 
corridors of financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 About 40 members of Teamsters Local 952 marched through the first floor of 
Merrill Lynch's Santa Ana office, accusing the investment firm of profiting 
from the county's financial ruin. Protesters demanded the brokerage return 
profits made from underwriting risky investments with tax money. The union 
represents 15,000 workers in Orange County . 
</P>
<P>
 A Westminster resident, Nancy Schwartz, was shaken when an American Savings 
Bank branch initially refused to cash a county-issued child support check. 
After a flurry of calls verified that funds in the county's child support 
account were not frozen, the branch agreed to accept the $200 deposit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a hell of a scare," Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The people who run nonprofit organizations were nervous, too, about when they 
would be paid. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think about anything else," said Paris, whose children's center 
contracts with the county to provide child-abuse counseling and other mental 
health services. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the county owes his group $200,000 -- much of it money the county 
simply administers for the state and federal governments. Paris said the center 
would be forced to close if the money didn't arrive by Feb. 15. "The statement 
that the checks are in the mail could never be more beautiful," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Overshadowing Thursday's developments was the SEC investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said that SEC officials met with Citron in April to discuss his use of 
high-risk investments such as reverse repurchase agreements and structured 
notes. Those loans and instruments helped the county's investment fund earn 
enviable returns while interest rates were falling. But as rates rose over the 
past year, they helped drive the fund and the county into bankruptcy -- and 
Citron out of office. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron assured investigators that authorizations for such transactions came 
"at every level," one source said. "Now we're finding out that maybe this 
wasn't the case." 
</P>
<P>
 County Counsel Terry Andrus said that after discussing the matter with SEC 
investigators, the scope of the agency request for documents has been "narrowed 
somewhat," but he refused to elaborate. County officials say the precise amount 
of information to be turned over by the supervisors is still being negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, I have no reason to believe that the Board of Supervisors is 
the subject of that investigation," Andrus said. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrus quoted from the SEC's letter to the supervisors, which said the inquiry 
"should not be construed as an indication . . . that any violations of law have 
occurred." 
</P>
<P>
 A former federal agent said the SEC's broad-brush approach to the Orange 
County case was not unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 "To some degree it's a fishing expedition; they are looking for what's there," 
said Sam Gruenbaum, an attorney with Cox Castle & Nicholson in Los Angeles and 
a former high-ranking SEC enforcement officer. "They will be looking at whether 
the relationships that existed were purely for underwriting or if there was 
more to the relationship that wasn't disclosed." 
</P>
<P>
 If there were financial ties between the supervisors and Wall Street firms 
that were not disclosed -- either to other board members or to those who 
invested in the county pool at the time of the county's bond deals -- that 
could point to possible violations of securities laws, Gruenbaum and others 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they find improper links, that could be the basis for serious 
non-disclosure issues," said Gruenbaum. "How much disclosure should there have 
been about the county's investment policy is very complicated." 
</P>
<P>
 Citron's attorney, David Weichert, declined to comment on the SEC 
investigation or the request for records from his client. But Weichert said the 
SEC action was not unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not surprised at all that the SEC would take an interest in the 
circumstances surrounding the county's loss," he said. "Furthermore, we believe 
that when all facts come to light, Mr. Citron will be totally exonerated from 
the reckless charges and innuendo that has appeared regularly in the press." 
Investors Gather 
</P>
<P>
 While the SEC investigation continued, a group of officials representing 
cities, schools and other public entities said they would need $117 million of 
their money from the county fund by week's end. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the officials emerged tight-lipped from the closed-door briefing in 
Santa Ana by Salomon Bros., part of the county's new financial team.  
</P>
<P>
 "They're doing a scheduled, logical liquidation of their assets," said Villa 
Park City Manager Fred Naley. "I think they've got some of the best people 
working on the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 But others said the meeting's atmosphere was edgy and that many of the 
investors' substantive questions about how and when money will be disbursed 
from the fund remained unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're blowing sunshine at you," one attorney who represents a water 
district said as he emerged from the meeting. "We have payrolls that have to be 
committed to next week." 
</P>
<P>
 Echoing criticism from Wall Street, officials of some of the agencies that 
invested in the pool questioned whether the entire fund should be sold off now; 
specifically, they urged Salomon Bros. to keep holdings with a maturity of four 
years rather than rushing to sell them. 
</P>
<P>
 And the jostling for priority among the fund's creditors continued, with some 
agency officials indicating they thought the county should be last in line -- 
behind the cities, schools and other investors -- for withdrawing money from 
the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Also up in the air is how property tax collections due for distribution Dec. 
20 will be doled out, said Joel S. Miliband, an attorney whose firm represents 
the cities of Newport Beach, Laguna Hills and Fountain Valley, along with 
several water districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Miliband said the creditors need to sit down to work out "which agencies need 
cash and for what purposes and how much. . . . The question is, 'Who has 
emergency cash needs in the next 10 days, intermediate needs in the next 30 
days?' When everybody thinks about what needs to happen, they'll see that there 
has to be cooperation." Securities Auctioned 
</P>
<P>
 Salomon Bros. sold $483 million of the county's remaining $7.96 billion of 
securities in a wide-open auction Thursday, the first step in making funds 
available to the pool's investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the face value of the bonds sold was $483 million, they were sold for 
prices ranging from 89.5 cents to 94.5 cents on the dollar. So the county's 
actual cash intake from the sale will be between $432 million and $456 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The rush to unload them came as county officials tried to ward off a slew of 
new economic announcements that they believed could cause another hike in 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The bonds attracted offers from a substantial number of investors, drawing 
$7.5 billion in bids, according to Salomon.  
</P>
<P>
 "We were very pleased with demand," a Salomon executive said. The sale got a 
boost from a drop in shorter-term market interest rates, as more investors 
began to bet that the Federal Reserve Board will defer any additional rate 
hikes until 1995. The Fed meets next week. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wall Street analysts said the bonds sold Thursday were conventional issues 
maturing in two to four years -- the kind of holdings that should be the 
easiest to sell among the county pool's remaining securities. Salomon's much 
bigger challenge will be to auction or restructure the complex "derivatives" 
that comprise 60% of the remaining portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Salomon had estimated that the overall portfolio was worth about 92 
cents on the dollar. If sold for less than that, the 27% loss now expected by 
fund investors from their original deposits to the fund will grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Salomon said it will auction another $566 million of the county fund's bonds 
today. 
</P>

 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) The SEC Probe 
</P>
<P>
 The federal Securities and Exchange Commission issued broad subpoenas late 
Wednesday to the five members of the Orange County Board of Supervisors. The 
agency is probing possible influence peddling and kickbacks tied to the 
collapse of the county's investment fund. The documents demanded that, by Dec. 
29, the supervisors turn over: 
</P>
<P>
 * All records of "compensation or other things of value received" since 
January, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 * Their federal and state income tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
 * "All documents relating to communications" with Merrill Lynch brokers 
Michael Stamenson, Debra Harris and Duane Canaga "or any other broker dealer or 
its employees." 
</P>
<P>
 * All personal and business diaries, calendars, telephone logs, books, memos 
and notes and other documents. 
</P>
<P>
 * Checking and savings account statements. 
</P>
<P>
 * Campaign accounts, including all campaign disclosure statements and reports, 
including but not limited to campaign statements. 
</P>
<P>
 * All documents related to any securities accounts held by the supervisors or 
members of their families. 
</P>
<P>
 * Records of any gifts or loans made to them directly or indirectly. 
</P>
<P>
 * Any tape recordings of conversations related to Merrill Lynch or other 
brokers.

 Science Finds, Industry Applies, and Man Conforms -- Motto, Chicago's 1933 
International Exposition on Progress 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Webster hates new technology. The electronic gadgets at the Irvine 
psychologist's home are forever flashing triple zeros. He refuses to use a 
cellular phone because it would end his favorite pastime of listening to rock 
'n' roll while driving to work. 
</P>
<P>
 But Webster is feeling pressure to change. He now uses a pager so his patients 
can reach him instantly. And to put himself in touch with the times, he is 
considering the unthinkable: computerizing his practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Call it the technology trap. 
</P>
<P>
 As America rushes headlong into the Computer Age, more people are finding 
themselves responding to the allure of a powerful new master. Encouraged by 
aggressive advertising and eager to keep up with the cyberspace Joneses, 
millions are racing out to buy personal computers, often with the idea that 
they will help their job prospects or bolster their children's education. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, computers can do just that. But, at least for now, technology's 
calls may be a siren song that can lure the unprepared into unwise investments 
of time and money and lots of unnecessary Angst.  
</P>
<P>
 The uproar over a comparatively minor flaw discovered in Intel's most advanced 
computer chip, the Pentium, shows how little most people know about the 
complexity and quality problems of PCs -- and how little manufacturers know 
about the needs and desires of non-technical consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 Many such users find that PCs demand long hours of tedious self-instruction 
for few tangible rewards. For them, their machines can become little more than 
costly toys. More than half of the 10 best-selling software packages are games. 
</P>
<P>
 And computers simply aren't the special entree to the future that many people 
expect. "You don't need to know computers for the age of computers," says Greg 
E. Blonder, who is starting a laboratory at AT&T to study the interaction of 
people and technology. "You have to be adaptable; you have to learn how to 
learn." 
</P>
<P>
 The flood of computer advertisements this holiday season -- the first ever in 
which consumers are buying as many PCs as corporations -- portrays the computer 
as the miracle machine. "Did you ever have to get up in the middle of the night 
and go to the bank?" Microsoft asks in one ad that shows a computer glowing in 
the dark. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Microsoft ad has two little girls asking their father to forgo 
"Goldilocks" as their bedtime story and instead use the computer to explain 
Sartre and existentialism. 
</P>
<P>
 And Intel is running a TV commercial that shows a family riding its computer 
through various adventures as if it were a modern magic carpet. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are making parents feel guilty for not having a computer for their 
children," says Robert Corpuz, PC analyst at Dataquest Inc., a San Jose 
research firm. "It's a strong emotional tug." 
</P>
<P>
 "If they (children) don't learn how to use computers by the fourth grade, they 
will be lost in the technology," said Ed Anoskey, a Boeing manager, as he 
charged a $1,666 Packard Bell multimedia computer for his 10-year-old 
granddaughter at a Seattle store. "There is so much to absorb." 
</P>
<P>
 People concerned about their employment prospects may also be attracted by the 
promise of the PC. Some say a new national divide is developing between 
technological haves and have-nots, and one had best be on the right side of it 
to be assured of prosperity and job security. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are not computer-literate, do not expect anyone in your organization 
to respect you," scolds management guru Peter Drucker in a recent article in 
Forbes. "My 5-year-old granddaughter would have no respect for me if I told 
her, 'You know, I'm afraid of the telephone.' She wouldn't believe me." 
</P>
<P>
 "Times change," says Drucker, "and we must change with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Machrone, a columnist for PC Magazine, suggests that "eschewing personal 
computers in this day and age is like saying 'no thanks' to refrigeration." 
</P>
<P>
 But if we step off the technology treadmill for a moment and reconsider, the 
real benefits may not be so obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no question that many businesses and professionals gain important 
advantages from computers. And temporary agencies say applicants who know their 
way around a keyboard are more employable -- just as workers skilled in using 
Wang word processors were in great demand a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But has the PC become a basic appliance ranking in importance with the 
telephone? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, no . . . or at least not yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, by appearing to offer more than it can deliver, experts say, the 
computer has contributed to a growing sense of fear and anxiety over new 
technology. It is still light-years away from the phone when it comes to ease 
of use. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentium flaw, which can cause errors in certain kinds of esoteric 
calculations, and a multitude of less-publicized problems show that PCs are far 
from the technological maturity of most common electronics products. Almost 
half of those surveyed recently by PC Magazine had had problems with their 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as early buyers of the automobile had to be rich, have some familiarity 
with mechanics and be willing to contend with shortages of good roads and gas 
stations, computer use requires a great investment of money, time and patience. 
People who buy PCs without any technical know-how or any specific sense of what 
to use the machines for often find themselves thumbing through mind-numbing 
manuals and spending hours on the phone trying to get through to a help line. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent study conducted by Larry Rosen, professor of psychology at Cal State 
Dominguez Hills, found that only half of the American university students 
surveyed were comfortable with computers. More than one-tenth had physical 
reactions such as heart palpitations and sweaty palms when required to learn a 
new technology. "People can't keep up with the pace of change," says Rosen, who 
calls the phenomenon "technophobia." 
</P>
<P>
 In a survey of about 400 users, market researcher Coleman Assn. of Teaneck, 
N.J., found that most had sworn at their computers, close to half sometimes 
felt like throwing something at the screen and 7% had struck their machine with 
an object. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of that frustration comes from inflated expectations about what computers 
can deliver. A Seattle physician recently spent $3,500 on a computer expecting 
it to quickly balance his checkbook and help him with diagnoses. But he hasn't 
had time for the laborious process of entering every check and ATM withdrawal, 
so he still lives with his checkbook unbalanced. After six months, the main 
product of his efforts is a letter to a friend that includes a tiny picture of 
his baby daughter printed under the return address. 
</P>
<P>
 In certain respects, computers have always been a technology in search of a 
problem. Even in the business world, companies have often treated computer 
systems as a brute means of replacing workers or measuring productivity, rather 
than developing applications to meet specific needs. 
</P>
<P>
 New York publishers, for example, once thought they could increase their 
editors' productivity if they forced them to edit all their manuscripts by 
computer, says Scott Larson, a Seattle anthropologist and consultant who has 
helped large companies respond to backlashes from the inappropriate use of 
technology. But editors invariably printed out the long manuscripts and edited 
them by hand. 
</P>
<P>
 People who promote technology "always pretend to know how best to do things," 
says Larson. "But technology is just a tool and you should question it." 
</P>
<P>
 Many corporations have learned from the past and are taking a more skeptical 
approach to the introduction of new technology. Some companies are even putting 
non-technical people in charge of their computer operations to guard against 
implementing technology for its own sake. 
</P>
<P>
 Patagonia, the Ventura-based sports clothing maker, recently installed Ed 
Schmults, a business manager with little computer knowledge, as head of 
information systems. "The owners of the company are reluctant to embrace 
technology unless it's very well thought out," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Patagonia has avoided using voice-mail systems that force customers to punch 
strings of numbers before reaching a real person. The company recently decided 
against marketing its products through on-line services because early 
experiences showed they weren't an effective sales channel for them. 
</P>
<P>
 On a smaller scale, Philip Bereano, professor of technology and society at the 
University of Washington, still reads his reports and letters into a Dictaphone 
for his secretary to transcribe. "In some ways it's absurd, but I'm efficient 
at it," he says. "I can't sit still in front of a computer. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who are into computers won't admit the fact that some people don't 
need them," Bereano says. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is increasingly common for people to feel compelled to buy computers 
without a clear idea of what they will be used for. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a lot of friends who have computers and they don't know what to do 
with them," says Jack Rosenberg, 76, of Pacific Palisades. He helped John Von 
Neuman, the inventor of the modern computer, design his first machine and is a 
skeptic about the computer's home applications. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their grandkids come in and play video games. At most they write an 
occasional letter," he says. "They are buying machines that cost $1,500 to 
$2,000 because they think they will eventually need one. They buy it to keep up 
with their neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have no specific plans for their machines and find themselves 
combing through home computer magazines may be disappointed. In its December 
issue, Home PC carried an article with holiday ideas for family projects. Among 
them: Use a computer to make a "Welcome, Santa" banner to hang over the 
fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading the consumer stampede are parents who feel their children need 
expensive multimedia computers to excel in school. And schools themselves often 
feel compelled to have rooms lined with computer screens to show parents that 
they are up on the latest technology. But numerous studies have produced little 
concrete evidence that children who learn on computers do better than those who 
stick to books. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, with children, there's another variable. Anoskey, the Boeing 
engineer, says he is buying a computer to help his granddaughter with her 
homework. But when asked what she will use the machine for, Megan quickly 
responds: "Games." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, there are good reasons for children to learn new skills while they 
are young. "There is a period of life when we are organizationally sanctioned 
to learn," says Robert Kraut, professor of social psychology and human-computer 
interaction at Carnegie Mellon University. "There is less time later on." 
</P>
<P>
 But the notion that learning to use a computer gives children a significant 
head start in life is debatable. 
</P>
<P>
 "The computer is just another rich educational toy," says Sally Narodick, 
chief executive officer of Edmark, an educational software company. She 
compares computers to other educational toys like clay, building blocks and 
books that each play a role in learning. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the whole notion of computer literacy as a fundamental skill like 
reading or math may be inaccurate. Successive generations of students have 
sought to become "computer literate" with a few college courses in programming. 
Only a tiny minority ever used those skills. Most saw the programs they learned 
quickly become obsolete as new generations of computers used new kinds of 
software. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft, Apple and others are constantly changing their software to make it 
easier to use. The person who masters Microsoft's Windows, for example, must 
learn a new set of skills next spring when Microsoft releases a new version 
that it says will be far more accessible for lay people. 
</P>
<P>
 The student who uses a computer for the first time at age 20 will not suffer a 
disadvantage against a child of comparable educational background who has used 
a computer all his life, says Donald Norman, a research fellow at Apple 
Computer Co. and author of "Things That Make Us Smart," a skeptical look at new 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
 He is part of a research group at Apple working on software that will make 
computer use more intuitive for new users. "Teaching kids how to use computers 
is the wrong thing to teach," says Norman. "You end up teaching things we (at 
Apple) are trying to make obsolete." 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the century, experts say, most computers will be embedded in 
appliances the way electric motors are in washing machines. 
</P>
<P>
 "At some point if you know your work it will be OK," says Judith Ramey, 
director of a laboratory at the University of Washington that helps 
corporations develop user-friendly products. "You won't need to know 
technology." 
</P>
<P>
 Even in highly computerized workplace environments today, analytic skills are 
generally valued more than any mechanical knowledge of computers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to know what computers can give you," says Dennis Strigel, chief 
executive officer at Bell Atlantic Mobile, a cellular phone company based in 
New Jersey. But Strigel notes that even in customer support jobs at the 
company, the key requirement is a college degree and the versatility to handle 
problems from billing to technical support. 
</P>
<P>
 Until computers make the transition to being a simple appliance with 
applications that are obviously helpful and easy to use, there is liable to be 
a lot of hand-wringing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to do it, I don't have time for it," says Webster, the 
psychiatrist. But he is resigned to his high-tech fate. "I'm going to be 
dragged kicking and screaming into the Computer Age."

BROWN SAYS LUCK QUASHED GOP'S SPEAKERSHIP PLANS; ASSEMBLY: DEMOCRATIC LEADER 
DERIDES BRULTE AS A VICTIM OF AMBITION. THE REPUBLICAN RESPONDS ANGRILY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Assembly powerhouse Willie Brown, in a wide-ranging interview Thursday with 
Times editors and reporters, said the maneuvering that denied Republicans 
leadership of the Assembly earlier this month resulted not from his legendary 
political skills but from "pure, unadulterated luck." 
</P>
<P>
 And, in remarks sure to ratchet up the level of rancor developing between the 
former Speaker and the GOP leader seeking to replace him, Brown criticized 
Assemblyman Jim Brulte as a man captive to his own errant ambitions who is 
refusing to bend for the good of the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Brulte, he hasn't hit the wall. He still thinks he can win the 
speakership," Brown said, clearly delighted at the recent turn of events. 
"Apparently, the month of promising the world that he was going to be Speaker 
raised the level of expectations among Republicans so much so that they are 
irrational. . . . They really thought their time had come and when it became 
apparent their time had not come, they became really angry." 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte returned the sentiment in kind, angrily denouncing Brown in a telephone 
interview from his Sacramento office as a man willing to do anything to retain 
the speakership. Technically, there is no Speaker at present because the 
Assembly has deadlocked 40 to 40 between Brown and Brulte. 
</P>
<P>
 "The voters of California overwhelmingly voted for change," Brulte said. "And 
there are two candidates for Speaker. One, Willie Brown, represents the status 
quo. The other, Jim Brulte, represents change." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown and Brulte also disagreed over the terms of a deal that Brown said he 
offered the Republican leader to solve the Assembly's leadership dilemma. Brown 
told The Times that he promised to step down as Speaker in July, after the 
state budget is enacted, and give the job to Brulte. Brulte said Brown only 
promised to turn the job over at the end of 1995. Either course, Brulte said, 
is unacceptable to Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 In other comments during the one-hour interview in Los Angeles: 
</P>
<P>
 * Brown said he would support lending state money to newly bankrupt Orange 
County if it is necessary to keep police and fire agencies and the schools 
afloat. But he noted with some glee that he looks forward to the pleas of the 
very Orange County legislators who have turned a deaf ear to bailout requests 
from other areas, including Brown's own earthquake-ravaged San Francisco in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
 * He described Republican Gov. Pete Wilson as potentially a "very strong" GOP 
nominee for the presidency in 1996, and said his own party was in such disarray 
that it could no longer figure out the most basic of political calculations -- 
the makeup of its constituency. 
</P>
<P>
 * In tones more bittersweet than defiant, Brown said racism has stalled his 
political climb, which he said he had hoped could end at the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to make the hard decision that the speakership was where I would spend 
my energy and my time and make my contribution," he said. "I could not even 
consider any other alternative that I might foresee as equal to my skills 
simply because of the level of racism that exists in this state." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said Republicans had consistently made him a "hate object," putting him 
on the ballot figuratively although he has never officially ventured outside 
his safe San Francisco district. He said his race contributed to their success 
in demonizing him, comparing it to former President George Bush's use of a 
black convict to slash at Democrat Michael Dukakis in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very easy for a guy in Chico to make me out as an evil person," he said. 
"There's a certain amount of racism in the system, particularly in those 
isolated places where . . . there's no diversity. And when someone up there 
says Willie Brown is evil, just look at him, you automatically get Willie 
Horton or you automatically get somebody who is awful. That makes it very 
difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged, however, that he has contributed to his own political 
pigeonholing with his extravagant lifestyle and freewheeling verbiage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not an ordinary person by any stretch of the imagination," he said, and 
then issued a wide grin. "I work at not being ordinary." 
</P>
<P>
 The speakership, and titular control of the Assembly, was thought to be in 
Republican hands after the returns came in from November's elections. The GOP 
won 41 seats, a bare majority that could have delivered the top job. But a 
month after the election, events took a dramatic turn. 
</P>
<P>
 In a showdown vote in the Capitol, all of Brown's Democrats backed him, giving 
him 39 votes. He was able to block Brulte's ascent when Republican Paul Horcher 
of Diamond Bar, asked for his vote, banged his fist on his desk and shouted 
"Brown!" 
</P>
<P>
 The move stunned Republicans, who thought they had Horcher's vote and who 
claimed that Brown had bought him off. Horcher subsequently announced that he 
is leaving the GOP to become an independent, and Republicans are mounting a 
recall against him. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown said he knew he had Horcher's vote a month before it was cast. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pure, unadulterated luck," he said. "I had nothing to do with Mr. 
Horcher's decision. Mr. Horcher came to me in early November, after the results 
became very clear, and he said if you are a candidate for Speaker, I will 
support you." 
</P>
<P>
 The former Speaker said that Horcher also sought him out six months ago and 
discussed his desire to become an independent, but that he had counseled him 
that it would cost him his election in the Republican district. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown contended that it was the Republicans' own treatment of the 
ever-maverick Horcher that prompted his vote, and nothing else. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they walked into a room of this nature and the only seat available was 
next to Horcher, nobody would sit in the chair," he said. "I could not assign 
any Republican to sit next to him on the floor. They just wanted to ostracize 
him; they wanted to destroy him. . . . He was really angry. I've never seen 
anybody as angry. And his motivations were greater than any that could be 
generated by greed." 
</P>
<P>
 Horcher, who could not be reached for comment Thursday, drew the enmity of his 
Republican colleagues in 1991 when he cast the deciding vote for a 
controversial state budget that raised taxes. Ultimately, Brown said, their 
treatment came back to haunt them. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you've learned anything from me, you know not to mistreat your enemies," 
said Brown, who has accumulated both enemies and friends with abandon during 
his record 14 years as leader of the lower house. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said he has tried to negotiate a way out of the leadership impasse with 
a carefully crafted plan meant to give Democrats nominal control of the 
Assembly next year and Republicans control thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that under his plan, incumbent Democratic chairs would keep their 
positions, and Republicans would become vice chairs. Brulte would become 
Speaker pro tem, the second-ranking position, and Brown would be Speaker. Party 
leaders would drop their "majority" and "minority" tags and become, simply, the 
Democratic and Republican leaders. Influential committees would have equal 
representation from each party and would split financial resources down the 
middle. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Speaker said he offered to turn over the speakership to Brulte 
after the next state budget is enacted, probably in July. At the end of the 
year, he said, Republicans would take over the committees for the final year of 
their term. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, the response has not been forthcoming yet, because he (Brulte) 
is still fixed in his mind that he's got to justify . . . the great promise of 
November that fizzled in December," Brown said. "He's so focused on the 
speakership." 
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone interview, Brulte's response was etched with acid. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you really believe that crap?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican leader said Brown had never told him he would leave in July, 
but did mention leaving at the end of the year. He is far from being fixated on 
the speakership, Brulte said, instead throwing that description at Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being Speaker of the Assembly was never a goal of mine," he said. "I 
understand that it has been Mr. Brown's life for 14 years. I just happen to be 
the Republican who for the first time in three decades led his party to 
victory." 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte also said Republicans remain unconvinced that Brown is committed to 
bipartisanship.

 "Given his 14 years as Speaker, where he has never exhibited bipartisan 
consideration, where he has never believed or exhibited power sharing, I told 
him I thought Republicans had every right to be very skeptical of his 
born-again belief," Brulte said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Brulte is hardly alone in his belief that Brown wants to continue to 
wield the Speaker's power, Brown concentrated his remarks Thursday on 
intimations that he is sick of the grind and wants out soon. 
</P>
<P>
 He confirmed that, before Republicans made their surprising gains in November, 
he had planned to step down as Speaker on his 61st birthday next March. But he 
also indicated that, given the renewed Republican strength, he will not defer 
gently. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would never do that," he said. "I would never do that even if there were 
only one Democrat left. I care about things. I care about choice. I care about 
school funding. I care about freedoms that you enjoy. I don't want this place 
to be a fascist state, and I really don't appreciate know-nothings doing the 
kind of damage they can do. So I am going to struggle even if there's only one 
of me. I'm going to struggle at every turn." 
</P>
<P>
 In remarks directed to his own political party, Brown acknowledged that 
Democrats are in a struggle of their own, given the national sweep of 
Republicans into office.  
</P>
<P>
 Asked what the election results said, he replied that "it says that the 
Democrats do not know their constituency." 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't tell anymore who the real Democratic constituency is," he added. 
"It's no longer the old one that elected me." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown credited Republicans for their ability to "reach inside our operation" 
with issues such as the anti-illegal immigration Proposition 187, which unified 
Republicans and divided Democrats.  
</P>
<P>
 He also expressed confidence that Gov. Wilson, with whom Brown shares a 
love-hate relationship, had his eye on the presidency, despite the governor's 
protests to the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their agenda was not the governorship. Their agenda was the presidency," 
Brown said of Wilson's team. He brushed aside claims from some Republicans that 
Wilson would never seek the presidency because if he won he would have to turn 
the state over to Democratic Lt. Gov.-elect Gray Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 While Brown said he was optimistic that Democrats could win California, he was 
less than enthusiastic about President Clinton. "Yes, I think he will be the 
nominee," he said. "Should he be the nominee? I have got to believe that he 
will answer that himself. But I think if he chooses to run, he will be the 
nominee."

3 MERRILL LYNCH BROKERS LED INVESTMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A trio of wealthy Merrill Lynch bond brokers, operating out of a pink marble 
office tower in the heart of this city's upscale financial district, became 
Orange County's main conduit for high-risk investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron was self-assured and 
outspoken in his investment strategy, but Merrill Lynch's team was ready to 
back Citron's every instinct and earn multimillion-dollar fees in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 The team was lead by the savvy but hard-edged Michael Gus Stamenson, 54, a 
silver-haired former Marine with a taste for expensive antiques and vintage 
wine.  
</P>
<P>
 With his two junior partners, Debra Harris and Duane Canaga, the trio were 
known throughout California's local treasurers offices and local finance 
agencies. When treasurers associations would meet, Stamenson would impress the 
groups with his sophisticated Wall Street views. 
</P>
<P>
 All three brokers declined to comment, but a Merrill Lynch spokesman said all 
remain employees in good standing. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill's San Francisco office came to dominate the lucrative field of 
brokering and underwriting securities for local government agencies over the 
last decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill Lynch officials supported Orange County's disastrous investments that 
bet on a decline in interest rates this year, supplying Citron with company 
reports that projected rates would drop. The majority of Wall Street economists 
had an opposite view. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill Lynch is the subject of federal and state investigations into whether 
its brokers properly marketed high-risk securities to Orange County. Stamenson, 
Harris and Canaga were named in subpoenas for records served Wednesday by the 
federal Securities and Exchange Commission on members of the Orange County 
Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The subpoenas are seeking a lengthy list of official and personal records amid 
allegations that Merrill Lynch's influence in Orange County was abetted by 
personal gratuities and gifts that found their way to government officials, 
according to sources close to the investigation. Stamenson, Harris and Canaga 
each donated $1,000 to Citron's reelection campaign June 13 -- six days after 
he was reelected. Campaign statements show that Stamenson's wife also gave 
Citron's campaign a $1,000 donation on the same day. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, the Board of Supervisors approved Citron's recommendation on the 
issuance of $600 million in taxable notes, with Merrill Lynch as the 
underwriter. 
</P>
<P>
 Stamenson could both charm and intimidate. Neighbors describe him as gracious, 
but a local building contractor, Paul Barendregt, who worked on Stamenson's 
$1.1-million home, says he is a "little bit of a Napoleon as far as his height 
and his attitude toward people." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Stamenson, 54, demonstrated just how tough he could be in 1988 when 
be bared fists with a lobbyist and walked away with a bloody nose, he also has 
a capacity to ingratiate. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came over the very first day we moved in to say hello, very casual and 
friendly," said Mary Ann Tataseo, his next-door neighbor of several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Stamenson invited Tataseo to his annual Christmas bash, where he has hosted 
more than 100 guests in past years at his 13,000-square-foot mansion with a 
water fountain in the front yard and a late-model Mercedes in the driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris, 39, and Canaga, 51, also appear to be well-rewarded for their work. 
Harris, who has worked at Merrill for 14 years, lives in a $1.2-million home in 
the San Francisco suburb of Lafayette, according to property tax records. 
</P>
<P>
 Canaga owns a $368,500 condo in a hilly section of San Francisco. He came to 
Merrill Lynch after his construction business was forced into bankruptcy in 
1985 when a partner in a project ran into financial difficulties, according to 
National Assn. of Securities Dealers records.  
</P>
<P>
 Canaga flunked one of his brokerage exams in 1991, company records show, 
although he passed the next year. Asked for comment Thursday, Canaga referred 
all inquiries to Merrill Lynch headquarters in New York and hung up. 
</P>
<P>
 The trio of brokers were able to cement a trusted relationship with government 
employees. But exactly who was calling the shots is likely to be hotly 
contested for months or even years to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron's attorney David Wiechert said: "As treasurer for the county of Orange, 
Robert Citron relied on the advice of securities professionals in making 
investment decisions, none more so than representatives of Merrill Lynch. The 
suggestions . . . that Mr. Citron was on some uncounseled frolic and detour or 
that he had the same level of expertise as his financial advisers is mere 
sophistry." 
</P>
<P>
 However, treasurers in such counties as Monterey and Contra Costa continue to 
vouch for Stamenson, Harris and Canaga, saying the Merrill team has gotten a 
bum rap and that the leveraged investment strategies they sold in Orange County 
and around the state should not be curtailed.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is not some flaky firm from Texas or Arkansas," Monterey County 
Treasurer-Tax Collector Louis Solton said. "I am comfortable with Merrill. I 
would have to be compelled to deal with another investment house. They have a 
reputation, as a firm, that precedes them." 
</P>
<P>
 Monterey has a $237-million pool of derivative securities, brokered 
exclusively by Harris. Solton said that Harris shares a mutual understanding 
with him about the county's investment view -- which is that derivative trading 
is a low-risk, high-return strategy despite Orange County's disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonoma County Treasurer Don Merz said his dealings with Stamenson and his 
staff for 14 years have left him believing that they are getting a bum rap in 
the Orange County disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of Mike's presentations were on the pitfalls in terms of investment 
practices," Merz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The loyalties between the Merrill brokers and their clients ran deep. An audit 
in Orange County disclosed that Citron bought and sold securities in 1991 to 
help Merrill Lynch meet certain federal requirements on its finances. 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt Merrill's brokers valued their close relationship with the 
treasurers. Orange County's business with Merrill Lynch generated millions of 
dollars of fees and commissions annually. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, Stamenson, the son of a Greek immigrant, became a very wealthy 
man. Stamenson earned $769,000 in 1991, according to a divorce filing by his 
former wife, and industry sources say that his earnings rose sharply in 1992 
and 1993 -- possibly as high as several million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, according to property tax records, Stamenson paid off the 
$937,000 mortgage loan on his home, a brick Tudor on the most prestigious 
street in the wealthiest gated section of the affluent East Bay suburb of 
Moraga. 
</P>
<P>
 When a reporter knocked on the home's massive oak doors earlier this week, 
Stamenson's wife peered from a crack in the door and said the couple would have 
nothing to say about the Orange County investment crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Stamenson's wife listed her occupation on their marriage certificate as a 
restaurant hostess. They were married after a divorce from his wife of 24 
years. In the settlement, Stamenson kept the couple's mansion, along with 
antiques, a wine collection and a boat. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Lomeli, Contra Costa County treasurer, acknowledges that Stamenson has 
money, but he "never rubs it in your face." Lomeli invited Stamenson to his 
wedding and attended Stamenson's wedding. 
</P>
<P>
 As Orange County fell deeper into financial trouble, Citron made ever riskier 
bets structured by Merrill Lynch and other brokers. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC and the California Department of Corporations are investigating 
whether Merrill Lynch and Stamenson violated their duties to sell investments 
with risk that is appropriate for taxpayers' money. 
</P>
<P>
 One November trade has attracted particular interest. Merrill underwrote a 
10-year note issued by the Student Loan Marketing Assn., or Sally Mae. Merrill 
sold the entire $600-million issue to Orange County at a price of $100.628 for 
each $100 face value of the notes.  
</P>
<P>
 But the same day, Bloomberg financial service assessed the value of the notes 
at $96.897 for each $100 face value, suggesting that Citron paid too much for 
the securities. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal netted Merrill fees and profits of $2 million to $6 million, 
according to bond experts and financial advisers who have said the trade was 
among the most unusual that Citron made. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill Lynch officials say that Citron and others were sophisticated 
investors, well aware of the risks. 
</P>
<P>
 But that is the same losing argument that Merrill Lynch and other brokerages 
used in a suit brought by San Jose after the city sustained a $60-million loss 
in 1984, according to attorneys for the city who now represent Orange County 
bondholders.  
</P>
<P>
 However, Alan Bromberg, a professor of securities law at Southern Methodist 
University in Texas, noted: "Everybody who sues claims they are unsophisticated 
and everybody claims that investments are unsuitable. That may succeed in some 
of the exotic securities, but it is almost impossible to prove on the general 
issue of over-leveraging." 
</P>
<P>
 Citron took out short-term loans and invested those funds in long-term 
securities, which meant he was betting that interest rates would stay level or 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill Lynch brokers provided reports that lent at least some comfort to 
Citron in laying those bets. The firm provided one investment report about a 
year ago that proclaimed, "The . . . case for lower rates is intact, even with 
a recovery." 
</P>
<P>
 But in that same time period the majority of economists were warning that 
rates would head upward, though almost all economists failed to predict the 
steepness of the increases.

 DISCONNECTED? KOCE-TV, the public service station in Huntington Beach (Channel 
50), couldn't have been more pleased with its pledges last week: The phones 
were ringing and ringing. . . . And then the county dropped its bombshell about 
its financial troubles. The phones went dead. "It was a chilling effect," says 
KOCE president William A. Furnice. "For three days the calls leveled off." . . 
. But even with that setback, KOCE raised $193,569, up 25 grand from last 
year's effort. 
</P>
<P>
 LONE CHEER: It was supposed to be a cheery Christmas at John Wayne Airport, 
with holiday song and dance all the way up to Christmas Eve. But the county's 
bond crisis has forced cancellation of its annual Holiday Festival. . . . One 
bright note, though: Golden West Carolers (from the Huntington Beach college) 
said they wanted to come despite cancellation of any fees. They'll entertain 
airport employees and travelers Monday at 4 p.m. 
</P>

 HAPPY TRAILING: Rusty Richards of Modjeska Canyon raises and trains horses 
plus does "about anything you can do under a cowboy hat," he says. But recently 
he was honored, along with other alumni, for his span of 21 years with one of 
the most famous Western singing groups, the Sons of the Pioneers. . . . They're 
known mainly for their work with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans. The famous couple 
appeared for the ceremony, in Tucson, Ariz. Says Richards: "It doesn't get any 
better than working with Roy and Dale."

 MONARCH ILLUSTRATED: It is rare to find much on high school sports in Sports 
Illustrated. But Mater Dei High School's undefeated exploits on the football 
field got the national magazine's attention this week. . . . It gushes about 
the Monarchs' offensive front line -- 257-pound average -- and notes the team 
had "blown away" previous No. 1, Bishop Amat of La Puente. They quote Monarch 
defensive coordinator Eric Johnson who noted: "Since they don't play football 
in Russia, we're No. 1 in the world."

COLISEUM REPAIR COST SOARS TO $92.7 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The cost of the earthquake repair of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum has 
soared to a projected $92.7 million, a 50% increase over the $60 million figure 
used by Coliseum officials when the stadium reopened on Sept. 3, and more than 
2 1/2 times the original estimate made by Coliseum officials in February. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency already has paid $70.5 million and the 
state $2 million for the repairs. But Frank Kishton, the chief FEMA 
representative in Los Angeles, said for the first time this week that the 
federal and state governments will not pay for all the repairs. He said at 
least a small part of the costs incurred are ineligible for reimbursement. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coliseum's projected repair costs have reached an amount where, had it 
been known in advance, authorities might have opted to replace the facility 
rather than repair it. 
</P>
<P>
 When the repair project director, Don C. Webb, made the initial $35-million 
estimate soon after the Northridge earthquake, he acknowledged that costs could 
go far higher as further damage was discovered. But he and other Coliseum 
officials presumably knew the full extent of the damage by the time the 
Coliseum reopened. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview this week, Webb said that the $60-million figure given in 
early September was only for work that had already been done, and not work that 
he knew had yet to be done. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he said, he is ready to acknowledge that the $92.7-million projected cost 
is not the final figure, but he cannot say how much it might still rise. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA's Kishton said in an interview that the government would refuse to pay 
the entire cost of 56 steel-reinforced beams installed to provide seismic 
strengthening, since they were built larger and stronger than needed for the 
present Coliseum, with an aim to support eventual luxury boxes on the Coliseum 
rim. 
</P>
<P>
 Kishton also said it is likely that all work on new concession stands will not 
be reimbursed, assuming that the stadium will end up with more concession space 
than it had before. 
</P>
<P>
 A bigger press box also would not be fully eligible for reimbursement, the 
federal official said. 
</P>
<P>
 A project cost chart released by Webb estimates future costs of replacing the 
press box at $5.7 million and future concession costs at $2 million. A 
breakdown of already expended construction costs includes $30.8 million for 
concourse and reinforcing work, but no specific figure is given for the beams. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coliseum is financially strapped, but Coliseum Commission President Yvonne 
Brathwaite Burke Thursday downplayed the chances that some repair project costs 
would be passed on to the commission, which is made up of city, county and 
state representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have to do an audit," she said of the federal government. "If there are 
betterments (improvements beyond original facilities), there won't be a 
government payment, but that's something that has to be negotiated. We don't 
believe there has been a betterment." 
</P>
<P>
 Kishton also said FEMA has always been concerned about the total repair costs 
because of a rule it has that if repair costs exceed 50% of the estimated cost 
of replacement of a damaged facility, the applicant for federal disaster repair 
funds can elect to replace rather than repair the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of its status as a national historic landmark, tearing down and 
replacing the Coliseum, assuming such a plan could have overcome the objections 
of historic preservationists, could well have been more costly than building an 
average stadium elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 For comparison purposes, an almost entirely new, 73,000-seat stadium now being 
readied for pro football in Jacksonville, Fla., is slated to cost $122 million. 
On Thursday, Harry Ornest, vice chairman of Hollywood Park, estimated that a 
new football stadium could be constructed there for the Raiders at $150 
million, a matter under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 Kishton -- like Webb -- re-emphasized this week that when the decision was 
made to go ahead with repair of the Coliseum, the total costs were not known. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unlike a flood, where what you see is what you get, until you get a 
quake-damaged facility ripped apart, what you have in fact are estimates," 
Kishton said. And, he said, even when all the damage was discovered, there 
still had to be considerable work done to determine what was required to bring 
the Coliseum up to modern building codes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The costs weren't accurately estimated in advance, because the nature of the 
damage defied accurate estimates," Webb said. "And we had no advance plans. If 
we had waited to do those, we'd only be ready to start the repair now." 
</P>
<P>
 If there had been such a wait, with the costs reaching the amount known now, a 
replacement would have been theoretically feasible, but in the meantime, the 
Coliseum's prime tenants, the Raiders and USC, would have been playing 
elsewhere this season. 
</P>
<P>
 One Coliseum commissioner, Sheldon Sloan, insisted Thursday that the whole 
idea of replacing rather than repairing the Coliseum was "nonsense." 
</P>
<P>
 "They would never have done that," Sloan said. "With the preservationists, we 
wouldn't have had a standing stadium there for about five years." 
</P>
<P>
 As for changing cost estimates, Sloan said, "We weren't hiding things. We told 
everybody at the outset, 'We know it's going to be more.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But one question is how much more, and another is when Coliseum officials knew 
it was going to be as high as it has turned out to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Last June, for example, Webb said he had assured FEMA representatives that the 
cost would not reach $80 million after they had expressed concern. 
</P>
<P>
 Kishton indicated this week that one reason federal representatives had asked 
about that amount was that $80 million was close to the 50% amount that would 
trigger the replacement option. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke said, however, that replacement was always a moot question to her 
because repairs had begun and the facility was a historic monument. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost breakdown released by Webb this week shows that total repair bills 
paid up to now have reached $72.5 million. This includes $66.9 million for 
construction, $2.6 million for architects and engineers, $1 million for project 
management and $0.8 million for inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the construction costs, $30.8 million has thus far been spent on the 
concourse, $7.4 million for utilities, $7.4 million on the peristyle, $4.7 
million on landscaping and escalators, $4.6 million on insurance, bonds, taxes 
and such matters, $4 million on seating, $1.3 million on press box work already 
done, $2.7 million on the facility's tunnels and $2 million on concession 
equipment. And $2.1 million went to the general contractor, Tutor Saliba, for 
overhead and profit. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Webb said $13 million in other expenditures had been incurred, 
but are pending review for payment. These include $5.2 million in general 
construction, $6.4 million for a new video board and $0.8 million for work by 
the city's Department of Water and Power, as well as smaller items. 
</P>
<P>
 Estimated future costs on the press box, concessions and other construction 
are put at $7.8 million, Webb said.

LANDMARK ACCORD REACHED ON USE OF BAY-DELTA WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK CLIFFORD, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an historic accord that marks at least a temporary end to the bitter 
struggle over California's most precious water resource, Gov. Pete Wilson and 
senior members of the Clinton Administration signed an agreement Thursday to 
protect the Sacramento Delta estuary and provide reliable water supplies to 
farms and cities across the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Flanked by Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt and U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency administrator Carol Browner, Wilson declared that the 
three-year accord "signals a cease-fire in the water wars that have too long 
plagued California." 
</P>
<P>
 "It puts an end to a bitter conflict that has persisted for decades," 
President Clinton said in a statement released by the White House. "This is a 
solution that serves all the people of California." 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement covering the delta inland from San Francisco Bay at the 
confluence of the Sacramento, San Joaquin and a host of lesser Northern 
California rivers calls for: 
</P>
<P>
 * New rules on how much fresh river water must be left in the delta for 
environmental needs, including the habitat of the endangered chinook salmon and 
delta smelt. In a normal year the amount will be 400,000 acre-feet. In severe 
drought years the total will be 1.1 million acre-feet. 
</P>
<P>
 * Three years of certainty about water supplies from the delta for farms and 
urban customers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lesser curbs on water for the Metropolitan Water District of Southern 
California during drought years. Under the accord, the MWD will lose no more 
than 5% of its total water supply in severely dry years. 
</P>
<P>
 * New salinity standards for the delta and Suisun Bay, the nation's largest 
brackish marsh and a nursery for many of the estuary's 120 species of fish. 
</P>
<P>
 * Payment by the federal government if any more water is needed to help any 
species that become newly endangered. 
</P>
<P>
 Many environmental groups endorsed the final accord, although it closely 
parallels proposals by a coalition of urban and agricultural interests. 
</P>
<P>
 It will provide "an affordable and reliable future water supply," said John R. 
Wodraska, general manager of the Metropolitan Water District, which delivers 
water to 16 million Southern California customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really a big deal for California agriculture," said Dan Nelson of the 
San Luis and Delta-Mendota Water Authority, one of the largest water users in 
the Central Valley. The agreement has been coming together for several months, 
but pulling it off required a final week of marathon negotiations and 
significant federal concessions over how much water is required to support the 
delta's ailing aquatic life.  
</P>
<P>
 Often described as a crossroads of environmental and economic interests, the 
delta is the largest wetland habitat in the western United States. It also 
collects half of the state's annual runoff, provides 60% of the fresh water 
used in California and is the source of irrigation water for 45% of the 
nation's fruits and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 The accord "finally secures significant environmental improvements for the 
bay-delta estuary," said John Krautkraemer of the Environmental Defense Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the enthusiasm was not universally shared among environmental 
activists. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the basis of respected independent scientists, there is no assurance that 
California salmon will survive this political compromise," said state Sen. Tom 
Hayden (D-Santa Monica). 
</P>
<P>
 For the Clinton Administration, which is girding for a Republican assault on a 
variety of environmental regulations, the pact offers an opportunity to argue 
that it can be flexible on crucial issues. That is particularly so in regard to 
one of the most embattled conservation laws, the Endangered Species Act. 
</P>
<P>
 "It (the agreement) allows us a very powerful case study that the Endangered 
Species Act is workable and can play an important role in finding the balance 
between the economy and the environment," Babbitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Wilson, who has been accused in the past of walking away from potential 
solutions to the delta impasse, the signing ceremony at the state Capitol was a 
moment to savor. 
</P>
<P>
 He had insisted that he would not go along with any plan that did not change 
the way that federal agencies, in charge of administering the Endangered 
Species Act, dictated the flow of water available to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has contended that implementation of the act led to arbitrary 
interruptions of water supplies that made it impossible for water agencies to 
calculate future supplies or costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it was a series of events independent of the governor that created much of 
the impetus for the accord. 
</P>
<P>
 Momentum for an agreement began after the EPA, reacting to a refusal by Wilson 
to set delta protection standards, announced that it would step in to impose 
federal rules. Then last March, Standard & Poor's warned that if something 
wasn't done to end the delta water dispute, the state's credit rating, already 
hurt by the recession, could be further weakened. 
</P>
<P>
 The warning prompted a dozen top executives of leading California businesses 
to write to Wilson and Clinton that if state and federal officials did not come 
up with an acceptable delta policy, the economic recovery in California could 
be jeopardized. 
</P>
<P>
 By midsummer, negotiations between state and federal officials began to show 
progress on one of the most important elements in the accord -- a standard to 
govern how much water must be allowed to flow past diversion pumps in order to 
establish a healthy balance between fresh and salt water in the estuary.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, progress on another front was being made by a coalition of urban 
and agricultural water users under the leadership of Wodraska and Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
 They began lobbying in Washington and Sacramento for a plan that became the 
basis for the accord. The Wilson Administration endorsed the plan, which called 
for reserving several hundred thousand acre-feet less water for environmental 
needs in critically dry years than was being recommended by federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the same environmentalists who ultimately signed the accord argued 
that the coalition's plan would lead to the extinction of endangered fish. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Republican Party's triumph in the November election changed the 
political environment in such a dramatic way that the coalition's proposal, 
with some modification, began to look like the best deal that might be struck 
on the delta. 
</P>
<P>
 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) Delta Agreement 
</P>
<P>
 State and federal officials announced a plan to restore the environmental 
health of the estuary that stretches from San Francisco Bay to the 
Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the key points of the agreement: 
</P>
<P>
 * New standards for salinity of delta water and Suisun Bay, the nation's 
largest brackish marsh. 
</P>
<P>
 * Water guaranteed for environmental needs in the delta: 400,000 acre-feet in 
normal years, 1.1 million acre-feet in extreme drought years.  
</P>
<P>
 * No new species to be listed as threatened for at least three years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Increased role of the state in delta water policy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Water users will bankroll fund to reduce fish loss by installing screens and 
other steps.

POSTAL AGENCY FACES FIGHT WITH HIGH-TECH RIVALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL A. HILTZIK, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Postal Service is confronting a technological assault that as never 
before threatens its cherished monopoly over the delivery of letters, even as 
its mail volume this year is expected to rise to a record 177 billion pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 And how is it responding? Critics say the agency has an instinct to answer 
competition with brute force that is one of the clearest signs that it 
mistrusts -- rather than values -- its customers. 
</P>
<P>
 That defensive posture, say analysts, is among the many qualities that must 
change if the Postal Service is to survive into the 21st Century as a going 
concern rather than a ward of the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 "The model of a mail monopoly is gone," said Robert Reisner, the agency's vice 
president for technology applications. "The customers have choices, and they 
will choose." 
</P>
<P>
 But while postal officials may know the change is coming, it has proved hard 
to live with. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Atlanta headquarters of Equifax, armed postal inspectors arrived one 
day, demanding to know whether all the mail that the large financial services 
company was sending via Federal Express was truly urgent. They also asked why 
paychecks being sent to outlying offices should not go by regular mail and even 
wanted to open personal mail.  
</P>
<P>
 "They lived with me for four months," recalls Joseph Steinbeck, Equifax's vice 
president for mail distribution. "They questioned everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Equifax refused to allow the personal mail to be opened, but it did eventually 
agree to pay the Postal Service a penalty of $30,000. It was essentially a fee 
allowing the firm to use Federal Express as it wished for the following year 
without Postal Service harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Postal Service initially maintained that it had the authority to 
investigate the use of express mail and levy the fine because such urgent mail 
is carried privately only under a special agency exemption. But the agency's 
enforcement of the exemption proved so excessive that it led to a congressional 
investigation this year and a pledge by Postmaster General Marvin T. Runyon Jr. 
not to use postal inspectors to audit customer mailings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pay $150,000-$200,000 a month in postage," Steinbeck said. "That means they 
jumped on the people who are supporting them. It hurt my feelings more than 
anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, electronic mail, fax and electronic funds transmissions all can 
move information and money faster, cheaper and more securely than the Postal 
Service. Alternate delivery services can hang advertising material and 
magazines on your doorknob for less than the cost of mailing them -- and their 
business soars every time the Postal Service wins a rate increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Express, Roadway Express, DHL and a host of other firms beat the 
Postal Service by hours on express delivery -- and if your business does enough 
volume with them they'll do it at a price per envelope well below the Postal 
Service's Express Mail minimum of $9. Private carriers typically offer faster 
and more reliable service and the capability to track a package's route from 
sender to recipient. 
</P>
<P>
 Land's End, the Wisconsin-based "mail-order" merchandiser, actually receives 
only 15% of its orders by post, as opposed to its 800 order line; the vast 
majority of customers using the mail today are those who pay by check rather 
than credit card. On the other end, the company forsakes the Postal Service's 
parcel post to ship 98% of its merchandise by United Parcel Service. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't a price issue with us," said Philip Schaecher, Land's End senior 
vice president for operations, noting that parcel post rates to some locations 
are lower than those of UPS. "It's that their service levels are not what we 
want them to be. If UPS says it will take two days, they make that 99% to 99.5% 
of the time. The post office is lucky to meet its standards 80%-90% of the 
time, and its standards are looser." 
</P>
<P>
 As competition has grown the rate of increase in first-class volume has 
sharply leveled off, from 4% in 1990 to 1.5% in 1993. In that time 
business-to-business mail has declined by almost a third, to just over 20 
million pieces, as businesses embrace new money-saving and lightning-fast 
communications media. 
</P>
<P>
 The shift by business customers to electronic communications cost the Postal 
Service about $1.8 billion in lost revenue from 1988 to 1991, according to a 
study by the General Accounting Office. (The GAO, the investigative arm of 
Congress, also warned that all of those services have been growing much faster 
-- on average 25% to 40% a year -- than mail volume.) 
</P>
<P>
 So far the drop has been offset by an increase in mail between businesses and 
consumers -- much of it bills, bill payments and merchandise orders -- but 
postal officials attribute much of that to a nationwide rise in the number of 
households. 
</P>
<P>
 "The risk to the Postal Service posed by competition and changing technology 
is very real," GAO Associate Director Michael E. Motley recently told a U.S. 
House committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The Postal Service itself believes that about 10% of the growing volume of 
electronic mail and fax transmissions represents a "diversion" of first class 
mail -- that is, messages that would otherwise have gone by post.  
</P>
<P>
 And it acknowledges that while the overall market for so-called correspondence 
and transaction mail -- the basic business of carrying letters, documents and 
funds -- grew to $45 billion this year from $26 billion in 1988, the Postal 
Service's share of that market dropped to 55% from 75%. 
</P>
<P>
 Given these trends, many in the mail industry believe the Postal Service has 
few options in confronting the future. It can seek out or develop new services 
for customers; it can improve its current performance so its traditional 
clientele sticks with it longer; it can prepare now for its inevitable 
downsizing; or it can be privatized or commercialized via the abolition of its 
monopoly over the delivery of letters. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of these steps would produce a postal system radically different from 
what existed in 1970, when Congress abolished the Post Office Department and 
dropped the postmaster general from the Cabinet.  
</P>
<P>
 The new, putatively independent Postal Service was to operate as a business, 
but it was forbidden by law to make a profit or show a loss. It was denied 
outright government subsidies and expected to cut costs, but it remained 
subject to federally mandated hikes in its employee health and pension expenses 
and to congressional opposition to closing unprofitable post offices or cutting 
back service.  
</P>
<P>
 Even more important, it became subject to a new regulatory body, the Postal 
Rate Commission. The PRC has 10 months to rule on any rate increase requested 
by the Postal Service. It also has the power to ensure that no one class of 
mail subsidizes any other and that no one group of customers -- big department 
stores, for example -- gets better rates than individuals mailing greeting 
cards to the proverbial "Aunt Minnie." 
</P>
<P>
 All of these factors contribute today to the Postal Service's difficulties in 
meeting competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "They gave it an institutional form of the HIV virus, and now it's weakened so 
much that you're seeing opportunistic infections all over the place," says Gene 
A. Del Polito, executive director of the Advertising Mail Marketing Assn., a 
Washington trade group for major postal customers.  
</P>
<P>
 "No business in America could ever succeed with the legislative and regulatory 
constraints that govern the Postal Service today." 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to doubts about the agency's future is the degree to which Runyon has 
focused on new businesses and services. 
</P>
<P>
 To gain a foothold on the so-called information superhighway the agency has 
proposed certifying delivery of e-mail messages to provide legally valid proof 
that they were sent and received and when -- much as the postmark has 
traditionally been accepted as proof of legal service.  
</P>
<P>
 The Postal Service has also suggested that it hold the public encryption key 
safeguarding e-mail transmissions of credit card numbers and other financial 
information -- generally regarded as crucial to the offering of commercial 
products and services over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 Under this concept, buyers of goods and services on the Internet would send 
the vendor an encoded version of his or her credit card number. The vendor 
would then turn to the Postal Service to decode the number and verify its 
legitimacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the service is starting a pilot program to install kiosks in post 
offices offering customers information, and conceivably documents, from federal 
agencies. It has undertaken an experimental program in Upstate New York to take 
utility meter readings electronically from letter carriers' vehicles, printing 
out gas and electric bills on the spot.  
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the agency has contracted to provide overnight delivery of 
merchandise ordered by customers of a new Time Warner television shopping 
network, set to debut next year in Orlando, Fla., with 4,000 customers. 
</P>
<P>
 But few believe that any of these ventures can make up for a long-term decline 
in its core business: delivering hard copy to offices and homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are these slam dunks, making billions of dollars risk-free to subsidize rural 
post offices?" asks Michael Cavanagh, a Washington-based consultant to major 
postal customers. "I doubt it."  
</P>
<P>
 All face either stiff private competition or questions about the Postal 
Service's competence. Several high-tech companies have already developed 
programs to certify and encrypt e-mail transmissions, raising the issue of 
whether a government agency is needed in a market potentially well-served by 
private enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Government kiosks and utility readings do not necessarily meld well with the 
traditional task of delivering the mail. As for Time Warner, some question 
whether the Postal Service can actually meet the standard of overnight delivery 
it promises -- and if it can, whether it won't eventually be shouldered out of 
the contract by a private competitor anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, many argue that the agency is trying to put its eggs into too 
many baskets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should continue to deliver hard-copy mail, not educate ourselves to 
compete with private sector companies," says Robert Setrakian, the San 
Francisco businessman and outgoing postal governor who was perhaps Runyon's 
fiercest critic on the board.  
</P>
<P>
 He argues that the Runyon administration has allowed itself to be distracted 
by the glitter of high-tech as a means of avoiding the "drudgery" of delivering 
the mail. "Getting into a field it doesn't know and that isn't related to its 
main business is wrong," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the Postal Service's recent record in applying new technologies is 
not an encouraging one. Take the creation in the early 1980s of E-COM. 
</P>
<P>
 This was a system by which business customers could transmit advertising 
flyers to any of 26 post offices specially equipped with computer printers. The 
idea was to give users a way to quickly and reliably saturate target areas with 
mass mailings. 
</P>
<P>
 As it happened, E-COM was an idea whose time had not yet come and was bound to 
disappear fast. It was designed to compete with Western Union Mailgrams, which 
were already considered obsolescent. The post office equipment could generate 
only plain-vanilla text messages on white paper, depriving users of the appeal 
of fancy printed graphics. 
</P>
<P>
 Once transmitted and printed out via high technology the E-COM messages were 
manually sorted and distributed conventionally to local post offices, where 
they once again became subject to all the mail's usual ills and delays. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Runyon and his lieutenants argue that their move toward high-tech 
reflects the needs of their own customers -- businesses as well as consumers 
who may not have access to the information highway other than through the post 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 "The promise of the information superhighway isn't going to be realized until 
the beginning of the next century," says Reisner, the agency's technology czar. 
Meanwhile, he adds: "We're working on new technologies not just because it's a 
revenue base but because the customer demands it." 
</P>
<P>
 But others say the challenge is so great that the Postal Service may be able 
to meet it only via a radical restructuring -- such as some version of 
privatization. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't had a debate about this in any depth within the last 100 years," 
says Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), the author of one bill to repeal 
the postal monopoly by allowing anyone to deliver first class mail. "We ought 
to take a look at how the demographics of America have changed and our 
technology has changed." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Runyon notes that throughout history reports of the post 
office's demise have proved premature. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they invented the telegraph, they said the mail's going out of 
business," he said in an interview with The Times. "The telephone, too. It's 
happened time after time." 
</P>
<P>
 But what distinguishes today's competitive environment from earlier eras is 
the extent to which the competition is coming from outside the bounds of the 
Postal Service's legal monopoly over delivery of letter mail. In fact, many 
experts believe the single biggest obstacle to better postal service is that 
very monopoly, established by a series of laws dating back to 1792, the 
so-called private express statutes.  
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the monopoly saps the Postal Service of any institutional impulse 
to satisfy customers and deprives it of the skills needed to thrive in 
non-monopoly markets like parcel post and express mail. The monopoly mentality, 
they argue, has prevented the agency from developing such services clamored for 
by customers as date-certain delivery of advertising mail and detailed tracking 
and tracing of parcels. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are only two ways to increase the efficiency of a government-owned 
monopoly," says Richard Geddes, a Fordham University economist who has 
testified before the Postal Rate Commission. "Repeal the monopoly or privatize 
it. Both are radical institutional changes for the Postal Service, but anything 
short of that won't lead to reform." 
</P>
<P>
 Postal officials fret that throwing the mails open to unbridled competition 
would lead to "cream-skimming": a scramble to service the most profitable 
routes -- inter-urban mail or business-district delivery, say -- while 
abandoning such thankless unprofitable routes as the inner cities and rural 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you'd see millions of small businesses go out of business if they 
can't communicate the way they do today," Runyon said. "We've got probably 8 
million small business people who really depend on us." 
</P>
<P>
 But others argue that the principle of universal mail service need not be 
sacrificed under a privatized or commercialized postal system; it could be 
protected by regulation -- by requiring bidders on profit-making routes to 
cover the less desirable ones as well, for instance -- or by charging more for 
delivery to outlying areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unprofitable routes would become profitable because people would pay a higher 
price," says John Ryan, a former postal governor who is a leading proponent of 
privatization. "That's what happens with everything else." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, there is little agreement on what a privatized or commercialized 
postal system would look like. Some proponents of change say one key would be 
changing the current system of postal regulation, by which the Postal Rate 
Commission figures the cost of all postal services and then approves a rate 
structure that covers it. 
</P>
<P>
 The postal system might be better served today by a structure in which the 
service is permitted a maximum overall rate, with automatic increases for 
annual inflation, and permitted to adjust prices as it sees fit within a given 
term -- say, five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "That way the Postal Service would have much more flexibility in setting 
rates," says Michael A. Crew, a Rutgers University economist who proposed this 
system in a study this year for the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington 
think tank.  
</P>
<P>
 Crew believes eventual privatization would be the "natural result" if such a 
change made the service a more effective competitor, "because it's 
inappropriate for a company funded by the Treasury of the United States to 
compete with private companies." 
</P>
<P>
 "Politically, the prospects of privatization are nil unless service gets so 
bad that people stop using it," says Ryan. Rep. Cox, on the other hand, 
believes a radical change short of selling off the service outright "is more 
likely to be taken more seriously in a new Republican Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 For all that, many believe the Postal Service's problems are so deep-seated 
that repairing it will not be an easy job. Says Cavanagh, the Washington postal 
consultant: "To say this is something an idiot could fix in 10 minutes is not 
true."

CLINTON OFFERS TAX CUT PLAN FOR MIDDLE CLASS; PRESIDENCY: HE CALLS FOR A MIX OF 
CHILD CREDITS AND SCHOOL-AID DEDUCTIONS BUT FAILS TO DETAIL THE FINANCING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER and JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton, in an effort to reclaim the allegiance of middle-income 
voters, proposed a series of personal tax cuts Thursday but did not offer a 
detailed plan to pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's middle-class tax cuts include a $500-per-child tax credit for 
children under the age of 13 and tax deductions for as much as $10,000 a year 
in post-high school education costs. 
</P>
<P>
 He also proposed expanding individual retirement accounts and consolidating 
all of the government's job training programs into a single plan that would 
provide training vouchers for those who lose their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 All the tax proposals, in what Clinton called his "middle-class bill of 
rights," would take effect Jan. 1, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 In an 11-minute address from the Oval Office, Clinton expressed sympathy for 
the millions of Americans who have not benefited from the current economic 
recovery and are "hurting, frustrated, disappointed, even angry." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking from a desk in front of holiday decorations and family photographs, 
Clinton delivered another talk designed to reverse a perilous political slide. 
He preached a new, conservative doctrine of tax cuts and reductions in 
government with all the fervor of a foxhole convert. 
</P>
<P>
 However, since Clinton did not outline hard choices on spending cuts to 
compensate for the revenue loss that would result from the tax cuts, he is in 
the position of underbidding the Republicans without being able to claim that 
he is any more responsible than the opposition in holding down the federal 
budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 The major competing GOP plan, the House Republicans' "contract with America," 
calls for a $500-per-child tax credit for all dependent children, not just 
those under 13. Families with incomes of as much as $200,000 a year would 
qualify for the Republican tax credit, compared with a $75,000 income ceiling 
under Clinton's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton estimated that his plan would cost about $60 billion in lost revenue 
over its first five years. House Republicans have estimated that the five-year 
cost of their plan, which also includes a capital gains tax cut, would be $147 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Clinton had declared explicitly that he would not propose a tax cut 
that would increase the federal deficit, he offered only vague promises of 
future spending cuts as the means to finance the bulk of his tax package -- 
something that he has accused the Republicans of doing. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, Clinton called for these tax cuts: 
</P>
<P>
 * A $500 credit for each child under the age of 13 for all families with 
incomes of $60,000 or less. Families with incomes between $60,000 and $75,000 
would be entitled to a reduced credit. Families with more income would get 
none. 
</P>
<P>
 * A provision that would allow families with annual incomes of as much as 
$100,000 to deduct $10,000 in college tuition expenses from their taxable 
income each year. Families with incomes between $100,000 and $120,000 could 
take a smaller deduction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just as we made mortgage interest income deductible because we want people to 
own homes, we should make college tuition deductible because we want people to 
go to college," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 * An IRA deduction of $4,000 ($2,000 for a single taxpayer) for all couples 
with incomes up to $100,000. Taxpayers would be permitted to withdraw IRA funds 
without penalty not only for retirement but also for education, catastrophic 
illnesses, the purchase of a first home or the care of an elderly parent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though the economic statistics are moving up, most of our living 
standards aren't," Clinton said in his brief talk. "It's almost as if some 
Americans are being punished for their productivity in this new economy. We 
have got to change that. More jobs aren't enough. We have to raise incomes." 
</P>
<P>
 Accordingly, the President said, he was proposing a "middle-class bill of 
rights" to provide tax relief and federal assistance for education and job 
training. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Republican response to the Clinton speech, newly elected Sen. Fred 
Thompson of Tennessee mocked Clinton for having said before the November 
election that tax cuts were unjustified and irresponsible. 
</P>
<P>
 "From what we heard tonight, the President's vision for the future now looks a 
lot like what Republicans just campaigned for -- at least until we start 
looking at the details," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your vote this election apparently got the President's attention. If the 
President's new position tonight represents a real change of heart we say, 
'Welcome aboard.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But the former prosecutor and actor added a veiled threat: "We welcome the 
President to help us lead America in a new direction. But if he will not, we 
will welcome the President to follow -- because we are moving ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said that the money to compensate for the tax cut 
would come from streamlining five government agencies and from extending a 
freeze on "discretionary" spending for two additional years, 1999 and 2000. The 
agency consolidations would provide about $24 billion over five years, while 
Clinton said that the extension of the discretionary cap would bring in $52 
billion in savings in 1999 and 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Aides said that the $16 billion in excess savings would be used to reduce the 
federal budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Discretionary spending is a broad category that covers programs from defense 
spending to highway construction that can easily be adjusted, year by year. It 
excludes programs, including Social Security and welfare, that entitle certain 
individuals to federal benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials acknowledged that calling for a discretionary 
spending cap falls short of proposing specific spending cuts to comply with 
that cap. In effect, Clinton was saying that he would propose a lower level of 
overall discretionary spending in future years -- and would decide how to 
reduce that spending in those years. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, the spending reductions would not go into effect until three 
years after the tax cut first had kicked in -- in the final two years of a 
second Clinton term in office. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite earlier discussions about reductions in spending for Medicare and 
Medicaid, the federal health care programs for the elderly and the poor emerged 
unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
 In his bid to save $24 billion by consolidating and streamlining agencies, 
Clinton would not eliminate any departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, he has ordered a "major restructuring" at the departments of Energy, 
Transportation and Housing and Urban Development. The General Services 
Administration and the Office of Personnel Management also would be subject to 
sizable cuts, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The President also would turn over to private industry the air traffic control 
system run by the Federal Aviation Administration and the Energy Department's 
emergency petroleum reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Clinton would consolidate roughly $12 billion in job training 
programs administered by the Labor Department into a single program that would 
funnel grants of $2,000 to $3,000 to those who had lost their jobs or wanted to 
change careers. They could then spend the money on a broad array of programs 
without having to deal with a federal or local bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Some senior Administration officials conceded privately that they were 
"uncomfortable" with the President's proposal. Some said that they see 
potential damage from the proposal to the Administration's credibility on 
deficit reduction. 
</P>
<P>
 White House Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta repeatedly has argued that the GOP 
approach to paying for its "contract with America" tax cut proposal -- a cap on 
spending for entitlement programs coupled with a constitutional amendment 
requiring a balanced federal budget -- represented "policy gimmicks" because 
cuts were not specified to comply with spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as last Sunday, Clinton promised to avoid such budgetary sleight 
of hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I intend to propose (a middle-class tax cut) as long as I can pay for it," 
Clinton said Sunday in his last public appearance, a press conference at the 
close of the hemispheric summit in Miami. "I do not want to see this deficit 
start going up again." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposals were the product of weeks of furious debate within the 
Administration over how to respond to the shellacking that Democrats took in 
the November elections and how to make viable the remainder of the President's 
term in office. 
</P>
<P>
 Beset by rambunctious Republicans, mutinous Democrats and a wary public, 
Clinton concluded that he must offer some sort of tax relief to beleaguered 
middle-class families and try in other ways to address their economic anxiety 
and political alienation. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and his advisers were scrambling all day Thursday to make major, 
last-minute changes in the shape of their tax plan, apparently to position the 
President's package in between the Republican alternative and a third proposal 
from Rep. Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), who will be House minority leader in the 
next Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Clinton unveiled a plan that was slightly different from one his 
aides had discussed as recently as Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours before Clinton spoke on national television, Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) 
offered his own proposal for a tax cut, calling for an immediate doubling of 
the income tax exemption for children from $2,500 to $5,000 per child. 
</P>
<P>
 Gramm, an all-but-declared candidate for the 1996 Republican presidential 
nomination, said that he would compensate for the $124-billion tax cut with a 
like amount of spending cuts over five years. The reductions would come from 
the discretionary budgets of the departments of Health and Human Services, 
Energy, Education, Labor, Transportation and Housing and Urban Development, 
amounting to a 16% budget reduction across the board. 
</P>
<P>
 If enacted, he said, the tax cut would "dramatically" reverse what he called a 
40-year trend in which the federal government "has spent more and more of the 
income of working American families." 
</P>
<P>
 Gramm said dismissively of Clinton: "I am glad that the President is beginning 
to at least hum along as we sing our song of less government and more freedom. 
. . . (But) the President is more than a day late and more than a dollar 
short."

</P>
<P>
 In his nationally televised address, President Clinton proposed a $60-billion 
mix of new tax credits and deductions, mainly for families with children and 
college students. Some highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 EDUCATION: Allows parents earning up to $100,000 annually to deduct $10,000 a 
year in tuition for college or other post-high school education. 
</P>
<P>
 CHILD CREDIT: Provides $500-per-child tax credit for all children age 13 in 
families with an adjusted gross income up to $60,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 IRA: Allows individuals earning up to $100,000 annually to claim up to a 
$2,000 deduction for putting money into individual retirement accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 PAYING FOR IT: Calls for $24 billion from cuts in federal agencies, $52 
billion from extending a freeze on all federal discretionary spending in 1999 
and 2000. Extra $16 billion goes toward deficit reduction.

SEC INVESTIGATING POSSIBLE BROKER KICKBACKS IN O.C.; BANKRUPTCY: RELATIONSHIP 
OF BROKERS TO OFFICIALS IS UNDER SCRUTINY, SOURCE SAYS. SUPERVISORS DENY 
WRONGDOING. SECURITIES ARE AUCTIONED FOR $483 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a broad investigation of 
possible influence peddling in the top reaches of Orange County government, 
looking specifically to determine whether brokers paid kickbacks to elected 
officials, a high-ranking source close to the investigation said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The probe has focused on "campaign contributions and kickbacks, things of that 
nature, and the relationship of broker-dealers to those officials," the source 
said. "When someone is making a lot of money on you, is there a quid pro quo? 
It's happened in the area of municipal securities before." 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, the county's investment pool -- driven by high-risk reverse 
repurchase agreements and structured notes -- suffered a $2.02-billion 
collapse. The loss led to the resignation of 24-year Treasurer-Tax Collector 
Robert L. Citron, and prompted county officials to file the largest municipal 
bankruptcy in history. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear whether any evidence of wrongdoing has surfaced in the SEC 
investigation. The Times reported Thursday that the SEC had issued subpoenas to 
members of the Board of Supervisors and Citron demanding that they turn over a 
huge array of documents -- including their federal and state tax returns, 
personal diaries and calendars, checking and savings account statements and 
records of any gifts or loans from investment brokers. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation focuses primarily on brokerages -- particularly Merrill 
Lynch, Wall Street's biggest investment house, which has handled millions of 
dollars worth of bond transactions for the county's investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday in Los Angeles, SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. suggested that 
Orange County voters oust the elected officials who allowed the debacle to 
occur. 
</P>
<P>
 "If your supervisors are so lax that they allow . . . that kind of 
speculation, I think the voters of that community should throw the whole bunch 
of (them) out of office," Levitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill Lynch spokesman Richard Silverman said Thursday that the firm would 
"cooperate fully" with the SEC. He declined to discuss the subpoenas, except to 
reaffirm that the brokerage acted "professionally and properly" in all its 
dealings with the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County supervisors, stunned by the unprecedented demand for records 
from the SEC, pledged to comply with the subpoenas but reacted angrily to any 
suggestion that the board may have been too close to Wall Street investment 
bankers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel absolutely confident that, as far as I'm concerned, I can sleep very 
comfortably," said Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley.  
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Thursday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Administrators of nonprofit agencies that contract with the county said they 
were becoming increasingly alarmed about delays in payment for services such as 
child abuse treatment and refugee vocational training. Some began to make 
emergency plans and held staff meetings to discuss layoffs, furloughs and even 
closure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to pare down everything we can until the county finds its feet 
-- and its head -- and finds the resources to keep us going," said Hank Paris, 
executive director of the Fullerton-based Child Guidance Center. 
</P>
<P>
 * Leaders of PTAs and educational foundations said the county's fiscal crisis 
could mean that thousands of dollars they raise each year for extras such as 
computers, music and art might go instead to pay for basic items and day-to-day 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 * The county auctioned $483 million worth of securities from its investment 
pool, the first step toward liquidating the fund, which has dropped $2.02 
billion -- about 27% -- in value this year. Officials of Salomon Bros., the 
county's financial adviser, expressed satisfaction with demand for the bonds on 
Wall Street, but they fetched less than the average value Salomon had 
attributed to the fund's less risky holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Officials unveiled an interim plan to divide the pool's revenues as the fund 
is liquidated, a process that could take from one week to six months. The 187 
cities, school districts and other agencies that invested in the pool -- along 
with youngsters whose damages from private lawsuits were deposited in the fund 
-- initially would receive 30% of the money they put in, a total of $2.24 
billion. The government agencies could then use the money to pay salaries and 
other bills. 
</P>
<P>
 * Talk of recalls mounted. Eileen Padberg, a prominent political consultant, 
said she expects to see recall movements against County Supervisors Roger R. 
Stanton and Gaddi H. Vasquez. Lake Forest resident Dianna Baumann said she has 
formed a group to gather signatures to prompt a recall of the board.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're encouraging people to send empty wallets to county supervisors," 
Baumann said. "We want them to know that they shouldn't come knocking on our 
doors, we have no more money." 
</P>
<P>
 * Assemblyman and longtime Speaker Willie Brown said he would support lending 
state money to Orange County, if necessary, to gas up police cars and keep 
schools open. But the Democratic leader of the lower house said he gleefully 
awaits begging by some Orange County legislators who refused to help out other 
areas in need -- including his hometown of San Francisco after the 1989 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gov. Pete Wilson directed state transportation officials to expedite a 
$15-million advance to the Orange County Transportation Authority, which has 
more than $1 billion tied up in the county's fund. The money is for road 
improvements, including the massive Santa Ana Freeway widening project. 
Repercussions Spread 
</P>
<P>
 The financial crisis was apparent on the streets of Orange County and in the 
corridors of financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 About 40 members of Teamsters Local 952 marched through the first floor of 
Merrill Lynch's Santa Ana office, accusing the investment firm of profiting 
from the county's financial ruin. Protesters demanded the brokerage return 
profits made from underwriting risky investments with tax money. The union 
represents 15,000 workers in Orange County . 
</P>
<P>
 A Westminster resident, Nancy Schwartz, was shaken when an American Savings 
Bank branch initially refused to cash a county-issued child-support check. 
After a flurry of calls verified that funds in the county's child-support 
account were not frozen, the branch agreed to accept the $200 deposit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a hell of a scare," Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The people who run nonprofit organizations were nervous, too, about when they 
would be paid. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think about anything else," said Paris, whose children's center 
contracts with the county to provide child-abuse counseling and other 
mental-health services. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the county owes his group $200,000 -- much of it money the county 
simply administers for the state and federal governments. Paris said the center 
would be forced to close if the money didn't arrive by Feb. 15. "The statement 
that the checks are in the mail could never be more beautiful," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paris said he gave notice to his staff at a meeting Thursday that the 
organization will have to close its doors if the money doesn't come. The agency 
employs 55 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Paris and the other nonprofit administrators said their predicament is all the 
more frustrating because the money they are waiting for is not among funds that 
the county was handling for other government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that we feel this threat and this possible loss and this confusion 
-- it seems like we hardly deserve it," said Marianne Blank, executive director 
of the St. Anselm Cross-Cultural Community Center in Garden Grove, which 
provides language and vocational services to Vietnamese refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 Blank said she met with her staff Thursday to tell them an emergency board 
meeting was called for next week. She said she only has enough money left to 
meet two more payrolls. "They looked stricken," she said, "but before the 
meeting was over they were trying to make me feel better." 
</P>
<P>
 Overshadowing Thursday's developments was the SEC investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said that SEC officials met with Citron in April to discuss his use of 
high-risk investments such as reverse repurchase agreements and structured 
notes. Those loans and instruments helped the county's investment fund earn 
enviable returns while interest rates were falling. But as rates rose over the 
past year, they helped drive the fund and the county into bankruptcy -- and 
Citron out of office. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron assured investigators that authorizations for such transactions came 
"at every level," one source said. "Now we're finding out that maybe this 
wasn't the case." 
</P>
<P>
 County Counsel Terry A. Andrus said that after discussing the matter with SEC 
investigators, the scope of the agency request for documents has been "narrowed 
somewhat," but he refused to elaborate. County officials say the precise amount 
of information to be turned over by the supervisors is still being negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, I have no reason to believe that the Board of Supervisors is 
the subject of that investigation," Andrus said. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrus quoted from the SEC's letter to the supervisors, which said the inquiry 
"should not be construed as an indication . . . that any violations of law have 
occurred." 
</P>
<P>
 A former federal agent said the SEC's broad-brush approach to the Orange 
County case was not unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 "To some degree it's a fishing expedition; they are looking for what's there," 
said Sam Gruenbaum, an attorney with Cox Castle & Nicholson in Los Angeles and 
a former high-ranking SEC enforcement officer. "They will be looking at whether 
the relationships that existed were purely for underwriting or if there was 
more to the relationship that wasn't disclosed." 
</P>
<P>
 If there were financial ties between the supervisors and Wall Street firms 
that were not disclosed -- either to other board members or to those who 
invested in the county pool at the time of the county's bond deals -- that 
could point to possible violations of securities laws, Gruenbaum and others 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they find improper links, that could be the basis for serious 
non-disclosure issues," said Gruenbaum. "How much disclosure should there have 
been about the county's investment policy is very complicated." 
</P>
<P>
 Citron's attorney, David Weichert, declined to comment on the SEC 
investigation or the request for records from his client. But Weichert said the 
SEC action was not unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not surprised at all that the SEC would take an interest in the 
circumstances surrounding the county's loss," he said. "Furthermore, we believe 
that when all facts come to light, Mr. Citron will be totally exonerated from 
the reckless charges and innuendo that has appeared regularly in the press." 
Investors Gather 
</P>
<P>
 While the SEC investigation continued, a group of officials representing 
cities, schools and other public entities said they would need $117 million of 
their money from the county fund by week's end. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the officials emerged tight-lipped from the closed-door briefing in 
Santa Ana by Salomon Bros., part of the county's new financial team.  
</P>
<P>
 "They're doing a scheduled, logical liquidation of their assets," said Villa 
Park City Manager Fred Maley. "I think they've got some of the best people 
working on the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 But others said the meeting's atmosphere was edgy and that many of the 
investors' substantive questions about how and when money will be disbursed 
from the fund remained unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're blowing sunshine at you," said one attorney who represents a water 
district as he emerged from the meeting. "We have payrolls that have to be 
committed to next week." 
</P>
<P>
 Echoing criticism from Wall Street, officials of some of the agencies that 
invested in the pool questioned whether the entire fund should be sold off now; 
specifically, they urged Salomon Bros. to keep holdings with a maturity of four 
years rather than rushing to sell them. 
</P>
<P>
 And the jostling for priority among the fund's creditors continued, with some 
agency officials indicating they thought the county should be last in line -- 
behind the cities, schools and other investors -- for withdrawing money from 
the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Also up in the air is how property tax collections due for distribution on 
Tuesday will be doled out, said Joel S. Miliband, an attorney whose firm 
represents the cities of Newport Beach, Laguna Hills and Fountain Valley, along 
with several water districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Miliband said the creditors need to sit down to work out "which agencies need 
cash and for what purposes and how much. . . . The question is, 'Who has 
emergency cash needs in the next 10 days, intermediate needs in the next 30 
days?' When everybody thinks about what needs to happen, they'll see that there 
has to be cooperation." Securities Auctioned 
</P>
<P>
 Salomon Bros. sold $483 million of the county's remaining $7.96 billion of 
securities in a wide-open auction Thursday, the first step in making funds 
available to the pool's investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the face value of the bonds sold was $483 million, they were sold for 
prices ranging from 89.5 cents to 94.5 cents on the dollar. So the county's 
actual cash intake from the sale will be between $432 million and $456 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The rush to unload them came as county officials tried to ward off a slew of 
new economic announcements that they believed could cause another hike in 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The bonds attracted offers from a substantial number of investors, drawing 
$7.5 billion in bids, according to Salomon.  
</P>
<P>
 "We were very pleased with demand," a Salomon executive said. The sale got a 
boost from a drop in shorter-term market interest rates, as more investors 
began to bet that the Federal Reserve Board will defer any additional rate 
hikes until 1995. The Fed meets next week. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wall Street analysts said the bonds sold Thursday were conventional issues 
maturing in two to four years -- the kind of holdings that should be the 
easiest to sell among the county pool's remaining securities. Salomon's much 
bigger challenge will be to auction or restructure the complex "derivatives" 
that comprise 60% of the remaining portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Salomon had estimated that the overall portfolio was worth about 92 
cents on the dollar. If sold for less than that, the 27% loss now expected by 
fund investors from their original deposits to the fund will grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Salomon said it will auction another $566 million of the county fund's bonds 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas W. Hayes, the former state treasurer who is now the county's chief 
financial adviser, said he was pleased by Thursday's sale. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got good prices consistent with what we thought we would get," he said.

 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) Investigating the O.C. Bond Crisis 
</P>
<P>
 These regulatory and law enforcement agencies are looking into the investment 
practices that led to Orange County's financial crisis: SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE 
COMMISSION 
</P>
<P>
 What it does: Created in 1934 after the stock market crash of the Great 
Depression, the federal agency regulates stock and bond brokers and the 
securities industry as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 Role in the bond crisis: The SEC has subpoenaed extensive records from the 
five-member Board of Supervisors and at least three financial advisers who 
helped the county issue bonds, the proceeds of which found their way into the 
troubled county investment pool. NATIONAL ASSN. OF SECURITIES DEALERS 
</P>
<P>
 What it does: An industry self-regulatory organization that oversees stock and 
bond brokers and their employers. 
</P>
<P>
 Role in the bond crisis: The NASD is investigating $3,000 in contributions 
from three Merrill Lynch employees to former County Treasurer-Tax Collector 
Robert L. Citron during his reelection campaign earlier this year. COMMODITY 
FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION 
</P>
<P>
 What it does: A federal watchdog agency that monitors the activity on the 
various commodity market exchanges. It does for commodity futures trading what 
the SEC does for stock and bond trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Role in the bond crisis: The CFTC is reviewing documents to determine whether 
the county investment portfolio held any futures commodities and, if so, 
whether federal regulations were followed. ORANGE COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S 
OFFICE 
</P>
<P>
 What it does: The county office that prosecutes criminal violations of state 
and local law. It also represents the government in civil suits to collect 
taxes or take property for public use. 
</P>
<P>
 Role in the bond crisis: Probing bond controversy, including possibly checking 
allegation that Citron accepted improper gifts from investment firms. U.S. 
ATTORNEY'S OFFICE 
</P>
<P>
 What it does: Acting as an arm of the U.S. Department of Justice, the office 
prosecutes criminal and civil violations of federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 Role in the bond crisis: Conducting an inquiry to determine if the U.S. mail 
or telephone wires were used to defraud investors in the now-collapsed county 
investment pool.

 SAVE THE TREES: The Joshua tree has been no match for suburbia. Antelope 
Valley's development in the 1980s destroyed about 200,000 Joshua trees. But, by 
purchasing five acres last week, the city of Lancaster is now halfway toward 
creating a 95-acre woodland preserve to keep the densest areas of the trees' 
growth intact (B1). . . . The tree is believed to have been named by Mormons 
traveling to Utah in the mid-1800s.

<P>
 FREDDY'S BACK: The first time Tex-Mex singer Freddy Fender played North 
Hollywood's Palomino, he was hot and so was the club. Trouble is that was 1975. 
But Fender is trying to make it back, and so is the Palomino. He'll play there 
Dec. 23 and 24. . . . "I wanted to be part of the Palomino's coming back," 
Fender says. "Once you play at the Palomino, you want to play there again." See

 SHOPPING: You don't have to hit the big malls to find great buys in the 
Valley. Just check out the small shops offering books, cigars -- even 
harmonicas. . . . Lionel Richman, above, looks at travel books at Geographica

experience, try Tri-Ess Sciences. It sells anything from hydrochloric acid to 
life-size plastic skeletons. See Valley Life! Page 8.

 ON TRACK: Despite the Amtrak cuts announced this week, passenger trains will 
still rumble through the Valley. The L. A. to Seattle route, which stops at 
Glendale, will keep operating daily, Amtrak's Dawn Soper says. . . . Glendale 
is a popular stop. Over the summer, it served 17,163 passengers, making it 84th 
out of 540 cities nationwide.

 SAME CADY: The scenery has changed, but Mick Cady's act hasn't. As basketball 
coach at San Fernando High, he still pushes his players hard. His approach 
worked at Notre Dame, which captured the 1992-93 Southern Section Division 
III-A title. . . . This time will be tougher. His team isn't likely to make the 
playoffs (C14). Michael Arkush

CLINTON OFFERS TAX CUT PLAN FOR MIDDLE CLASS; PRESIDENCY: HE CALLS FOR A MIX OF 
CHILD CREDITS AND SCHOOL-AID DEDUCTIONS BUT FAILS TO DETAIL THE FINANCING. 
</P>

<P>
 President Clinton, in an effort to reclaim the allegiance of middle-income 
voters, proposed a series of personal tax cuts Thursday but did not offer a 
detailed plan to pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's middle-class tax cuts include a $500-per-child tax credit for 
children under the age of 13 and tax deductions for as much as $10,000 a year 
in post-high school education costs. 
</P>
<P>
 He also proposed expanding individual retirement accounts and consolidating 
all of the government's job training programs into a single plan that would 
provide training vouchers for those who lose their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 All the tax proposals, in what Clinton called his "middle-class bill of 
rights," would take effect Jan. 1, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 In an 11-minute address from the Oval Office, Clinton expressed sympathy for 
the millions of Americans who have not benefited from the current economic 
recovery and are "hurting, frustrated, disappointed, even angry." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking from a desk in front of holiday decorations and family photographs, 
Clinton delivered another talk designed to reverse a perilous political slide. 
He preached a new, conservative doctrine of tax cuts and reductions in 
government with all the fervor of a foxhole convert. 
</P>
<P>
 However, since Clinton did not outline hard choices on spending cuts to 
compensate for the revenue loss that would result from the tax cuts, he is in 
the position of underbidding the Republicans without being able to claim that 
he is any more responsible than the opposition in holding down the federal 
budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 The major competing GOP plan, the House Republicans' "contract with America," 
calls for a $500-per-child tax credit for all dependent children, not just 
those under 13. Families with incomes of as much as $200,000 a year would 
qualify for the Republican tax credit, compared with a $75,000 income ceiling 
under Clinton's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton estimated that his plan would cost about $60 billion in lost revenue 
over its first five years. House Republicans have estimated that the five-year 
cost of their plan, which also includes a capital gains tax cut, would be $147 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Clinton had declared explicitly that he would not propose a tax cut 
that would increase the federal deficit, he offered only vague promises of 
future spending cuts as the means to finance the bulk of his tax package -- 
something that he has accused the Republicans of doing. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, Clinton called for these tax cuts: 
</P>
<P>
 * A $500 credit for each child under the age of 13 for all families with 
incomes of $60,000 or less. Families with incomes between $60,000 and $75,000 
would be entitled to a reduced credit. Families with more income would get 
none. 
</P>
<P>
 * A provision that would allow families with annual incomes of as much as 
$100,000 to deduct $10,000 in college tuition expenses from their taxable 
income each year. Families with incomes between $100,000 and $120,000 could 
take a smaller deduction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just as we made mortgage interest income deductible because we want people to 
own homes, we should make college tuition deductible because we want people to 
go to college," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 * An IRA deduction of $4,000 ($2,000 for a single taxpayer) for all couples 
with incomes up to $100,000. Taxpayers would be permitted to withdraw IRA funds 
without penalty not only for retirement but also for education, catastrophic 
illnesses, the purchase of a first home or the care of an elderly parent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though the economic statistics are moving up, most of our living 
standards aren't," Clinton said in his brief talk. "It's almost as if some 
Americans are being punished for their productivity in this new economy. We 
have got to change that. More jobs aren't enough. We have to raise incomes." 
</P>
<P>
 Accordingly, the President said, he was proposing a "middle-class bill of 
rights" to provide tax relief and federal assistance for education and job 
training. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Republican response to the Clinton speech, newly elected Sen. Fred 
Thompson of Tennessee mocked Clinton for having said before the November 
election that tax cuts were unjustified and irresponsible. 
</P>
<P>
 "From what we heard tonight, the President's vision for the future now looks a 
lot like what Republicans just campaigned for -- at least until we start 
looking at the details," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your vote this election apparently got the President's attention. If the 
President's new position tonight represents a real change of heart we say, 
'Welcome aboard.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But the former prosecutor and actor added a veiled threat: "We welcome the 
President to help us lead America in a new direction. But if he will not, we 
will welcome the President to follow -- because we are moving ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 "Welcome aboard" were the two words most often uttered by Orange County 
Republicans who responded to the President's proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Republican Congress will reduce taxes and slash government spending," 
said Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), the incoming chairman of the House 
Republican Policy Committee. "If the President signs our legislation, he will 
deserve a share of the credit." 
</P>
<P>
 But Cox also said that while Clinton has moved more to the right, the center 
of the debate also has shifted since the Nov. 8 election that resulted in 
Republicans gaining control of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that key Republicans have proposed abolishing the income tax or 
instituting a 17% "flat tax," Cox said the "tinkering of the margins that 
comprise the President's proposals looks timid in comparison." 
</P>
<P>
 So anti-climactic was Clinton's speech, however, that two of the three Orange 
County congressmen who offered their assessments did so even before the 
President addressed the national television audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's come aboard on what's a Republican issue," said Rep. Ron Packard 
(R-Oceanside), before the speech. Packard said he is not worried about who gets 
the credit for cutting taxes because "I think everybody in America knows this 
is part of our (Republican) agenda." 
</P>
<P>
 But Packard also issued a challenge to Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will cooperate on the middle-income tax cut and then we are going to turn 
right around and ask him to cooperate with us on a capital gains tax cut," he 
said, advocating a proposal not favored by Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Ed Royce (R-Fullerton) said he also welcomes the President's apparent 
conversion to a more responsive and less top-heavy kind of government." 
</P>
<P>
 "This was, after all, clearly the message sent by the voters when they sent 
the GOP majority to Washington," Royce said. "It's good to know that everyone 
has heard it, all the way to the top." 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said that the money to compensate for the tax cut 
would come from streamlining five government agencies and from extending a 
freeze on "discretionary" spending for two additional years, 1999 and 2000. The 
agency consolidations would provide about $24 billion over five years, while 
Clinton said that the extension of the discretionary cap would bring in $52 
billion in savings in 1999 and 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Aides said that the $16 billion in excess savings would be used to reduce the 
federal budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Discretionary spending is a broad category that covers programs from defense 
spending to highway construction that can easily be adjusted, year by year. It 
excludes programs, including Social Security and welfare, that entitle certain 
individuals to federal benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials acknowledged that calling for a discretionary 
spending cap falls short of proposing specific spending cuts to comply with 
that cap. In effect, Clinton was saying that he would propose a lower level of 
overall discretionary spending in future years -- and would decide how to 
reduce that spending in those years. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, the spending reductions would not go into effect until three 
years after the tax cut first had kicked in -- in the final two years of a 
second Clinton term in office. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite earlier discussions about reductions in spending for Medicare and 
Medicaid, the federal health care programs for the elderly and the poor emerged 
unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
 In his bid to save $24 billion by consolidating and streamlining agencies, 
Clinton would not eliminate any departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, he has ordered a "major restructuring" at the departments of Energy, 
Transportation and Housing and Urban Development. The General Services 
Administration and the Office of Personnel Management also would be subject to 
sizable cuts, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The President also would turn over to private industry the air traffic control 
system run by the Federal Aviation Administration and the Energy Department's 
emergency petroleum reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Clinton would consolidate roughly $12 billion in job training 
programs administered by the Labor Department into a single program that would 
funnel grants of $2,000 to $3,000 to those who had lost their jobs or wanted to 
change careers. They could then spend the money on a broad array of programs 
without having to deal with a federal or local bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Some senior Administration officials conceded privately that they were 
"uncomfortable" with the President's proposal. Some said that they see 
potential damage from the proposal to the Administration's credibility on 
deficit reduction. 
</P>
<P>
 White House Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta repeatedly has argued that the GOP 
approach to paying for its "contract with America" tax cut proposal -- a cap on 
spending for entitlement programs coupled with a constitutional amendment 
requiring a balanced federal budget -- represented "policy gimmicks" because 
cuts were not specified to comply with spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as last Sunday, Clinton promised to avoid such budgetary sleight 
of hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I intend to propose (a middle-class tax cut) as long as I can pay for it," 
Clinton said Sunday in his last public appearance, a news conference at the 
close of the hemispheric summit in Miami. "I do not want to see this deficit 
start going up again."

 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) The President's Package 
</P>
<P>
 In his nationally televised address, President Clinton proposed a $60-billion 
mix of new tax credits and deductions, mainly for families with children and 
college students. Some highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 EDUCATION: Allows parents earning up to $100,000 annually to deduct $10,000 a 
year in tuition for college or other post-high school education. 
</P>
<P>
 CHILD CREDIT: Provides $500-per-child tax credit for all children age 13 in 
families with an adjusted gross income up to $60,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 IRA: Allows individuals earning up to $100,000 annually to claim up to a 
$2,000 deduction for putting money into individual retirement accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 PAYING FOR IT: Calls for $24 billion from cuts in federal agencies, $52 
billion from extending a freeze on all federal discretionary spending in 1999 
and 2000. Extra $16 billion goes toward deficit reduction.

SPREADING THE WORD ON PROP. 187; IMMIGRATION: ACTIVISTS PLAN CAMPAIGN TO DISPEL 
UNCERTAINTY OVER MEASURE'S STATUS IN WAKE OF FEDERAL RULING THAT PUT IT ON 
HOLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One day after a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction barring 
implementation of key portions of Proposition 187, activists statewide were 
mobilizing to get the word out that the hotly debated ballot measure on 
immigration is on hold indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 They plan public service announcements, neighborhood forums, distribution of 
pamphlets and notices in the Spanish-language media and other ethnic 
publications and broadcast programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This gives us a chance to get into the parishes, the barrios, the trade 
unions, and let people know that there's no reason to be afraid," said Bert 
Corona, national director of Hermandad Mexicana, a Los Angeles-based Mexican 
American rights group. 
</P>
<P>
 Widespread uncertainty about the measure's status has generated great anxiety 
in California's immigrant community, activists say, prompting some people to 
forgo medical treatment and even take their children out of school. 
</P>
<P>
 One Eastside clinic that saw a sharp decline in the number of clients after 
Election Day plans to send 200 volunteers door to door to reassure residents 
who are afraid that they or relatives will be turned in to immigration 
officials if they seek care. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187, approved overwhelmingly by California voters Nov. 8, would 
bar illegal immigrants from receiving public education and most 
taxpayer-financed non-emergency health care and social services. Educators, 
social workers, health professionals and law enforcement authorities would be 
required to report suspected illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting on a series of lawsuits challenging Proposition 187's 
constitutionality, U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer in Los Angeles 
enjoined most of its provisions from becoming effective until a trial 
determines their legality. Much of the initiative will now probably be bottled 
up in court for months or years -- if it ever takes effect.  
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Gov. Pete Wilson -- who made passage of Proposition 187 a 
cornerstone of his successful reelection campaign -- blasted the judge's 
ruling, declaring: "I will not tolerate this. The voters of California will not 
tolerate this." 
</P>
<P>
 But beyond continuing the court battle, it is unclear what the governor can 
do. State regulators continue to draft guidelines governing prospective 
implementation of Proposition 187, but such directives cannot be disseminated 
or put into effect without court sanction. 
</P>
<P>
 California authorities have argued that the regulations, once issued, would 
resolve questions about Proposition 187's constitutionality. But attorneys 
challenging the measure disagree, and Pfaelzer, in issuing her preliminary 
injunction, also expressed doubts that regulatory moves alone could allay 
constitutional concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 A state appeal of the judge's ruling is possible. An appeal, though, is far 
from a guaranteed success and may further delay the proposition's 
implementation. 
</P>
<P>
 Buoyed by their success in court, Proposition 187 opponents may request that 
Pfaelzer also enjoin a provision that bars illegal immigrants from state-funded 
colleges and universities. The judge excluded that section from her injunction, 
although she ruled that undocumented youngsters may continue attending public 
elementary and secondary schools. (Implementation of the post-secondary 
educational provisions remains on hold pending resolution of a separate lawsuit 
filed in state court in San Francisco.) 
</P>
<P>
 Pfaelzer also let stand two sections of Proposition 187 that increase 
penalties for the manufacture, sale and use of false documents to conceal 
citizenship or immigration status -- the sole provisions of the ballot measure 
now in effect. 
</P>
<P>
 In the months leading up to trial on Proposition 187's fate, lawyers plan to 
take depositions from state and federal officials about the measure's potential 
effects on California's health, educational and law enforcement infrastructure, 
said Peter A. Schey, one of the lead attorneys in the federal court challenge. 
Lawyers challenging the proposition predict adverse consequences if it is 
implemented, including a rise in contagious diseases and crime -- scenarios 
dismissed by proposition advocates as alarmist. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, proposition advocates -- outraged about their rebuff in federal 
court -- said Thursday that they are considering whether to step up efforts to 
intervene in the case. The main purpose would be to clarify the intent of the 
10-member committee that drafted the measure, said Ron Prince, who chaired the 
Proposition 187 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to be sure this initiative is adequately defended," Prince said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers challenging Proposition 187 contend that its sponsors illegally 
stitched together a state scheme to regulate immigration -- a task reserved for 
the federal government. Proposition framers deny such intentions.

DYE FOUND LETHAL TO MEDFLIES; PESTS: COLOR USED IN PEPTO-BISMOL AND LIPSTICK 
SHOWS PROMISE FOR REPLACING MALATHION, RESEARCHERS SAY. TWO MORE YEARS OF STUDY 
ARE EXPECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A pink dye used to color Pepto-Bismol and lipstick kills Mediterranean fruit 
flies and shows early promise for eventually replacing the pesticide malathion 
in California's costly and controversial war against the crop-destroying pest, 
federal researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
 Separate tests by two U.S. Department of Agriculture scientists show Medflies 
in Hawaii and Mexican fruit flies in Texas die when exposed to light after 
feeding on low concentrations of dye mixed with bait. Apparently when the dye 
catches light energy from the sun, oxygen turns into a destructive form that 
wipes out cells in the flies' gastrointestinal tracts. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings by entomologists Nicanor Liquido and Robert Mangan are being 
presented today at a meeting of the Entomological Society of America in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 Since aerial spraying of malathion -- used periodically to combat Medfly 
infestations in California -- has evoked a public uproar for over a decade, 
discovery of a nontoxic and inexpensive alternative could be a major advance 
for farmers and agricultural officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is very encouraging because there is such public demand for more 
biologically safe and environmentally safe (substances) as well as ones that 
the public are more comfortable with," said Liquido, a USDA research 
entomologist in Hilo, Hawaii.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, Liquido warned, "we try not to make a lot of promises" because 
larger-scale studies, expected to last at least two years, are necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would like to be very sure because of the impact of this research on 
Medfly eradication programs not only in the U.S. but outside the U.S," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry J. Voss, secretary of the California Department of Food and Agriculture, 
said he was cautiously optimistic about the USDA's new findings.  
</P>
<P>
 In laboratory tests that began in the fall of 1993, 65% of female flies died 
after they were fed a molasses or corn syrup mixture containing 0.1% of the dye 
for two days, Liquido said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 800 individual flies were fed each of 10 different dye concentrations 
and then exposed to artificial light. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, when a Medfly-infested 10-acre coffee field in Kauai was sprayed 20 
times over a period of three months, about 50% fewer Medflies were counted in 
the treated field than in an untreated field nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more encouraging results were reported on a related pest, Mexican fruit 
flies, during tests in Texas. "The flies have to seek out the bait station (in 
those trials)," Mangan said. "At least three-fourths of them did so -- and died 
-- in the first trials, and we hope to improve on that."  
</P>
<P>
 Liquido said the dye mix, called SureDye, did not injure crops and has no 
known harmful effects on humans, wildlife or other plants. USDA officials say 
the dye had undergone rigorous testing required by the Food and Drug 
Administration before its use as a color additive in consumer products such as 
antacids and cosmetics. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is considered very, very, very safe," Liquido said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dye is the medium-pink shade of hibiscus flowers, and when mixed with the 
brownish bait, it turns a maroon shade. The mixture, though, should not 
discolor the landscape when sprayed in an ultra-fine mist, Liquido said. 
</P>
<P>
 "California wouldn't turn pink," he said. "You wouldn't even see the mist." 
</P>
<P>
 The USDA will next test the dye mixture on a larger field in Hawaii. Voss said 
his department has also authorized research in California to resolve questions 
of whether it will work in the state's dry climate.

THE WASHINGTON CONNECTION / MARC LACEY: A LOT IS RIDING ON VENTURA TEN'S 
MISSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura Ten came to Washington with a mission. Bunking at the Quality 
Hotel for $69 a night, the former congressman, retired naval officer, citrus 
rancher and some of Ventura County's most heavyweight politicos felt the weight 
of an entire county resting on their shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 In three quick days they had to save their county from economic obliteration 
by persuading the Pentagon brass to save two Navy bases. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, you just don't climb on a plane out here and lecture admirals and 
deputy defense secretaries about how their decisions might devastate Oxnard or 
Simi Valley. To do it right, you speak Pentagon-speak and you pay careful 
attention to everything from what you wear on your lapel to what comes out of 
your mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 The delegation ironed out its message at countless strategy sessions back 
home: Stay pithy and to the point, they repeatedly reminded themselves, but 
deadly serious, too. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, besides the looming deadline -- a list of endangered bases will 
emerge in the spring -- the delegation faces another reality: Theirs is hardly 
the only community to push its case in the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While the Ventura County group attempted to save bases at Point Mugu and Port 
Hueneme, a separate group from the Indian Wells Valley spent the week here 
defending the Naval War Air Force Center at China Lake. Delegations from 
Monterey, Sacramento, Long Beach and Barstow have made recent visits too. 
</P>
<P>
 The Base Closure and Realignment Commission has seen about 100 community 
groups, chambers of commerce, city councils and other groups traipse through 
its doors in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 How can Ventura County hope to stand out? 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way we're going to be successful is to show that these bases have 
unique defense capabilities," explained former Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino 
(R-Ventura), who came along to offer his knowledge of the Washington scene. "We 
have to know our facts." 
</P>
<P>
 The group prepared comprehensive briefing papers and hauled along technical 
experts who know the inner workings of the bases cold. They stressed the 
county's one-of-a-kind geography, including assorted offshore islands, a 
deep-water port and a radar-crowded peak that rises nearly 1,500 feet from the 
Point Mugu base. 
</P>
<P>
 Style was important, too. 
</P>
<P>
 The group came up with an official-sounding name, the BRAC '95 Task Force, 
which refers to the Base Realignment and Closure law. They wore evidence of 
their patriotism on their lapels -- red, white and blue ribbons and tiny 
American flags. 
</P>
<P>
 (They did not, however, invite any decision-makers for drinks at their humble 
hotel, where a roach was spotted crawling up the leg of the pool table in the 
dimly lit bar.) 
</P>
<P>
 To set up the meetings in the first place, they took advantage of one of the 
cottage industries that have emerged from the base closure process: lobbyists 
specializing in keeping bases open. (The delegation stayed away from the other 
set of experts that have emerged, the ones who help communities convert closed 
bases to civilian uses.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody knows for sure whether a trip to Washington affects the base closure 
process a bit. Groups have come out here and lost their bases. Others have 
stayed home and survived. 
</P>
<P>
 One person who has listened to the community groups in the past is Jo Ann 
Miller, a former assistant secretary of the Air Force and Army. Now an aide to 
Gov. Pete Wilson, she is fighting to save California's bases. She says the 
group from Ventura County did the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "A community that does not make a visit would be at a disadvantage -- 
especially if there were erroneous information in any of the reports," said 
Miller, who spent 11 years in the Pentagon. "It's definitely worth the trip 
because once something gets in the report, you'd be hellbent on getting it 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the therapeutic side of it all. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Connell, who has visited Washington numerous times to help save the China 
Lake base, came out again this week, just so he'll sleep well at night when the 
Pentagon does finally make up its mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know for sure if we're doing any good," the former Navy test pilot 
said. "We have no way to be sure. But one thing we do know -- we've done 
everything we can." 
</P>
<P>
 And for those communities who have not made the trip, Connell offers this 
advice: "If you're planning your trip now, just putting it all together, I hate 
to say it, but you're probably too late." 
</P>
<P>
 As the Ventura Ten wound up their week, they congratulated one another on a 
job well done. Their presentations were snappy, they said, and at least one 
rear admiral said he learned a thing or two. Did they make a difference? Did 
they save Ventura County from a major blow?

MEDICINE / KAPOSI'S SARCOMA; RESEARCHERS LINK HERPES STRAIN TO SKIN TUMOR; 
ONCE-RARE CONDITION THAT IS NOW A HALLMARK OF AIDS MAY BE CAUSED BY PREVIOUSLY 
UNRECOGNIZED FORM OF THE VIRUS, STUDIES SHOW. DISCOVERY RAISES HOPE OF VACCINE. 
</P>

<P>
 Kaposi's sarcoma, the once-rare skin tumor that has become a hallmark of AIDS, 
may be caused by a previously unrecognized strain of herpes virus, according to 
California and New York researchers. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the tumor, which strikes at least one in every four AIDS 
patients, has been a mystery since its increased prevalence in such patients 
was first noted in the early 1980s. It has been linked tenuously to a variety 
of viruses, as well as to the nitrite inhalants called "poppers," but proof of 
such links has remained elusive. 
</P>
<P>
 A research team from Columbia University in New York City and DNAX Research 
Institute in Palo Alto reports today in the journal Science that it has 
isolated viral DNA that is related to herpes viruses from Kaposi's tumor 
tissue. The researchers found no such DNA in non-cancerous tissue from the same 
patients or in tissue from healthy individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers are now working to identify the virus itself in hopes of 
producing a vaccine or some form of drug therapy. "If we can prove that this 
putative virus actually causes the cancer, a diagnostic test could be developed 
that might help clinicians determine sooner who may be at risk," Dr. Yuan Chang 
of Columbia said Thursday at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a tremendously interesting result," said Dr. Harold Jaffe, head 
of the HIV/AIDS division of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 
Atlanta. "At this point, we can't definitely say it's the (causative) agent, 
but I think it's a very good candidate." 
</P>
<P>
 The classical Kaposi's sarcoma is a slow-growing skin tumor that strikes 
primarily elderly men of Mediterranean descent. It is characterized by purplish 
sores on the face and in the mouth. In AIDS patients, the disease progresses 
more rapidly, spreading to other organs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it occasionally strikes women and heterosexual AIDS patients, 
Kaposi's is primarily a disease of gay AIDS patients. As many as 50% of gay 
AIDS patients develop it. The two disorders are so closely associated that the 
presence of Kaposi's in a young person is considered a presumptive diagnosis of 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Chang and her colleagues used a powerful new technique called representation 
difference analysis to identify the viral DNA. The technique allows researchers 
to compare two different tissue samples and isolate DNA that is present in only 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 They found the viral DNA in tissue from 25 of 27 Kaposi's tumors and in six of 
39 biopsied tissue samples from various organs of people who had AIDS but no 
Kaposi's. In contrast, they found no evidence of the virus in biopsied tissues 
from 85 people with neither AIDS nor Kaposi's. 
</P>
<P>
 Chang said Thursday that researchers in five other labs had replicated her 
findings. "This work has been confirmed," she said. But the presence of the DNA 
in the tissues does not conclusively prove that the virus causes the tumors, 
she cautioned.  
</P>
<P>
 The virus might, for example, simply find the already-established tumor a 
fertile ground for growth. Proof that the virus causes the tumors will require 
much more work, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 The DNA isolated from the tumors appears to be fragments of three genes from a 
herpes virus. Seven types of herpes viruses have previously been isolated from 
humans. They cause diseases ranging from cold sores and chickenpox to genital 
herpes and cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate development that may improve the likelihood of developing an 
AIDS vaccine, Dr. Jay H. Levy and his colleagues at UC San Francisco report in 
the international medical journal The Lancet that a class of white blood cells 
called CD8 T-cells attack the AIDS virus during the early stages of an HIV 
infection. 
</P>
<P>
 After two to six weeks, the initial illness recedes, levels of virus in the 
blood fall, and neutralizing antibodies to HIV are produced. If this response 
of CD8 T-cells could be enhanced and prolonged, Levy said, the progression of 
an HIV infection to AIDS could potentially be delayed or perhaps even blocked. 
</P>
<P>
 Levy and his colleagues found seven HIV-infected individuals who had high 
levels of CD8 activity in their blood at the time they first showed HIV 
infection. In four of them, the activity was observed as much as one year 
before they became HIV-positive. 
</P>
<P>
 In three patients, the researchers observed a decrease in the level of HIV in 
the blood as CD8 activity increased, suggesting, they wrote, CD8 cells are 
"responsible for the control of HIV replication."

SUIT FILED AGAINST WILSON FOR BARRING U.S. VOTING ACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA RESPERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A coalition of voting rights organizations, led by the American Civil 
Liberties Union, filed suit Thursday in a San Jose federal court against Gov. 
Pete Wilson and the directors of several state agencies for their failure to 
implement the National Voter Registration Act, which President Clinton signed 
into law last year. 
</P>
<P>
 In an executive order in August, Wilson directed state employees to hold off 
on participating in the so-called motor-voter program until the federal 
government provides funding for it.The class-action suit alleges that the 
governor's order could deprive more than 1 million Californians -- many of them 
poor and minorities -- of an opportunity to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal law, which takes effect Jan. 1, is intended to boost citizen 
participation in elections. It allows residents to register to vote when 
applying for or renewing a driver's license or when applying for benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Rosenbaum of the ACLU said Wilson's arguments that the measure is too 
costly for the state to bear is "hogwash," adding that other state officials 
concluded that financial strains would be minimal. 
</P>
<P>
 "That executive order enacted by Gov. Wilson is smoking-gun evidence that it 
is the governor who will not play by the rules," Rosenbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some feel that California may not be able to make the Jan. 1 deadline for 
complying with the law, even if Wilson were to rescind his executive order. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said Thursday he has no intention of changing course. "I am very 
unhappy when any unfunded federal mandate is handed down by the federal 
government," he said. "And I just don't intend to pay that."

U.S. SETTLES PRICING LAWSUIT AGAINST VISION CARE INSURER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Justice Department on Thursday sued and settled with the nation's largest 
vision care insurer over allegedly illegal agreements that the government said 
discourage optometrists from cutting prices or offering discounts on vision 
care services. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the settlement, Vision Service Plan, headquartered in Rancho Cordova, 
Calif., will no longer require optometrists and ophthalmologists to give Vision 
Service the lowest price they charge individuals or other insurance plans. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreements inhibited vision care providers who did a large amount of their 
business with the plan from discounting their charges to others, Justice 
Department officials said, and they restricted competing plans from attracting 
and retaining enough doctors to serve their members. 
</P>
<P>
 Anne K. Bingaman, assistant attorney general for antitrust, said the suit and 
settlement marked the first national attack on a pricing practice reported to 
be widespread in the health care industry and noted that cases are under 
investigation in other segments of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 90% of California's optometrists have signed up with the plan, which 
does business with about 7.5 million consumers in the state, Bingaman said. One 
measure of the provision's impact is that the average price for an eye 
examination and glasses in California is $100 to $110, compared to $70 to $80 
in states where the plan is not in effect, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe the effect per plan member could be $20 to $30," Bingaman said. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, the federal antitrust enforcers settled a case against an Arizona 
dental plan that eliminated a similar pricing provision, known in the industry 
as a "most favored nation" clause. 
</P>
<P>
 VSP admitted no wrongdoing in settling the civil suit, and Roger Valine, the 
plan's president and chief executive officer, said the plan will adopt a new 
fee-setting system. Valine said VSP settled the case "to avoid long and 
expensive litigation with the Justice Department that could easily have cost 
thousands and maybe millions in legal fees." 
</P>
<P>
 In markets where a health care plan has only a small share, the pricing 
provision can encourage discounts, Bingaman said. But where the plan dominates 
the market, the provision discourages doctors from discounting to anyone 
because they would have to extend the lower prices to the bulk of their 
business in the dominant plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Bingaman said Vision Service applied the clause in about 42 states and the 
District of Columbia, probably harming vision care service consumers in all or 
parts of many of those states. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the clause, other vision care insurance plans have been unable 
to obtain discounts of 20% to 40% for which they had contracted with doctors, 
Justice Department officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Bingaman said she could not quantify the overall dollar impact of the 
clause, she noted that the vision care services market in California is well 
over $500 million a year, and that it is in the billions of dollars nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Elimination of the "most favored nation" clause in the VSP case "will promote 
operation of the free market," Bingaman said. "It will allow optometrists 
throughout the country who are members of Vision Services to discount as they 
see fit, case by case, plan by plan, consumer by consumer without fear that it 
will impact their revenue across their entire practices."

DOWNED PLANE'S PILOT SAVED AFTER PASSENGER HIKES 5 MILES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A pilot who crashed his small airplane in a canyon south of Palm Springs was 
rescued Thursday after spending the night in the cold and after his passenger 
walked five miles down the mountain in darkness to get help despite his own 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside County sheriff's Sgt. Jon Carlson said James Bixby's treacherous 7 
1/2-hour hike that led to the rescue of pilot Nathan Carriker displayed courage 
and endurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was dark, the guy was injured, and he's walking down a mountain canyon -- 
a drainage wash," Carlson said. "He was crawling over rocks, through ravines 
and around bushes. It's just amazing. It's a place you wouldn't want to walk 
through, even in daylight." 
</P>
<P>
 Carriker, 35, who sustained a broken back and other injuries in the crash, was 
listed in critical but stable condition Thursday at Desert Hospital in Palm 
Springs. Bixby, also 35, was listed in fair condition with facial injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlson said the men were flying in a single-engine Grumman American AA-1 
aircraft up Martinez Canyon in the Santa Rosa Mountains on Wednesday afternoon. 
He said the plane lacked the power to gain enough altitude to clear the rise of 
the canyon walls, and there was not enough room to turn around. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not supposed to fly up canyons in piston-engine airplanes," Carlson 
said. "They were digging themselves into a hole." 
</P>
<P>
 The plane crashed into boulders as the ground rose swiftly in front of it, 
Carlson said. Bixby helped Carriker out of the plane and covered him with a 
tarp to keep him warm as temperatures began to drop toward freezing. He took 
the aircraft's transponder -- which electronically signals its location -- and 
began his trek. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before midnight Wednesday, Bixby reached a roadside pay phone near the 
small community of Oasis and called 911. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities mounted a rescue effort but were thwarted by darkness. On 
Thursday, the wreckage was spotted by a helicopter, and Carriker was airlifted 
out.

SPREADING THE WORD ON PROP. 187; IMMIGRATION: ACTIVISTS PLAN CAMPAIGN TO DISPEL 
UNCERTAINTY OVER MEASURE'S STATUS IN WAKE OF FEDERAL RULING THAT PUT IT ON 
HOLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK J. McDONNELL and PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One day after a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction barring 
implementation of key portions of Proposition 187, opponents statewide were 
mobilizing to get the word out that the hotly debated ballot measure on 
immigration is on hold indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 From the San Fernando Valley to the governor's office, supporters of the 
proposition reacted with both anger and strategic acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents said they plan public service announcements, neighborhood forums, 
distribution of pamphlets and notices in the Spanish-language media and other 
ethnic publications and broadcast programs, to publicize the judge's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "This gives us a chance to get into the parishes, the barrios, the trade 
unions, and let people know that there's no reason to be afraid," said Bert 
Corona, national director of Hermandad Mexicana, a Mexican American rights 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 Widespread uncertainty about the measure's status has generated great anxiety 
in California's immigrant community, activists say, prompting some people to 
forgo medical treatment and even take their children out of school. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187, approved overwhelmingly by California voters Nov. 8, would 
bar illegal immigrants from receiving public education and most 
taxpayer-financed non-emergency health care and social services. Educators, 
social workers, health professionals and law enforcement authorities would be 
required to report suspected illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer in Los Angeles enjoined most of its 
provisions from becoming effective until a trial determines their legality. 
Much of the initiative will now probably be bottled up in court for months or 
years -- if it ever takes effect.  
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Gov. Pete Wilson -- who made passage of Proposition 187 a 
cornerstone of his successful reelection campaign -- blasted the judge's 
ruling, declaring: "I will not tolerate this. The voters of California will not 
tolerate this." 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Spencer, president of the Sherman Oaks-based Voice for Citizens 
Together, which backed the proposition, said his phones were ringing all 
morning with calls from Prop. 187 supporters angry over the federal judge's 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer's group has sued Los Angeles school board members, arguing that it is 
illegal for them to use public funds to fight a proposition passed by the 
voters. Maintaining that they could lose up to $600 million in federal funding 
and be forced to fire up to 10,000 teachers if the proposition's education 
provisions are implemented, the school district has filed a lawsuit against it 
in a San Francisco state court. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Board of Education President Mark Slavkin said the federal judge's 
decision shows the measure was flawed. "Our concerns have been validated," 
Slavkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Spencer, who is launching a recall drive against Slavkin for his role in 
the fight against the proposition, predicted the courts would ultimately uphold 
the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Others accepted the challenges philosophically as a long-expected development, 
saying that no matter what happens in the court cases, the message that much of 
the electorate is fed up with illegal immigration has been delivered to 
political leaders with great force. 
</P>
<P>
 "That purpose has been served," said Gerald Curry, president of the San 
Fernando Valley's United Chambers of Commerce. "But we'd like to see full 
implementation," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 But beyond continuing the court battle, it is unclear what pro-187 
officeholders like the governor can do. State regulators continue to draft 
guidelines governing prospective implementation of Proposition 187, but such 
directives cannot be disseminated or put into effect without court sanction. 
</P>
<P>
 Pfaelzer let stand two sections of Proposition 187 that increase penalties for 
the manufacture, sale and use of false documents to conceal citizenship or 
immigration status -- the sole provisions of the ballot measure now in effect. 
</P>
<P>
 In the months leading up to trial on Proposition 187's fate, lawyers plan to 
take depositions from state and federal officials about the measure's potential 
effects on California's health, educational and law enforcement infrastructure, 
said Peter A. Schey, one of the lead attorneys in the federal court challenge. 
Lawyers challenging the proposition predict adverse consequences if it is 
implemented, including a rise in contagious diseases and crime -- scenarios 
dismissed by proposition advocates as alarmist. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, proposition advocates -- outraged about their rebuff in federal 
court -- said Thursday that they are considering whether to step up efforts to 
intervene in the case. The main purpose would be to clarify the intent of the 
10-member committee that drafted the measure, said Ron Prince, who chaired the 
Proposition 187 campaign.

YELTSIN PAUSES ON BRINK OF FULL WAR IN CHECHNYA; RUSSIA: HIS TROOPS UNDER 
ATTACK AND HIS POLICY UNDER FIRE AT HOME, PRESIDENT OFFERS REBELS 48 MORE HOURS 
TO DISARM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 His troops under attack by guerrillas and his decision to deploy them under 
fire back home, Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin paused Thursday at the brink 
of a full-scale war with the breakaway Muslim republic of Chechnya and gave the 
rebels 48 more hours to disarm. 
</P>
<P>
 In an appeal to the Chechen people read on Russian television four hours 
before his previous ultimatum was set to expire, Yeltsin called for a 
cease-fire, negotiations and setting a date for new elections in Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (President) Dzhokar Dudayev personally agrees to lead the Chechen 
delegation to the negotiations, I will send a plenipotentiary high-level 
delegation from Russia," Yeltsin's statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin said he will extend the deadline of his ultimatum until midnight 
Saturday to try to "minimize the use of force, which could, regrettably, bring 
civilian casualties." 
</P>
<P>
 "I will consider a cease-fire on the part of the unlawful armed militias to be 
a show of goodwill and a first step toward the restoration of peace and 
legality in the Chechen Republic," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dudayev has previously demanded face-to-face negotiations with Yeltsin. There 
was no immediate word on whether he would accept Yeltsin's offer while Russian 
tanks are camped six miles outside the capital of Grozny. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian forces have been shelling the outskirts of the garbage-strewn, 
decaying Soviet-style concrete-block city of 400,000. Three people were 
reportedly killed Thursday when a Russian helicopter gunship fired on a farm 
near the settlement of Dolinsk, Reuters news service said, and Russians boosted 
their official death toll to 15, with 11 soldiers captured. Other reports put 
the death toll as high as 70 on both sides in the five days of fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Thursday, Dudayev had told reporters he was prepared to negotiate with 
Moscow. He called for a halt to Russian military activity, withdrawal of 
Russian troops from Chechnya and urgent high-level talks "with no 
preconditions." 
</P>
<P>
 The last round of peace talks in Vladikavkaz collapsed Wednesday after Russian 
negotiators demanded that Chechnya drop its 3-year-old declaration of 
independence and disarm before Moscow would withdraw its troops. Chechen 
negotiators demanded that the troops withdraw as a condition for disarmament. 
Russian television greeted Yeltsin's move with relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today at the last moment the hope of peace in Chechnya was preserved," 
correspondent Dmitri Motrich announced. 
</P>
<P>
 On the fifth day of Russian military intervention in the fiercely independent 
Chechnya, the Russian press with rare unity begged Yeltsin not to launch a tank 
offensive against Grozny. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are on the brink of a precipice. Stop!" advised the rural daily Selskaya 
Zhizn.  
</P>
<P>
 "Tomorrow the war will enter every home in Russia," declared the Moscow 
newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda. 
</P>
<P>
 A survey by the Mnenie polling organization released Thursday found 70% of 
those polled opposed armed intervention in Chechnya, up from 58% six days 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The Estonian capital of Tallinn offered Dudayev asylum Thursday. Dudayev, a 
former Soviet air force general, was once stationed in Estonia, and sided with 
the independence movement there.  
</P>
<P>
 However, even if Dudayev were to agree to leave Chechnya to help make peace 
with Moscow, as the anti-Dudayev opposition has demanded, it is not clear that 
all the rival factions would stop fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Dudayev's supporters say Chechen separatists have already set up combat posts 
in the mountains and plan to torment the Russian occupiers with sniper fire, 
terrorist attacks, rockets and missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Unconfirmed reports said that a Russian helicopter downed by Chechen fighters 
Wednesday had been hit with a Stinger missile, presumably supplied by the 
United States to Afghan rebels in the 1980s and then smuggled into Chechnya by 
Islamic sympathizers. 
</P>
<P>
 Chechnya, a mountainous republic of 1.2 million, remains a poor outpost of the 
old Soviet empire despite its rich oil reserves. What its leader wants most is 
to be treated as an equal with Russia under international law, Chechnya's 
deputy foreign minister said.

COLOMBIA; PLAN TO OK PRIVATE SECURITY FORCES FOR FARMERS DRAWS FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Frustrated by the unrelenting violence that grips Colombia, the government is 
planning to legalize private security groups in the countryside as a way for 
rural citizens to protect themselves.  
</P>
<P>
 But the proposal has outraged human rights experts, who fear the private 
groups will turn into paramilitary death squads like those that have been 
responsible for much of the violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The security plan raises questions about the ability of President Ernesto 
Samper's government to impose law and order and highlights Colombia's poor 
human rights record. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the proposed security squads, intended to protect ranchers from 
kidnaping and theft, could easily degenerate into lawless organizations 
dedicated to assassinating peasants and suspected Communists. The new squads 
could resemble those that have killed thousands of Colombians since the late 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes no sense that a state unable to control the use of violence would 
make the problem worse by creating such groups," said Juan Gabriel Gomez, a 
lawyer for the Colombia section of the Andean Commission of Jurists, a human 
rights organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission's section on Colombia estimates that 30% of politically 
motivated killings with identified culprits are carried out by death squads and 
paramilitary groups, often with links to the military and police. 
</P>
<P>
 There are an estimated 3,000 political killings each year in Colombia, more 
than the total number of people killed in Gen. Augusto Pinochet's "dirty war" 
against communism in Chile. 
</P>
<P>
 Samper has taken numerous steps aimed at improving Colombia's human rights 
image. 
</P>
<P>
 He got Congress to approve the Second Geneva Protocol on the treatment of 
civilians in time of war and said he would introduce human rights courses and 
offices in military garrisons. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, recently released reports by international agencies note widespread 
impunity for police and army crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent report by Human Rights Watch/Americas says police contribute 
to a per-capita murder rate for children eight times that of the United States. 
Police involved in such crimes rarely receive anything more than dismissal, the 
report says. 
</P>
<P>
 It recommends, among other measures, that the government punish "civilians and 
security forces who abet, deploy or participate in paramilitary groups." 
</P>
<P>
 But the government also faces powerful pressures at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservative ranchers demand that officials protect them in areas where 
guerrilla groups make money by kidnaping them and stealing their cattle. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, more than 430 farmers have been kidnaped. Many small and 
medium-sized ranching operations have closed, and drug traffickers have moved 
into the void, accumulating an estimated 30% of Colombia's usable farmland in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 The pressure is so great that Defense Minister Fernando Botero was heartily 
applauded when he unveiled the proposal on private security groups at the 
annual ranchers conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in total agreement with the government," Cesar de Hart, president of 
the powerful Society of Colombian Farmers, said in an interview with the 
newspaper El Tiempo. "This is consistent with the state's incapacity to provide 
security to Colombian farmers." 
</P>
<P>
 Observers say Botero also has been influenced by Peruvian President Alberto 
Fujimori's success in arming peasant patrols to fight guerrillas and may wish 
to enlist similar help in pushing back Colombia's Communist rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 Botero insisted that the government will review the background of members of 
the new security groups and the weapons they receive. Local civilian and 
military authorities will oversee their conduct, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The development of private security groups subject to strict state 
supervision should not be confused with criminal groups, protagonists of the 
most abominable crimes," Botero said. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics warn of a "Frankenstein" phenomenon, recalling that state-created 
groups have committed some of the worst atrocities.

NEW SERB PEACE BID SEEN AS PLOY, BUT FEW DISMISS IT OUTRIGHT; BALKANS: BOSNIAN 
REBEL LEADER MAY BE TRYING TO SOFTEN INTERNATIONAL RESOLVE WITH INVITATION TO 
JIMMY CARTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A new Bosnian Serb peace offer that would require the mediation of former 
President Jimmy Carter was widely viewed Thursday as a calculated ploy to 
further undermine the international community's teetering resolve in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 But after nearly three years of civil war and countless failed peace efforts, 
few were willing to dismiss the new initiative outright for fear of missing an 
opportunity to end the conflict, the bloodiest in Europe since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anybody will object to any steps that can help end the killing, 
improve the humanitarian condition and ease tensions that exist between the 
Bosnian Muslims and the Bosnian Serbs," State Department spokesman Mike McCurry 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 For officials here and in Bosnia-Herzegovina, who favor an internationally 
approved peace plan that would divide the country roughly in half, the new 
offer fell far short of a breakthrough in the tense stalemate between the two 
warring sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than 12 hours after Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic disclosed his 
new proposal, a U.N. helicopter near Sarajevo was hit by small arms and 
antiaircraft fire while en route to pick up the U.N. commander in Bosnia, Lt. 
Gen. Michael Rose, a U.N. spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not clear who was responsible for the attack, but speculation centered 
on Bosnian Serb troops, who were also reported to have blocked food and other 
humanitarian aid deliveries throughout Bosnia despite pledges by Karadzic to 
end such harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The situation is still quite bleak," said Michael C. Williams, spokesman for 
Yasushi Akashi, the U.N. special envoy in the former Yugoslavia.  
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials said they were taken by surprise by the late-night proposal 
from Karadzic, which was disclosed in a telephone interview with CNN shortly 
before midnight Wednesday in Bosnia. Karadzic talked with CNN after speaking by 
telephone to Carter in Plains, Ga., from Pale, the self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb 
capital near Sarajevo. Earlier, Karadzic sent two Los Angeles-area Serbian 
Americans to meet with the former President and lay the groundwork, diplomatic 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.N. spokesman said the telephone conversations with Karadzic violated a 
U.N. Security Council resolution that bans all commercial activity -- including 
the use of international telecommunication links -- with the Bosnian Serbs 
without approval from the U.N. Protection Force. 
</P>
<P>
 "The resolution was clearly meant to punish the Bosnian Serbs by restricting 
commercial ties," spokesman Paul Risley said. "A telephone call with Pale 
breaks international sanctions." 
</P>
<P>
 Karadzic said in the CNN interview that he is willing to impose a cease-fire 
in the Sarajevo area, free detained U.N. troops, allow the movement of 
humanitarian relief, release teen-age Muslim prisoners of war, reopen Sarajevo 
airport and guarantee human rights. In return, he wants Carter to fly to Bosnia 
to begin negotiations for a permanent settlement, possibly as early as this 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials were clearly miffed by the Bosnian Serbs' end run, particularly 
since Akashi had met with Karadzic earlier Wednesday and the Bosnian Serb 
leader had made no mention of a new peace initiative. Williams said Karadzic 
actually refused in the meeting to accept several demands by Akashi that later 
turned up in Karadzic's offer to Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The six points of this peace plan do not represent peace in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina," Williams said. "This is simply taking us back where we 
were two months ago, which was not so grand then." 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials and Western diplomats said they feared Karadzic was attempting 
to drive a wedge into the peace plan already approved by the Muslim-led Bosnian 
government and neighboring Serbia. The plan, which would give the Bosnian Serbs 
49% of Bosnian territory, was negotiated by the so-called Contact Group, 
consisting of the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Karadzic has rejected that plan, but the Contact Group has refused to back 
away from it. The group, which met in Zagreb on Thursday, reiterated its 
support for the plan and said no further negotiations with the Bosnian Serbs 
will be possible until they accept it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once we have an accepted peace plan, then there is a basis for further talks, 
because there are other issues to be resolved," said Michael Steiner, the 
German ambassador to the Contact Group. "But we need to have this common basis 
first." 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic said Contact Group members assured him 
that they would not retreat from the plan, even with the new Karadzic proposal 
and Carter's likely involvement. Silajdzic said Carter's participation would 
constitute a "destruction" of the peace process if it focused on anything but 
gaining Bosnian Serb approval of the existing peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those initiatives that are not intended to lead to the acceptance of the 
peace plan are destructions," Silajdzic said. "We have the Contact Group plan 
that we worked on for months. . . . We accepted the peace plan, and all we want 
is for the other side to accept that plan." 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said in New York that Carter had 
assured him that his involvement would be "fully synchronized" with the work of 
the Contact Group, according to a spokesman. But Steiner said Carter had not 
been in touch with the group before or after his discussions with Karadzic and 
his Los Angeles emissaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Western diplomats here were skeptical that such assurances could be honored 
anyway, saying Karadzic would not have solicited Carter's involvement simply to 
talk about a peace plan that he had already rejected. Col. Andrew Duncan of the 
Institute for Strategic Studies in London said there is a danger that separate 
talks by Carter, who would have no official standing, could do more harm than 
good. 
</P>
<P>
 "It creates all sorts of chances for misunderstandings," Duncan said. "There 
are already enough groups and people involved." 
</P>
<P>
 NATO Secretary General Willy Claes also expressed puzzlement over Carter's 
role. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see why it is necessary to ask for a former President of the United 
States to come in in order to get a cease-fire," Claes said in Brussels. "I do 
not believe that if there is a willingness (by the Bosnian Serbs) for a 
cease-fire there is a need for an intermediary." 
</P>
<P>
 By drawing Carter into the fray, Karadzic seems bent on circumventing the 
route to peace set out by the international community in the partition plan, 
Western diplomats in Zagreb said. His ultimate goal may be to come up with an 
alternative plan more favorable to the Bosnian Serbs that would carry Carter's 
name and ultimately erode support for the Contact Group plan -- perhaps 
splitting the group itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is another master stroke," said one Western official in Zagreb. "He has 
made fools out of us so many times already." 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton Administration officials, who on Thursday offered Carter an Air 
Force jet and support staff if he travels to Bosnia, said that Karadzic may be 
looking for a way to end the conflict without appearing to knuckle under to 
international pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 By visiting the Bosnian Serb leader in his self-proclaimed capital of Pale, 
Carter would give him a measure of the respect and international legitimacy 
that Karadzic seeks, possibly allowing him to claim victory while accepting 
perms he previously rejected, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's impossible to fully understand Karadzic's motives, but I would suggest 
that it does have something to do with the fact that he is facing pressure and 
he is facing the prospect of a war that will continue to drain resources from 
the Bosnian Serb community in Bosnia and continue to result in the deaths of 
his fellow citizens," McCurry said. 
</P>
<P>
 One Western diplomat in Zagreb said the U.S. view in part amounts to wishful 
thinking. "Everyone is very skeptical, but we're at the point where you have to 
say, 'Heck, go with whatever works,' " the diplomat said.

SWEDEN TO LEAVE 800 BODIES INSIDE SUNKEN FERRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sweden decided Thursday to leave more than 800 bodies inside the sunken ferry 
Estonia and preserve the wreck as a grave on the bottom of the Baltic Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-awaited decision immediately drew fire from some relatives who had 
hoped to retrieve the bodies of their loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one hell of a stupid decision," Kerstin Henriksson, a relative of two 
of the victims, told the Swedish news agency TT. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 2 1/2 months since the disaster, debate has been intense among 
supporters and opponents of a salvage that would be costly both financially and 
emotionally. 
</P>
<P>
 Although technically feasible at an estimated cost of $67 million, officials 
believe they would never be able to retrieve all 818 bodies or identify them 
with certainty. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson said the emotional toll on salvagers would be 
intense and unnecessary. He said the monetary cost of raising the ship, which 
sank about 23 miles southeast of the Finnish island of Uto, had "played 
absolutely no part" in the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 900 people died on Sept. 28 after a Baltic Sea storm tore off the 
Estonia's front cargo door. Only 137 people survived and only 94 bodies were 
recovered.

POPE URGES YOUNG TO PRAY AS 'MODEL FOR GROWN-UPS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM D. MONTALBANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a chatty Christmas letter to children, Pope John Paul II is asking young 
people around the world to pray for peace as an object lesson to adults mired 
in violence and arrogance. 
</P>
<P>
 In a warm, avuncular tone in a letter climaxing his church's Year of the 
Family, the Pope remembers his own youth in Poland "as though it were 
yesterday" and asks young people to assert themselves as prayerful promoters of 
peaceful change. 
</P>
<P>
 "What enormous power the prayer of children has," the Pope writes. "This 
becomes a model for grown-ups themselves: Praying with simple and complete 
trust means praying as children pray." 
</P>
<P>
 It is the first time the Pope has written directly to the youngest members of 
his gigantic church, and publication of his letter at the Vatican on Thursday 
was timed to coincide with the bittersweet annual State of the World's Children 
report issued by the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is to your prayers that I want to entrust the problems of your own 
families and of all the families in the world," the Pope says in a letter being 
distributed to parishes worldwide. "You instinctively turn away from hatred and 
are attracted by love: For this reason the Pope is certain that you will not 
refuse his request." 
</P>
<P>
 Noting cruelties inflicted on children in trouble spots as diverse as Africa 
and the Balkans, the Pope mourns for the young people who "suffer many forms of 
violence and arrogance from grown-ups." 
</P>
<P>
 "They are hungry and poor, they are dying from diseases and malnutrition, they 
are the victims of war, they are abandoned by their parents," he laments. "How 
can we not care when we see the suffering of so many children, especially when 
this suffering is in some way caused by grown-ups?" 
</P>
<P>
 In the report issued at the United Nations in New York on Thursday, officials 
noted some successes in the painful struggle against consequences of the 
poverty that afflicts most of the world's children. 
</P>
<P>
 Pneumonia and malnutrition remain major killers of young people in developing 
countries, but international public health programs are saving millions, the 
Associated Press reported from the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 "By mid-decade, about 2.5 million fewer children will be dying every year from 
malnutrition and disease. And at least three-quarters of a million fewer 
children each year will be disabled, blinded, crippled or mentally retarded," 
said James Grant, executive director of the U.N. Children's Fund.

NEWS ANALYSIS; DEFENSE MINISTERS PATCH UP NATO UNITY; DIPLOMACY: TWO-DAY 
MEETING FINDS WAYS TO STRENGTHEN U.N. FORCE IN BOSNIA. U.S. SOFTENS TALK OF 
EXPANDING ALLIANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 During a two-day meeting ending Thursday, NATO defense ministers did a good 
job of patching together a sense of unity in an alliance that in recent months 
has become dangerously divided. 
</P>
<P>
 On the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, an issue that has so torn the 16-member 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization that some feared it could cause irreparable 
damage, the ministers visibly pulled together to find ways of strengthening the 
struggling U.N. Protection Force there. 
</P>
<P>
 On the delicate subject of extending NATO membership eastward -- which drew 
criticism this month from some European allies that the United States had 
forced the pace and spooked the Russians -- Defense Secretary William J. Perry 
noticeably throttled back the Administration's rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no timetable on expansion," he said at a news conference Thursday 
before leaving for Moscow. "All of us believe this will take some years." 
</P>
<P>
 And, in case anyone missed the subtleties, an official communique on the 
meeting stressed "the determination of our alliance to maintain its unity and 
cohesion." 
</P>
<P>
 But while NATO seems to have recovered its balance temporarily, more trouble 
almost certainly lies ahead.  
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, with all the unknowns in NATO's future, one of the few certainties is 
that unity will be increasingly difficult to maintain. 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, NATO faces a reality articulated nearly two centuries ago by the 
French diplomat Charles Maurice de Talleyrand: Coalitions tend to last only as 
long as the reason that brought them together in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 With the common enemy -- communism -- now dead, NATO's glue has weakened 
perceptibly. 
</P>
<P>
 The foray into Bosnia was an attempt to carve out a new, post-Cold War role 
for NATO as a peacekeeper in brush-fire wars outside its own member countries. 
It has been a crushing failure, in part because the alliance has found itself 
completely at odds with the way the United Nations conducts its business. 
</P>
<P>
 But NATO has also suffered greatly in Bosnia because in this post-Cold War 
era, the interests of its members no longer coincide as they once did. 
</P>
<P>
 When President George Bush made a conscious decision to stay out of the way of 
a collapsing Yugoslavia, it marked the first time since World War II that the 
Europeans faced a major crisis on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 With the forces of seven NATO allies struggling on the ground in Bosnia and 
the Clinton Administration belatedly eager to punish the Bosnian Serbs from the 
air but unwilling to commit ground troops, strains within the group were 
inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 A row between the United States and France late last month over tactics in 
Bosnia became so bitter that both sides reportedly pulled back for fear of 
opening a serious, long-term rift. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bosnia marks a setback," noted Edward Foster, a European defense expert at 
the Royal United Services Institute in London. "We've had a clear illustration 
of how the abstract concept of exporting stability plays out in reality." 
</P>
<P>
 The rift over NATO's eastern expansion has similar origins: a conviction on 
the part of Europeans that the United States has waded into an extremely 
sensitive issue, complicating rather than helping resolve their problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The view of one European ally was reflected in a confidential telegram last 
month from Germany's NATO Ambassador Hermann von Richtofen to the Foreign 
Ministry in Bonn warning that the U.S. attempt to push through rapid expansion 
could turn "into a Pyrrhic victory for the alliance." 
</P>
<P>
 Since that message was leaked to a Munich newspaper, officials from several 
other European delegations at NATO have commented that it captured their 
feelings too. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the policy itself, it's the lack of contact, the lack of real 
consultation," complained a senior official at NATO, who declined to be 
identified by name or nationality. 
</P>
<P>
 Transatlantic differences are nothing new to NATO. Before the fall of the Iron 
Curtain, the Americans frequently clashed with their allies. But in those 
years, agreement always came because of the need to unite against the Soviet 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that threat no longer exists. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a different international climate and a different America," said 
Dominique Moisi, deputy director of the French Institute for International 
Affairs in Paris. "It is an America much less keen to be involved in Europe. 
It's wrong to talk about NATO being terminally ill, but the crisis it faces now 
is deeper than at any previous time."

ZEDILLO PROPOSES PEACE PANEL TO AVOID WAR WITH REBELS IN CHIAPAS; MEXICO: 
LAWMAKERS FROM ALL MAJOR PARTIES WOULD PARTICIPATE. ZAPATISTAS LIKELY TO REFUSE 
OFFER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a bid to maintain the shaky peace in Mexico's southernmost state, President 
Ernesto Zedillo launched a peace offensive that he hopes will persuade armed 
rebels in Chiapas to halt plans to restart their guerrilla war against the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Mexican army and rebel units on high alert, and opposition leaders in 
Chiapas warning that war could start at any moment, Subcommander Marcos, 
self-styled leader of the Zapatista National Liberation Army, was expected to 
reject the proposal from his isolated jungle hide-out. 
</P>
<P>
 He has called similar past proposals unproductive attempts to negotiate with 
words rather than substance. 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo, who took office two weeks ago vowing to govern through dialogue and 
end the threat of war in Chiapas, announced his peace plan in a nationally 
televised speech Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Declaring that the Mexican army remains committed to a unilateral cease-fire 
in the embattled state, the president offered as the centerpiece of his 
initiative a new peace commission made up of eight federal legislators 
representing all major political parties in the country. Their mission: to 
negotiate a political settlement with the Zapatistas that will address the 
major grievances of the Indian and peasant guerrillas and persuade them to lay 
down their arms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I propose that this commission make immediate contact with the Zapatistas, 
establish a dialogue, listen to the causes of the inequities and foster the 
necessary steps to become an active and actual mediating body," a stern-faced 
Zedillo announced from his new presidential residence, stressing that he did 
not believe that there will be war in Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 But opposition leaders in the state said the president's first decisive moves 
in the long-simmering conflict may be too little, too late. 
</P>
<P>
 A series of similar efforts to negotiate political settlements with the 
Zapatistas have broken down in the months since the Mexican army declared its 
unilateral cease-fire Jan. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 In his most recent public statement on the crisis, Subcommander Marcos said 
his guerrilla army was making final preparations to launch new attacks on the 
government. And just two weeks before the first anniversary of the Zapatistas' 
New Year's Day uprising that left more than 150 dead in two weeks, the mood in 
the impoverished and embattled state appeared more on the brink of war than of 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
 In his rambling communique earlier this week, Marcos declared: "War is 
imminent." 
</P>
<P>
 He announced that his rebel units are on the move, advancing out of the 
territory they control in the Lacandon rain forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Taken together, Marcos' pronouncements left most Mexican political analysts 
debating whether the rebel commander and his ill-armed, ragtag army were so 
committed to their ideals that they could commit almost certain military 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time the Zapatistas were threatening war, the Mexican army was 
deployed around the rebels' jungle strongholds and Chiapas' major towns, 
apparently in their largest numbers yet. Their positions remained defensive, 
but several Mexican opposition groups reported that the army was in a state of 
heightened alert. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are movements by both armies; both are currently on maximum alert. The 
confrontation could start at any moment, and even the slightest incident could 
light the spark that sets Chiapas ablaze," declared a statement issued this 
week by the "Transition Government in Rebellion." 
</P>
<P>
 The group's title illustrates the deepening political turmoil in the state 
since last week's inauguration of ruling-party Gov. Eduardo Robledo Rincon. 
</P>
<P>
 The day Robledo took his oath, opposition leader Amado Avendano declared 
himself the legitimate governor in a populist ceremony attended by thousands of 
indigenous Mexicans in the state capital's town square. Avendano alleges that 
the ruling party won the August gubernatorial elections through fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chiapas today is living through one of its tensest moments," Avendano's 
self-declared government said in its statement. 
</P>
<P>
 In a clear effort to bridge that political chasm, Zedillo said the proposed 
peace commission would include members of Avendano's opposition Democratic 
Revolutionary Party. The president stressed that the multi-party makeup of the 
negotiating team would ensure its neutrality.

LANDING CALLED POSSIBLE EVEN ON 1 ENGINE; CRASH: VETERAN PILOTS SAY AMERICAN 
EAGLE CREW PROBABLY COULD HAVE CONTINUED SAFE DESCENT. ONE SAYS THERE MAY HAVE 
BEEN COCKPIT INDECISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Barring unexplained circumstances, the cockpit crew of an ill-fated American 
Eagle commuter plane probably should have been able to land safely after one of 
the plane's two engines failed, veteran pilots said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The British-built Jetstream Super 31 apparently was about 1,000 feet above the 
ground Tuesday evening, descending for a landing at Raleigh-Durham 
International Airport, when the crew started talking about an engine 
"flameout," according to a cockpit recording recovered by the National 
Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Seconds later, after the crew discussed the possibility of aborting the 
landing and going around for a second attempt, Flight 3379 crashed belly-down 
into a wooded area about four miles southwest of the airport, killing 15 of the 
20 on board. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane is designed to fly and land on one engine, and much of the regular 
retraining that the cockpit crew of multi-engine planes must undergo -- either 
in flight simulators or in actual aircraft -- centers around what to do in the 
case of engine failure, according to several turboprop pilots who asked not to 
be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it sounds like there may have been some indecision in that cockpit," one 
of the pilots said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any discussion about going around after a power failure is chancy," said 
another pilot. "There's absolutely no reason I can see that they would not have 
continued on in for a landing." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal records show that at least seven other Jetstream Super 31s have landed 
safely after losing power in one of the engines. 
</P>
<P>
 While descending toward a runway for a landing, as American Eagle Flight 3379 
was doing, relatively little power is needed to keep a plane on its intended 
flight path, aviation sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 And although the failure of one engine gives the plane asymmetrical thrust, 
that problem can be corrected by use of the rudder and by feathering the 
propeller on the failed engine. The Super 31 has an automatic feathering 
mechanism. 
</P>
<P>
 When a turboprop engine fails, the whirling propeller provides a sort of 
resistance, or drag. To reduce this drag, the propeller blades are twisted, or 
"feathered," so their edges are parallel to the air flow. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the pilots analyzing the crash said the sort of flameout discussed by 
the cockpit crew is "very unusual" for turboprop engines, which are generally 
known for their reliability. 
</P>
<P>
 On a turboprop plane, a jet engine spins a turbine that is attached to a 
propeller. A "flameout" is said to occur when the fire in the jet engine goes 
out. In the case of Flight 3379, kerosene soaked the crash site, so it is 
believed that the plane did not run out of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 The NTSB said it still hasn't determined which engine on Flight 3379 may have 
failed, but the plane's turn to the left before it crashed suggests that it may 
have been the left engine. 
</P>
<P>
 American Eagle said Thursday that a cockpit crew had trouble starting that 
engine earlier on the day of the crash, but the airline said that difficulty 
would not have been related to any subsequent problems in flight. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash site was a subdued scene of tragic devastation on Thursday as the 
investigation to determine the official cause of the crash continued. 
</P>
<P>
 The three main chunks of wreckage extended in a line beyond the swath cut 
through a stand of trees as the plane descended. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an awesome thing to see," said Chris Sullivan, who was one of four 
members of the news media allowed access to the site. "You can judge the 
terror. . . . It's hard to see how anyone could have gotten out alive."

NEWS ANALYSIS; PRESIDENT ONCE AGAIN SEEKS TO CALM THE 'ANXIOUS CLASS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With Thursday night's address from the White House, President Clinton returned 
to the struggle that has preoccupied him since he first pointed his ambition 
beyond the borders of Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 In virtually every signature speech he has delivered on the national stage -- 
from the May, 1991, address to the Democratic Leadership Council that 
effectively launched his presidential campaign to his nomination acceptance 
speech in 1992 to his State of the Union messages -- Clinton has sought to 
portray himself as the product and defender of what he often calls "the 
forgotten middle class."  
</P>
<P>
 Leaving no ambiguity Thursday night, he labeled his new agenda a "middle-class 
bill of rights." 
</P>
<P>
 In the short term, these speeches have often bolstered Clinton's standing. But 
within months, as if locked into some oddly elliptical orbit, he has inevitably 
found himself back in the same corner -- struggling to regain the approval of 
middle-income voters alienated by policy missteps or accusations of personal 
impropriety. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton raised the ante Thursday with promises of a middle-class tax cut and 
massive cuts in federal spending -- with many of the cuts to be itemized later. 
But even many Democrats are uncertain to what extent disappointed voters are 
open to once again reconsidering their view of him. 
</P>
<P>
 "People haven't closed the door on him," says Democratic consultant Brian 
Lunde, "but the door is only cracked open; it's not wide open." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Clinton begins this latest struggle for recovery with less control 
over his political fate than at any point since he survived the New Hampshire 
primary in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, the initiative has palpably passed from the White House to 
congressional Republicans. They are eager to cement their new legislative 
majority and position the party for 1996 by marginalizing Clinton's ideas and 
implementing their own agenda of tax reductions, sweeping budget cuts and 
hard-edged reforms in social programs. 
</P>
<P>
 And after two years of stirring speeches sunk by uneven follow-through, even 
many Democrats are leery of investing too much hope that one address can 
restore Clinton's frayed fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
 "What it comes down to in the simplest terms is this is a President who has 
several great opening moves on the chessboard, but he never has an end game. . 
. ," said one senior Democratic strategist. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's political targeting was evident in his economic message: By focusing 
his tax cut on families with young children earning $60,000 or less, offering 
expanded federal efforts to support education and training (including a new tax 
deduction for college tuition expenses) and promising to streamline and 
retrench government, he aimed his new agenda precisely at the uneasy 
middle-income voters Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich has termed "the anxious 
class." 
</P>
<P>
 Those voters -- whom Clinton has long sought to champion -- turned decisively 
against him and the Democrats last November. The heart of the historic New Deal 
coalition, white working- and middle-class voters, broke resoundingly for 
Republicans in November: According to one exit poll, whites earning from 
$15,000 to $30,000 voted Republican by between 45% and 55%; those earning from 
$30,000 to $50,000 voted Republican by a 3-to-2 margin. Compounding the 
problem, younger whites without a college education -- who leaned strongly 
Democratic as a group in 1992 -- expressed their dissatisfaction with Clinton 
by staying away from the polls in large numbers, according to a post-election 
survey by Stanley B. Greenberg, Clinton's pollster. 
</P>
<P>
 All of those economically strapped voters were the people Clinton had in mind 
when he said Thursday: "More jobs aren't enough. We have to raise incomes." 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans rang up their majorities among middle-income citizens last fall by 
directing voter anger over income stagnation and economic insecurity at 
government and politicians, and to a slightly lesser extent, welfare 
recipients, violent juveniles and illegal immigrants.  
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's speech sought to direct the anger toward more traditional targets as 
he contrasted his agenda with Republican proposals he has said would favor the 
rich. The GOP "contract with America" would provide a children's tax credit for 
families with incomes up to $200,000 and reduce taxes on capital gains; Sen. 
Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) on Thursday proposed doubling the children's exemption to 
$5,000 for families of any income. 
</P>
<P>
 "The contrast we want to draw is that they are not proposing anything that 
will lift the prospects of average working Americans," said one Administration 
official.  
</P>
<P>
 The speech suggested another critical contrast sure to drive debate in the 
months ahead: While Republicans portray government primarily as a barrier to 
opportunity -- in the GOP response newly elected Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson 
said Republicans viewed their mandate as cutting "government down to size" -- 
Clinton remains resolute in his contention that government can be reformed to 
expand and promote opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton underscored that belief by comparing his plan to the GI Bill that sent 
millions of returning World War II veterans to college and consecrated a faith 
that has almost entirely evaporated over the past quarter century: that 
government could uplift the broad middle class. "I want a leaner, not a meaner, 
government, a government that's back on the side of hard-working Americans," 
Clinton declared. 
</P>
<P>
 As an economic blueprint, Clinton's plan is bound to draw criticism for 
failing to specifically identify all the spending cuts that would offset his 
tax reductions -- after weeks during which the President repeatedly claimed he 
would only propose a tax cut if he could pay for it. That criticism may be 
somewhat academic for a reason hardly comforting to the White House: With 
Republicans controlling Congress, there's virtually no prospect of the plan 
passing in anything resembling the form Clinton described anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in this latest attempt to regain the grace of the middle class, 
Clinton is operating with an extremely weakened hand. While the threat of 
presidential vetoes -- and Senate Democratic filibusters -- give Democrats some 
leverage to influence legislation in the coming session, Clinton will be able 
to advance his agenda only if Republicans first stumble and fail. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Republicans quickly claimed Thursday night that Clinton had capitulated 
to their agenda. But the differences between Clinton's plan -- with its 
insistent emphasis on the middle class -- and the GOP agenda -- which rains 
benefits even on the upper rungs of the income ladder -- suggest the 
opportunities that a direct confrontation may provide him. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet many analysts believe that in a fundamental sense, Clinton's most 
important opponent is himself -- specifically the questions about his integrity 
and leadership. Clinton himself indirectly acknowledged the doubts about his 
leadership when he declared, "My goal for the next two years will be country 
first and politics as usual dead last." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a stirring declaration -- but not one that a man with the country's 
faith would have had to unfurl.

NEW PREMIER, COALITION GOVERNMENT TAKE OVER IN IRELAND, ENDING MONTHLONG CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Irish Parliament elected a new prime minister and a coalition government 
Thursday, ending a monthlong political crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 The new premier is John Bruton, head of the Fine Gael party, which had been in 
opposition in recent governments headed by Albert Reynolds, leader of the 
Fianna Fail Party, Ireland's largest. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruton, 47, who won by an 85-74 vote in Parliament, will head a coalition that 
includes the Democratic Left Party and the Labor Party, which had been in 
previous coalition governments. 
</P>
<P>
 The crisis began when Reynolds lost a parliamentary vote of confidence because 
of his handling of a child-molestation case involving a Roman Catholic priest. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bruton did not sail easily into the new post: Democratic Left members 
spent the day arguing about whether they should join the government because 
they wanted to be assured of the appropriate number of Cabinet and sub-Cabinet 
posts in the new administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fine Gael Party's ties to the Irish Republican Army are not as close as 
those of the former ruling party, Fianna Fail, but Bruton said Thursday that 
addressing himself to the Northern Ireland peace process would be a priority. 
</P>
<P>
 And Peter Robinson, a member of Parliament and proponent of continued British 
control of Northern Ireland, said Bruton has a greater understanding of the 
loyalist position than do most members of the Irish Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 Bertie Ahern, who replaced Reynolds as leader of Fianna Fail, pledged full 
cooperation with Bruton's coalition and paid tribute to Reynolds for his work 
toward peace in Northern Ireland. It was Reynolds and British Prime Minister 
John Major who offered separatists a place at peace talks one year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, both the IRA and Protestant paramilitary groups have observed a 
cease-fire in Northern Ireland, and talks have been held with the British 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Belfast, the British government held talks with the militant 
Protestant unionist groups, which are British loyalists, as officials did last 
week with Sinn Fein, the political arm of the IRA. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the talks had been congenial, though the meeting focused on the 
touchy issue of paramilitaries in Northern Ireland giving up their weapons and 
explosives. 
</P>
<P>
 In London, Major declared in Parliament that terrorist weapons in Northern 
Ireland must be "decommissioned and destroyed" before the government enters 
full-scale talks with either Sinn Fein or loyalist paramilitary groups. 
</P>
<P>
 He told the House of Commons that he is "not concerned" whether the arms are 
actually surrendered, as long as they are done away with before substantive 
talks begin.

EX-WHITE HOUSE TRAVEL OFFICE CHIEF ARRAIGNED IN EMBEZZLEMENT CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Billy R. Dale, charged with embezzling money paid by the news media for travel 
with the President, pleaded not guilty Thursday and asked a judge to demand 
records from First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and others in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale, the former chief of the travel office, was arraigned before U.S. 
District Judge Harold H. Greene, booked, then released on his own recognizance. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Stuart Goldberg estimated that the trial, which will probably begin 
in February, would take two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the records sought are those of the late Vincent Foster, the deputy 
White House counsel who committed suicide. The request covers "all documents, 
records and files" removed from Foster's safe that refer in any way to the 
White House travel office. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale's lawyer said records seized from Dale's office were never returned and 
that prosecutors claim they don't have them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The persons whose records are sought are named in several reports as having 
an interest in taking over the travel office functions and, in some instances, 
removing travel office documents," his motion claims. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton White House, complaining of lax management of the travel office, 
fired Dale and the other six employees in May, 1993. The Administration 
subsequently said it had made a mistake and found new jobs for the workers, 
except for Dale and one who retired. 
</P>
<P>
 A grand jury indictment earlier this month said Dale pocketed more than 
$68,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury, however, charged Dale only on two counts of embezzling and 
converting $33,297 to his own use, because the statute of limitations had 
expired on the rest.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; HITTING HOME; INVESTMENT FIASCO TRICKLES DOWN AS 
SCHOOL LAYS OFF WORKERS

<P>
 The children of Glen Yermo school are among the first to feel the pinch. 
</P>
<P>
 The little elementary campus in Mission Viejo is losing two of its favorite 
people today, an office aide and a remedial reading instructor. Both were laid 
off by the Saddleback Valley Unified School District, along with 45 other new 
employees whose paperwork wasn't even processed before Orange County's 
financial losses were discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said Thursday that they had to terminate the newly hired 
teachers' aides, clerks and custodians because of the county's huge investment 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone used to say it's just on paper," said Pam Bragg, who did everything 
at Glen Yermo from keeping attendance to dispensing children's medication. 
"Well, guess what? It's not on paper anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Harkins, who has been teaching remedial reading to 35 children at Glen 
Yermo for the last six weeks, said that if she had been hired one week sooner 
her job would be safe. 
</P>
<P>
 But because her position wasn't formally approved by the Board of Education, 
it was eliminated in a cost-cutting frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
 Harkins said she is not worried about herself, even though her husband is also 
out of work. She's worried about the promising students in her five reading 
classes.  
</P>
<P>
 As the only person teaching intensive phonics at Glen Yermo, she fears there 
will be a void into which some slower students may tumble. 
</P>
<P>
 "Working with them in second and third grades makes a huge difference in how 
they read when they get to fourth and fifth grades," she said, moments after a 
school district clerk told her not to bother attending a big meeting for new 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Harkins nor Bragg feels any bitterness. Both hope the district finds a 
way to restore their positions soon.  
</P>
<P>
 Harkins wonders if she will be able to stay at Glen Yermo as a substitute. 
Bragg wonders if things will loosen up after the first of the year, once the 
county figures out where all the money went. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who would have thought we'd end up in a situation like this?" Bragg said, 
referring to a county she has never known to be anything but prosperous. 
</P>
<P>
 But neither she nor Harkins was feeling optimistic Thursday, as teachers and 
co-workers began to say goodby. And as for the children, Harkins couldn't bring 
herself to tell them she was leaving.  
</P>
<P>
 "I love my job," she said, smiling bravely. "We make nothing, although you get 
used to making nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Bragg's thoughts exactly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love my job," she said as her fellow office workers watched sadly. "If you 
have to work, you want to be in a job you enjoy. They just made me feel right 
at home from the onset. It was nice, feeling you were doing something 
important, even if it wasn't pulling in a hundred grand." 
</P>
<P>
 Directly across from Bragg's desk is a wall display: A tree, with pictures of 
Glen Yermo's employees sprinkled throughout the branches. Beneath the tree, 
hand-crafted letters read, "Glen Yermo Family." 
</P>
<P>
 When the women in the office saw that Bragg's picture was not part of the 
display, they vowed that they would add it. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a sign that you're coming back," one of the women told her. 
</P>
<P>
 Bragg smiled sadly. 
</P>
<P>
 With nothing to do Thursday afternoon, Harkins thought she might go to the 
mall and shop. She was wearing a red Christmas sweat shirt with the word joy 
embroidered across the front. It wouldn't be the same shopping spree she had in 
mind only a few days ago. "It's going to be a completely different Christmas," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bragg, who had never before been laid off, said that every gift will need to 
be considered a little more carefully.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think anyone in this position that is counting on a job and doesn't have 
it, it's going to be difficult. When you're talking 20 hours a week, it's not 
that much, but it's that extra little padding."

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; DAILY DEVELOPMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Plain Unveiled: Officials unveiled an interim plan to divide the investment 
pool's revenues as the fund is liquidated, a process that could take from one 
week to six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Auctioning Begins: The county auctioned $483 million worth of securities fro 
its investment pool, the first step toward liquidating the fund, which has 
dropped by $2.02 billion--27%--this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Union Protest: About 40 members of Teamsters Union Local 952 marched through 
the first floor of Merrill Lynch's Santa Ana office. The protesters demanded 
that the brokerage firm return profits made from underwriting risky investments 
with tax money. 
</P>
<P>
 Placing Blame: State Controller Gray Davis blamed the Board of Supervisors for 
the financial crisis, saying they delegated too much authority to former 
Treasurer Robert L. Citron. "The responsibility lies with the supervisors," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento Response: Gov. Pete Wilson directed state transportation officials 
to expedite a $15-million advance to the Orange County Transportation 
Authority, which has more than $1 billion tied up in the county's fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Funding Fallout: Leaders of PTAs and educational foundations said the county's 
fiscal crisis could mean that thousands of dollars they raise each year for 
extras such as computes, music and art will go instead to pay for basic items 
and day-to-day operations.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; FUNDS RAISED FOR SCHOOLS TO BUY EXTRAS MAY BE USED 
FOR BASICS 
</P>

 Thousands of dollars that PTAs and educational foundations have raised for 
extras such as computers, music and art in Orange County's public schools might 
end up buying paper and pencils instead. 
</P>
<P>
 As school districts work to determine how they will deal with losses from the 
county's investment pool, parents who raise money for schools said the crisis 
will probably result in fewer computers and enrichment programs for students. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Unified School District officials already have asked the schools' 
private fund-raising arm to provide $10,000 earlier than originally scheduled. 
The district has $102 million in the pool -- more than any other Orange County 
school district. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer was yes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are prepared to help in any way necessary if the district should ask us 
for more help to meet basic needs," said Elizabeth Thomas, executive director 
of the Irvine Education Foundation. "It's all going to be a matter of survival. 
We're going to have to figure out what our priorities are." 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit foundation provides the district with about $23,000 in grants 
and equipment each year. Foundation money has purchased school encyclopedias, 
calculators and books as well as fine arts instruction and field trips, Thomas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The leader of Laguna Beach's main school fund-raising group, SchoolPower, also 
said Thursday that the organization might use some of the $50,000 to $60,000 
the group has raised for the district so far this year for basic school needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may get it to (the school board) earlier than we usually do," said Cindy 
Prewitt, executive director of SchoolPower. "It doesn't make sense to do 
enhancements if the basics aren't there." 
</P>
<P>
 One option, Prewitt said, would be to use the money to replace a roof at 
Thurston Middle School's Artists Theatre, which is now being remodeled. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board decided Tuesday that it cannot replace the theater's leaky 
roof, which would cost about $38,000 on top of the rest of a remodeling job. 
</P>
<P>
 Also threatened is a planned trip in April by sixth-graders at Castille 
Elementary School in Mission Viejo to a county outdoors science camp. 
</P>
<P>
 The Castille Parent Teacher Organization gave the district about $20,000 for 
the trip earlier this year -- funds the district automatically placed in the 
county investment pool, as required by state law. Now, the $20,000 is frozen in 
the pool along with $74 million in district funds, said Barbara Smith, 
assistant superintendent for instructional services. 
</P>
<P>
 The group "deposited it well in advance," Smith said. "What we have to do is 
hope that between now and April this whole thing sorts itself out."

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; ANGRY CITIZENS TARGET SCHOOL, CITY LEADERS; 
REACTION: RESIDENTS ARE BEGINNING TO ASK WHY LOCAL OFFICIALS KNEW SO LITTLE 
ABOUT INVESTMENTS THAT ORANGE COUNTY MADE FOR THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A peaceful, contented citizenry has awakened with a start. 
</P>
<P>
 As news of Orange County's financial debacle stretched this week into homes 
from Yorba Linda to Dana Point, community activists across the county say they 
have been deluged with calls from taxpayers demanding that someone, anyone, be 
held accountable. 
</P>
<P>
 And although most residents are reserving most of their fury for top county 
officials such as ex-Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron and the Board of 
Supervisors, some are also pointing the finger of blame a little closer to 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 The public spotlight has fallen uncomfortably this week on city and school 
officials, some of whom have shifted uneasily in their chairs as they are 
forced to listen to outraged citizens castigate them for knowing so little of 
what the county was doing with their money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why don't you save us all a recall effort and resign right now?" resident 
Nick Lall demanded of the Orange City Council at a heated meeting Tuesday. "The 
city investment committee has failed miserably and the City Council has failed 
miserably in following (its) policies." 
</P>
<P>
 In tiny Seal Beach, resident Bruce Stark also called for resignations, 
criticizing council members for not demanding to know more from the county 
officials who were investing the city's money. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, Stark said, "I wouldn't invest my own money without knowing what it 
was in." Why, Stark wanted to know, had his own public officials not held to 
the same standards? 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Mello, a longtime Huntington Beach community activist, said he and other 
members of the countywide taxpayer group Committees of Correspondence have been 
swamped this week with calls from a furious public. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never believed people in America could be so angry about something," Mello 
said Thursday, sounding amazed at the vehemence of some of his callers. "They 
are ready to go down and storm the Bastille." 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly, though, Mello said most callers have been less upset about the actual 
loss of the money -- now estimated at more than $2 billion from the county 
investment pool -- than about the behavior of public officials in the 
aftermath. Many are especially upset about the numerous closed sessions public 
officials have held to discuss the matter, Mello said. 
</P>
<P>
 The wave of public outrage that threatens to engulf some local officials has 
left others relatively untouched, at least so far. 
</P>
<P>
 A top official of the Irvine Unified School District, which borrowed an extra 
$50 million to invest in the ill-fated county investment fund, said he had not 
received a single phone call from anyone who was angry about the choices the 
district made. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's certainly a concern in the community and I think people are thirsting 
for information, but I have not seen people point fingers," Irvine school board 
President Tom Burnham said Thursday. "They're waiting for all the information 
to come out." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, in some small cities, there has been more public apathy than 
outrage thus far. 
</P>
<P>
 In La Palma, which has about $5 million in the county fund, only one member of 
the public showed up for a special City Council meeting last week on the 
subject of the county's bankruptcy. What's more, the lone individual was there 
to listen, not speak. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cypress City Council, on the other hand, was greeted by an overflow crowd 
of residents at its regular meeting Monday. But the crowd had come out to 
protest a proposed warehouse in Cypress, not the county investment crisis and 
how it might affect their city. 
</P>
<P>
 Some school district and city leaders, perhaps anticipating angry reactions 
from their constituents, have taken steps to head it off. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with the Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District, for 
instance, which like Irvine voluntarily invested an extra $50 million in the 
county investment fund, have asserted this week that they, too, were helpless 
victims of the plunge in its value. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter sent Wednesday to parents in the district, Supt. James O. Fleming 
said the district never knew how the county treasurer was investing the $50 
million in proceeds from taxable notes the district sold in an effort to 
generate interest income. 
</P>
<P>
 "How they invest and the types of securities involved were not disclosed to 
the school district," Fleming wrote in the letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleming also said the district sought more information but was denied. 
</P>
<P>
 "They refused to reveal investment strategies with us," he said at a meeting 
of the board of trustees Tuesday. "They said it would harm their ability to 
invest." 
</P>
<P>
 The letter didn't save Fleming from public wrath, with some residents 
insisting that it was irresponsible for the district to invest $50 million in 
borrowed money in investments of an unknown nature. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't imagine taking one half of the district's operating budget and 
investing in a high-return pool without knowing more details," Yorba Linda 
resident Thomas Turk said. "With such a high return, obviously, it was a lot 
more of a risk." 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy D. Carlyle, newly elected board president of the Laguna Beach Unified 
School District, took pains to point out that school districts, unlike other 
participants, were required by law to invest their funds in the county pool. 
His district was not among the five that borrowed extra money to increase their 
return. 
</P>
<P>
 The district, Carlyle noted in a press release Wednesday, "was mandated by 
statute to become a player at the county casino." 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, city officials appeared to be having a tougher time escaping the 
blame. 
</P>
<P>
 Luci Grismer, a longtime critic of the Placentia utility tax and of city 
spending, says responsibility for the city's investment problems rests squarely 
on the shoulders of the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's the council, because they voted to put that money into the 
fund," Grismer said. "If (the bond crisis) had been two months ago, I don't 
think these guys would have ever been reelected." 
</P>
<P>
 Even former mayors got into the blame game. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Irvine Mayor Larry Agran said residents should question why the city 
was more heavily invested in the county pool than any other in Orange County -- 
at $209 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the loss is 27%, then we're talking about a $56-million loss for the 
city," Agran said. "This is not a so-called paper loss. That is a total 
mischaracterization. This is a real loss. The only question is when and how are 
we going to absorb that kind of loss." 
</P>
<P>
 Agran said it is inexcusable for city leaders to say they did not know the 
county investment pool included risky investments, such as derivatives, and 
reverse repurchase agreements that made the pool more susceptible to shifts in 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you are talking about other people's money, it's your job to know the 
nature of the investment portfolio," Agran said. "And if that's difficult to 
determine or you need help, then it's your job to hire the requisite people to 
investigate the portfolio to make sure the public is protected." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very simple for Mr. Agran, who is sitting on the sidelines, to say this 
is what you should have done," Irvine Mayor Michael Ward replied. "But given 
all the information we were given at the time we made this investment, he 
probably would have made the same decision we made." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Babcock, a Fullerton activist who headed a campaign to recall three 
council members earlier this year, predicted that the public ultimately will 
blame the county officials -- especially the supervisors -- and not the 
individual city councils for the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city council people are paid pennies," Babcock said. "It's a part-time 
job and quite thankless." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Babcock's magnanimity did have its limits. He faulted Fullerton 
city officials for not providing greater oversight of the county fund and for 
not alerting the City Council to potential problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like this happened overnight," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mello said that members of the Committees of Correspondence and a local 
chapter of United We Stand, the Ross Perot group, will hold a news conference 
Tuesday listing seven demands it they will present to the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Mello refused to say what the demands are until Tuesday or to confirm whether 
the activists would call for the resignation or recall of county officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Lall, a 36-year-old building subcontractor, had never paid much attention to 
local news and has attended only two council meetings in the seven years he has 
lived in Orange. But last week, they got his attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "I only attend when they lose $28 million of our money," he said.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; HOW THE FUND FELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County's now-bankrupt investment pool has lost 27% of what its 
investors put in, according to Salomon Bros., the county's financial adviser. 
Slammed by a strategy that used heavy borrowing to buy long-term bonds, the 
fund's value has been whittled to $5.4 billion, including bonds and cash. 
Here's what happened: 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 1, the county said the fund held bonds that would be worth about $20 
billion if held to maturity. But because all bonds have tumbled in value this 
year as interest rates have risen, the county said its fund had dropped about 
$1.5 billion in market value. In other words, if sold Dec. 1, the county 
figured the portfolio would have been worth about $18.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Strapped for cash as the cost of its loans continued to surge, the county 
began to miss loan payments to its brokerage lenders in the days following Dec. 
1. The brokerages then began to call in the loans the fund had taken out to buy 
most of its bonds. Those loans were backed by $11.5 billion of the bonds 
themselves, which the brokerages then sold in the market last week. As of 
Monday, Salomon estimated that the market value of fund's remaining bonds was 
$7.96 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But that amount included $2.56 billion in loans still outstanding. Subtracting 
that sum, Salomon estimated that the actual market value of the securities 
owned outright by the fund was $5.4 billion as of Monday, including a small 
amount of cash. That represents a loss of $2.02 billion -- or 27% -- on the 
$7.4 billion that government agencies and other investors had on deposit in the 
fund Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Salomon began to auction the remaining bonds in the fund. A total 
of $483 million of conventional bonds maturing in two to four years were sold 
on Thursday, at prices ranging from 89.5 cents to 94.5 cents on the dollar. The 
fund is expected to auction its remaining securities -- including its more 
complex bonds, which comprise the bulk of the leftover portfolio -- within the 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the final loss to fund investors is more or less than the 27% now 
estimated will depend on the prices at which the remaining bonds are sold. TOM

HOLDER OF COUNTY CHECK GETS BRIEF SCARE AT BANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Bankruptcy jitters hit at least one county child support recipient Thursday, 
when a branch of American Savings Bank refused to accept her county check drawn 
on Union Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 After a flurry of calls verifying that child support funds were not frozen, 
the bank agreed to accept the $200 deposit from Nancy Schwartz of Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 "If my bank's making this mistake, I'm wondering if other banks are doing the 
same things," Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz, 37, said that Thursday she went to the branch on Edinger Avenue, 
where she has banked for 20 years, and tried to cash her check.  
</P>
<P>
 "The bank said they no longer honor Orange County checks," Schwartz said. 
"They said they had three other child support checks come in today and they 
bounced. I was so shocked." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of American Savings wouldn't comment on whether other checks had 
bounced. 
</P>
<P>
 After repeated inquiries from Schwartz and a discussion with Union Bank, 
American Savings agreed to accept the deposit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds like it was a misunderstanding," said Dianne Seeber, a spokeswoman 
for American Savings. 
</P>
<P>
 The misunderstanding apparently stemmed from a brief period Tuesday morning 
when Union Bank froze the child support funds, according to Assistant Dist. 
Atty. Wallace Wade. 
</P>
<P>
 "For about an hour, there was indication there would be some sort of a 
problem," Wade said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Wade said, "there's absolutely no problems on child support checks 
going out or being cashed." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Union Bank in Orange, who asked not to be identified, said 
"We've been cashing the checks all day. There's no problem with them." 
</P>
<P>
 The county receives 23,000 child support payments per month, some of it from 
garnisheed wages, said Jan Sturla, supervising deputy district attorney for the 
family support division. The county issues almost 4,000 checks a week.

ELECTRONIC GRAD SCHOOL TEST CHALLENGED; EDUCATION: EXAM PREPARATION FIRM SAYS 
THE COMPUTERIZED VERSION OF THE GRE IS NOT CHEAT-PROOF. THE FINDINGS HAVE 
PROMPTED PLANS FOR INCREASED SECURITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A national program that allows students to take a computerized version of the 
Graduate Record Examination -- the test required for admission to many graduate 
schools -- is being suspended temporarily because it is not cheat-proof, 
Educational Testing Service officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a stunning admission that highlights the fallibility of the testing 
service's security measures, officials said they were prompted to act after a 
New York City test preparation firm revealed that 20 of its employees had 
managed to memorize much of the test in just a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaplan Educational Centers, the New York firm, told the testing service last 
week that Kaplan employees -- who each took the test once and were asked to 
remember as many questions as they could -- had accumulated 70% to 80% of the 
questions on the computerized test. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaplan officials said they did not distribute the questions, but merely wished 
to draw attention to the vulnerabilities of the computerized testing system. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a wake-up call," said Jonathan Grayer, president of Kaplan 
Educational Centers, the largest test preparation company in the nation. "If 
computer testing is the best way to assess skills, then so be it. . . . But 
what's most important is that the exam be a valid measure. And we believe that, 
as of yesterday, it wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
 This year, about 420,000 college students will take the GRE, which is used by 
graduate schools in much the same way the SAT is used in college admissions. 
For a fee, Kaplan offers test preparation courses that are designed to boost 
GRE scores.  
</P>
<P>
 About one in four students who take the GRE will do so on computer this year. 
The pencil-and-paper test, which is offered just four times a year, includes a 
different set of questions each time it is given. The computerized test, which 
is offered almost every day of the year, is not completely changed each day -- 
and therein lies the problem.  
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have an infinite supply of questions," said Nancy S. Cole, president 
of the New Jersey-based Educational Testing Service. Cole stressed that the 
computerized test has an adaptive function intended to ensure that students do 
not see the same set of questions. Cole said the findings of Kaplan's unusual 
experiment are cause for concern, though there is no evidence that any test 
results have been compromised. 
</P>
<P>
 Cole said she is grateful that Kaplan officials safeguarded their findings and 
shared them only with the testing service. But, she noted, coaching firms such 
as Kaplan "have a special motivation to wish that computer-based testing would 
go away."  
</P>
<P>
 With infrequent paper-and-pencil tests, she said, such firms can offer large 
preparatory classes a few times a year. Computerized tests, she said, require 
coaching firms to offer more classes, to invest in computer equipment -- and 
thus to make less of a profit. 
</P>
<P>
 After revealing their findings, Cole said, "(Kaplan) proposed that they had 
shown us this significant security breach and our response should be to 
immediately withdraw the computer-based test." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Cole said, Kaplan's findings have prompted an acceleration of 
previously planned security enhancements. "We are firmly committed to 
computer-based testing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 To enhance security, Cole said, the testing service will halt the tests during 
the last week in December to implement new procedures that will guarantee that 
"any one question will be shown to smaller proportions of students." 
</P>
<P>
 Students who have planned to take the computerized test during that period 
will have to reschedule, she said. Testing will resume Jan. 3 but may be 
interrupted on other days as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The brief suspension of computerized testing could not come at a worse time of 
year for many students who are hurrying to take the GRE to meet graduate school 
application deadlines. But testing officials said every effort will be made to 
help students reschedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Kaplan Educational Centers said they initiated their experiment 
after some of their clients said they had heard it was possible to obtain lists 
of test questions in advance.  
</P>
<P>
 Jose Ferreira, Kaplan's GRE director, said that in designing the experiment he 
did not tell his employees to remember any particular segment of the test. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sent in people any old way and said remember what you can," he said. "If 
we had wanted to be very efficient, we could have said, 'memorize 10 
questions.' But we wanted to emulate something anyone could do. . . . The idea 
was: What can a few people put together just by talking to their friends?" 
</P>
<P>
 Grayer, the president of Kaplan, acknowledged that what his employees did was 
a violation of copyright law.

 "But we felt obligated to . . . unearth this because it was not good for 
anyone," he said. "An individual college kid or fraternity doesn't much care 
about copyright law. If they can increase their scores dramatically, they're 
going to do it."

INVESTORS MANEUVER FOR WINNING EDGE IN GAME WITH NO RULES; FUND: CHAPTER 9 LAW 
DRAWS NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN LARGE AND SMALL CREDITORS. IT'S UNCLEAR HOW WHAT'S 
LEFT WILL BE DIVIDED. 
</P>

<P>
 What has become crystal clear in the nation's largest municipal bankruptcy is 
that many investors in Orange County's ill-fated investment portfolio are going 
to lose money, lots of it. What is unclear is whose ox is going to be gored. 
</P>
<P>
 Will the billions of dollars lost by departed Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert 
L. Citron be divided evenly among those with money in the fund, or will some 
end up far down a pecking order, shouldering more of the financial loss than 
others? 
</P>
<P>
 In an ordinary business bankruptcy, there is a firm division between secured 
creditors, those who extended credit against a guarantee or collateral, and 
unsecured creditors, generally suppliers of goods and services. Secured 
creditors are the ones most likely to get their money. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the case of Orange County's investment pool, municipal bankruptcy law 
sets no priority between the competing claims of the Newport-Mesa Unified 
School District with almost $80 million in the fund, Judge Margaret R. 
Anderson's retirement nest egg and the special $8-million fund that had been 
set aside to replace the county Fire Department's aging fleet of firetrucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor does it distinguish between the managers of the $1.3-million fund to 
protect gnatcatcher habitat, Operation Santa Claus, which has $10,000 tied up 
in the pool, and the Orange County Transportation Authority with $1 billion on 
the line. 
</P>
<P>
 All must fend for themselves with few hard and fast rules in an emerging 
battle over the $5.4 billion that remains in the investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, scores of investors are staking out their positions and exploring 
legal arguments in an attempt to show they deserve to recover more from the 
fund than other individuals and institutions who placed money with the county 
treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are lots of competing parties with competing demands. Unwieldy is 
perhaps too mild a term to describe what's happening," said Prof. Dan 
Schechter, a bankruptcy expert at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. "There is a 
strong argument that there will be a hierarchy of creditors. But this is an 
area of new law. There is no set priority on anything. I mean the county could 
end up giving everyone a 27% haircut." 
</P>
<P>
 There are 187 governmental entities that have funds in the investment 
portfolio that Citron managed, as well as thousands of individuals who invested 
retirement funds and court settlements. 
</P>
<P>
 Who eventually recovers money and in what amount will be determined largely by 
the U.S. Bankruptcy Court and the county creditors committee, which was picked 
Wednesday by bankruptcy Trustee Marcy J.K. Tiffany. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel is made up of representatives from the fund's major institutional 
investors, including the Orange County Department of Education, the Orange 
County Transportation Authority, the Orange County Sanitation Districts, the 
Transportation Corridor Agencies, the city of Irvine representing all county 
cities, and the city of Mountain View, representing municipalities outside the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 The creditors committee is responsible for developing a disbursement and 
recovery plan that is acceptable to the competing interests that sit on the 
committee, as well as a host of subcommittees chaired by each representative. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, investors and creditors can ask the bankruptcy court to order the 
county to release funds or grant them priority for recovering their original 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankruptcy lawyers anticipate that many of those involved will make their 
pitch to the creditors committee or the Bankruptcy Court in the months ahead. 
Complex negotiations to work out compromises among the many interests also will 
occur, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Circling the wagons is part of the game," said Richard Levin, who was a 
bankruptcy attorney for 16 years with Stutman, Treister & Glatt, the Los 
Angeles law firm now representing the county. "You have a lot of people who 
have lost money or stand to lose lots of money. Of course, they are going to 
fight." 
</P>
<P>
 Among those jockeying for a high position in the pecking order are the 
county's 27 school districts and four community college districts, which have 
about $1.5 billion tied up in the fund. About $500 million is borrowed money 
placed with Citron voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials across the county contend they should at least recover 100% 
of their operating funds from the pool, because state law requires school 
districts to put those funds in the county treasurer's accounts. They are also 
looking into whether the money, in effect, was held in trust. 
</P>
<P>
 School district officials argue that they had no control over the way Citron 
was using their money, hence they were at his mercy. They also maintain that if 
the county does not pay them back in full, the state is legally obligated to 
make up the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "We in the schools feel we have a case for 100 cents on the dollar, and we 
intend to aggressively pursue that case," said Supt. James A. Fleming of the 
Capistrano Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 The borrowed money could be more problematic. For example, Newport-Mesa 
Unified, Irvine Unified, the Orange County Department of Education and the 
North Orange County Community College District took out loans of $200 million 
for the sole purpose of investing in the fund voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had discretion on that one," acknowledged Supt. Mac Bernd of Newport-Mesa 
Unified. "We were not mandated to place that money with Citron. We are in that 
pickle with other school districts and cities." 
</P>
<P>
 For the first year at least, Citron gave the districts guarantees against risk 
if they placed the money with him, but there were no guarantees in writing at 
the time the fund collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 Another $1 billion invested in the pool belonged to all the cities in the 
county, except for San Juan Capistrano and Garden Grove. Unlike school 
districts, municipalities are not required by law to place their funds with the 
county treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the money was placed voluntarily or involuntary should not matter that 
much, some city officials contend. Municipalities may be just as deserving of 
full reimbursement as the school districts, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were led to believe that this investment would be made in good faith and 
that the funds were safe and secure," said one Anaheim official, who requested 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim invested about $169 million with the county, the third-largest amount 
among cities with money in the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in the same boat as everyone else," said Santa Ana City Manager David 
N. Ream. "We want an equitable distribution based on what is left in the fund. 
We have $150 million in the account. We would like all that, but there is not 
all that to get out. Right now it's 73 cents on the dollar. Our main interest 
now is getting that out as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of some of the largest institutions that put money in the 
investment pool, such as the Orange County Transportation Authority and the 
Transportation Corridor Agencies, say it is too early in the proceedings to 
formulate a position for recovering funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, we don't have enough information to determine what our arguments 
will be," said Lisa Telles, a spokesperson for the TCA, which is building the 
county's toll roads. "We are working with the creditors committee to obtain the 
information we will need." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Chapter 9 of the bankruptcy statutes, all parties involved are supposed 
to be treated equitably, bankruptcy lawyers say. No one can be granted priority 
for removing funds or being paid unless the creditors committee or a bankruptcy 
judge agrees to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bankruptcy does not look at deservedness or whether you invested voluntarily 
or involuntarily," Levin said. "The fundamental principal of distribution is 
equality. If you have no collateral, you are part of the great unwashed." 
</P>
<P>
 Bankruptcy lawyers say it could very well turn out that the losses are shared 
pro rata -- that is, everyone will lose a percentage equal to what they had in 
the fund. If that is the case, it would be a relief to Municipal Judge Margaret 
R. Anderson in Newport Beach, who has saved money for almost 20 years in the 
Orange County Deferred Compensation Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The retirement account, which Citron invested, contains about $88 million from 
more than 2,000 county employees. Under the plan's contract, the money is the 
county's until the employee retires, resigns or is fired, and can be used to 
pay creditors. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson says her financial adviser told her she and other participants in the 
fund have little standing in an attempt to recover their contributions to the 
retirement plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the money belongs to the county," Anderson said. "I don't know whether I 
am going to get any money back. I can't do anything about it. I have no options 
at this point."

TEAMSTERS HURL CHARGES DIRECTLY AT MERRILL LYNCH; PROTEST: LOCAL INVADES SANTA 
ANA OFFICE ACCUSING BROKERAGE OF PROFITING FROM COUNTY'S LOSS. FIRM SEES A 
UNION VENDETTA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It would seem ironic that the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, long 
known for its own corruption scandals, would now be a watchdog of morality in 
the ongoing financial crisis involving Orange County government officials and 
their Wall Street brokers. 
</P>
<P>
 But for days now, the labor union has doggedly pushed for federal 
investigations into the relationship between county officials and Merrill Lynch 
and Co., the county's investments broker -- at times, turning up its own leads. 
</P>
<P>
 And on Thursday, about 40 members of the union's Local 952 marched through the 
firm's Santa Ana office, loudly accusing the company of profiting from the 
Orange County financial debacle. Their shouts were punctuated by the placards 
they carried, including two which read: "Merrill Grynch is stealing our 
Christmas," and "Little kids shouldn't pay the price for Merrill Lynch's bad 
advice." 
</P>
<P>
 Teamster leaders say their members could become innocent victims in this 
drama. The Orange County Transportation Authority, one of the largest 
contributors to the county's investment pool that crashed last week, employs 
1,073 teamsters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are here on behalf of every man, woman and child in Orange County," said 
Robert Hahn, an official of Teamsters Union Local 952, after storming into the 
Merrill Lynch offices. "We are mad. We are angry. And we are tired of the 
bull," a reference to the company logo. 
</P>
<P>
 But Merrill Lynch said the pickets and other Teamsters activities in Orange 
County have nothing to do with the county's financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Teamsters union has an ongoing vendetta against Merrill Lynch," said 
company spokesman James Wiggins in New York. "This has nothing to do with 
matters in Orange County. The media is being hoodwinked." 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the Teamsters' interest in Orange County, Wiggins said, is a 
stretch -- part of an ongoing labor dispute between the union and North 
Carolina-based Pony Express Courier Corp., a subsidiary of a company with 
investment funds managed by Merrill Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
 The union and the delivery service are embroiled in a bitter dispute over 
working conditions and wages of nearly 4,000 workers nationwide. Wiggins said 
Merrill Lynch has no management role in Pony Express. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's true, that's one of our motivations," said Bart Naylor, a Washington, 
D.C.-based corporate affairs officer for the union. However, that does not take 
away from the union's interest in representing its Orange County members, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after the county declared bankruptcy, the Teamsters urged the Securities 
and Exchange Commission to investigate whether Merrill Lynch employees violated 
federal policy when they gave -- or urged others to give -- campaign 
contributions to then-Orange County Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Naylor met with agents of the National Assn. of Securities Dealers 
and with staffers of the Senate Banking Committee to discuss proposed 
legislative reforms for securities dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's protest in Santa Ana came one day after federal investigators 
issued subpoenas of the Board of Supervisors seeking their dealings with 
Merrill Lynch. The SEC is investigating Merrill Lynch and at least one other 
firm for possible influence peddling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Merrill Lynch played Mr. Citron for a patsy," said Hahn, the local Teamsters 
official, who was among those who had crammed into the small lobby of the 
firm's Santa Ana office. "We believe Merrill Lynch thinks they can play the 
citizens of Orange County as patsies and that's just not going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 In a terse response to the Teamsters pickets, a Merrill Lynch spokesman 
stated: "The Teamsters are distorting Merrill Lynch's relationship with Orange 
County. Merrill Lynch has never served as the county's financial adviser." 
</P>
<P>
 The union members arrived unannounced at the Merrill Lynch office about 11:30 
a.m. with the media at their heels. After failing to get a conference call with 
the firm's Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Tully in New York, a local company 
official faxed to the corporate headquarters a list of the union's demands, 
including one that the firm return to the county all profits from county bond 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstrators denied they had any other motive except to turn a spotlight 
on Merrill Lynch and to blame the firm for allegedly helping create the 
financial turmoil. The result, they added, may be cutbacks at local schools 
that had invested money in the county's fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came because I'm concerned about my kids," said protester Denise Vandeusen, 
27, a clerical worker from Brea. "Just because Merrill Lynch gave bad advice, 
we can't allow the kids to suffer." 
</P>
<P>
 Police eventually dispersed the demonstrators after the 90-minute protest. No 
arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez reported from Washington, and Miller reported from Santa Ana.

BOXER AND INVESTORS COMMISERATE; REACTION: POLITICIANS, INCLUDING THE SENATOR, 
JOIN INDIVIDUALS WITH O.C. HOLDINGS IN ADDRESSING A FACT-FINDING SESSION.

 Duke Miller, fighting the flu, commiserated with U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer on 
Thursday about the thousands of dollars his 14-year-old son invested in the 
now-frozen county investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't beat yourself up over this," the senator told the 37-year-old civil 
engineer. "Obviously, this has stunned even the most sophisticated investors." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller was among about 40 investors, finance experts and public officials who 
spoke at Anaheim City Hall during a two-hour fact-finding session on the 
failure of the county's investment fund. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to "put a public face" on the debacle, Boxer said she invited the 
Laguna Beach resident to speak. Miller said he had been urged by a judge to 
invest the $9,630 his son received in an accident settlement into the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 State Controller Gray Davis, who also appeared at the session, said the County 
Board of Supervisors is ultimately to blame for the situation for giving former 
Treasurer-Tax-Collector Robert L. Citron free reign. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important to have oversight," Davis said. Citron "essentially acted 
without any other authority with items being approved on the consent calendar 
with no debate. Now all of the citizens are going to pay a price for all of the 
excesses." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said Citron was "almost arrogant" over the years when discussing his 
investment strategies and asked state officials why they didn't experience the 
same success. 
</P>
<P>
 "Higher risk means there is a day of reckoning," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis also focused on school districts, which have $1 billion invested in the 
now-frozen county investment pool. He said the state is obligated to make sure 
all children are educated, and "we may have to pick up part of the tab." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis was critical of the five school districts in the county that have 
borrowed money invested in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just outrageous that a school district would go out and borrow millions 
of dollars to invest in hopes of getting a higher return," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The controller said his primary concern is to make sure that state funds 
intended for schools and highways do not get tied up in bankruptcy proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's intended for public purposes, and we don't want it being used to pay off 
creditors," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxer repeated her call on Republican House leaders to drop the securities law 
section of their "contract with America," a plan that she said would make it 
more difficult for investors in the county fund to sue successfully if they 
believe they were victims of fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), who wrote the securities section in 
the Republican plan, said this week that it is targeted at frivolous lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Boxer and Cox have said they will push for legislation requiring 
municipalities to provide the same disclosure to potential investors as 
corporations provide when they issue shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxer said she also wants to focus on derivatives, which she called "the new 
scam of the '90s." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes they may be a good hedge, other times, they may be a disaster. Are 
broker-dealers being honest about the risk?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview after the session, Boxer called the county's financial 
troubles "a shocking thing all the way down the line. They kept adding debt on 
debt." 
</P>
<P>
 Boxer said hearings in the Senate Banking Committee on the Orange County 
situation will begin during the first week in January.

SANITATION BOARD MEMBER WANTS SWAN OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Orange County Sanitation District board member is demanding that District 
Vice Chairman Peer Swan resign his leadership position because of questions 
about the role he played in the ongoing county bond crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Councilman Barry J. Hammond on Thursday said that Swan failed "a 
fiduciary responsibility" in November by not alerting district members to 
suspected bond fund problems. Swan, acting as chairman of the Irvine Ranch 
Water District, had withdrawn $100 million in water district funds from the 
county's troubled bond pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammond maintained that Swan should have told sanitation district board 
members about his concerns. " . . . At the least he should have discussed it 
with the district's legal counsel. And he didn't do that." 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 1, the county announced that the bond fund's cash position had 
plummeted to just $300 million from $3.5 billion. The county froze the fund's 
remaining assets, including $391.7 million invested by the sanitation district, 
and on Dec. 6, the still-evolving crisis forced the county into bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Swan said Thursday that he withdrew $100 million in water district funds "to 
try and get someone at the county to pay attention to the fund . . . not 
because I saw any immediate liquidity problem." After the county agreed to 
review the portfolio, Swan said, "I stopped taking money out." 
</P>
<P>
 Swan also said that water district bylaws permit the board to withdraw money 
from the county fund and invest elsewhere. In contrast, Swan said, the 
sanitation district traditionally invests solely through the county fund, and, 
in November, didn't have the immediate option of placing its funds elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Swan said that when county officials told him in late November that they were 
going to discuss the fund's problems, "I was sworn to confidentiality." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everyone was due this explanation because I was prominently located 
near ground zero on this thing," Swan said.

U.S. AID SOUGHT FOR THE JAILING OF IMMIGRANTS; SERVICES: COUNTY WANTS $2 
MILLION FROM EMERGENCY FUND TO HOUSE INMATES WHO ARE HERE ILLEGALLY. THERE'S 
LITTLE OPTIMISM FOR ACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Joining a nationwide effort to hold the federal government accountable for 
immigration woes, Orange County wants $2.06 million in reimbursement for the 
costs of housing illegal immigrants in local jails and detention facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Administrator Ernie Schneider has alerted the U.S. Department of 
Justice that he is preparing a formal request for federal money from the 
Immigration Emergency Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter, Schneider contends that illegal immigrants are worsening the 
county's chronic jail crowding. The crowding has led to early releases of other 
inmates, creating an "emergency" that poses a "substantial risk" to Orange 
County residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The move is unrelated to the county's recent bankruptcy filing, officials 
said. And while any federal relief would be especially welcome at this time, 
county officials concede that the application for federal reimbursement is a 
long shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's just say we're not standing around waiting for the check," said Bob 
Wilson, manager of forecast and analysis at the county administrative office. 
"But we wanted to let them know as soon as possible that we think this a cost 
that we shouldn't have to pay." 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Department spokeswoman Anna Cobian said Thursday that the Immigration 
Emergency Fund established in the late 1980s is designated for "mass migration 
emergencies." She said she could not discuss the county's chances of receiving 
reimbursement from the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 But another Justice Department official, who asked not to be identified, said 
the funds are for "true emergencies. And it doesn't look like (the situation in 
Orange County) is a true emergency." 
</P>
<P>
 With its request, Orange County joins a nationwide demand for the federal 
government to financially help states grappling with the costs of illegal 
immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 In Texas, state officials Thursday said they will likely press their lawsuit 
seeking up to $5 billion in federal compensation for the costs of illegal 
immigration, despite a federal judge's indication that he will dismiss the 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Dusek, spokesman for state Atty. Gen. Dan Morales, said Texas will likely 
appeal a negative ruling to the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New 
Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 The state argues that the federal government violated its constitutional 
responsibility to control immigration and therefore should cover the cost. 
Texas also maintains that the federal government takes in tax dollars from 
illegal immigrants but fails to compensate states for services that are 
provided. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, Gov. Pete Wilson followed the lead of Texas and Florida by 
suing the federal government for reimbursement for the cost of illegal 
immigration. Public outrage led California voters last month to pass 
Proposition 187, a measure restricting government services for illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to such concerns, the federal government earlier this year 
promised $33.4 million to California to defray the state's costs of imprisoning 
illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 But that money is not earmarked for county disbursement, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent study of Orange County's four detention facilities found that at 
least 175 of the 5,000 people in custody had been designated as suspected 
illegal immigrants by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. It costs 
about $33 a day to house an inmate. 
</P>
<P>
 The total number of illegal immigrants in custody, including those who have 
not caught the attention of the INS, could be higher, according to the county's 
letter, dated Oct. 28 but just now disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 Amin David, chairman of Los Amigos of Orange County, said he has no problem 
with seeking federal reimbursement for illegal immigrants, but he fears that, 
too often, the INS focuses its attention on Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they are going to do this, they should go after everyone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's Wilson said he has been pleased so far with the Justice 
Department's response to the county's letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials have been informally discussing ways to help the county, 
such as moving illegal immigrants into INS custody more quickly, freeing up bed 
space in the county jails for other inmates. 
</P>

 Orange County Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez said he's optimistic and believes 
that the federal government is finally recognizing the states' immigration 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there has been a clear indication that the federal government will be 
escalating its involvement in this issue," Vasquez said. "That's why we need to 
stake a claim with the federal government as soon as possible. Hopefully there 
will be a quick turnaround here."

PROJECT'S FOES PLOT WETLANDS' DEFENSE; ENVIRONMENT: COUNTY AND KOLL REAL ESTATE 
GROUP SAY THE BOLSA CHICA HOUSING PLAN COMPLIES WITH ALL LAWS AND PROCEDURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Angered by the Board of Supervisors' approval of a plan to build 3,300 homes 
at the Bolsa Chica wetlands, a host of opponents Thursday moved ahead with 
plans to challenge the proposed development in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach City Councilman Ralph Bauer said he would ask the council at 
its Monday meeting to authorize the filing of a lawsuit challenging the project 
on the grounds that its environmental impact report did not adequately address 
the financial, safety, traffic, water or other concerns of Huntington Beach 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for two school districts within the city said that legal counsel 
has been retained to prepare a separate lawsuit charging the county with 
violating the California Environmental Protection Act by not properly 
mitigating the project's impact on the Huntington Beach City School District 
and the Huntington Beach Union High School District. 
</P>
<P>
 And Bruce Monroe, a spokesman for the Angeles Chapter of the Sierra Club, said 
that he and various other environmentalists would huddle Saturday to discuss 
various legal challenges, ranging from alleged procedural violations of state 
law to the potential destruction of natural habitat, presumably in violation of 
the Endangered Species Act. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the only recourse left open to us," Monroe said. "They have acted as if 
they are a higher authority and can do as they choose." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials and representatives of the Koll Real Estate Group, which 
wants to develop Bolsa Chica, have repeatedly said that the project has 
followed all proper procedures and violates no laws.  
</P>
<P>
 Driving the city and school districts' efforts is the fear that the proposed 
development would cost them tens of millions of dollars to provide services for 
the new residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can't be legal that you can saddle a community with millions of dollars in 
additional responsibilities and not condition the project on mitigating the 
impacts," Bauer said.  
</P>
<P>
 Because Bolsa Chica is not within city limits, Bauer said, the city will not 
receive any of the development fees associated with the project. But, because 
of its close proximity to the city, the councilman said, Huntington Beach will 
undoubtedly be required to provide such services as fire and police protection, 
road improvement and water. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get zero and none of this has been worked out," Bauer said. "The county is 
basically telling the people of Huntington Beach to go jump in the lake." 
</P>
<P>
 Lucy Dunn, senior vice president with Koll, said her firm is eager to 
negotiate with the project's opponents. "We have things to bring to the table 
and we hope" that they will too, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 An internal financial analysis developed earlier this year, Bauer said, 
estimated that the Koll project could cost the city as much as $60.8 million 
initially and $5 million a year thereafter. Those numbers were based on an 
earlier construction plan that has since been scaled down from more than 4,000 
homes, however, and Bauer said that he has asked city staff for an update by 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The school districts' numbers, meanwhile, are as current as can be, a 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The deficit will be more than the revenue generated," said Marshall Krupp, a 
consultant for the two school districts. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Krupp's analysis, the project would add about 1,195 students, 
requiring the construction of facilities at a cost of about $33.5 million to 
the districts. While that would be partially offset by developer fee revenue of 
about $5.7 million, he said, it would still leave the districts with a 
substantial financial bite. 
</P>
<P>
 Developer fees are set by state law and cannot be increased by the districts, 
Krupp said. 
</P>
<P>
 And even if the districts opted to used portable classrooms or reopen schools 
closed in recent years due to falling enrollments, he said, the difference 
would only be slight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless some agreement is reached between the districts and the county or the 
Koll company, a lawsuit will be filed," Krupp said. "Our goal, however, is to 
try to reach an agreement prior to filing." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials could not be reached for comment Thursday. During Wednesday's 
all-day public hearing before the Board of Supervisors, however, they had 
repeatedly expressed a willingness to negotiate with school district and city 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 And on Thursday, Dunn said Koll officials also were willing. "The very first 
phone call I made today was to the city," she said. "My message was that I 
would be willing to meet today or at any other time to resolve the city's 
concerns and work out service agreements acceptable to the city. My second 
phone call was to the school districts. I believe we should sit down and work 
together for the benefit of the children of Huntington Beach." 
</P>
<P>
 While acknowledging public questions about the viability of such a massive 
project in the midst of the county bond fiasco, Dunn said that the company is 
looking at a number of options, including obtaining private funding from a bank 
or lending institution that is secured against the land. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange for permission to build the homes, the company agreed to spend 
about $48 million in restoring 950 acres of deteriorated wetlands on the 
1,600-acre site by, among other things, constructing a tidal inlet reconnecting 
the marshlands to the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 The project still must be approved by the California Coastal Commission and 
the Army Corps of Engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Dunn said, she is anxious to work out any difficulties or 
disagreements that may impede the development's progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have to market those homes," she said. "We consider schools (and 
services) to be project amenities. We want to work out acceptable 
arrangements."

COSMETIC CLINIC OWNER, 2 DOCTORS FOUND GUILTY OF FRAUD, GRAND THEFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA NGUYEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The owner and two doctors at a Westminster cosmetic surgery clinic, once 
popular with the Southeast Asian immigrant community, were found guilty 
Wednesday of insurance fraud and grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
 A Superior Court jury found that Elizabeth Cam Thach Thi Le, the owner and 
office manager of Cam Thach Clinic, and plastic surgeons Alexander S. Sinclair 
and David Page conspired to overbill patients and defraud insurance companies 
by claiming cosmetic surgeries were for medical purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Le was convicted of seven counts of insurance fraud and two counts of grand 
theft. She faces up to 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury found Sinclair guilty of four counts of insurance fraud and two 
counts of grand theft; Page was convicted on five counts of insurance fraud. 
They face maximum prison terms of 10 and nine years, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Le hired the two Los Angeles-based plastic surgeons to perform such surgeries 
as eyes and nose reconstructions, which are common among Asian patients, 
according to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Le's practice of splitting fees with Sinclair and Page fueled 
her $1-million-a-year business. 
</P>
<P>
 Le advertised in mainly Vietnamese-language newspapers, promoting everything 
from removing acne scars to "fixing" lost virginity. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was very influential in the Vietnamese community," said senior 
investigator Larry Blochl of the Medical Board of California. "She made a lot 
of money."  
</P>
<P>
 Property records show that in 1988, Le, a Los Angeles resident, paid $715,000 
for a piece of land overlooking the ocean in Laguna Niguel. She was also listed 
as a co-owner in a $207,000 condominium on Wilshire Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Former patients testified that Le threatened them and offered to pay them 
$1,000 to $2,000 not to give evidence against her. 
</P>
<P>
 Medical board investigators, assisted by local police and state insurance and 
pharmacology agencies, raided the clinic and the two surgeons' private offices 
in Los Angeles in 1990 after a number of patients reported that they were 
harmed by botched surgeries.  
</P>
<P>
 In a previous interview, Thanh Thi Nguyen said she sought skin treatment from 
the clinic in 1986. After the "face peel," Nguyen said her skin kept peeling, 
became covered with pus and then blackened. She said she was left with a scar 
from eye to chin. 
</P>
<P>
 The state attorney general's office is prosecuting the two doctors on 
malpractice charges, investigators said.  
</P>
<P>
 "By shutting her down, we are protecting the public from medical professionals 
who were preying on insurance companies and the uninformed immigrant 
community," Blochl said. 
</P>
<P>
 All three will be sentenced on March 1.

DANA PARSONS: STORIES OF CHRISTMASES PAST MAKE GIFTS WORTH SHARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA PARSONS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Several of them started their stories the same way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, this isn't very important," they said. Or, "This probably isn't very 
interesting to anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 And then they proceeded to take the microphone that was being passed around 
among them at the Villa Valencia retirement home and tell a Christmas story. 
Some were in wheelchairs, others in regular chairs. Several were stroke 
victims; at least one stoked up on oxygen before joining the conversational 
circle. 
</P>
<P>
 Most are in their 80s or 90s, and they have to struggle to keep life and its 
memories from fading into the distant shadows. One way to stay sharp, to stay 
healthy, is to exercise their minds. 
</P>
<P>
 And so they recalled Christmases past. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't talk very well," Glad Gray said. She is 92. "I'm going to tell 
you about the first Christmas I remember. I was a very little girl, and my 
sister was very little too. Grace and I were very small. Mother made a suit for 
Santa, and I knew him, I knew him till I was 8 years old. Kids came from all 
over the neighborhood. It was a jolly, jolly evening to remember as long as I 
live." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Hill, 75, and in a wheelchair, was next. "I remember only that I was about 
5 or 6, and I was curious about what I was getting for Christmas, of course. So 
I waited until my parents went to bed. We lived out in the country, with a 
pot-bellied stove in the dining room with the tree beside it." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill said he crept down from his upstairs bedroom and began sorting through 
the unwrapped presents. Unfortunately, he heard a creak from a footstep and 
realized his father was heading for the room. Young Bob tried to hide in his 
favorite spot in the kitchen, but his father found him and dispatched him to 
bed. But not without the information: "I woke up my brother and told him 
everything he was going to get for Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 Signa Lafors had been showing album pictures before the storytelling began. 
She came from a Swedish family of six girls and six boys. Now 90, she recalled 
the time her sister Klara, then 40, played Santa Claus. Everything was fine, 
she said, until one of the children said, "He has the same earrings as Aunt 
Klara! There's something wrong here." 
</P>
<P>
 Evelyn Marley is the activities director at Villa Valencia, which provides 
both housing and care for its residents. Part of the center's challenge is 
keeping the seniors mentally alert. "It's an ongoing task," she said. "If we're 
able to keep them functioning mentally, we seem to see a correlation in their 
physical abilities to either recuperate or stay healthy, and in their emotional 
outlook. The more they keep busy, the better off they are, and they're less apt 
to get depressed." 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Ryan is 82. "I was born in a small town in Pennsylvania in the Allegheny 
Mountains," she began, adding that virtually everyone in town was 
German-Catholic. She recalled wanting to grow up to be 14 so she'd be old 
enough to stay awake for midnight Mass at Christmas. In her mind's eye, she 
still recalls the priests' flowing robes of gold and silver. 
</P>
<P>
 But that isn't what she remembers most. It was being "initiated" as a 
teen-ager by her family with a shot of whiskey and beer. She took a drink of 
whiskey and "coughed and spit the whole thing out." Her relatives gave her a 
cracker and insisted she wash it down with a swig of beer. "We had five 
breweries in a town of fifteen-hundred people," she said. "I tasted the beer 
and it wasn't as bad as the whiskey, but I haven't had any beer to this day." 
</P>
<P>
 With a comic's touch, she paused just long enough as her friends laughed 
before adding: "I'll drink gin or vodka, but no beer. And I don't like 
whiskey." 
</P>
<P>
 They kept their stories short, because that was the order of the day, but 
maybe because as Signa Lafors said, "I can't remember so much now that I had 
this stroke a few years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 But while their world may be darkening, it's strangely comforting that they 
can still dip into their childhoods of 80 years ago and remember pot-bellied 
stoves beside the Christmas tree, their mother making a suit for Santa, a 
child's sense of delight. 
</P>
<P>
 The elderly always have lessons to teach the young. What these folks seemed to 
be saying was that the simplest stories, the purest tales, are the ones that 
stick with you for a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you get to that point where you're no longer trying to impress anyone, 
isn't it interesting what stories we choose to tell? 
</P>

A HEARTFELT HOLIDAY; FAMILY AND FRIENDS HELP CANCER VICTIM MARK LAST CHRISTMAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Karen Riggs pulled Santa Clauses, snowballs, Christmas quilts and toy villages 
out of the box as she helped her sister-in-law decorate her home last weekend. 
But she stopped when she came to the straw angels. 
</P>
<P>
 This will be the last Christmas 43-year-old Ann-Marie White will have with her 
husband, Tom, and her two boys, Michael, 9, and Benjamin, 3, and Riggs was 
afraid the angels would be a sad reminder of the cancer that has racked her 
sister-in-law's body and lodged in her brain. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, the doctors told Tom White to prepare for the end. Last Sunday 
the Whites made a family decision to go ahead and have a "normal" Christmas. 
Including the angels. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided to make it as good a Christmas as we can," Riggs said. 
</P>
<P>
 And the family is getting a lot of help from friends and strangers alike. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday night, a full contingent of teachers, staff members and 
administrators from the Magnolia School District crammed around the hospital 
bed where White is confined in her living room, singing every Christmas carol 
they could think of. They also handed her a lifetime service award for the 20 
years she has put in teaching severely handicapped preschoolers at Lord Baden 
Powell Elementary School in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the Mabury Ranch neighborhood, where the Whites live, are also 
helping the family get ready for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, it's absolutely amazing what is happening in this small community," 
Riggs said. 
</P>
<P>
 A paramedic who lives across the street is on call day and night in case of an 
emergency. Another neighbor brings a full dinner over at least once a week. 
After the White family had trouble finding medication late at night, a 
pharmacist who lives across the road volunteered to open his store and get 
needed drugs when emergencies arise. "And we don't even know this man," Riggs 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the way the world used to be 50 years ago," said Marcia Hormell, Tom 
White's mother. "And we've lost this." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of this spirit comes from White herself, whom friends and family describe 
as a private woman who rarely displays emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just amazing. Her attitude has been so positive," Hormell said. "She's 
never let on to anyone but Karen and me and her husband that she's scared." 
</P>
<P>
 White's 20 years of work with disabled children helped her keep a practical 
attitude when illness forced her into a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people think of a wheelchair as a defeat, but I think of it as a 
means of conserving my energy," White said. "I figured if a 3-year-old can do 
this, I can do it. It doesn't take all of the scariness away, but it does put 
it in a positive perspective." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a little different when a teacher came by several weeks ago with a gold 
road-runner charm -- a reminder of the school's mascot -- that the school gives 
to retirees. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made it more final," White said. It was one of the few times her family 
saw her sob. 
</P>
<P>
 But White had accepted the idea that she would never teach again by the time 
her colleagues came to the house to serenade her Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really special," she said. "It's one thing when your peers do it for 
you, but when higher up people come from the school board and the district, 
it's a real neat touch." 
</P>
<P>
 Hormell said she had to go into the kitchen to cry when the group started 
singing "Have a Very Merry Christmas." But White's husband, a manager at 
Rockwell International Corp., said it reminded him of old times and gave him a 
much-needed lift. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was neat to see how her co-workers felt about her," he said. "It was 
reminiscent of some of the parties we used to have. It wasn't sad at all. 
Everybody was drinking cider and having a good time." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom White said he was also surprised at how many people at work have made 
truly meaningful and persistent offers of help. 
</P>
<P>
 "You expect it from the few people who are close to you, but it's really 
surprising how broad-based the support is," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The next hurdle will be to get through Christmas itself, Riggs said. Hormell 
usually cooks prime rib and Yorkshire pudding on Christmas Eve, but this year 
the family is preparing just hot hors d'oeuvres, not sure what White's 
condition might be. 
</P>
<P>
 But family members said it's important to try to keep up tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is most definitely important with two small kids," White said. "That has 
been one of our biggest things. Things are not the same, but we would like to 
have them appear to be the same. It's real important to the kids."

TESTIMONY FOCUSES ON JAIL PRIVACY; SIMPSON TRIAL: COMMANDER OF THE FACILITY 
APPEARS TO BOLSTER LAWYERS' CONTENTION THAT THE DEFENDANT'S OUTBURST TO A 
MINISTER, WHICH A DEPUTY OVERHEARD, SHOULD NOT BE USED BY PROSECUTORS. 
</P>

<P>
 The commanding officer of the Men's Central Jail, where O.J. Simpson has been 
housed for almost six months, testified Thursday that the room where Simpson 
allegedly blurted out an emotional comment to the Rev. Rosey Grier was in an 
area where, the defense team had been assured, confidential conversations could 
be held. 
</P>
<P>
 Called to the stand by defense lawyers, Capt. Albert A. Scaduto appeared to 
bolster the claim that Simpson's remarks should remain out of reach of 
prosecutors, who are seeking access to them because they believe the comments 
might tend to incriminate the football great in the double murder of his 
ex-wife and her friend. A deputy working in the jail said he overheard the 
remarks Nov. 13, and he subsequently wrote a memorandum detailing what he 
allegedly heard. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito has that memo, but neither prosecutors nor 
defense attorneys have been allowed to read it while the judge considers 
whether the conversation should remain privileged because it was between an 
inmate and a clergyman. One issue before Ito is whether Simpson and Grier had a 
reasonable expectation of privacy during their conversation, even if Simpson 
raised his voice loud enough to be heard by a deputy working in a nearby 
control booth. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson, who has pleaded not guilty to the June 12 murders of Nicole Brown 
Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman, has listened to several days of testimony and 
argument about the conversation, conveying little sense that he is concerned 
about the outcome. As Scaduto testified Thursday, Simpson frequently smiled and 
arched his eyebrows in apparent bemusement. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources have said the remarks by Simpson could be construed as incriminating 
but are ambiguous. The deputy who overheard them has conceded that he did not 
hear the full context of the comments, only a three- to five-second snippet 
from Simpson and a brief retort from Grier. 
</P>
<P>
 "Judge Ito approved of the . . . visiting area as a place for confidential 
communications?" Simpson lawyer Robert L. Shapiro asked the captain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, sir, he did," Scaduto responded. 
</P>
<P>
 "And those confidential communications extended not only between the lawyer 
and the client but to any material witnesses . . . as well as any parishioner?" 
Shapiro continued. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, sir," Scaduto said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Scaduto later added under cross-examination that Simpson had never 
been promised that deputies would not staff the control booth while he held 
conversations nearby, his testimony about the assurance of privacy strengthened 
the Simpson team's contention that their client's remarks were made privately 
to his minister and thus should not fall into prosecutors' hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito did not resolve the matter Thursday because Deputy Dist. Atty. William 
Hodgman was out sick, leaving prosecutors unprepared to argue the matter. But 
the judge scheduled a hearing for this morning in the hopes of finally settling 
an issue that has lingered at the margins of the case for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito also delayed a hearing, potentially of far greater significance, on the 
admissibility of evidence relating to domestic discord between Simpson and his 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's attorneys complained that they were deluged by 1,044 pages of new 
prosecution documents -- including statements from a dozen new possible 
witnesses -- on the eve of that hearing. Gerald F. Uelmen, one of Simpson's 
attorneys, called that a "deliberate and calculated move" to leave the defense 
unprepared for the session. 
</P>
<P>
 As he outlined the defense team's complaint about the late disclosure of 
documents, Uelmen revealed the names of 12 new potential witnesses from whom 
prosecutors have taken statements regarding the relationship between Simpson 
and his ex-wife. The couple divorced in 1992, and prosecutors are expected to 
try to introduce evidence of several violent confrontations between the two. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those from whom prosecutors have taken recent statements are former 
Dodger star Steve Garvey and his wife, Candace -- who are friends of Simpson -- 
and Faye Resnick, who co-wrote, with a National Enquirer columnist, a splashy 
book about Nicole Simpson's final months of life. 
</P>
<P>
 One source said the list of witnesses was culled, at least in part, from 
notes, legal records and other information gathered for Resnick's tell-all 
best-seller. Resnick, who has said she believes O.J. Simpson is guilty, wanted 
to cooperate with the prosecution and has been turning over background material 
to them for at least two months, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 The book describes several scenes of alleged domestic violence between the 
Simpsons that Resnick says she either witnessed or heard about from Nicole 
Simpson. One involved a 1993 Christmas party given by Chris and Bruce Jenner. 
Resnick wrote that Simpson attended the party with his ex-wife and children, 
but caused a scene and stormed out when one of Nicole's purported lovers showed 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Candace Garvey said Wednesday that the prosecution had wanted to corroborate 
that incident and other portions of Resnick's book. She said she had witnessed 
the disagreement but had "not been a witness" to any physical abuse. "That was 
a verbal fight," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, meanwhile, said he had been questioned on matters ranging from 
discord between the Simpsons to what transpired at a June 12 dance recital 
hours before Nicole Simpson was stabbed to death. The Garveys were at the show 
because their daughter was in the same program as the Simpsons' daughter 
Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
 But Steve Garvey said he saw little that would have been useful to 
investigators. "I was there, briefly exchanged hellos with O.J. and then spent 
the time videotaping the recital," Garvey said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Statements were taken from Garvey, Resnick and the others in October and 
November, said Uelmen, who accused prosecutors of sitting on the information 
and only turning it over when it was too late for the defense to study and 
prepare for the scheduled hearing Thursday. Uelmen accused prosecutors of 
holding back on the information intentionally and asked Ito to sanction them 
for their actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher Darden, a veteran prosecutor whose appointment 
to the Simpson prosecution was fought by Simpson's attorneys, retorted by 
accusing Uelmen of hyperbole and by noting that prosecutors have turned over 
18,060 pages of material to the defense. For the most part, Darden said, the 
latest batch of transcripts are merely typed versions of tapes that the defense 
has long had in its possession. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't been hiding the ball," Darden said. "There really isn't anything 
new. We've pretty much exhausted everything we have." 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with such voluminous material handed over on the eve of the hearing, 
Uelmen urged Ito to press ahead with opening statements in the trial on Jan. 4 
and to force prosecutors to delete any reference to domestic abuse from their 
initial comments to the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the second time this week that defense attorneys have proposed a 
scheduling alternative that could force a curtailment of the prosecutors' 
opening remarks; a defense motion for addressing the issue of DNA evidence, if 
accepted by Ito, also could have the effect of forcing prosecutors to avoid 
commenting on DNA test results in their opening remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts said that asking prosecutors to curtail their opening statements 
was highly unusual and probably unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 "The prosecution should know what evidence is likely to be admitted and to 
take full advantage of it," said Erwin Chemerinsky, a USC law professor. "Each 
side, as much as possible, should know the evidence that's going to be 
admissible before they deliver opening statements." 
</P>
<P>
 Ito has yet to rule on when he will hold hearings on the DNA test results and 
domestic abuse. He is expected to discuss both issues this morning.

JUDGE UPHOLDS FORGER'S 'STRIKE' BUT ASSAILS LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Expressing deep dissatisfaction with the state's "three strikes" law, a Santa 
Monica Superior Court judge has nevertheless let stand the sentence of a check 
forger facing 25 years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Judge Leslie W. Light expressed misgivings about the controversial 
statute and promised to reconsider the sentence he imposed on Michael Leon 
James, a 30-year-old career criminal convicted in October of attempted check 
forgery. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Light said that James' lengthy criminal record made the chances 
of a new sentence "very, very slim." But the judge requested further 
information from prosecutors and used the hearing to conduct what amounted to a 
90-minute seminar on what he considers flaws in the "three strikes" law. 
</P>
<P>
 Light said he was particularly disturbed that James might have received as 
little as 32 months in prison if he had accepted an early plea bargain from 
prosecutors. Instead, the defendant rejected the deal -- and got 25 years to 
life after being convicted at trial. "I'm concerned that the history of this 
case possibly indicates a flaw of unequal protection of the law," Light said 
during the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Trial judges are increasingly speaking out against the so-called "three 
strikes" law, signed in March by Gov. Pete Wilson. The new law requires a 
sentence of 25 years to life for any felony defendant who has previously been 
convicted of two violent or serious felonies. 
</P>
<P>
 Judges have complained that the law has clogged courts with the trials of 
defendants desperate to avoid a third conviction. At the same time, the 
Legislature has not provided additional funding for judges since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Light argued that the law, ostensibly designed to curtail plea-bargain 
arrangements favorable to violent criminals, has in practice eliminated the 
discretionary powers of judges and prosecutors, and flooded court dockets with 
"three strikes" cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have the resources to try all these cases," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
 James calmly sat at the defense table with his attorney, Deputy Public 
Defender Charles Cervantes, but did not address the court. The defendant wept 
last week when Light first imposed the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 James' criminal record included convictions for two counts of burglary and one 
count of assaulting a police officer -- all of which were eligible as "strikes" 
under the new law -- plus convictions for auto theft and some juvenile 
offenses. James' most recent run-in with the law occurred in June, when he was 
arrested at a Culver City supermarket on suspicion of attempting to write a 
forged check and carrying a fake driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Lori Aiu told the court that prosecutors were unaware of 
the full extent of James' criminal record when they offered him the plea 
bargain last summer. Light ordered her to prepare a memo by Jan. 31 fully 
explaining why prosecutors attempted to strike a plea bargain with James when 
they did not have all the facts. 
</P>
<P>
 The court has 120 days to revise James' sentence.

QUAKE AID COULD FALL SHORT BY $3 BILLION; RECOVERY: TOTAL DAMAGE TO CIVIC 
STRUCTURES RISES FAR ABOVE ESTIMATES PREPARED SHORTLY AFTER JAN. 17 NORTHRIDGE 
TEMBLOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Damage to roads, schools, hospitals and other government structures from the 
Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake may be $3 billion more than the money 
appropriated by Congress to rebuild civic structures in Southern California, 
according to county and state officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Estimates of damage to public facilities have more than doubled -- to about $6 
billion -- over the last year and could climb higher, according to figures 
prepared by the state Office of Emergency Services and Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 But based on estimates prepared within weeks of the earthquake, the Clinton 
Administration and Congress assumed $2.8 billion would cover the cost of 
repairing and replacing public facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The potential $3-billion gap between the claims being filed for reimbursement 
and funds made available is a cause for concern, said Los Angeles County Chief 
Administrative Officer Sally Reed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county may have a problem, and if so, so do almost 50 cities, educational 
institutions, hospitals, and other nonprofit agencies in (Los Angeles and 
Ventura) counties that have damage claims pending," Reed said in a report to 
the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials, who are coordinating damage claims for all local 
jurisdictions, say they share Reed's fears. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had concerns for several months now," said Tom Mullins, a spokesman for 
the state Office of Emergency Services. "And we have communicated those 
concerns to FEMA (the Federal Emergency Management Administration)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed said she hopes Congress will appropriate additional funds. 
</P>
<P>
 But if not, local and state governments will either have to find billions of 
dollars in their already tight budgets to complete repairs or allow a wide 
variety of facilities from courthouses to bridges and sewers to classrooms and 
libraries to remain damaged or unusable. 
</P>
<P>
 In the weeks immediately after the Jan. 17 temblor, Congress appropriated $5 
billion to cover all types of emergency aid -- including housing, food and 
transportation as well as loans and grants so homeowners and businesses could 
rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 But claims for rebuilding public structures have already exceeded that total 
appropriation, according to the state figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County has filed claims for $2.4 billion to rebuild dozens of 
buildings and other damaged structures.  
</P>
<P>
 The city of Los Angeles has filed claims for nearly $1 billion and the Los 
Angeles Unified School District has estimated its repairs at $100 million. 
Dozens of other cities, school districts and agencies have filed thousands of 
claims totaling several billion dollars more. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA spokesman Phil Cogan said he was unsure of the level of claims already 
made under the agency's public assistance program and was uncertain how the 
shortfall will be handled, but added, "This is a serious implication they are 
drawing." 
</P>
<P>
 Cogan said he did not know if enough money would eventually be available to 
cover all legitimate claims but added that, "historically, FEMA has had the 
funds required." 
</P>
<P>
 Cogan added that if there is a shortfall, FEMA will have to determine which 
projects have the greatest priority in the community. Those would be the first 
funded; other projects would be delayed or rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed said FEMA officials may already be feeling -- and responding to -- the 
looming cash crunch. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials have found that in recent weeks FEMA has gotten significantly 
tougher in its review of damage claims for such things as courthouses, 
County-USC Medical Center and the Hall of Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is concern that FEMA may be trying to reduce damage claims to fit the 
funds available," Reed said. "If so, the county . . . has a great deal at 
stake."  
</P>
<P>
 Mullins of the Office of Emergency Services said the time it has taken to 
process claims is increasing, though it was unclear whether more claims were 
being reduced.  
</P>
<P>
 Reed said the key reason for the shortfall is that projected costs have 
dramatically increased from initial estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's initial estimate, for example, was $1.3 billion; it has grown to 
$2.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Los Angeles' claim has nearly doubled in a year. The city has only 
recently discovered, for example, that its sewer system is extensively damaged. 
City officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Reed said, there are more than $2 billion in claims from private, 
nonprofit agencies, hospitals, colleges and universities that appear to have 
been overlooked or grossly underestimated in initial estimates -- including $1 
billion from UCLA. So far, no major claims have been rejected and local 
officials have not stopped reconstruction work on any of the projects for which 
they are hoping to be reimbursed. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed said she is hoping there will be a coordinated effort to lobby the 
federal government for additional appropriations.

GETTY INSTITUTE TO SALVAGE EARLIEST FOOTPRINTS OF UPRIGHT HUMANS; EVOLUTION: 
CONSERVATION ORGANIZATION STEPS IN TO PROTECT SITE IN TANZANIA THAT HAS ERODED 
OVER 3.5 MILLION YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Getty Conservation Institute has stepped in to preserve the earliest known 
evidence of humanity's ability to walk upright -- a fossil trail of footprints 
that have survived 3.5 million years only to be jeopardized today by the 
scouring wind and destructive tree roots. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts in human origins consider the footprints, near Laetoli in northwestern 
Tanzania, to be one of the most important finds in the study of human 
evolution. Although the discoverers reburied the fossil trail as a protective 
measure after several years of study, the remote site has eroded to the point 
at which the footprints soon may be damaged. Getty officials announced Thursday 
that they have reached an agreement with the government of Tanzania on a 
three-year project to refurbish and protect the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very pleased to have the Getty Conservation Institute as a partner in 
this endeavor to preserve the footprints at Laetoli, which have such great 
importance not only for our country, but for all humanity," said Philemon 
Sarungi, Tanzanian minister of education and culture.  
</P>
<P>
 Discovered in 1977 by scientists working with fossil hunter Mary Leakey, the 
ancient trail is less than 90 feet long. It preserves the tracks of two 
pre-human primates, who apparently walked together, across a stretch of moist 
clay and ash on a rainy day more than a million years before the first human 
ancestor used tools. 
</P>
<P>
 Their footprints -- along with those of a third individual who walked a short 
distance away -- were quickly covered over by layers of fine ash from a nearby 
volcano. Moistened by the rain, the ash turned to a kind of cement that 
preserved the tracks. The imprint of the tiny raindrops is still visible in the 
volcanic tuff. 
</P>
<P>
 The tracks helped settle a long scientific dispute over how humanity's 
earliest ancestors moved by providing direct evidence that they walked with the 
upright free-striding gait of modern Homo sapiens.  
</P>
<P>
 "There is this incredible connection established between the people who walked 
there so long ago and yourself," Getty Director Miguel Angel Corzo said of the 
site. "It is a magical place. You can imagine that this place is the beginning 
of it all. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make sure that this is preserved for future generations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Getty experts were first asked to examine the site two years ago, after 
Tanzanian government officials had become alarmed over the damage caused by 
saplings sprouting along the buried trackway and the effects of erosion. In 
subsequent visits, the Getty workers dug up part of the track to assess the 
damage and discovered that tree roots had already injured several of the 
footprints. 
</P>
<P>
 During the next two years, an international team of archeologists, 
conservators and other specialists recruited by the Getty will start excavating 
the tracks, remove the roots and stabilize the soil. Once they determine how 
best to ensure that no new growth will threaten the footprints, the entire 
trail will be reburied.

JURY TOLD GIRL'S DEATH MAY HAVE BEEN ACCIDENTAL; COURTS: SEX ACTS WITH CHILD, 
8, MAY HAVE BEEN TAPED, PROSECUTOR SAYS. DEFENSE COUNTERS THEY MAY HAVE 
OCCURRED AFTER SHE DIED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A prosecutor told a Superior Court jury Thursday that Hooman Askhan Panah 
probably didn't mean to kill an 8-year-old neighbor, theorizing instead that 
Panah inadvertently took Nicole Parker's life while videotaping sex acts with 
the child. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's possible he didn't intend to kill her," Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter S. 
Berman said. "It's possible this started as a seduction. He wanted to tape it 
and keep it as part of his collection." 
</P>
<P>
 If a videotape existed, it never was found. Nor were Nicole's clothes or a 
softball glove she was playing with outside Panah's Woodland Hills apartment 
minutes before she disappeared at mid-morning on Nov. 20, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 She was dead by 1 p.m., the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Berman told jurors that Panah, 23, probably got rid of the child's clothes and 
an incriminating tape before he went to work that afternoon. But he was unable 
to dispose of the child's body before her father, who lived nearby, noticed she 
was missing and called police. 
</P>
<P>
 Panah never returned to his apartment because police set up a command post at 
the complex to organize the search for Nicole, Berman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor publicly voiced this theory, long the subject of speculation, 
for the first time during closing arguments at Panah's capital murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Panah is charged with murder with special circumstances that could carry the 
death penalty. He is accused of murdering Nicole while committing other crimes 
-- sodomy, lewd acts with a child under 14 and oral copulation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Berman told jurors that, legally, it doesn't matter whether Panah meant for 
Nicole to die because Panah killed her while committing the sex crimes. The 
physical evidence includes body fluids left behind on a bloody bedsheet, a robe 
and a piece of toilet paper. They match Panah's and Nicole's blood types. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Robert Sheahen told jurors the prosecution hadn't proved its 
case, didn't present more conclusive DNA evidence and failed to investigate 
other possible suspects. He questioned why Panah, whom he described as "a 
college kid with a normal, active sex life," would want to "go after a little 
girl." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheahen also told jurors that the sex acts may have occurred after Nicole 
died, a theory designed to spare Panah from the special circumstances that 
carry the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter how offensive, no matter how extremely repugnant sodomy with a dead 
person might be, it is not a special circumstance," Sheahen argued. 
</P>
<P>
 But Berman told the jury that Nicole suffered injuries that caused her to 
bruise and bleed -- clear evidence that she was alive when sexually assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorneys argued their cases in a packed courtroom where emotions ran so 
high that Judge Sandy R. Kreigler had to admonish spectators to restrain 
themselves from openly reacting to what the lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole's parents, Edward and Lori Parker, sat stoically in the front row of 
the courtroom as the evidence of how their daughter died was discussed in 
graphic detail. 
</P>
<P>
 The second-grader's body was discovered in Panah's closet 36 hours after 
Edward Parker reported her missing. 
</P>
<P>
 The child's bruised body was the most compelling evidence against Panah, 
Berman said. "It's like a smoking gun," the prosecutor told the jury. 'You have 
a body in his closet, in his suitcase." 
</P>
<P>
 Berman contended that the physical evidence showed that Panah first forced 
Nicole to perform oral sex on him, violated her with a foreign object, then 
sodomized her. Bruises and tears on her body showed the force he used. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was done to satisfy his own lust," the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 She died slowly and painfully, some time after Panah had sodomized her, Berman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After she died, he said, Panah wrapped Nicole's nude, bruised body in the 
bloody bedsheet, stuffed it in a suitcase, and hid it in his closet, under two 
other suitcases and a pile of laundry. 
</P>
<P>
 "For 13 months, Mr. Panah has enjoyed the mantle of the presumption of 
innocence," Berman said, imploring jurors, "You are now in the position to 
brand him for what he is, the murderer of a helpless 8-year-old child -- who 
satisfied his own lust, who treated her as if she wasn't human, who gratified 
himself sexually with a victim who was about 4 feet, 3 inches tall and about 45 
pounds." 
</P>
<P>
 Jury deliberations begin today.

SUBURBAN OASIS; ANTELOPE VALLEY: LANCASTER MOVES AHEAD WITH PLANS TO SAVE 
JOSHUA TREE SITE, BUYING FIVE ACRES FOR A PLANNED NATURE PRESERVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ISAAC GUZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A boom town still trying to find its way after a storm of development, 
Lancaster is attempting to save its most abundant Joshua tree site from illegal 
dumpers, off-road vehicle enthusiasts and the bulldozers of developers. 
</P>
<P>
 With the purchase last week of five new acres of land, the city is halfway 
toward reaching its goal of creating a 95-acre woodland preserve, a high desert 
oasis in the middle of expanding suburbia. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the (San Fernando) Valley encroaches on the desert, we're looking more 
like a city," said Lyle W. Norton, director of Parks, Recreation and Arts. "We 
just have to try to coexist as best we can." 
</P>
<P>
 Development in the Antelope Valley during the 1980s destroyed an estimated 
200,000 Joshua trees, one of the Mojave desert's unique plants, inspiring land 
use reform in Lancaster and Palmdale. Where once the Lancaster desert was 
dotted with the contorted arms of these oddly beautiful yuccas, there is now a 
continuum of housing tracts and shopping centers. 
</P>
<P>
 At first glance, it would be easy to mistake the woodland site -- an 
irregular, 45-acre lot just south of K-4 Street -- for nothing more than 
another illegal desert dumping ground. Near magnificently thick stands of 
Joshua trees lie the dilapidated hulk of an abandoned swamp cooler and an 
assortment of shredded couches. 
</P>
<P>
 But the broken glass, mud-stiff rags and rusting cans that litter the ground 
belie the abundant flora and wildlife to be found here. This is the richest 
concentration of Joshua trees -- some with hundreds of branches covering a rare 
series of sand dunes -- in the city of Lancaster. Alongside the Joshua trees, 
California junipers shelter the warrens of desert cottontails and white-tailed 
antelope squirrels. 
</P>
<P>
 An enormous creosote bush, 10 feet high and 20 feet in diameter, has been 
estimated to be nearly 800 years old by biologists, said Norton. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the fact that the woodlands are surrounded by homes and that the 
shouts of children playing at the nearby school are audible during the day, 
there is still a wide-open feel to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In many places, the rooftops of neighboring developments are obscured by 
vegetation. The view of the Tehachapi Mountains to the northwest and the San 
Gabriel foothills to the south lends the impression of isolation in a pristine 
desert setting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so nice," said Pilar Alcivar, parks director, anticipating the day when 
the site will be returned to its natural condition. "You don't even feel like 
you're in the city." 
</P>
<P>
 But that feeling of oneness with nature lasts only as long as you don't look 
to the ground, where reminders of humanity abound. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things we can't control right now is garbage dumping," said 
Norton, standing over a moldering roll of yellow-orange shag carpet. "It's 
secluded, so people are doing things that aren't very nice." 
</P>
<P>
 Even a squatter who uses the woodlands as a temporary residence has complaints 
about the junk. 
</P>
<P>
 Cameron MacLauchlin, who grew up in nearby Quartz Hill, recently spent a 
freezing night in the woodlands site and wandered out of the brush to ask 
Norton whether the land he'd been sleeping on was public or private property. 
Once MacLauchlin determined he wasn't going to be run off the land, he was 
vociferous in his attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to put up a sign that says, 'If you happen to be the person who put 
this garbage here, I am totally contemptuous of your lack of regard for the 
environment,"' said the raggedy MacLauchlin, who sells some of the refuse he 
finds, including skis, golf bags and aluminum cans. 
</P>
<P>
 Operating with a $2.4-million budget -- money from grants and voter-approved 
taxes for park improvements -- Norton plans to buy 40 more acres, fence the 
woodlands in, and construct an information center and trail system for 
visitors. The city has already acquired 50 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 Installing a fence around the area is crucial, he said, pointing out that 
off-road vehicles and dumpers have easy access to the woodlands from K-8 
street. Near the planned entrance to the park, someone has cut through a strip 
of steel fence with a blowtorch, a sign that some locals value their shortcuts 
more than Joshua trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Near a web of tire tracks along a pockmarked dirt path, three five-gallon 
drums of oil had recently been dumped on the ground near a hubcap, a child's 
sandal and a crusty blanket. Berms delineated an informal motocross circuit.

 Norton said he will probably need $500,000 more to complete the project, which 
will include cleaning out both trash and non-native plant species, like the 
Russian thistle, commonly called the tumbleweed and seen rolling through 
streets.

 Acquisition of land for the desert woodlands project has been complicated by 
the numerous land owners on the site. City planner Brian Ludicke said decades 
of rampant land speculation have created a crazy quilt of small subdivided 
lots, many owned by people who live out of state or in foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The recently acquired five acres known as the "Pohle Property" is being 
purchased for $210,000, and the city has its eye on an adjacent five-acre lot 
on which to build a parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Before city officials settled on the current site, they came under fire in 
1992 for acquiring parcels of land for another Joshua tree preserve site. At 
the time, they paid higher than market prices without first having the land 
appraised. Now, the fate of those controversial lots is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people want to sell that land, others want to preserve it," said Norton. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the city slowly presses ahead in its effort to purchase and 
rehabilitate the prime desert woodlands, the community anticipates a place 
where the next generation can see how their hometown looked before it was 
covered with red-roofed housing tracts and stucco shopping malls. 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Kinnon, a fifth-grade teacher at Sunnydale Elementary School, looks 
forward to the transformation so she can take her students to the reserve for 
field trips. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to get the kids to appreciate where they live," said Kinnon. "Joshua 
trees are kind of ho hum to them because they see them all the time . . . but 
if you actually had some information there . . . I think it would be real 
educational."

DISTRICT OFFICIALS SUPPORT CLOSING SANTA PAULA POOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL ELIAS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To the outrage of 32 Santa Paula High School swim team members and their 
parents, school administrators want to turn the city's only public swimming 
pool into a giant sandbox. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Robert Fisher, who said the district can no longer afford to keep the 
high school pool open, is recommending spending $21,000 to fill the city 
landmark with sand and disbanding the swim team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to cut expenses somewhere," Trustee Al Sandoval said in advocating 
the closure of the pool, where he and three other board members learned to 
swim. Officials estimate it costs $27,000 to maintain the pool each year. 
</P>
<P>
 If the pool does close, it will be the latest casualty in five years of 
budgetary woes for the 1,177-student district. This year, teachers agreed to 
take a 2% pay cut, and three employees were laid off as the district struggled 
to balance its $4.7-million budget, Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher added that swimming was no longer a requirement to graduate and few 
classes were offered. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Paula Union High School District trustees were set to order the pool 
closed Wednesday, but -- prompted by protests voiced by swim team members and 
their parents -- they refused to adopt Fisher's recommendation and delayed 
action until next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Pool boosters said they are seeking private financing and talked of organizing 
fund-raisers to save the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some of us, this is the only sport we have," Tara Nelson, a 17-year-old 
senior, told the board. "If you close down the pool, we won't have any 
extracurricular activity." 
</P>
<P>
 The board agreed to give the boosters a week to present their case, and a 
special meeting was tentatively called for Tuesday at 6:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 But some board members -- including newly sworn-in Trustee Terrence Nelson 
III, who is Tara's father -- said the delay may be only putting off the 
inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it has an important impact on campus, but it is not the main impact," 
Nelson said. He said the district did not receive $440,000 it expected from the 
state this year and that cuts had to be made. 
</P>
<P>
 If team boosters can come up with $12,300, the swim season could be saved, 
Nelson said. But the pool is in jeopardy after that, without a permanent 
outside funding source, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the school does not shut the pool and cut costs elsewhere, it faces the 
same fate as the Richmond School District, Sandoval said. That Northern 
California district filed for bankruptcy three years ago and was taken over by 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the budget goes into a default and there isn't enough to pay the bills, 
you'll end up losing everything," he said. "This pool has always been a 
problem."  
</P>
<P>
 Closing the pool to cut expenses first became an issue five years ago when the 
Santa Paula district came close to filing for bankruptcy, Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, he said, he has listened each year to undelivered promises of a 
permanent, outside source of money for the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 When the city withdrew its summer contribution of $6,000 last year, it threw 
the pool's viability into a crisis, trustee Shirley Hendren said. Hendren 
argued Wednesday against closing the pool, suggesting that the district 
approach several governmental and private agencies, including the city, for 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city's refusal to rent the pool from the district this year prompted 
the pool's summer closure for the first time in 40 years, school officials 
said. City officials said its summer aquatics program has lost about $7,000 
each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Given its own budgetary constraints, the city decided not to pay for the pool 
anymore, Recreation Director Mel Howery said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The school ran us out of the pool business," Howery said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Councilwoman Robin Sullivan was not optimistic about city aid. 
"The school people have a habit of doing this -- pointing the finger at the 
city," Sullivan said, adding that she has not heard from any school officials 
about contributing to the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Parent Vicki Corona also said that she had not heard until recently that the 
pool was in jeopardy. Her son, Corey Corona, is a three-year member of the swim 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 "June was the first we heard of this," she said. Corona said boosters should 
be given more time to find money. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should make every effort to save the pool," Hendren agreed, proposing that 
the district back a parcel tax if fund-raising efforts fail. 
</P>
<P>
 If trustees vote to close the pool Tuesday, the district will pay $21,000 to 
fill it with sand, a move that many deem as a permanent closure. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no way you can open it after all that sand has been sitting in it 
for years," Corona said.

FUND-STRAPPED ORCHESTRA WINS COVETED GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura County Symphony, still recovering from its worst budget deficit in 
history, has won a coveted $50,000 grant from the National Endowment for the 
Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Directors of the orchestra are hoping that the grant, which must be matched 
with $150,000 in local funds, will be a turning point and lead to a countywide 
audience for the symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing the award Thursday, symphony officials also said they plan to 
expand next year's concert series to 12, including six performances at the 
Civic Arts Plaza in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like any entity, either you grow or you die," board President Felice 
Ginsberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Conductor Boris Brott said another of the symphony's long-term goals is to 
provide more educational programs to replace music and art classes cut in 
public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to not only serve the audience of the present, but also develop the 
audience of the future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, 91 arts groups throughout the country applied for the National 
Endowment's $50,000 grants. Of the 38 chosen, the Ventura County Symphony was 
the only organization in California and one of only two on the West Coast. The 
other is the Portland Baroque Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 Victoria Cohen, a representative for the National Endowment, said the grants 
are awarded to orchestras, dance troupes, acting companies and museums of all 
sizes. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they have in common is that they are looking to improve themselves for 
the long term," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The money may be used for anything that supports a group's five-year plan for 
growth, but cannot be used for fund raising or to pay off existing debts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's thrilling that the NEA is encouraging us to continue to go in the 
direction we are going," said Betsy Chess, the symphony's interim executive 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the Ventura County Symphony, like many orchestras nationwide, 
has grappled with internal discord and serious financial difficulties. The 
33-year-old symphony began this fiscal year with a $180,000 deficit, the 
largest in its history. Its annual budget is $730,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The financial troubles were compounded earlier this year when the symphony's 
musicians sought a collective bargaining agreement for the first time. As 
negotiations grew increasingly tense, symphony management threatened to cancel 
the first part of the season or hire a foreign orchestra as a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
 Just weeks before the season opener, an interim contract was reached. A 
permanent contract is expected to be signed this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 With the new five-year plan and the $50,000 grant, Ginsberg said she believes 
that the symphony is poised for a financial turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite longstanding fund-raising problems, Ginsberg said she is confident 
that the orchestra will raise the $150,000 needed to match the federal grant. 
</P>
<P>
 A positive sign, she said, was the agreement by Old Creek Ranch Winery to 
sponsor three concerts this year. And, so far, the symphony is within its 
budget, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Ginsberg said a new executive director should be hired in January 
or February to replace Karine Beesley, who left in August. Board members are 
looking for someone with strong marketing and fund-raising skills, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Next season, the symphony is tentatively scheduled to play six concerts at the 
Oxnard Civic Auditorium and repeat those programs at Thousand Oaks' new 
1,800-seat auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 Brott said he believes that the expansion into the east county will complement 
performances by the Conejo Symphony Orchestra, rather than fueling competition 
between the two groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "An expansion of activity, in my experience, has tended to bring more people" 
to classical music performances, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett Ascher, director of the Conejo symphony, said the real test of whether 
the county can support two orchestras will come in the fall of 1995 when both 
groups appeal to a regional audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a question of the quality of what is performed, of how it's performed 
and who the guest artists will be," he said.

DEFENSE ADMITS THAT THORNTON KILLED NURSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Giving in to what they described as overwhelming evidence, defense attorneys 
Thursday admitted for the first time that Mark Scott Thornton kidnaped and 
fatally shot Westlake nurse Kellie O'Sullivan last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But lawyers for the 20-year-old defendant claimed the nurse's shooting was 
unintentional and perhaps even the result of her own attempt to escape from 
Thornton, who they say panicked and fired the three fatal shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mark Thornton is responsible for the death of Kellie O'Sullivan," Deputy 
Public Defender Howard J. Asher conceded somberly during final arguments in 
Ventura County Superior Court. "You've heard very solid, very reliable evidence 
of that." 
</P>
<P>
 The concession is significant because Thornton steadfastly had denied 
murdering the 33-year-old nurse, who was shot once in the chest and twice in 
the back Sept. 14, 1993, at a desolate area of the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the defense team had declined to deny or admit his involvement in 
the slaying during six weeks of testimony at his trial, which concluded Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 But by admitting Thursday that Thornton shot O'Sullivan, the defense camp 
hoped to convince the jury that he pulled the trigger without thinking and 
therefore is not guilty of a special charge that could lead to a possible death 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 They told the jury that Thornton is guilty of first-degree murder, but not of 
planning the killing as part of the kidnaping -- the special allegation with 
which he is charged. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to reaching a verdict of first-degree murder, the jury would have 
to find Thornton guilty of killing the nurse while trying to further either a 
kidnaping or robbery in order for him to be eligible for death. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors refused to comment outside court on the turn of events Thursday. 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter D. Kossoris will deliver a rebuttal to the defense 
arguments this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 While not specifically providing his own theory of the slaying, Asher 
repeatedly told jurors that the nurse was shot "in a rash manner" by a panicked 
Thornton. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview outside court, Asher said he did not know specifically how she 
died. 
</P>
<P>
 "My theory is that Kellie O'Sullivan made some unexpected, rash move, probably 
to disarm Mark, and he panicked, and he shot her," Asher said. "And he didn't 
shoot her for any reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying it was an accidental shooting. I'm saying it was 
unintentional." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say Thornton kidnaped O'Sullivan outside a Thousand Oaks pet store 
and forced her to the mountain. Once there, he made her crawl into a brushy 
grotto, turn and face him, and then shot the kneeling nurse once in the chest 
and, as she slumped over, twice in the back, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 To support their contention, prosecutors took the jury out to the scene of the 
crime off Mulholland Highway. In court, they re-created the crime using a 
mannequin dressed in the nurse's bullet-riddled uniform. A ballistics expert 
and forensic pathologist, two of the more than 60 prosecution witnesses, also 
testified that the scenario of the compliant, kneeling nurse was the most 
logical recreation of the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense did its best to pick that theory apart, attacking prosecution 
witnesses as being not credible and inconsistent. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many other ways that Kellie O'Sullivan could have been killed 
out there in that ravine that it's just pure speculation and conjecture to rely 
on just one," Asher told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 "If she was shot in a rash manner, not in furtherance of a felony, then there 
is no special circumstance," he told the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 First to argue Thursday, Deputy Public Defender Susan R. Olson made it clear 
from her opening remarks that the defense was ready to admit Thornton's 
culpability in O'Sullivan's death. "This is basically a felony murder," Olson 
told the jurors, who did not show much reaction to the admission. "This is a 
murder that occurred during another felony." 
</P>
<P>
 Olson also acknowledged that prosecutors had proved that Thornton was trying 
to find a car with keys in it to leave town. But she denied that they had 
proved that he overtook O'Sullivan violently outside the pet store or heaped 
any other physical harm on the nurse prior to her death. 
</P>
<P>
 She chastised Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael K. Frawley for referring to the 
murder in his closing statements the day before as an execution. "Mr. Frawley 
can talk all he wants about this being an execution," Olson said. "But unless 
he has evidence of it, it's not a premeditated murder." 
</P>
<P>
 That is a theme the defense stressed most of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Asher and Olson both described Thornton as being immature and not capable of 
thinking through an event as complicated as a murder. Thornton showed little 
emotion throughout the proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the defense portrayed O'Sullivan as aggressive. Asher, for 
instance, said it was possible that she precipitated her own death by lunging 
at Thornton, who did not know what to do except to shoot her. 
</P>
<P>
 Asher reminded the jury of testimony that O'Sullivan was an athletic person 
who was into running and scuba diving. He said she would not have stood by idly 
while someone led her to her death. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do know that she has never acted like a wallflower," he said.

D.C. RETURN PLANNED BY BASE LOBBY DELEGATION; NAVY: VENTURA COUNTY GROUP WILL 
CONTINUE ITS PUSH NEXT MONTH FOR POINT MUGU AND PORT HUENEME FACILITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With its lobbying effort winding to a close today, a delegation from Ventura 
County already is planning a return trip here next month to continue driving 
home its message that the entire nation would suffer militarily if the county's 
two Navy bases are closed or consolidated. 
</P>
<P>
 After spending the first day inside the Pentagon, the group moved Thursday to 
a series of meetings with supportive staffers on Capitol Hill in a continued 
push to keep the bases at Point Mugu and Port Hueneme off the closure list. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called BRAC '95 Task Force -- named for the federal Base Realignment 
and Closure Commission -- has spent more time talking about military strategy 
than the dire effects to Ventura County's economy should either base close. 
Task force members hope the approach will appeal to Pentagon decision-makers 
and differentiate the county from other communities' lobbying efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The most frustrating part of the visit, members of the delegation say, has 
been the lack of immediate feedback and the prospect of not knowing the results 
of their efforts until Defense Secretary William Perry releases his base hit 
list in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel pretty much the same as when I first arrived -- concerned," said 
Supervisor John K. Flynn. "I still don't know how our bases will fare." 
</P>
<P>
 The group, led by Flynn and county Supervisor Maggie Kildee, has deliberately 
avoided lecturing admirals and deputy defense secretaries on how their 
decisions might devastate the Ventura County economy. Instead, they brought 
with them technical experts who thoroughly know the bases. 
</P>
<P>
 The group prepared comprehensive briefing papers and stressed the county's 
one-of-a-kind geography, including the proximity of the Channel Islands, a 
deep-water port and a peak packed with radar equipment that rises up nearly 
1,500 feet from the Point Mugu base. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the looming deadline -- a list of endangered bases will emerge in the 
spring -- the delegation has faced another reality: They hardly are the only 
community to push their case in the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Ventura County group attempted to save bases at Point Mugu and Port 
Hueneme, a separate group from the Indian Wells Valley spent the week here 
defending the Naval War Air Force Center at China Lake. Delegations from 
Monterey, Sacramento, Long Beach and Barstow have made recent visits too. 
</P>
<P>
 The Base Realignment and Closure Commission has seen roughly 100 community 
groups, chambers of commerce, city councils and other groups traipse through 
its doors in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way we're going to be successful is to show that these bases have 
unique defense capabilities," explained former U. S. Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino 
(R-Ventura), who came along to offer his knowledge of the Washington scene. "We 
have to know our facts." 
</P>
<P>
 Even before it was over, the group was talking of a return visit in late 
January, saying that such a follow-up will be essential as Pentagon officials 
are in the final stages of delivering their recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday was spent huddling with staffers for Sens. Barbara Boxer and Dianne 
Feinstein and Reps. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) and Anthony C. Beilenson 
(D-Woodland Hills), all of whom support the bases. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly hosted a lunch at the members-only Capitol Hill Club, a Republican 
gathering spot, and the delegation reconvened for dinner with its Washington 
lobbyists and other advisers at a restaurant near the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 "The point of today is to make sure the (congressional) delegation knows our 
strategy and give them the information we've compiled," Flynn said. 
"Theoretically, this whole base closing process excludes the White House and 
Congress, but we're covering all our bases." 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody knows for sure whether a trip to Washington affects the base closure 
process a bit. Groups have come out here and lost their bases. Others have 
stayed home and survived. 
</P>
<P>
 One person who has listened to the community groups in the past is Jo Ann 
Miller, a former assistant secretary of the Air Force and Army. Now an aide to 
Gov. Pete Wilson, she is fighting to save California's bases. She says the 
group from Ventura County did the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "A community that does not make a visit would be at a disadvantage -- 
especially if there were erroneous information in any of the reports," said 
Miller, who spent 11 years in the Pentagon. "It's definitely worth the trip 
because once something gets in the report, you'd be hellbent on getting it 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 The trip winds up today with a meeting with staffers for the base-closure 
commission, the group that will submit the fateful list of proposed base 
closings to President Clinton next year. 
</P>
<P>
 When Congress gets the commission's recommendations, it can vote the entire 
list up or down but cannot tamper with individual bases, a change in the law 
designed to keep the process as free from political influence as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The ultimate decision has huge financial stakes for the county: The Navy 
funnels $1.5 billion a year into the two locations and employs about 20,000 
people.

SUSPECT IN FIRE STATION THEFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG RIPPEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Ventura County Fire Department supply clerk who had hoped to become a 
firefighter has been charged with breaking into eight stations since March to 
steal petty cash and other possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul F. Lopez, 34, of Oxnard could face up to eight years in prison if 
convicted in connection with the thefts, which frustrated detectives for months 
and caused the Fire Department to tighten security at stations from Simi Valley 
to the Rincon. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Kim Gibbons, who filed the complaint Wednesday charging 
Lopez with eight counts of burglary, reviewed reports of 15 fire-station 
break-ins that date back to October, 1993. Gibbons said they involved losses of 
about $2,000 in cash and several items -- cameras, compact disc players, 
videotapes, even sunglasses -- owned by firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 Most, if not all, of the possessions have been surrendered to authorities by 
Lopez or his attorney, Gibbons said. One item, a firefighter's buck knife, was 
recovered after a search warrant was served at the suspect's house more than a 
month ago, the prosecutor added. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, who has resigned from the department he had long sought to serve, is 
suspected of using secret access codes or master keys to enter stations that 
were vacated after 911 dispatchers received false-alarm calls -- at least three 
involving bogus motorcycle accident reports -- from nearby telephones. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives linked Lopez to the burglaries after viewing a surveillance tape 
that showed a man resembling him making a false accident report to a store 
clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ever since he was right out of high school, he wanted to be a firefighter," 
said Victor Salas Jr., Lopez's Oxnard-based attorney and a boyhood friend who 
had been a Cub Scout and Boy Scout with Lopez in Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 But because of a knee injury, Lopez was frustrated in his efforts to make the 
force, and he became, in Salas' words, "depressed . . . and that led him into 
trouble in getting back at (the) institution." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, who is married and has two daughters, had worked as a supply clerk for 
the Fire Department since May, 1989, after transferring from another county job 
that dated back to January, 1987. Contacted at home, Lopez declined to comment 
on the case. He is expected to appear in court Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Salas said his client denies taking any cash and added, "Everything he had 
taken, he'd kept. It was all at his house. He didn't attempt to sell it or 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the rash of burglaries, Battalion Chief Larry Whelan said, "I've been here 
for 30 years, and it's the first time I've ever seen this happen. Naturally, we 
feel betrayed. We do like to see (the department) as one big happy family." 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Rod Sims of Station 54 in Camarillo, which was broken into one night in 
August, said, "Personally, there were a lot of guys that were hurt by this. . . 
. When you live with and trust people like that, it becomes a real upsetting 
thing. But there was great relief when we found out (the suspect) wasn't an 
actual line-firefighter." 
</P>
<P>
 In a key piece of evidence, a surveillance video camera at a gas station 
convenience store in Thousand Oaks shows a man asking the clerk on March 11 to 
call 911 to report a motorcycle accident, Detective Stan Weber of the Ventura 
County Sheriff's Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 But there had been no such accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Just two blocks away, the fire crew at Station 31 responded to the 1 a.m. call 
and returned to their quarters about 15 minutes later. About $30 in food money 
was found to be missing the next morning, but -- as with all of the other 
burglaries -- there were no signs of forced entry into the station. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he originally targeted only one station a night, the thief soon began 
to slip into two or three stations an outing, typically making false-call 
reports from pay phones a short distance away, Weber said. 
</P>
<P>
 At midnight on Aug. 10, for example, Station 56 east of Mugu Rock was hit 
after receiving a false report of a motorcycle accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Station 25 on the Rincon was broken into after a bogus report of a trash 
bin fire at Faria Beach at 1:15 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Station 23 in Oak View was burglarized after a false report of a car accident 
at 2:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 In each case, the call was made from a phone close by -- less than a block 
away in the last theft. In neither case was the crew gone more than 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like somebody who knows the procedures on how to get into the 
stations," Weber said after becoming the lead investigator of the thefts. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, as a supply clerk and courier based in the department's warehouse in 
Ventura, routinely would take such materials as bandages, axes, fire hoses and 
safety clothing to any of the 30 stations throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 As such, he likely would have known the door-lock access codes used to enter 
the stations, said Battalion Chief Mark Sanchez of the department's Human 
Resource Division. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a very nice, very courteous person . . . very interested in becoming a 
firefighter," Sanchez said. "He always seemed very willing to please and to 
help." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the false alarms that lured firefighters into the night, Weber added, 
was one involving a gas leak, another a person having a heart attack and one 
involving a tennis player with a broken ankle at Borchard Park in Newbury Park.

'DECEMBER DILEMMA'; EDUCATION: SCHOOLS ADOPT MULTICULTURAL APPROACH TO 
CELEBRATIONS AS STUDENT POPULATION BECOMES MORE DIVERSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Children performing Hanukkah dances are sharing the stage with youngsters 
singing "White Christmas," as schools around Ventura County strive to celebrate 
religious holidays without emphasizing any one religion. 
</P>
<P>
 Aware that a growing number of county students come from families that are 
Jewish, Islamic or of other non-Christian faiths, schools are taking a more 
multicultural tack toward marking this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
 Christmas vacation is now called winter break. 
</P>
<P>
 Explicitly religious songs such as "The First Noel" are forbidden; secular 
ditties such as "Jingle Bells" are allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 And holiday performances are as likely to include Caribbean calypso music as 
American tunes about sleigh rides. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try very hard not to be sending religious messages," said Phil Parish, 
principal of Manzanita School in Thousand Oaks. "We don't do any of the 
traditional Christmas songs, not because it would be wrong but because we try 
to be more open-minded." 
</P>
<P>
 Or as Santa Rosa School Principal Pat Fitzgerald put it: "What we're really 
trying to do is give every kid a feeling of worth, a feeling of value. We don't 
want to obviously celebrate one side over the other." 
</P>
<P>
 But even this pluralistic approach can leave some children out in the cold. 
</P>
<P>
 Some religious traditions, such as those of Jehovah's Witnesses, have no 
holidays at this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
 Monty Murray, a presiding overseer of a Ventura congregation of Witnesses, 
said scholars generally agree that early European Christians established 
Christmas on Dec. 25 because the date corresponded to the pagan celebration of 
the winter solstice. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't recognize Christmas as Christ's birth because it isn't," Murray 
said. "The Christmas holiday in itself is based on a pagan festival." 
</P>
<P>
 So teachers know to give children of Witnesses alternatives to some 
traditional holiday activities. 
</P>
<P>
 While other youngsters are drawing pictures of Santa Claus or menorahs, 
children of Witnesses may be doing Native American-type crafts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's awkward for them," said Jeffrey Davies, principal of Blanche Reynolds 
School in Ventura. "Just the season is difficult. Everything they see on TV and 
everywhere else" has to do with Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Students whose families are Buddhist, Muslim, Jewish or from other 
non-Christian backgrounds also may feel left out of the seasonal fanfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Manzanita School has probably half a dozen students of the Islamic faith, 
Parish said. But the school has so far not come up with any songs or activities 
to commemorate Muslim religious observances, which fall at various times during 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We frankly haven't crossed that bridge yet," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Children who are not Christian may feel uncomfortably aware of being members 
of a minority at this time of year, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some kids feel pretty sensitive about not being Christian," said George 
Coyle, principal of Banyan School in Thousand Oaks. "Kids in general don't want 
to look different. There's all that peer pressure. They all want to look the 
same." 
</P>
<P>
 So, Coyle said, some Jewish children decline teachers' suggestions that they 
bring menorahs to class and give presentations on Hanukkah. 
</P>
<P>
 "We call it the 'December dilemma,' " said Rabbi Shimon Paskow of Temple Etz 
Chaim in Thousand Oaks. "With all the Christmas stuff, what do Jewish kids do? 
They feel kind of left out." 
</P>
<P>
 But Paskow said he has no qualms about schools commemorating Christian 
celebrations, as long as they also recognize Jewish holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 When Paskow's own daughter was attending school in Thousand Oaks, she came 
home one day singing "Merry Christmas" in Hawaiian -- a tune she learned from a 
teacher of Hawaiian descent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't bother me," Paskow said. "I thought it was cute. And now my 
daughter's a rabbi." 
</P>
<P>
 Adherents of Islam also have no problem with their children singing Christmas 
ditties or participating in other holiday activities at school, said Abdullah 
Dawoodjee, a member of the Islamic Center of the Conejo Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just don't want them to do it at home," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But some Christians lament the absence of traditional Christmas hymns, such as 
"Silent Night" or "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing" from school holiday programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to see Christian religious songs, the old carols," said Pastor 
Roger Nolan of East Ventura Foursquare Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan added, however, that he has no objection to including Hanukkah songs. 
"The Jewish thing's OK too." 
</P>
<P>
 Even while schools shun explicitly religious songs and symbols, many teachers 
use the Christmas theme as an opportunity to teach the Christmas spirit -- 
including such virtues as charity and generosity. 
</P>
<P>
 At Glenwood School in Thousand Oaks, Juan Bowen directs his first-graders 
every year in a play about a boy who is transformed into a snow boy when he 
tries to steal Santa's hat. The boy is freed from the spell only when he learns 
to say the magic words -- please and thank you.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the skit has a Christmas theme, Bowen said he has had Jewish children 
in the past who have acted in it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of leave it up to the kids," he said. "They know what they feel 
comfortable with." 
</P>
<P>
 At the other end of the spectrum are groups of mostly non-Jewish children 
performing traditional Jewish dances and folk songs. 
</P>
<P>
 A chorus of Manzanita School students, who gave separate performances this 
week for parents and children, did a rendition of the Jewish folk song 
"Do-Di-Li" as 10 children danced the hora. 
</P>
<P>
 And a fifth-grade class from Blanche Reynolds School sang and danced two 
Hanukkah songs before a crowd of hundreds at the Ventura High School 
auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 Some students in the class said that even though they are Christian, they 
enjoyed performing the Jewish songs and dances. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of like it," 10-year-old Shane Birchfield said. "It's like celebrating 
for other people." 
</P>
<P>
 Or as 11-year-old Joey Bowles put it: "You get to do stuff you never do."

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SUN VALLEY; POLICE SEIZE SLAYING SUSPECT IN SWEEP

<P>
 Los Angeles police arrested a 17-year-old gang member on suspicion of killing 
a North Hollywood youth in a drive-by shooting last month during an early 
morning sweep Thursday in Sun Valley, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager, who was not identified because of his age, was taken into 
custody at his mother's home in the 12300 block of Sheldon Street at 7:30 a.m.  
</P>
<P>
 Detective Mark Aragon of the LAPD's North Hollywood Division said the 
teen-ager, with no provocation, shot Omar Valdez, 17, of North Hollywood on 
Oct. 31 as he used a pay phone near his home. 
</P>
<P>
 Valdez was not a gang member, Aragon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other members of the same Sun Valley gang were arrested on outstanding 
warrants in the sweep. Francisco Deras, 20, of Sun Valley was arrested at the 
Sheldon Street address and was held at the North Hollywood Station in lieu of 
$15,000 bail, Aragon said. Deras was wanted on a charge of reckless discharge 
of a firearm. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Cota, 20, of Sun Valley was arrested at his home on a misdemeanor 
vandalism warrant and was released on $250 bail, Aragon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine locations were hit in the Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums, or 
CRASH, sweep Thursday, which included 50 investigators from the LAPD's Valley 
and West bureaus, Aragon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police recovered a loaded sawed-off shotgun in the murder suspect's bedroom 
and various gang paraphernalia at the other sites, including photos of the gang 
members, gang drawings and a list of gang members, Aragon said. JEANNETTE

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; SUSPECTED DRUG DEALER ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sheriff's narcotics officers said Thursday that they have arrested a longtime 
drug dealer who had nearly 75 customers in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas Ramirez, 31, was out on bail for an earlier narcotics arrest and on 
probation for a felony drug-dealing conviction when he was arrested Wednesday 
afternoon after a police chase, Sgt. Gary Pentis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez was driving away from a house where he had delivered drugs at about 1 
p.m. when he noticed that undercover police cars were following him, Pentis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez "put his foot into it," Pentis said, and deputies chased him at speeds 
of more than 70 m.p.h. along Pederson Road before several deputies could box 
his car in with theirs and arrest him. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez faces charges of selling methamphetamine and possessing cocaine and 
marijuana for sale, Pentis said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was ordered held at Ventura County Jail in lieu of $30,000 bail. MACK REED

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NEWPORT / COSTA MESA / IRVINE; COSTA MESA; CITY TO STUDY 
PARK FEES FOR NEW APARTMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM RAGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council is thinking about levying a developers fee on the 
construction of all new apartment complexes, with the revenue to be used to 
build more parks and recreation facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council, in a study session Monday, discussed the possibilities of 
levying the fee.City Atty. Thomas Kathe said that, before the council could 
adopt a fee, it would first have to prove that residents moving into new 
apartments increase the demand for parks and recreation facilities. The city 
already levies a development fee on single-family developments. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 60% of the residents of Costa Mesa live in apartments, and that's 
considered one of the highest percentages in the county, said Councilwoman 
Sandra L. Genis, who supports the fee idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Little League and soccer parents keep on telling us that 'We need more 
ball fields,' and 'Look at Irvine and Mission Viejo and all the greenbelts and 
open space they have,' " Genis said. "This fee would be a 
one-time-upon-construction thing." 
</P>
<P>
 But the proposed ordinance is just in the beginning stages and probably won't 
be voted on until further fee studies are conducted. The issue will be sent to 
the Planning Commission for its consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Joe Erickson also backs the proposed ordinances, saying "it's not fair" 
that home builders have to pay the fee and apartment developers currently do 
not. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's important that people recognize that single family homes are 
required to pay a park fee," Erickson said, "and people in rental units use the 
parks just as much as those living in single family homes." TOM RAGAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NEWPORT / COSTA MESA / IRVINE; NEWPORT BEACH; COUNCIL OKS 
PLAN FOR TACO BELL ON MARINER'S MILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOLLY J. WAGNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mariner's Mile will be the site of a Taco Bell restaurant in Newport Beach, 
despite the protests of a handful of residents who live on the bluff above the 
Pacific Coast Highway commercial zone. 
</P>
<P>
 An anonymous flyer distributed in the neighborhood failed to inspire more than 
a few residents to go to Monday's City Council meeting to voice an opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you value your personal safety, the security of your family and your 
property, you must act now! Before Taco Bell becomes your neighbor and the 
future of Mariner's Mile becomes Fast Food Restaurant Row," the flyer warned. 
It exhorted readers to call council members and go to the meeting to protest. 
</P>
<P>
 In at least one case, it backfired. Fullerton Avenue resident Jackie Ellis 
told the council: "Frankly, when I find flyers like this on the doorstep, I 
say, 'There goes my neighborhood.' It was left there by someone who didn't have 
the courage to put his name on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Kurt Yeager, whose home is directly above the restaurant site, said a 
fast-food stand would be a "black mark" on Mariner's Mile and lead to 
"permanent lesser uses." He criticized a carwash and lube shop as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Dunlap, executive director of the Cliff Haven Homeowners Assn., said the 
restaurant would invite noise and conflict, especially at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Bluff resident Chuck Daniels said he had persuaded the seller of his new home 
to put $15,000 of the selling price into escrow to construct a sound barrier if 
the restaurant created the need. 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell officials have contended they do not anticipate any problems at the 
restaurant but that, if any arise, they will work with neighbors to resolve 
them. They have met with residents over the past several months to attempt to 
ease concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning Director James Hewicker said such problems had not surfaced in the 22 
years since McDonald's put up its golden arches a half-mile up the highway. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 4 to 1 to approve the plan of Taco Bell to raze the vacant 
Malee's restaurant at 1400 W. Coast Highway, across from the Balboa Bay Club. 
Councilwoman Jean H. Watt was opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Norma Glover, who chaired the Planning Commission when the 
restaurant was initially approved, abstained from both discussions after a 
campaign opponent accused her of a conflict of interest. She denied having a 
conflict but said she would abstain because, "I do not want this council 
saddled with that perception." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Dennis D. O'Neil also abstained because one of his law partners had 
addressed the council on behalf of restaurant opponents, primarily residents of 
Kings Road. HOLLY J. WAGNER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; WARNER BROS. PLANS DOZEN NEW BUILDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE RYFLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Warner Bros. Studios has unveiled its plans to expand and consolidate its 
entertainment business operations in Burbank over the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The media industry giant hopes to build a dozen new office buildings, several 
new sound stages and other studio production facilities totaling nearly 5.8 
million square feet at both its main studio lot at 4000 Warner Blvd. and its 
so-called Ranch lot at 3701 Oak St. 
</P>
<P>
 "They presently have office space and production space in a lot of different 
locations, including Glendale and surrounding parts of Los Angeles, in 
buildings not owned by Warner Bros.," said Greg Herrmann, a project planner for 
the city of Burbank. "They would like to consolidate their operations here so 
they can be more efficient." 
</P>
<P>
 Just last month, Warner Bros. announced it would open its new feature 
animation division, which will employ up to 400 people, at an office building 
in Glendale. Studio officials said the expansion plan will help the studio 
avoid having to keep offices in surrounding areas and will bring more of the 
company's jobs into Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 "Warner Bros. has been a significant part of the Burbank economy and a major 
community employer for more than six decades. The master plan reconfirms our 
company's commitment to continuing that relationship," Dan Garcia, vice 
president of real estate planning, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The master plan is divided into two phases. A large portion of the proposed 
construction would occur during Phase 1, from 1995 through 2000, while the 
second phase of the work would be spread out over a longer period, from 2000 to 
2015. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed construction includes: 
</P>
<P>
 * Four 15-story office buildings on the main studio lot, plus three or four 
five-story office buildings. Five five-story office buildings are proposed on 
the Ranch lot. 
</P>
<P>
 * Demolition of about 400,000 square feet of existing buildings on the main 
lot and about 100,000 square feet of existing buildings on the Ranch lot. 
</P>
<P>
 * Construction of four parking structures on the main lot and one six-story 
parking structure on the Ranch lot. 
</P>
<P>
 * Construction of one sound stage on each lot. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said a consultant has been hired to prepare an environmental 
impact report on the master plan. A series of community meetings to gather 
opinions from affected residents, businesses and property owners will begin 
early next year. STEVE RYFLE

in contemporary society.

Fridays, and the other section will meet from 6:30 to 9:30 p.m. Thursdays. The

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; SANTA GIVES HIS REINDEER A DAY TO HIT THE HAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rudolph had the day off. Santa's helpers wore flight suits. And the four-ton 
sleigh was named "Whiskey Pop." 
</P>
<P>
 But for a sunny Southern California Santa, there was no better way to visit 
the 400 students at Gault Street Elementary School in Van Nuys on Thursday than 
aboard a helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little faster, and you get to see a lot more," said Santa, preparing 
to board the twin-engine Bell 412 helicopter at Van Nuys Airport. "With 
reindeer, you have to clean up behind them." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that trading in reindeer for rotor blades doesn't have its hazards. To 
complete Van Nuys Airport's annual school visit, Santa -- played by Bob 
Sironen, a 61-year-old airport electrician -- had to risk dangers that they 
just don't teach on the flight simulator at the North Pole. The first hazard -- 
potential decapitation -- came even before the helicopter took off. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you enter or exit a helicopter, go towards the front because of the 
spinning tail rotors," pilot Wes Hobbs told Santa and his entourage, which 
included Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck. 
</P>
<P>
 Unconsciously ducking their heads, the nine passengers hopped aboard the 
whining aircraft, which lifted off moments later as softly as an elevator in a 
posh hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 At an elevation of 3,000 feet, Santa gazed out the window at Lake Balboa, 
Ventura Boulevard and the Santa Monica Mountains above Encino as chief pilot 
Gary Yates waited for orders to arrive at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as Santa's thoughts seemed to drift off peacefully into the fluffy, white 
clouds, Yates sent a shudder through the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 "Remember the old days when people used to shoot at us?" Yates quipped to 
Hobbs, causing the jolly old elf to peer through his glasses for snipers on the 
ground below. 
</P>
<P>
 But nobody would dare shoot down St. Nick, Yates quickly reminded his 
passengers.  
</P>
<P>
 With calm restored aboard the aircraft, Yates dipped toward the school at 
nearly 150 miles an hour, coming to a perfect two-skid landing on the school 
playground that even Santa could not have pulled off with his sleigh. 
</P>
<P>
 A cheer erupted from the pupils as Santa stepped from the helicopter. Moments 
later, the world's favorite elf was embraced by dozens of little arms and more 
than a few questions about his mode of transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where are your reindeer?" asked 7-year-old Marshall Simmons, a second-grader. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to bring them when there's no snow," Santa quickly replied. 
</P>
<P>
 But most students had no quarrel with Santa's travel agent. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he brought the reindeer down now, they might be tired, and they've got to 
be ready for Christmas Eve," explained second-grader Nicole Burns, 7. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so excited," said fourth-grader Ryan Olsen, 10. "I've never been so 
close to a helicopter."  
</P>
<P>
 One student even had an explanation for Hobbs and Yates, dressed in their blue 
pilot suits. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're Santa's helpers," said fourth-grader Darryl Bonner, 10, of Van Nuys. 
"They're disguised so nobody else will know." JEFF SCHNAUFER

ON THE ISSUE: INFORMED OPINIONS ON TODAY'S TOPICS; SHOULD THE U.N.'S TROOPS 
STAY IN BOSNIA? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTONIO OLIVO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After months of deliberations over the merits of evacuating United Nations 
forces from Bosnia-Herzegovina, the United States and French defense ministers 
proposed a series of measures Monday, designed to make troops better able to 
fight against harassment by Serbian nationalists. 
</P>
<P>
 An example of such harassment occurred that same day, when a Bangladeshi 
armored car in Bihac was struck by two anti-tank missiles, killing one soldier 
and wounding three others. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack, the most serious strike against U. N. forces yet, was believed to 
have been launched by Croatian Serbs in northwest Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 The soldier's death marked the 133rd fatality since the U. N. began its 
peacekeeping role in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of an evacuation argue that the vacillating stance taken by the U. 
N. has contributed to the problem. A lifting of the U. N. arms embargo that has 
kept the Muslim-led Bosnian government from defending the country from heavily 
armed Serbs has been suggested as an alternative to the U. N.'s present role. 
</P>
<P>
 But, most of the U. N. forces are stationed in Serb-encircled enclaves, which 
makes them vulnerable to further attacks and hostage-taking if the Serbs fear 
that withdrawal will lead to the elimination of that embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 The peacekeepers could also face blockades from nervous civilians opposed to a 
U. N. pullout. 
</P>
<P>
 Should U.N. troops remain in Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
</P>
<P>
 Ram Roy, professor of political science, Cal State Northridge 
</P>
<P>
 "The decision to pull out was causing a lot of concern. The Muslim countries 
are now meeting in Morocco and will make a decision that will have an impact on 
the situation. If the U. N. were to have pulled out immediately, it would have 
affected its own image. The impression conveyed would have been that the U. N. 
is very weak, that an aggressor could frustrate U. N. attempts in a certain 
situation and it would walk away. The U. S. has been playing it safe for 
obvious reasons: The situation is not of vital interest to (the American 
public), and no President can afford to get involved in a civil war where the 
outcome is not clear. For these reasons, the situation has worsened." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Marija Miletic Dail of North Hollywood, an activist in Los Angeles' Croatian 
community 
</P>
<P>
 "The U. N. is not doing a good job there, so they should get out. As of late, 
they have proven to be the enemy of the little people and the friend of the 
aggressor. They are feeding the people there, but letting them get slaughtered. 
They've tied the Bosnian government's hands behind its backs and are letting 
the Serbs shoot. The few sacks of food they give are not enough to buy the 
tragedy that's happening there. They only need to lift the arms embargo. These 
people are itching to fight for themselves."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; ANNUAL LIGHTS PARADE SCHEDULED AT HARBOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The annual Parade of Lights is coming to Ventura Harbor on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The event, whose theme this year is "A Country-Western Christmas," begins at 3 
p.m. with country music and dance, pony rides, a petting zoo, face painting and 
strolling carolers, said Judy Amendola, the harbor's marketing director. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Pedal-Oar-Paddle Parade," featuring kayakers, rowboats, outriggers and 
any other human-powered vessels, strewn with lights and other decorations in 
honor of the season, starts at 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The Parade of Lights itself starts at 7 p.m. when about 35 boats of 20 and 70 
feet, also strung with lights, leave from the port district headquarters, sail 
through the harbor channels, then head for the Harbor Village, only to turn 
around and make the loop again. 
</P>
<P>
 For about 30 minutes, starting at 7 p.m., Santa Claus will also make his 
rounds in the sky, as a helicopter hauling St. Nick on his sleigh soars above 
the festival. CONSTANCE SOMMER

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COSTA MESA; LATINO STUDENT GROUP TO FILE APPEAL ON BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM RAGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Latino student organization that was temporarily broken up at Golden West 
College plans to file an appeal at the district level in an attempt to have the 
administration recognize the group again. 
</P>
<P>
 Ana Carbajal, a spokeswoman for the MEChA, the Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano 
de Aztlan, told the Coast Community College District board Wednesday night that 
the 20-member group should be reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
 The group was disbanded in March after the Golden West College administration 
discovered alcohol was present at one of the group's scholarship fund-raisers, 
which was held in the college cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
 A Sept. 1 sit-in was staged in the president's office to protest the 
administration's decision, and Carbajal, 28, Lupe Lopez, 21, and Claudia 
Rochin, 20, who handcuffed themselves to one another, were expelled from the 
district for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The group has denied serving alcohol and insists it had no control over the 
one non-member who brought a drink to the event. But the college administration 
disbanded the group, saying the only way it can get together again is if a new 
adviser and a new slate of officers are appointed -- something present members 
refuse to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't just go 'poof' and get rid of an organization that's been around 
for 24 years," Carbajal said after Wednesday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Carbajal said the college administration never provided evidence that the 
group was responsible for serving drinks. Carbajal said the college also failed 
to set up a hearing, which is their legal right under district policy for 
students who receive disciplinary action. 
</P>
<P>
 But the vice chancellor of the district, Gene Farrell, said the administration 
"has bent over backward" to ensure the group received due process. 
</P>
<P>
 "State law is very clear about no alcohol on community college campuses," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing on the appeal will be heard at the district's Jan. 25 meeting. TOM 
RAGAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; DEMOLITION PLANS FOR 'CASTLE' HOME RENEWED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A court-ordered compromise to prevent demolition of the Kron Street "castle" 
home of Haym and Fern Ganish appears to be unraveling. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ganishes missed a Dec. 9 deadline to submit new plans for completion of 
what has become a 12-year remodeling project.City officials sent the Ganishes a 
warning this week that their house would be demolished Jan. 3 unless they 
submit the plans and a $50,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city of Irvine is not making the decision to destroy the Ganishes' home," 
Irvine Mayor Michael Ward said. "That decision is being made by the Ganishes, 
by not meeting their deadlines." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ganishes have battled with city officials during the last 12 years over 
the start-and-stop remodeling of their home into a three-story, stone-covered 
house. City officials have alleged numerous safety code violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Fern Ganish pleaded no contest last month to safety code violations filed 
against her by the city. Her husband refused to be named in the compromise 
agreement, which gave her until Nov. 9, 1995, to complete the renovations. 
</P>
<P>
 But she said her attorneys, Robert Sainburg and John Barthrop, are now seeking 
court permission to withdraw from her case. She also said they have refused to 
return building plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Sainburg declined comment, and Barthrop did not return phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm at the point of a nervous breakdown," Fern Ganish said. "We're not 
criminals. I was basically forced into entering a no-contest plea." 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Joel D. Kuperberg said the city will move "vigorously" to tear down 
the home. RUSS LOAR

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 21-year-old Oxnard gang member was sentenced Thursday to 16 years to life in 
prison for his role in a fatal shooting at a Ventura motel last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaun Bolo received the mandatory sentence of 15 years to life for 
second-degree murder, plus one year for being armed with a gun.He pleaded 
guilty to the charges last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolo is the third defendant to be convicted in the Dec. 18, 1993, shooting of 
Paul Martinez, who was gunned down on the second-floor balcony of the Motel 6 
on Johnson Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Hidalgo, 20, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and is serving a 
sentence of 18 years to life. Naomi Honohan, a 20-year-old former Channel 
Islands High School cheerleader and honor student, received two years in prison 
for being an accessory to the murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Still awaiting trial are Bolo's brother, Willard, 23, who is charged with 
murder, and Alfonso Cortez, 21, accused of being an accessory to the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 All the defendants are members or associates of the same Oxnard gang, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said that Martinez, a Whittier resident, was shot after getting 
into an argument with Honohan, who was attending a party in a room at the 
motel. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaun Bolo drove the vehicle from which the fatal shots were fired, Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Matthew J. Hardy said. BARBARA MURPHY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; CABDRIVER ARRESTED IN ROBBERY ATTEMPT 
</P>

<P>
 An Oxnard cabdriver has been arrested on suspicion of attempting to rob a bank 
after the branch manager spotted him leaving the bank parking lot and police 
picked him up at his next stop, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police that the man entered the Bank of America on South A 
Street in Oxnard just before closing Wednesday.He approached a teller, 
pretended to have a weapon and demanded cash. But the teller told the suspect 
that she had already locked her cash drawer for the night, and the suspect 
left, Oxnard Sgt. Dan Christian said. 
</P>
<P>
 The branch manager, who was standing outside, saw the suspect leave the bank's 
well-lit parking lot in a Yellow Cab with a white hood, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 After bank officials contacted police, Christian drove to the cab company's 
offices, where an employee told him there was one cab with a white hood. 
</P>
<P>
 The employee also told Christian the same cabdriver would pick up his next 
fare on 5th Street in five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 When police arrived at the designated spot, they saw a cab with a white hood 
pulling away. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested Jan Louis Withers, 44, of Thousand Oaks, without incident 
after the bank teller identified him as the suspect, Christian said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't make any statements to us, he just professed his innocence," 
Christian said. 
</P>
<P>
 Withers was booked into County Jail, where he was being held Thursday in lieu 
of $50,000 bail. The case is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Withers' passengers, a woman and her daughter, waited in a patrol car until 
another cab arrived.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; PARENTS TO BE POLLED ON BASICS PLUS SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although Ventura school officials will make any final decisions about a 
back-to-basics school, district parents and teachers can give their opinions on 
the matter in a survey to be distributed in January. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura Unified School District board this week approved surveying all 
parents of children in kindergarten through fourth grade on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed school, which officials are calling Basics Plus, would have 
essentially the same curriculum as other district schools. Parents would have 
to volunteer at least 12 hours a month at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, they would have to sign a contract at the beginning of the year agreeing 
that their children would abide by school rules, including turning in homework 
promptly. 
</P>
<P>
 Children would also have to wear uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 A main purpose of the parent survey is to measure the level of interest in 
order to determine which neighborhood schools should be converted. 
</P>
<P>
 But none of the questions on the survey directly ask parents whether they want 
to convert their neighborhood school to the proposed magnet school. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the survey asks three questions: 
</P>
<P>
 * Are the parents interested in the Basics Plus School? 
</P>
<P>
 * Would they be willing to commute to another district school using their own 
transportation? 
</P>
<P>
 * Are they interested in the Basics Plus School but unable to provide 
transportation? 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Supt. Gerald Dannenberg said the district wants to determine how 
many parents would drive their children to the proposed school if it is not 
close to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials plan to decide by early February on a location for the 
proposed school. MAIA DAVIS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; L.A. MAN ARRESTED ON 2 COUNTS OF 
BURGLARY

<P>
 A commuter burglar who broke into two Simi Valley businesses before dawn 
Thursday was arrested as he headed home to Los Angeles, Simi Valley Police Sgt. 
Gordon Weeks said. 
</P>
<P>
 The crime matches a pattern Simi Valley detectives say is becoming familiar -- 
Los Angeles County thieves come to Simi Valley, rip off property or cars, and 
zip home along the Simi Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Armando Villanueva, 24, was booked at the Ventura County Jail in lieu of 
$20,000 bond on two counts of burglary, jail officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weeks said a shop owner at an industrial complex in the 200 block of Easy 
Street called police just after 4 a.m. to say he saw someone smash a window at 
a neighboring business and steal property from inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Dispatchers broadcast a description of the suspect and his car, and Officer 
Don Douglass arrested Villanueva several minutes later as he drove east on the 
freeway, Weeks said. 
</P>
<P>
 A clock and a watch reported stolen from Richard Evans Construction were found 
in Villanueva's car, but there was no sign of sewing machines that were 
reported stolen from a neighboring business, Weeks said. MACK REED

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; LOCKHEED PLAN CUTS VAPOR EMISSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Lockheed Corp. has modified its controversial plan for building a "vapor 
extraction system" that would emit potentially cancer-causing substances that 
had seeped into and contaminated soil at the firm's former B-1 plant site. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of pumping up to 40 pounds a day of vapors into the air as originally 
planned, the amount will be reduced to as little as 10 pounds a day, Lockheed 
representatives told the Burbank City Council on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The former aerospace giant is under state orders to remove contaminants left 
behind after 63 years of building military aircraft at the site, located at 
1705 Victory Place near Burbank Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed officials say the vapor extraction system of wells, pipes and 
charcoal filters is typically used by gas stations and dry cleaners, and is the 
most effective way to clean up the 90-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
 The level of emissions "is down so far (that) it's not unlike having a gas 
station or dry cleaners on that site," said William Sorenson, Lockheed's vice 
president of operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of pumping chemicals such as carbon tetrachloride, chloroform and 
methylene chloride into the air had raised a storm of protest from residents 
living nearby. Opponents of the project reserved judgment on the latest 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not their (Lockheed's) final position," said attorney David Casselman, 
who represents 350 residents who oppose the plan. "It does reflect a 
significant reduction in emissions. On that basis, we're somewhat optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to reducing the emissions, Lockheed officials say they are willing 
to pay for an independent agency to monitor the system constantly, among other 
things. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other developments Tuesday, City Treasurer Jim Rogers reassured the 
council that municipal funds were unaffected by the financial crisis in Orange 
County.  
</P>
<P>
 Council members also identified three projects they are determined to find 
funding for under the five-year Capital Improvement Program: construction of a 
new Buena Vista Library, refurbishment of McCambridge Park and building a 
roller hockey rink. VIVIEN LOU CHEN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: PLACENTIA / YORBA LINDA; NEW PRESIDENT CHAIRS FISCAL 
FALLOUT MEETING

 Craig Olson's habit of questioning even routine expenditures will be given a 
workout as he takes over as president of the Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified 
School District Board of Trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 The board unanimously elected Olson at the beginning of Tuesday night's 
meeting, and he proceeded to lead a meeting filled with questions and concerns 
about how Orange County's bankruptcy would affect district finances. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting could well be an indication of what Olson will face throughout his 
term, as the district grapples with the fallout from its decision to borrow $50 
million to place into the county's beleaguered investment pool.  
</P>
<P>
 Olson was first elected to the board in 1992. Although he generally votes with 
the majority of the board, Olson frequently requires far more explanation for 
so-called "routine" expenditures than is normally presented to the board by 
district staff. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also reluctant to relinquish board control of the district's finances, 
and last July he and trustee Jerry Brakebill voted against giving the 
superintendent authority to settle claims of up to $50,000 against the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson said he is aware that the coming year could be pivotal for the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am concerned about the challenges we have in the coming year," Olson said. 
"It's mostly about wanting to come up with right solutions. I've always felt 
money should be spent in the classroom for the benefit of kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Also at the meeting, the board elected Brakebill as vice president and Karin 
M. Freeman as clerk. Freeman and Cathy Ann Brooks both took the oath of office, 
but it was just for show. They had been sworn in at an emergency board meeting

 The amount of trash entering Orange County landfills has steadily declined 
since 1989, according to the county's Integrated Waste Management Department. 
The decline occurred because most cities have adopted successful recycling 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, residents and businesses are putting out less trash because they 
were making fewer purchases due to the recession, officials said. It's only 
recently that the economy has shown signs of improving. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993-94, the amount of trash taken to the county's four landfills was 1.3 
million tons less than in 1988-89. This should be good news to cities that are 
anxious to comply with a state law that requires a 25% reduction in the volume 
of trash dumped in landfills by 1995. Today

<P>
 "Music of Many Lands" is the theme of the 32nd annual Cruise of Lights in 
Huntington Harbour. Narrated boat rides through the harbor to view the bright 
and festive decorated homes will continue tonight through Dec. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets are $8.50 and $9.50 for adults and $5 for children. 
</P>
<P>
 The event is sponsored by Huntington Harbour Philharmonic Committee. Proceeds 
go toward music education programs throughout Orange County. Information: (714)

<P>
 A conference commemorating the 25th anniversary of the foundation of Chicano 
studies departments at colleges and universities throughout the state will take 
place today at Rancho Santiago College. 
</P>
<P>
 Highlighting the event will be workshops on Chicano studies in the past and 
future, discussion on the aftermath of Proposition 187 and presentations on 
community organizing and how to start Chicano clubs on high school and college 
campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have struggled for 25 years to implement Chicano studies at colleges and 
universities and the conference is a celebration and reminder to keep 
struggling," said Seferino Garcia, executive director of Solevar Community 
Development Corp., a nonprofit Latino empowerment group helping to organize the 
conference. "The true history of this land must be taught in schools and it can 
be done by learning Chicano" literature, art and other disciplines, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the speakers addressing the conference: Rancho Santiago Community 
College District Trustee Enriqueta Ramos, author Rudy Acuna, historian Ernesto 
Vigil, Chicano studies professors Adolfo Ortega, Jose Lopez and Susie Rodriguez 
and high school and college MEChA (Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan) 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference, free and open to the public, begins at 3 p.m. The college 
campus is at 1530 W. 17th St., Santa Ana. A dance, from 9 p.m. to midnight in 
the Johnson Center building, will conclude the event. MIMI KO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; RESIDENTS PICKET PLANNED TOPLESS BAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 300 residents, including entire families, on Thursday picketed the site 
on Garden Grove Boulevard where a topless bar is under construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel this is wrong for our neighborhood," said David Nelson, who was 
carrying his blanket-wrapped 5-month-old boy, while his wife, Kathy, took care 
of their 2-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will contribute to more crime in our neighborhood," Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The protest was organized by the Traditional Values Coalition of Westminster, 
which is opposing plans of the Santa Fe Realty Corp. to convert a closed 
nightclub near a neighborhood into a bar that would feature women in bikini 
bottoms. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, the City Council denied Santa Fe Realty a building permit to 
construct the bar. But the company sued in federal court and contended that its 
First Amendment rights were denied. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Laughlin E. Waters granted the company a temporary permit 
to begin construction. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 "The opposition against this thing is just mind-boggling," said Mayor Charles 
V. Smith, who joined the protesters Thursday. "The people have the right to 
enjoy their homes without their neighborhood being degraded." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Charmayne S. Bohman, who also joined the protest, said: "I think 
it (bar) does not belong here. The community doesn't want it." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Martin, who will manage the bar if it opens, said the council is "feeding 
false information to the people." 
</P>
<P>
 "We won't have a nude bar, just topless girls," Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that he had complied with city parking, landscaping and zoning 
regulations, but has been denied a building permit because the council does not 
want an adult business in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel it's all political, " he said. "There will be another election in two 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 But residents said that they are determined to stop the bar from opening and 
will continue their protest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to stop it in its tracks," said Katie Mulherin, 69, who has lived in 
the neighborhood for more than 25 years. "Even if we don't win, we'll put up a 
good fight." 
</P>
<P>
 Another demonstrator, Rhiannon Soverns, 17, said: "This is full of profanity. 
We are in a good neighborhood and we don't want to bring this in here." BERT

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LAGUNA HILLS; A WORLD OF THEIR OWN IS IN STORE FOR 
CHILDREN 
</P>

<P>
 The City Council has unanimously approved a plan to open a children's 
recreation and education center in the empty Laguna Farms market at Moulton 
Parkway and La Paz Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12,000-square-foot Planet Kids center will offer computers, a music room, 
an arcade, a sandbox, arts and crafts, and party rooms for children ages 13 or 
younger. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds like an exciting use of that property," said Councilwoman Melody 
Carruth. "If Planet Kids can fulfill even half of its promises, I would like to 
be under 13." 
</P>
<P>
 "Planet Kids fills a need that our community has had," added Councilman Randal 
J. Bressette. "There is a demand for activities for our kids to be involved 
in." 
</P>
<P>
 Planet Kids is a proposal by Lion Country Safari, the Irvine company that runs 
Camp Frasier, a children's day camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Planet Kids is planned to accommodate up to 250 children at a time. All must 
be signed in and out by parents, who will be given beepers for notification in 
case of emergency. A three-hour time limit will ensure that Planet Kids isn't 
used as a baby-sitting service. 
</P>
<P>
 Planet Kids will be open seven days a week from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. and will 
include a dining area. No admission fee has been determined. 
</P>
<P>
 Planet Kids will also offer a big-screen TV for youth athletic teams to show 
videos of their games during team banquets. LYNN FRANEY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: TUSTIN; SANTA-COP EVENT TO TREAT NEEDY FAMILIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twenty needy families will be treated to a holiday party at City Hall tonight 
by the Tustin Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual Santa-Cop event is supported by city employees and the local 
community.Officer Jeff Singleton said this may be the only celebration many of 
the families will have during the holiday season. The families are selected by 
the department. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we get in homes where we see a family isn't going to have much of a 
Christmas, we ask them if they want to join the party," Singleton said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the party, children ages 12 and younger will receive gifts donated by city 
employees, local companies and Tustin residents. There will also be 
refreshments and giveaways of books, food baskets and Christmas trees. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, children will be invited to have their pictures taken with Santa 
Cop. Santa will arrive in a police car, Singleton said, while party-goers are 
caroling outside City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing with Santa will be the storybook character "Clifford the Dog." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fun program," said Singleton, who works with Tustin schoolchildren 
through the Police Department's Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE) program. 
"It's a little bit heart-wrenching sometimes to see these kids. When they get 
their gifts they're just so happy." 
</P>
<P>
 "Some don't open their gifts at the event," he added. "That way they'll have 
something to open on Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 Singleton said the department is only able to accommodate 20 families. Names 
of additional needy families are compiled by the city, Singleton said, "and we 
put them in touch with people who would like to help out." 
</P>
<P>
 Additional information is available from Singleton at (714) 573-3294.ALAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ORANGE; RESIDENTS SHOW ANGER OVER INVESTMENT CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mayor Joanne Coontz assured residents this week that "the city is not going to 
go broke" and that the City Council will have a plan in place by January to 
deal with the bond crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 But her speech failed to soothe angry residents Tuesday who asked why the city 
had not done more sooner to pull its $28 million out of the county's pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the speakers alluded to minutes from an April, 1994, council meeting 
quoting Coontz as being uneasy about the city's investment policies and, 
specifically, about the $33 million the city had in the pool then. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Nick Lall suggested that the entire council resign because members 
failed to follow their own investment policy, which does not allow speculation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why don't you save us all a recall effort and resign right now," Lall told 
the council members. "The city investment committee has failed miserably and 
the City Council has failed miserably in following (its) policy." 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager David F. Dixon said the city had reduced the city's investment in 
the fund to $28 million. He conceded that the city had borrowed $8.7 million to 
invest in the pool as late as July. He noted that the city previously had 
benefited from high returns, and that county treasurer's reports on the pool 
had been "glowing." 
</P>
<P>
 "We can point fingers, but I've always been told that if you point one finger, 
three more will point back at you," Dixon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Alice Clark pointed a finger at Councilman Mike Spurgeon, who is also 
chief of staff in Supervisor William G. Steiner's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Councilman Spurgeon should step down immediately," Clark said. "Many 
citizens of Orange have had a serious problem with the fact that Councilman 
Spurgeon now works for the county of Orange, as well as serving as one of our 
councilman. It is no longer good enough to deny that there is any legislation 
which would prevent such double-job activities." 
</P>
<P>
 Spurgeon later said that Clark was trying to "hang me with the county 
bankruptcy." 
</P>
<P>
 "I run Steiner's staff," he said. "I don't run Steiner. Nor do I run the Board 
of Supervisors." 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon, meanwhile, said residents should expect no immediate impacts but that 
the staff was working on worst-case and best-case scenarios. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city will pay its bills, we have a positive cash flow, we are not 
declaring bankruptcy," Dixon said. "We are going to carry on the services of 
this city in a manner that is acceptable. . . . It is not going to be an easy 
road and it may take several years to overcome this problem," he said. LESLEY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; RESIDENT COMPLAINS ABOUT PIGEONS AT PIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS LOAR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Council members turned their attention away from the county's fiscal 
crisis for a few moments Monday night to consider another threat to the beach 
community -- pigeons. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're like flying rats," warned retired pipe-fitter John Stamps, speaking 
to council members."People may laugh about that, but they carry many diseases." 
</P>
<P>
 Stamps, a 25-year Seal Beach resident who said he walks the city pier every 
day, said the feeding of birds around the beach area has created a public 
nuisance. He urged city officials to enforce the ordinance against feeding 
birds near the pier area by posting signs and ticketing violators. 
</P>
<P>
 Bird enthusiasts also have clogged up the water fountain on the pier to 
accommodate their feathered friends, according to Stamps. "It's like that movie 
('Field of Dreams'). You feed the birds and the birds will come." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite some laughter from those attending the City Council meeting, council 
members took Stamps' concerns seriously, directing City Manager Jerry L. 
Bankston to explore the cost of posting one or more signs to warn that bird 
feeding near the pier is prohibited. Bankston confirmed that a city ordinance 
outlaws the practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman William J. Doane said sea gulls, not pigeons, belong at the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am somewhat of an ornithologist," Doane said. "Pigeons are not indigenous 
to beach towns. They are here only because of the food. If we stop the food, 
the pigeons will go away." RUSS LOAR

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; PANEL DELAYS VOTE ON REMOVAL OF OAK TREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Regional Planning Commission has indefinitely postponed 
a vote on whether to allow the developer of Ahmanson Ranch to cut down 10 oak 
trees along Thousand Oaks Boulevard in Calabasas to make way for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "The commission wants to study the issue some more," said Richard Frazier, a 
regional planner for the county. "There are some additional legal issues that 
need to be looked at." 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson Land Co., the developer, wants to widen the road and extend it from 
Calabasas north into Ventura County. The road would be a major artery to 
Ahmanson's planned mini-city in the Simi Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County officials need to study, among other issues, whether the 
rulings would be impacted by the proposed annexation of Mountain Gate, an 
exclusive, unincorporated community, to the city of Calabasas, Frazier said. 
The widened road would go through an area near Mountain Gate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission, which was to have voted on the oak tree matter 
Wednesday, asked county counsel to study the legal issues and report back, 
Frazier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson Land wants to build 3,050 homes, two golf courses and 400,000 square 
feet of commercial space in a hilly area southeast of Simi Valley near the 
border of Los Angeles County. The project has met fierce resistance from area 
residents, who say it would disrupt their neighborhoods. Several communities 
have filed lawsuits to stop it. 
</P>
<P>
 The developers say they have minimized the impact of the project on neighbors. 
The development, Ahmanson officials add, will benefit the environment by 
preserving open space, and will help the economy of the area by bringing in $1 
million a year in sales taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents of Mountain Gate want their community to be annexed to 
Calabasas, believing that would help protect them from encroachment from the 
Ahmanson development. There will be a hearing on the matter at Calabasas City 
Hall at 7:30 p.m. Jan. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related matter, the city has begun to process Ahmanson Land's application 
to extend Las Virgenes Road north 15 feet to the Ventura County line. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in the process of reviewing their application," said Steve 
Quintanilla, an attorney representing Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the second time that the developer has had to apply for permits to 
extend the road. The city ruled that the company's first application for an 
encroachment permit was incomplete because Ahmanson did not also apply for a 
conditional-use permit. 
</P>
<P>
 A conditional-use permit is required because the proposed extension would run 
through the Las Virgenes Road Scenic Corridor, according to city officials. The 
city has informed Ahmanson Land that it must conduct another study to determine 
what impact the extension would have on the environment, Quintanilla said.

CURTAIN RAISER; AHMANSON THEATRE REDEDICATED AFTER YEARLONG RENOVATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a $17.1-million renovation, the Ahmanson Theatre at the Los Angeles 
Music Center was rededicated Thursday with the blessings of a long line of 
dignitaries including the Phantom of the Opera himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The voice of Robert Guillaume, one of the actors who played the Phantom at the 
Ahmanson, greeted the event's 500 guests at the beginning of the rededication 
ceremony with a plea to free him from "the miserable din of jackhammers" that 
accompanied the renovation. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, dressed in black tie, Guillaume and his "Phantom" co-star, Dale 
Kristien, sang "All I Ask of You" from the "Phantom" score while perched on a 
gently swaying construction bridge above the stage. Then Guillaume descended to 
the stage to call forth a shower of purple and gold ribbons that dropped from 
above. The ribbons were promptly snipped by a row of county supervisors and 
other civic and arts leaders, officially rededicating the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ahmanson had been criticized since its opening in 1967 for its lack of 
intimacy and poor acoustics. In September, 1993, after the long run of "The 
Phantom" ended, the theater was closed for a massive reconfiguration. Balconies 
were thrust inward on a curving line, and six boxes were erected on each of the 
side walls. The ceiling was lowered and covered with new acoustical paneling, 
the backstage was expanded, and mobile dividers were installed in the balconies 
to decrease seating for shows that require more intimacy. The theater now can 
accommodate audiences from 1,300 to nearly 2,100. 
</P>
<P>
 The lobby and forecourt were also altered, but the forecourt was not yet open 
Thursday. A few finishing touches yet to be completed inside the hall also were 
apparent to the invitation-only audience. There was no carpet in the front 
section of the orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the show went on. As the guests arrived at the rear of the theater, 
they were seated on the stage, facing the dropped curtain. Then, as a taiko 
drummer heralded the event, the curtain rose and lights went up on the 
renovated interior, prompting loud applause. 
</P>
<P>
 Performers -- many of them from the Music Center's resident companies -- were 
stationed throughout the hall and performed musical selections, danced or 
declaimed Shakespeare for the crowd. The Shakespearean actors included Charlton 
Heston, John Lithgow, Lynn Redgrave, David Dukes, Penny Fuller, Jane Carr and 
John Vargas. Some of their lines had been slightly edited to include references 
to the Ahmanson, which drew appreciative chuckles. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Lula Washington, whose Los Angeles Contemporary Dance Theatre 
members filled the aisles, drew laughter when, in a prayer on behalf of the new 
theater, she asked "the Heavenly Father" to "fill each seat, each night." 
</P>
<P>
 Halfway through the program, the audience moved from the stage into the 
orchestra section, guided by Guillaume's Phantom voice, urging the crowd not to 
worry -- the show's famous descending chandelier was gone.

3 SUPERVISORS GIVING RAISES TO CHARITIES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Getting into the holiday spirit, the majority of the Los Angeles County Board 
of Supervisors said Thursday they would donate their new $3,000 raises to 
charities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors salaries are tied to those of Superior Court judges, 
which are scheduled to be increased 3% to $107,000 starting Jan. 1.

 As they did last year, Supervisors Gloria Molina, Mike Antonovich and Yvonne 
Brathwaite Burke said they will donate their pay increases to several local 
charities. Supervisor Deane Dana, who gave away his annual pay raise last year, 
could not be reached for comment Thursday on what he intends to do with the 
latest salary increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Newly elected Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, who campaigned on a pledge to bring 
fiscal conservatism to the Hall of Administration, has not decided whether he 
will accept the raise. 
</P>
<P>
 "He will decide before it takes effect," said Joel Bellman, a Yaroslavsky 
spokesman. As a City Council member last year, Yaroslavsky gave away a raise to 
several charities.

TAXI FIRM WINS APPROVAL TO ABSORB 250 'BANDIT' CABS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Bell Cab Co., which recently agreed to pay a $40,000 fine to settle 
charges of campaign money laundering, received approval Thursday to absorb 250 
illegal "bandit" cabs, a move that will make it the largest operating taxi firm 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The city Transportation Commission voted unanimously to allow Bell Cab to more 
than triple its 100-car operation by taking in drivers from the Union de 
Taxistas Independientes, a group of unlicensed Latino cabbies. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners said the decision will reduce the city's bandit cab problem by 
putting the illegal cabs under the city's authority. The action comes two weeks 
before a new state law gives city officials the power to impound the cabs of 
unlicensed drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission voted at a hearing in which it was also scheduled to consider 
penalizing Bell Cab for making illegal campaign contributions totaling $10,500 
to City Council members and candidates in 1990 and 1991. The penalty hearing, 
however, was postponed a month. 
</P>
<P>
 The contributions were made at the same time that the firm was trying to 
obtain a lucrative city permit to operate at Los Angeles International Airport. 
In July, 1990, the council gave Bell Cab the permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell Cab admitted in October to 54 counts of campaign money laundering and 
agreed to pay a $40,000 fine under a settlement with the city Ethics 
Commission.

LITTLE ENTREPRENEURS PLAN ON BIG BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If she can pull it off, it will be a major achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 But things have a way of working at Junior Achievement -- the venerable 
entrepreneurial program for kids that has turned hundreds of thousands of 
teen-agers into successful adult business people, says Kathryn J. Whitmire. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Houston mayor is the newly named head of the 75-year-old 
international organization that hopes to double the number of pint-size 
capitalists in Los Angeles over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 And if Southern California's recession isn't over by then, Junior Achievement 
graduates may be in a position to help put an end to it, Whitmire suggested 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitmire, 48, was in Century City for a dinner honoring longtime Junior 
Achievement supporter Lodwrick Cook, retiring chairman of Arco. Earlier, she 
met with junior entrepreneurs at Monte Vista Street Elementary School in 
Highland Park.  
</P>
<P>
 Fourth-graders there were mapping strategies to find raw materials for their 
yo-yo business. A few classrooms away, fifth-graders were practicing job 
interview techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 Putting youngsters to work with hands-on activities like those helps teach 
economics to schoolchildren as young as 5, Whitmire said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to let young people know about new career opportunities, not just the 
one major industry in their community that they might be familiar with," she 
said, pointing to the shriveling defense industry that for half a century was 
the dominant business force in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Classroom entrepreneurial lessons are taught by volunteers trained by Junior 
Achievement to help youngsters "stay focused on the need to stay in school" as 
well as think of future careers, Whitmire said. By the sixth grade, Junior 
Achievement students are knowledgeable about global economics. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it started in 1919 as an after-school program for Massachusetts high 
school students, Junior Achievement expanded four years ago to include pupils 
as young as kindergartners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids start making life decisions at about the third grade -- 'Am I going to 
drop out of school? Am I going to join a gang?' " said Allen Kirtley, president 
of Junior Achievement's Southern California chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 Local businesses fund the program. And local businessmen traditionally have 
been the volunteers who run the 12-week, hourlong sessions now offered each 
semester at 425 Southern California schools. 
</P>
<P>
 But the program has begun recruiting college students, parents and retirees to 
beef up its corps of "consultants," as adult leaders are called. About 2,000 
volunteers assist 62,000 children; an additional 1,000 adults will be needed if 
the Los Angeles-area program is to reach its goal of nearly doubling in size by 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitmire -- who as a Houston 11th-grader belonged to a student-run Junior 
Achievement "company" that manufactured can openers -- was mayor at a time when 
that city became more diversified and came out of a 1980s recession. 
</P>
<P>
 A wider economic base also will help Los Angeles out of its 1990s funk, she 
suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in a more competitive environment now," she said. "This is a time to 
focus on preparing the work force for the future."

NUMBER OF L.A. WELFARE RECIPIENTS LEVELS OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The number of people on welfare in Los Angeles County, which has more than 
doubled since mid-1989, appears to have stopped rising -- an indication that 
the region is finally beginning to emerge from the recession, economists and 
welfare experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 But they warned that although the welfare rolls appear to have stabilized, 
they have done so at a very high level. One in five county residents -- more 
than 1.86 million people -- receive welfare payments or similar government 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 That is more than twice as many as five years ago, but fewer than in May, when 
the long rise finally peaked. 
</P>
<P>
 "The leveling-off is at crisis proportions," said Michael Dear, a geography 
professor at USC and co-author of the book "Malign Neglect: Homelessness in an 
American City." 
</P>
<P>
 If the economy continues to improve, the number of people on welfare is 
expected to shrink dramatically because the driving force behind the growth of 
the rolls is the recession -- not recipients' unwillingness to work, said 
Madeleine Stoner, a professor of social work at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 But Stoner and other experts say that even if the economy booms, the rolls may 
never decline all the way to pre-recession levels for several reasons, 
including:  
</P>
<P>
 * The years-long drop in the availability of manufacturing jobs for unskilled 
laborers, referred to as the "structurally unemployed." Welfare may be the only 
recourse for them or their children. 
</P>
<P>
 * The aging of the population. Counter to the overall trend in the county, the 
number of elderly and disabled people who receive welfare benefits known as 
in-home supportive services continues to rise. 
</P>
<P>
 * The influx of illegal immigrants. They are ineligible for most benefits 
except prenatal and emergency medical care, but their children who are U.S. 
citizens qualify for Aid to Families With Dependent Children. Data on the 
percentage of welfare recipients who are children of illegal immigrants was not 
available. But county welfare officials said that 157,399 illegal immigrants 
received Medi-Cal benefits in October -- 25% of the total number of Medi-Cal 
recipients that month. 
</P>
<P>
 * The increasing number of women, particularly teen-agers, who give birth to 
children out of wedlock and then depend on government assistance to support 
themselves and their offspring. The rate of children born to single women in 
California has risen dramatically in the last 33 years. In 1970, about 13% of 
all children were born out of wedlock. Last year, more than 35% of births in 
the state were to unmarried mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The rate was even higher, 70%, among women under 20 -- the group most likely 
to turn to welfare and stay on it the longest -- said Werner Schink, chief of 
research for the California Department of Social Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Declining unemployment rates are another sign that regional economy may be on 
the rebound, long after the recovery in the rest of the nation. "We've dug a 
deep hole and it will take us awhile to get out of it," First Interstate Bank 
economist Adrian Sanchez said. "But the encouraging thing about all these 
indications, including the welfare rolls, is that they seem to suggest that the 
economy has bottomed out." 
</P>
<P>
 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) Welfare Cases Leveling Off 
</P>
<P>
 In March, 1989, the number of people on welfare began to rise steadily. The 
trend continued, with minor fluctuations, until May of this year. Since then, 
it has leveled off.

 Los Angeles Raiders defensive end Anthony Smith gave a lot of kids something 
to cheer about Wednesday, when he passed out 300 tickets to an upcoming NFL 
football game to youngsters in Universal City. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith is a mentor ambassador for the Los Angeles City Housing Authority's 
youth mentor program. The kids, ages 8 through 14, were bused in from Watts, 
Pacoima, Culver City and Rancho San Pedro.  
</P>
<P>
 Substituting for the Raiderettes were the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, who 
gave a special performance for the children at Universal Amphitheatre. The 
housing authority's program matches kids enrolled in the city's youth gang and 
drug diversion program with volunteer adult role-models. TIM MAY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: NEW LAW REQUIRES LANDSCAPED YARDS 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying they want to avoid the presence of unsightly yards in the city, members 
of the Camarillo City Council voted this week to adopt regulations that would 
give residents a year to landscape their properties or face civil fines. 
</P>
<P>
 Voting unanimously Wednesday, the council amended the city's zoning code by 
requiring homeowners to landscape any front and side yards that are visible 
from public sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 Violators will face fines ranging from $100 to $1,000 depending on the number 
of citations issued. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthew Boden, Camarillo's director of planning and community development, 
said there are approximately 11,000 detached single-family homes in the city 
that would come under the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 New owners of homes in recently built tracts would have one calendar year from 
the time their utility services were hooked up to comply with the law. All 
other homeowners in the city would have a year from the time the amended zoning 
code becomes effective Feb. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Boden said homeowners violating the proposed ordinance would be issued several 
warnings before being given a citation and fine. J.E. MITCHELL

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: EX-COUNCIL MEMBER NOW HELPS ELDERLY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Helping women turn longer lives into better lives is the goal of Ventura's 
Pati Longo, a statewide advocate for elderly women. 
</P>
<P>
 Longo, 67, is one of 39 representatives across the country for the Women's 
Initiative, a decade-long effort of the American Assn. of Retired Persons to 
address the economic, social, health and long-term care needs of elderly women. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Ventura city councilwoman travels throughout California and the 
United States lecturing and presenting workshops on issues such as economic 
security and breast cancer. A volunteer, she receives no pay but does get 
reimbursed for expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Poverty among women prompted Longo to become involved with AARP nearly 11 
years ago. According to the group, women represent nearly three-fourths of the 
elderly poor, with one-third of older single women relying on Social Security 
for at least 90% of their income. 
</P>
<P>
 Longo said women of her generation in particular believe that their husbands 
will take care of their financial futures. She said very few older women know 
the details about wills, pensions, credit, taxes and other money matters. And 
many work in jobs that don't offer benefits or work part time and thus have 
little to save toward retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Illness exacerbates the situation, Longo said. Since many women are unable to 
afford supplemental health insurance they avoid going to doctors or don't take 
the prescribed dosage of medication. "Many times it is a choice between 
medicine and food," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such concerns led Longo and other community volunteers to organize the Women's 
Financial Information Program several years ago. The eight-week seminar, held 
at Ventura College, gives older women information on topics such as investing, 
care-giving, Social Security and drawing up wills. 
</P>
<P>
 A gubernatorial appointee to the California Commission on Aging, Longo also 
serves as chairwoman of the Area Agency on Aging and with the Long-Term Care 
Ombudsman Program of Ventura County and the Elder Abuse Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Through her work on the council she has found abuse to be a critical problem 
in Ventura County.  
</P>
<P>
 "Seniors are abused not only physically but financially and mentally," Longo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that while nursing home abuse has been well publicized, seniors often 
as not face abuse from family members who deprive them of food or medical care 
or try to coerce them to sign over their assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Longo said local advocates for seniors would like to establish a home where 
abused seniors can go "for a cooling off period" -- similar to a battered 
women's shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the problems of elderly women concern her, Longo has a refreshingly 
positive outlook on aging in this society where many women try to conceal their 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Growing old is really a wonderful experience," Longo said. "All this wisdom, 
all this experience, all these things you can apply to your daily life." JAN

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: SALON REMINDS KIDS THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL

<TEXT>
<P>
 About the last thing you would have expected to see in this high-tech, 
upscale, black-and-chrome atmosphere was a vanload of teen-agers. But there 
they were.  
</P>
<P>
 At Estetica Salon in Tarzana, these 11- to 17-year-olds arrived Wednesday 
night, six or eight at a time, from Sylmar's Hathaway Children's Services, a 
long-term residence for children with the kinds of backgrounds, problems and 
abuse that most of us would rather not think about. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last 10 Decembers, Hathaway residents, ages 5 to 18, have been taken 
to Tarzana for shampoos, cuts, styling, manicures, makeup -- in other words, 
general make-overs.  
</P>
<P>
 This unnamed program is the brainchild of stylist Dan Fierstein. Begun in 1984 
when Fierstein owned his own salon, it was inspired by cut-and-comb-out 
conversations with Fierstein's client, Laurie Singman, an avid Hathaway 
fund-raiser and member of the agency's board of directors.  
</P>
<P>
 For the first six years, Fierstein and his staff volunteered one evening each 
December to brighten the holidays for these children. After he closed his salon 
and moved across the street to Estetica, he approached owner Tony McCourt about 
continuing the program. McCourt readily agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen stylists, two manicurists and two makeup artists stood at the ready 
with brushes, blow dryers, nail polish and eye shadow Wednesday night. The 
first van arrived at 6 p.m., unloading four teen-age girls. One headed straight 
for the makeup chair, two to the shampoo room and the fourth to a manicure 
table. 
</P>
<P>
 By 6:15, the next van had arrived carrying six boys. By 7 p.m., this softly 
lighted, usually sedate salon had more than 20 teens peering anxiously over the 
stylists' shoulders, high-fiving each other's new looks, taking furtive peeks 
in the mirror, picking holiday nail colors or looking pleased, but slightly 
embarrassed, by the professional makeup jobs.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great experience," McCourt said. "They come in looking a little scared 
and 30 minutes later, they're hanging on your arm. It's wonderful!" 
</P>
<P>
 For the male members of the group, the step cut, the fade and the tail were 
this year's preferences. The female clients were less exacting, leaving some 
decisions to the stylists -- with one proviso: Don't cut off too much!  
</P>
<P>
 Said Fierstein: "I believe in putting back. My trade has been very good to me. 
I think everybody has something they can do to help others and the payback is 
great -- we get much more than we give."  
</P>
<P>
 While that may be true, this well-mannered and appreciative group seemed happy 
with their end of the bargain -- if their overheard comments are any 
indication:  
</P>
<P>
 "They treat us like kings."  
</P>
<P>
 "They really know how to cut hair!"  
</P>
<P>
 "Who cut you? Richard did mine. He's really cool!"  
</P>
<P>
 By 8:30, the vans were loaded for the return to Sylmar. The thank-yous from 
the kids to salon staff were numerous and sincere. 
</P>
<P>
 Walking along Ventura Boulevard, the teens could have been any group of 
junior- and high-school students on a pre-holiday outing, but these young 
people won't be home for Christmas. They will, however, be with new friends. 
And they will greet the holidays looking their best. BARBARA WELDON TONE

 Councilman R. Craig Scott handed the gavel to new Mayor Joel T. Lautenschleger 
this week, after Lautenschleger was unanimously elected by his City Council 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Lautenschleger, the 50-year-old vice president of Mesa Verde Convalescent

 "We're on a course to being one of the best communities in Southern

program and build more athletic fields. We're also going to be fiscally 
prudent. We are in good financial shape because we invested wisely." 
</P>
<P>
 Randal J. Bressette, who along with Scott was elected again, was unanimously 
chosen to serve another year as mayor pro tem. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also welcomed newly elected Councilwoman Cindy Greengold and said 
farewell to former councilman and former mayor L. Allan Songstad Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members thanked Songstad for his key role in the city's incorporation 
effort and his focus on improving public safety in Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is one person who really is responsible for bringing this community 
to cityhood, it would be Allan Songstad, who led us with a strong hand through 
a tumultuous time," Councilwoman Melody Carruth said. "We needed someone with 
his experience to see us through." 
</P>
<P>
 Songstad had decided not to run for reelection and said he wanted to give 
other local activists a voice in city decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very honored to have been part of the first City Council. It was a very 
special group," Songstad said. "I'm very proud of the City Council and of how 
the city has conducted itself in the last three years." LYNN FRANEY

 The fuzzy delight of bringing into the family a kitten or puppy for the 
holidays has been made a lot more affordable, thanks to the Mercy Crusade, a 
nonprofit animal care corporation. 
</P>
<P>
 Dogs, puppies, cats and kittens can be adopted Tuesday through Thursday for 
$10 plus licensing fee at the Agoura animal shelter and the other five county 
shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 Adoptions usually cost at least $40, according to Bob Ballenger, executive 
assistant, Los Angeles County Animal Care and Control Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercy Crusade donates the money for all spaying, neutering and shots to allow 
families that may not otherwise be able to afford a pet to have one. Last year, 
more than 400 animals were adopted by families through the Mercy Crusade 
program. MAKI BECKER

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: CITY FILES LAWSUIT OVER PARK PACT 
</P>

<P>
 The city of Calabasas has gone to court to block Ventura County's decision 
giving the Ahmanson Land Co. an extra three years to turn 10,000 acres into 
public parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, filed in Ventura County Superior Court, says the Board of 
Supervisors should have conducted another environmental study before granting 
the three-year extension in October. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit also argues that if Ahmanson could not meet the 1995 deadline for 
turning over the land, supervisors should have canceled the development 
agreement to build a mini-city in the Simi Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The original agreement called for Ahmanson to acquire entertainer Bob Hope's 
Jordan Ranch, Runkle Ranch, Corral Canyon and Liberty Canyon properties by 
December, 1995, and sign over 10,000 acres to state and federal park agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange for the public land dedication, Ahmanson was given permission to 
build 3,050 residential dwellings, plus a town center, two golf courses and a 
300-room hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed by Calabasas and a homeowners' association adjacent to the 
property, says the extension significantly changes the development's impact on 
the environment. Those changes needed to be examined before the extension 
legally could be granted, the suit contends. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaintiffs seek a court order overturning the extension. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the latest of several suits filed over the Ahmanson project. The 
extensive litigation, the developer says, prompted the company to ask for the 
extension because it has been tied up in court instead of working out the 
details of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson has prevailed so far in each of the lawsuits, but the decisions are 
on appeal. BARBARA MURPHY

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: RESEDA; NEWLY PAINTED WALLS VANDALIZED AT SCHOOL

<TEXT>
<P>
 Student leaders at Reseda High School learned a tough lesson when they arrived 
at school Thursday morning and found that graffiti vandals had been at work on 
the walls and bins they had painted over just the day before. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really is sad. . . . The kids were just devastated," said Jay Shaffer, a 
teacher and sponsor of the student government class. 
</P>
<P>
 The students at Reseda had received money from the Los Angeles Police 
Department's West Valley Division to purchase the tools and supplies needed to 
paint over the graffiti that is scrawled all over the neighborhood surrounding 
the school. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the students painted over an earthquake storage bin and two 
walls, and were looking into future cleanup projects for the paint they had 
left over. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaffer said the students are considering repainting the bin and the one wall 
that was tagged with graffiti Wednesday night. But they are also somewhat 
disheartened. "I don't know what the solution is," he said. MAKI BECKER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CANOGA PARK; CIVIC PRIDE LIVES ON AT WOMEN'S CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To those who knew her, Clara Rooksby was the kind of woman who, when something 
needed to be done, didn't wait for somebody else to do it. She did it herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Back around 1914, the story goes, Rooksby, a teacher, set out on a crusade to 
obtain badly needed books for her students. Before long, she had collected 
enough volumes to open what became the area's first library. 
</P>
<P>
 That same year, Rooksby and 15 other like-minded ladies also founded the 
Canoga Park Women's Club, which this month celebrates its 80th anniversary. 
Over the past eight decades the organization has championed civic causes 
ranging from volunteering for the war effort to promoting literacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone stated in an early issue of the Owensmouth Gazette that the women 
were never known to falter in any good work," said Beth Shirley, unofficial 
historian of Canoga Park and a past president of the Women's Club. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Women's Club was established, Canoga Park was a fledgling prairie 
town known as Owensmouth, Sherman Way was still traversed by streetcars and 
"electric lights were still three years down the road," Shirley said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the club's roster was a Who's Who of prominent area women who hailed from 
the present-day communities of Chatsworth, Northridge, Reseda and Calabasas. 
The list included Mrs. T.A. Hull, wife of the first minister; Mrs. John Burch, 
whose husband farmed 40 acres; Mrs. Waring, the banker's wife, and Mrs. Wayne 
Bechtelheimer, whose husband was a pharmacist. 
</P>
<P>
 The women, who had high-minded ideals, pitched themselves straightaway into 
charitable endeavors, Shirley said. 
</P>
<P>
 During World War II, Women's Club members volunteered to watch for enemy 
planes in a tower west of town after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1977, the club established Haven Hills, a nonprofit organization dedicated 
to preventing domestic violence and establishing the Valley's first shelter for 
battered women. 
</P>
<P>
 Club members continue today to volunteer their time to such organizations as 
the Laubach Literary Tutoring Program, the Hugh O'Brien Youth Foundation and 
the West Valley Food Pantry. 
</P>
<P>
 Rooksby died in 1967 at the age of 103, but she is not forgotten, said 
Shirley. "She was quite a lady. People in their 60s around here still remember 
her." FRANK MANNING

JURY FINDS MAN GUILTY IN 1991 MURDER; COURTS: HE IS CONVICTED IN STRANGULATION

 A Fullerton businessman was convicted Thursday of strangling his business 
partner in 1991 and dumping her body in the desert. 
</P>
<P>
 An Orange County Superior Court jury deliberated two days before convicting 
Richard W. Lockridge, 41, of first-degree murder in the July, 1991, death of 
Kim Martello. 
</P>
<P>
 Martello, 28, of Fountain Valley disappeared July 22, 1991, and her body was 
found several days later near Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said she was murdered in the warehouse at ERB Foods in Fullerton 
in a dispute over ownership of the supply company. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher J. Evans argued at trial that Lockridge killed 
Martello because of "bad blood" between the pair. 
</P>
<P>
 "This jury did an excellent job at piecing together all the evidence that the 
Fullerton Police Department collected, which clearly showed Mr. Lockridge did 
it," Evans said after the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockridge has maintained his innocence, contending that someone else killed 
Martello. His defense attorney did not return a phone call seeking comment 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 He faces 25 years to life in prison when he is sentenced Jan. 20.

UNLICENSED CONTRACTORS TARGETED IN AGENCY STING; CRACKDOWN: FIVE ARE ARRESTED 
OR CITED BY UNDERCOVER AGENTS. NEW OFFICE TO DEAL WITH GROWING COMPLAINTS OPENS 
TODAY.

 Paulo Langi -- a cement contractor of sorts -- walked into the gutted 
two-story house on Thursday after submitting a bid to replace a cracked 
driveway and offered to negotiate a price to do the interior stucco work as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem was, state investigators say, that Langi may be a 
Jack-of-all-trades, but is licensed at none. 
</P>
<P>
 Langi, 41, of Van Nuys, was one of five men arrested or cited Thursday in a 
sting operation conducted by the Contractor's State License Board from a house 
in the 5300 block of Hinton Avenue. The house's owners and a contractor working 
there allowed investigators to use it for the sting, said Ralph Hollier, a 
board investigator who led the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators contacted Langi and the other unwitting participants who had 
placed ads for repair work in a local shopper, then posed at the house as the 
homeowners and a neighbor who just stopped by. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Northridge earthquake rattled some homes from their foundations last 
Jan. 17, the state agency has regularly conducted sting operations because of a 
steep rise in the number of consumer complaints against unlicensed contractors, 
Hollier said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've tried to do operations like this at least twice a week in quake-damaged 
areas since last January," Hollier said. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency's Van Nuys office has received more than 300 complaints over the 
past four months, far above the norm, said Sam Haynes, an agency spokesman in 
Sacramento. More than 400 unlicensed contractors have been arrested in the San 
Fernando Valley since the Northridge temblor, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The volume of complaints has been so great that the department is opening a 
special office in Van Nuys today with 10 investigators solely to handle 
earthquake-related contractor complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 Langi's arrest was instructive because it is typical of what investigators 
often find in such operations and in the twice-a-week surprise visits they make 
to construction sites, said Dan Hitt, a special investigator with the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 First off, the burly Langi arrived in a truck that displayed a licensed 
contractor's number that Hitt said didn't belong to him. 
</P>
<P>
 He briefly looked at the driveway and then came inside to write up an estimate 
for the work and talk with the "owners." 
</P>
<P>
 "After the holidays, maybe we can continue and do something else," Langi said, 
fishing for more business. When he finished, Hitt wrote him a check for more 
than $2,000, half the price of the job. 
</P>
<P>
 When Langi accepted it, Hitt identified himself as a peace officer, told Langi 
he was under arrest for contracting without a license and handcuffed him. 
</P>
<P>
 After his arrest, Langi gave investigators yet another license number. This 
one belonged to Langi's brother and had expired in August of 1993, Hitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 He gave investigators a third number. Strike three. That was also invalid, 
Hitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 It turned out that the company Langi represented also had used three different 
names in the past, and now operated under the name Langi Construction, Hitt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As he was booked right on the spot -- handcuffed, photographed and processed 
-- Langi, who appeared to take the turn of events in stride, told investigators 
that he had applied earlier to take the test for a state license. 
Unfortunately, he admitted moments later, he had paid with a bad check, adding 
that he replaced it with a good one as soon as he could. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's operation ended with five arrests and two misses, cases in which 
the contractor failed to show up or actually had a valid license. All those 
arrested or cited were released. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Langi, who asked the investigator as he was escorted to the front door: 
"Does this mean I don't get the check?"

SHOPPERS TRICKLE BACK TO GALLERIA; GLENDALE: MERCHANTS AGREE THAT BOMB HOAX 
CAUSED MANY TO STAY AWAY THURSDAY AT THE HEIGHT OF THE HOLIDAY RUSH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Holiday shoppers began trickling back to the Glendale Galleria on Thursday, 
the day after a bomb scare forced the evacuation of more than 50,000 people and 
cost mall merchants an estimated tens of thousands of dollars in lost sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the dramatic evacuation -- and subsequent recovery by police of three 
fake "bombs" -- the mall opened on time Thursday, with the first 2,000 
customers receiving $5 gift certificates for mall merchandise and tickets for 
free coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 But even with the goodwill efforts, mall merchants agreed that the hoax -- 
which came 11 days before Christmas -- caused many shoppers to stay away at the 
height of the holiday rush. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually our sales are in the thousands of dollars by lunchtime on a Thursday 
and today we're only in the hundreds," said Michelle Turscak, manager of the 
Christopher Ranch, a specialty food store that sells luxury gifts such as 
garlic dipped in 18-carat gold. 
</P>
<P>
 Turscak's shop is one of the 264 specialty stores and restaurants -- as well 
as five department stores -- housed in the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, police continued their investigation and expressed worry that the 
Galleria hoax -- which followed a bomb scare earlier this month at a South Bay 
mall -- may trigger a rash of copycat pranks. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a new occurrence," said Lt. Bill Christiansen of the Los Angeles 
County sheriff's arson explosives detail. "Because of the notoriety, . . . it 
may prompt other people to try pulling a similar stunt." 
</P>
<P>
 The bomb scare began Wednesday afternoon when a mall customer spotted a 
suspicious package in a restroom trash can. About the same time, the Glendale 
Police Department received an anonymous phone call warning that there was a 
bomb in the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Police searched the 1.3-million-square-foot shopping center and found two more 
elaborately wrapped packages in separate men's bathrooms. All three packages, 
which were each labeled "bomb," turned out to be five-pound sacks of flour. 
</P>
<P>
 Police accompanied by mall merchants searched Wednesday night for a possible 
fourth package, which was never found. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale police spokesman Chahe Kheuregholian said his department has so far 
received hundreds of telephone calls with tips on possible suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 If caught, Kheuregholian said, the culprit faces felony charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale Police Agent Rod Brooks said a computer analysis was being performed 
on the male voice taped in the anonymous 911 phone call received by police. 
Investigators also checked for fingerprints at the pay phone at Broadway and 
Pacific Avenue, where the call was placed. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Department bomb squad officials said the packages at the Galleria 
are not the work of the person who left a fake bomb inside a restroom at the 
South Bay Pavilion in Carson earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The shoppers who returned to the Galleria on Thursday say there was one small 
benefit to the trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot less crowded than I expected. Usually at lunch, I can never find a 
space, but I didn't have any problems today," Glendale resident Sheryl Carlin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 David Manders, a forklift driver at Price Club, said he did not hesitate to 
follow through on a promise to bring his 3-year-old godson, Anthony, and his 
4-month-old niece, Olivia, to see Santa Claus. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought we would come anyway," Manders said. "I wasn't worried, and the 
kids certainly don't know the difference."

MOORPARK HOPES TAX BREAKS WILL ATTRACT COMPANY; BUSINESS: CITY HELPS ASSEMBLE

<P>
 Moorpark has helped package about $8 million in state and local tax breaks to 
lure a Newhall-based company with 700 jobs to the city and head off the firm's 
flight to Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 The rapidly expanding company, Special Devices Inc., which makes small 
detonators used to spring car air bags, has outgrown its Newhall plant and 
wants to expand to more than 1,000 employees by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials picked a 285-acre parcel in an isolated part of Moorpark 
last spring, saying it is ideal for a new plant. The company would spend about 
$12.5 million building the facility on 15 acres, leaving the rest as open 
space, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 While company officials like the location, California state taxes and local 
fees would make the cost of building in Moorpark more than $10 million higher 
than in Mesa, Ariz., said Moorpark Councilman Scott Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials in Mesa, where Special Devices Inc. has another plant, have 
offered to give the company a graded parcel and have promised quick approval of 
construction plans, Montgomery said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the processing fees for Mesa add up to about $62,000," Montgomery said. 
"Here in California, the county and city fees alone add up to about $1.6 
million. In addition, because of the environmental review process, it would 
take them about 10 months longer to build here. And we wonder why businesses 
are moving out of state?" 
</P>
<P>
 A Special Devices executive did not return phone calls Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But city and state officials said they expect to meet with company executives 
next week to go over the incentive package. A decision is expected by the end 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The combined recruitment of Special Devices is part of an ongoing effort by a 
Ventura County "Red Team," a group of local officials, state legislators and 
economic development experts in the Wilson Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery said that Moorpark and Ventura County are offering to cut about $1 
million in fees, including about $700,000 that would go to road maintenance and 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The city also has pledged to cut through red tape and reduce the time it would 
take the company to get a building permit from 10 months to about six. The 
county would speed up its agency reviews and the city would combine Planning 
Commission and City Council hearings into one. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more significant are pledges for $5 million in state tax breaks, and an 
offer by the California Department of Transportation to contribute land that 
would add about $2 million to the package, Montgomery said. 
</P>
<P>
 The state tax credits could be claimed after the new plant is designated an 
enterprise zone by the Legislature, a proposal that Assemblyman Nao Takasugi 
(R-Oxnard) and state Sen. Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) plan to introduce next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 As an enterprise zone, the company's plant would be granted an estimated $5 
million in payroll and income tax credits, said Wright spokesman John Theiss. 
The tax credits would be for jobs the company creates over the next five or six 
years, Theiss said.  
</P>
<P>
 The incentive package was developed over several months in conjunction with 
the state Trade and Commerce Agency, part of the county's Red Team, said the 
agency's Tom Alfano. 
</P>
<P>
 "Along with officials from the city and county, we meet with the companies to 
hear what their needs are," Alfano said. "We look for creative ways to lure new 
businesses to the state and keep the ones we already have here." 
</P>
<P>
 In June, Gov. Pete Wilson sent a letter to Special Devices President Thomas 
Treinen encouraging him to stay in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Key bargaining sessions are set for next Tuesday and Wednesday in Westlake 
Village. Moorpark officials are optimistic because the $8-million package now 
rivals Mesa's tax advantages. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's close to making up the difference," Montgomery said. "Besides that, 
they would be able to stay in California, which is something they have said 
they want to do."

DISTRICT FEARS LOSS OF INTEREST INCOME FROM POOL FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In addition to worries about its $18.9-million investment in the county 
securities pool as required by law, the Huntington Beach Union High School 
District is concerned that lack of interest income will further add to district 
budget problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt.David Hagen told the school board Tuesday night that the district had 
counted on earning $1.7 million in interest this year from its investment. 
</P>
<P>
 "That (projected interest income) is money the county would pay us on the 
balance we had in their account," Hagen said. "But for the first six months of 
this fiscal year, it is obvious the county has lost money, so we do not believe 
we will be able to count upon the entire $1.7 million in interest income. That, 
therefore, will have an impact on this year's budget." 
</P>
<P>
 Hagen said that prior to the county's bankruptcy, the county treasurer's 
office had predicted that school funds would earn a 6% return. "We think that 
instead of 6% that figure will be closer to 2% or 3% on investments," Hagen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Loss of interest income worsens an already bleak financial outlook for the 
school district. In a financial report Tuesday night, the school board was told 
that expected income this school year so far is running about $500,000 less 
than the district had budgeted. A decrease in state and redevelopment funds is 
the major reason for the income drop, the board was told. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagen said the school district would "only spend money that is absolutely 
essential" to keep employees paid and schools open. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board chopped two spending items from its agenda Tuesday night. The 
board postponed a $58,000 repair to the Edison High swimming pool in Huntington 
Beach and deferred action on leasing a copy machine for the district, thereby 
saving about $75,000 this year.

POLITICAL BRIEFING: BERNSON'S P.O. DECODES THE ABCS OF GOVERNMENT ACRONYM B.S.

 LANGUAGE SKILLS: One of the most difficult parts of dealing with City Hall is 
trying to understand the jargon and acronyms that bureaucrats interject into 
what would otherwise be considered English. 
</P>
<P>
 City Hall insiders chat about CDBG money and whether CD 7 is getting its fair 
share. Or they say they will ask the MTA for funding to pay for new DASH buses. 
It's enough to drive any newcomer MAD. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe you can't fight City Hall because you can't understand City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 It was for that reason that Councilman Hal Bernson's press deputy Francine 
Oschin put together a dictionary of City Hall jargon and acronyms, which she 
offers to new council members so they too can speak the secret language of 
bureaucratese. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Oschin sought to update her dictionary by sending out a copy of the 
20-page document to all department heads, asking them to add any new words or 
acronyms that they have recently coined. 
</P>
<P>
 But she didn't expect the new acronym submitted by an anonymous bureaucrat who 
didn't think much of her request: ASCCP. It stands for Another Stupid City 
Council Project. 
</P>

 LANGUAGE SKILLS, WASHINGTON STYLE: It is not just the names of many members of 
Congress that will be changing when the House of Representatives reconvenes on 
Jan. 4. Scores of committees and subcommittees have been given snappy new 
titles as well. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Rep. Howard P. (Buck) McKeon (R-Santa Clarita) will no longer 
sit on the Education and Labor Committee. It's been renamed the Economic and 
Educational Opportunities Committee, for clarification's sake. And McKeon's 
subcommittee on elementary, secondary and vocational education has been 
transformed into the subcommittee on post-secondary education, training and 
lifelong learning. Got that? 
</P>
<P>
 The Government Operations Committee that Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Los Angeles) 
sits on has become the Government Reform and Oversight Committee. And Rep. 
Carlos J. Moorhead (R-Glendale) may have to reprint his stationery, too. His 
Energy and Commerce Committee will become the Commerce Committee next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Just like that, Congress has undergone major reform. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 LANGUAGE SKILLS, COUNTY STYLE: Zev Yaroslavsky told his colleagues at the 
Board of Supervisors meeting this week that as a newcomer, he found the 
county's budget format indecipherable. "I've been trying to figure this thing 
out for six months, and I tell you, I don't understand it. The format we had 
over at the City Council was easy to read." 
</P>
<P>
 Joel Bellman, Yaroslavsky's transition deputy and the press deputy to former 
Supervisor Ed Edelman, said later: "Every year everybody stoutly resolves to 
make the budget plan simpler to read, to make it just burst with startling 
clarity. Somehow, we've never achieved that level." 
</P>

<P>
 A JOYFUL EVENT: During her 16 years on the Los Angeles City Council, Joy Picus 
made a name for herself in City Hall as a champion of women's causes. Now, more 
than a year after voters ousted her from her post, she is getting her name on 
City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing her fight to get a city child-care coordinator appointed to help 
working women, the City Council voted unanimously this week to rename the City 
Hall child-care center after Picus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pretty ecstatic," she said about the honor. "I can't think of anything I 
would rather be remembered for." 
</P>
<P>
 As a council member representing the west San Fernando Valley, Picus took a 
leading role in seeing that the city adopted a pay-equity plan so that female 
city government employees earned the same as men working in jobs requiring 
similar skills. 
</P>
<P>
 She also supported a plan to grant special building privileges to developers 
who provide child-care facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Picus lost her reelection bid last year to her former deputy Laura Chick. 
</P>
<P>
 The child-care center for city and federal employees serves 96 children as 
young as 6 weeks. It has a staff of 25 and serves catered lunches provided by a 
nearby Italian restaurant.

 THE VIDEO AGE: With the 6 o'clock news focused more on crime and disasters 
than on public affairs, viewers get a lot less exposure to reports of political 
back-room deals and boondoggles. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) is stepping forward to fill that void. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week saw the debut release of a Hayden video meant to expose government 
inefficiency and lobbyists' agendas. It was touted as the first in a series of 
"spotlight on corruption" videos the senator plans to distribute to local TV 
stations, cable public access channels and other media. 
</P>
<P>
 In a four-minute tape, Hayden walks viewers through what he calls the "fiscal 
fiasco of the MTA," blasting the Metropolitan Transit Authority for its 
multimillion-dollar expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
 He points out that (A) few people actually use the costly new subway system 
running beneath L.A.; (B) the MTA spent hundreds of millions on a plush new 
26-story office tower, and (C) clean-fuel buses are more economical than 
trains. 
</P>
<P>
 The video, produced and filmed by Hayden's staff members, aired on Century 
Cable's "Weekend Review." 
</P>
<P>
 The bookish and professorial Hayden views videos as a key tool for reaching 
people too busy to read extensively. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Hayden: "It's hard to find out what happens behind closed doors, and few 
folks read the scholarly studies written on the details of government 
procurement and decision making. 
</P>
<P>
 "So we've turned to video technology to help the citizens understand how 
they're being taken to the cleaners," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 New releases will come out every month, but don't look for them to crack the 
Top 10. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 THE BIRDS: Oh, the problems of an outdoor press conference. 
</P>
<P>
 State Assemblywoman Paula Boland (R-Granada Hills) and Hayden held a news 
conference outside Northridge Middle School earlier this week but their voices 
kept getting drowned out. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporters kept moving closer to the podium to hear the lawmakers and community 
leaders discuss their plans to dismantle the Los Angeles school district. 
Speakers were asked to raise their voices. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the black birds took over. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of the large, loud birds lined up along a telephone wire in front of 
the school. Their crowing became louder than the legislators'. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Hayden: "They must be having a press conference of their own."

BOARD AGREES TO PUBLIC AIRING OF BREAKUP PLAN; SCHOOLS: MARK SLAVKIN SAYS MAJOR 
ISSUES WILL BE OPENLY DEBATED, WITH LOBBYISTS TO MAKE DISTRICT'S STANDS CLEAR 
TO LAWMAKERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 One day after two state legislators announced plans to dismantle the Los 
Angeles Unified School District, the Board of Education agreed Thursday to let 
the issue have a full -- and unusual -- public airing. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board will hold a public hearing on the breakup legislation, then 
will take a formal position in the next several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of a new strategy, board President Mark Slavkin said major political 
issues will be debated -- in public -- and that the board will direct its 
lobbyists to make those positions clear in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board members should have a voice and be clear on where they stand on 
issues like this," he said. "I think it's very appropriate that the Los Angeles 
community be engaged about what they want in these issues. We'll have, I think, 
a significant debate on this one." 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Paula L. Boland (R-Granada Hills) and state Sen. Tom Hayden 
(D-Los Angeles) discussed their joint plans at a news conference Wednesday. 
Boland plans to introduce legislation that would both reduce the number of 
voters' signatures required to get the proposal on the ballot and remove the 
school board's power to veto a breakup plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden's legislation, which would establish a committee to devise a breakup 
proposal, would also require such a plan to incorporate existing court orders 
over such things as desegregation. 
</P>
<P>
 Boland said Thursday that the public hearing would be useless if it is held 
Downtown because it is too far removed from parents and students, and that she 
is unsure whether she would attend. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the problem -- everything is Downtown and people have to drive 40 
miles to talk about their kids," she said. "I think they (school board members) 
are real concerned that the people's voices might be heard. They're running 
around trying to counteract that." 
</P>
<P>
 But board members and district officials defended the idea of holding a public 
meeting on the breakup legislation, saying they believe that the issue must be 
debated in the open rather than just having lobbyists directed -- in private -- 
to take positions in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Said Assistant Supt. Ron Prescott, the district's chief lobbyist: "This is an 
unusual break from tradition. But I think this is the way we should do business 
-- the public ought to be in on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Boland and Hayden said they believe that their bills stand better chances 
this year -- rather than in previous years -- because of the new political 
landscape in Sacramento. With the arrival of 28 new Assembly members and 
Speaker Willie Brown's power diminishing, the lawmakers said the breakup 
legislation could be approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Boland said her office telephones were ringing continuously Thursday with 
supporters of the legislation. "People are really excited about the possibility 
of this happening," she said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; DISTRICT CONSIDERS CAMPUS CUTBACKS, LAYOFFS; 
EDUCATION: OFFICIALS, EXPECTING A DEFICIT, LOOK FOR WAYS TO SLASH BUDGET AS 
COSTS OF TWO NEW SCHOOLS STRAIN FINANCES. 
</P>

<P>
 The cost of maintaining two new schools in the Santa Clarita Valley's lone 
high school district will cause the district's budget to drop from a $5-million 
surplus this year to a $2.3-million debt by 1997, prompting authorities to 
discuss large-scale layoffs and possibly closing a school. 
</P>
<P>
 The William S. Hart Union High School District has enough money to operate 
only through the 1995-96 school year -- and those figures are conservative, 
said William Maddigan, director of fiscal services, at the district's board of 
trustees meeting Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The board will need to make significant budget cuts by July to avoid disaster 
the following year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could shut off all of our utilities and not buy any paper or supplies for 
the whole year and it still wouldn't overcome the shortfall we have here," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddigan said the only viable solution is layoffs, since personnel costs 
account for 85% of the annual $50-million general fund budget. However, some 
board members went a step further, saying that closing a school or facilities 
at several schools should also be considered. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may be faced with that kind of alternative," said board President John 
Hassel. "I don't know of any clearer alternative right now." 
</P>
<P>
 The shortfall resulted because the district expanded from six traditional 
schools to eight this year, opening Valencia High School and La Mesa Junior 
High. The new schools increased the district's operating costs by one-third 
without any increase in revenue, Maddigan said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the state's massive budget shortfalls of recent years were not 
foreseen when Hart officials began planning the new schools 10 years ago to 
accommodate growing enrollments, Maddigan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the district's surplus had actually grown in recent years. The 
surplus was $3.7 million in 1992-93 and grew to $5 million for the 1993-94 
school year. For 1994-95, however, the surplus is beginning to drop, and the 
district expects to lose more than $2 million a year over the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Board members said they will discuss financial goals in February and March, 
and probably will begin proposing cuts in April. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that a couple of years ago any fat that was there was gone," said 
board member Patricia Hanrion. "We're down to the bone." 
</P>
<P>
 The district's ratio of employees to students is already among the worst in 
the state, said Assistant Supt. Michael von Buelow. A program to bring more 
computers and other high-tech equipment to district schools is also in 
jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 And the district finds itself in a Catch-22: a significant increase this year 
in on-campus burglaries and vandalism. Maddigan said the break-ins are costing 
the district tens of thousands of dollars, but money isn't available to fund 
extensive security measures. 
</P>
<P>
 "The vandalism probably wouldn't take place if we had someone on campus 24 
hours a day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 High schools have an all-night janitor on weeknights and the district spends 
$35,000 a year for guards to patrol campuses during holidays, Maddigan said. 
The board agreed to let Maddigan explore the possibility of alarms around 
school perimeters, although he said such a system would cost at least $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it might be a good idea to spend wisely now on what would be a 
preventative measure," said Supt. Daniel Hanigan. 
</P>
<P>
 The only good financial news at the meeting was that the district recently won 
a $1,000 grant from the California School Boards Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do we put this into lottery tickets?" Hassel quipped.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; AIR FORCE TESTS SUSPECT COMMUTER PLANE FOR ICE 
RISK; AERONAUTICS: EUROPEAN-BUILT ATR 72 IS THE SAME TYPE OF CRAFT THAT CRASHED 
IN INDIANA IN OCTOBER, KILLING 68 PEOPLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A European-built ATR commuter aircraft began undergoing tests here Thursday to 
see if ice buildup on its wings may have been a factor in an October crash of 
the same type of plane that killed 68 people in Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
 A twin-engine ATR 72 turboprop flew behind an Air Force KC-135 tanker jet that 
sprayed water into the air, forming ice crystals on the commuter craft's body. 
The ATR's manufacturer, a consortium of French and Italian firms, paid the Air 
Force to conduct the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Icing on the wings has been suspected as a cause of the Oct. 31 crash of an 
ATR 72 in Roselawn, Ind., near Chicago. The Federal Aviation Administration 
later banned ATR 72s and their sister planes, ATR 42s, from flying in weather 
likely to produce icy conditions. ATR 72s have 68 seats, while ATR 42s 
generally have 46. 
</P>
<P>
 ATRs, which have a range of 350 to 400 miles, are commuter workhorses in 
Midwestern and Eastern states. The 157 ATR 72s in service in this country are 
operated mainly by American Airlines' American Eagle subsidiary, Continental 
Express and Trans World Express. None are flown in California. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Roselawn crash, the FAA said ATRs were still safe in all conditions. 
But the agency later changed its position and imposed the icy-weather ban after 
some pilots expressed reluctance to fly the planes in such conditions and the 
National Transportation Safety Board recommended flight restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA said it ordered the ban because new information from the manufacturer, 
Avions de Transport Regional, about potential hazards of icy conditions showed 
that control could be lost in certain situations. The agency said the craft 
remained safe to fly in good weather. 
</P>
<P>
 ATR, however, issued a statement arguing that voluntary tests it conducted 
"provide no bases for the action taken by the FAA." The cause of the crash 
remains under investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathryn Creedy, a spokeswoman for ATR Marketing, said the plane's manufacturer 
conducted wind-tunnel tests for ice problems, using wooden models of ice 
formations, and is now performing in-flight tests at Edwards. The Air Force 
hires out its facilities to civilian firms if they cannot find the same 
services in the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
 Creedy said one early theory on the cause of the Roselawn crash was ice 
forming on the ATR's aileron, a movable flap that controls an aircraft's roll.

 "We are as mystified as the FAA and the NTSB," Creedy said. "We want to know 
what happened to that flight." 
</P>
<P>
 Some aviation experts said that before the October crash, ATRs were generally 
recognized as superior planes with a good safety record. But authorities now 
say that the craft's smaller, fuel-efficient wings and tail may be especially 
susceptible to icing. 
</P>
<P>
 In icing conditions, water remains liquid in the air until it encounters a 
surface -- such as an airplane wing -- on which to freeze. Ice buildup can 
disrupt airflow over wings, causing them to lose lift.

GUNFIRE WOUNDS 2 BOYS IN SANTA ANA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gunfire from someone on a bicycle wounded two boys Thursday night, a police 
sergeant said. 
</P>
<P>
 The unidentified boys were standing in front of a house in the 1400 block of 
South Maple Street when a gunman opened fire, striking one of the boys in the 
thigh and the other in the foot, said Sgt. Dick Faust. The boys did not see the 
assailant, whose gunfire also hit a house two doors down, Faust said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both boys were listed in good condition Thursday night at Coastal Communities 
Hospital.  
</P>
<P>
 "They were lucky, real lucky," Faust said. "It could have been much worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators say the shooting may be gang-related. Police have no suspects 
and are continuing the investigation.

SUIT FILED BY KIN OF 2 PEDESTRIANS STRUCK, KILLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The children of two elderly people who were struck and killed as they crossed 
a street filed a lawsuit Thursday against the city and the driver, the second 
such suit pertaining to that intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred B. Young and Patricia E. Crowell, both 78, were walking home after having 
breakfast at a fast-food restaurant on March 15 when they were struck by a 
pickup driven by Francisco Jimenez, 25, of Costa Mesa at West 19th Street and 
Meyer Place, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimenez had been on his way to work, traveling east on West 19th Street when 
he struck the two pedestrians. The sun was in his eyes and he didn't see the 
couple, Jimenez told police at the time of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaintiffs contended that a lack of a traffic signal, which was planned 
for the intersection at the time but had not been installed, was partly to 
blame for the accident. About three months later, city employees installed a 
$98,000 signal at the same intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 Other dangerous conditions listed in the lawsuit, which was filed with the 
state's Superior Court, included inadequate signs and bad design and markings 
of the crosswalks. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit filed by Crowell's child and Young's five children is the second 
against the city involving the intersection at West 19th Street and Meyer 
Place, also the site of a 1990 accident in which a 25-year-old woman was hit by 
a car and seriously injured.

FOUR RAIDERS GET SPOTS IN PRO BOWL; PRO FOOTBALL: MCGLOCKTON, BROWN, MCDANIEL 
AND WISNIEWSKI NAMED. BETTIS MAKES NFC SQUAD DESPITE SLUMP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Raider defensive tackle Chester McGlockton gave himself four years to make the 
Pro Bowl when he was drafted in the first round from Clemson in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, McGlockton learned that he is ahead of schedule when he was named 
to the AFC Pro Bowl team, along with three Raider teammates -- wide receiver 
Tim Brown, cornerback Terry McDaniel and guard Steve Wisniewski. 
</P>
<P>
 One Ram, running back Jerome Bettis, was named to the NFC team. 
</P>
<P>
 Said McGlockton: "This is something that you want to achieve when you first 
get in the league, to be considered one of the best. It's like someone took a 
big weight from off my shoulders." 
</P>
<P>
 McGlockton's relief is understandable, considering the injuries he has had to 
overcome in his first two seasons. As a rookie, he was limited to 10 games 
because of a preseason foot injury. Last season, he sat out the playoffs 
because of a broken leg he suffered in the final game of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always said that if he's healthy, he's going to be a force to be 
reckoned with," Raider Coach Art Shell said. "Now, he's arrived. You can tell 
by the number of double and triple teams he's faced. That tells you that he has 
the attention of other teams." 
</P>
<P>
 Participants in the Pro Bowl, which will be played Feb. 5 in Honolulu, are 
selected by NFL players, coaches and fans. 
</P>
<P>
 McGlockton, who has 49 tackles and 7 1/2 sacks this season, was the third 
defensive tackle selected, behind starters Cortez Kennedy of the Seattle 
Seahawks and Michael Dean Perry of the Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt that I had a realistic chance to make it this season," said 
McGlockton, who planned to thank former teammate and current Fox television 
broadcaster Howie Long for helping during his first two seasons. "I thought 
that going toward the end of last season I was on my way before getting hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 McDaniel has scored three defensive touchdowns this season and leads the team 
with seven interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Shell: "Most of the guys who make the squad are playing at a high level. 
Steve (Wisniewski) makes it every year and he's deserving of it. Same thing 
goes for Tim Brown. With Terry, this is his third selection and I thought that 
he should have made it a year or two earlier before that." 
</P>
<P>
 McDaniel said, "It's called an individual award, but it's really done through 
the team." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Wisniewski: "Personally, I think that I had a good year. But I'm in my 
sixth year in the league and I would love to trade (playing in the Pro Bowl) 
for a shot at playing in the Super Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis made the NFC team for the second consecutive year, even though he will 
fall well short of not only his announced goal of 2,000 yards rushing but his 
1,429 yards as a rookie last season. 
</P>
<P>
 His 970 yards in 296 carries rank fourth among NFC rushers behind the Detroit 
Lions' Barry Sanders with 1,721, Dallas Cowboys' Emmitt Smith with 1,410 and 
Minnesota Vikings' Terry Allen with 975. Bettis is averaging 3.3 yards a carry 
and has run for three touchdowns -- the lowest among the top 10 NFC rushers in 
those categories. He was selected as a reserve behind Sanders and Smith.  
</P>
<P>
 Considering his statistics on a 4-10 team, Bettis said he was pleasantly 
surprised by his selection. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a rough year, but I think I was still able to do some positive 
things," he said. "I'm just happy I'm considered one of the best backs in the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people are looking past that whole thing of me having huge numbers. 
They're saying, 'How did he perform? Is he having a decent year?' Look at the 
stats, and I'm up there past a lot of backs who are having pretty good years. 
What does that say? Am I having a bad year?" 
</P>
<P>
 Struggling behind an injured offensive line, Bettis hasn't rushed for more 
than 100 yards in a game since Oct. 2 against the Atlanta Falcons. He was 
slowed by a back injury earlier in the season and by a number of other bumps 
and bruises. He has averaged 31 yards and 12 carries a game the last five 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jerome has had a hard year," Ram offensive coordinator Chick Harris said. "He 
has fought through it. I'm sure the productivity he wanted isn't there, but he 
has been a lot of our offense, and a lot of people respect that when we've 
played against them." 
</P>
<P>
 Two-time Super Bowl champion Dallas, led by running back Emmitt Smith and 
quarterback Troy Aikman, put a league-high 11 players on the NFC team. The San 
Francisco 49ers had nine players, including wide receiver Jerry Rice and 
quarterback Steve Young. Rice was voted to the team for the ninth time. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pittsburgh Steelers led the AFC with six players voted to the team, 
linebackers Greg Lloyd and Kevin Greene, cornerback Rod Woodson, safety Carnell 
Lake, guard Duval Love and center Dermontti Dawson. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego tied the Raiders with four players: linebacker Junior Seau, 
defensive end Leslie O'Neal, running back Natrone Means and kicker John Carney.

MIKE PENNER: POND IS GOOD TO THE CLIPPERS ONCE AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The night before, Clipper guard Terry Dehere uttered what has to be the quote 
of the NBA's first quarter when, mulling 48-point blowout in Portland, he 
noted, "This league is too good to get down by more than 50 points and be able 
to come back." 
</P>
<P>
 So true, so true. 
</P>
<P>
 Dehere's words are the essence of what it means to be a Clipper in these lose 
16, win two, lose two same-old-same-old days. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a Clipper would say such a thing, because only a Clipper has first-hand 
knowledge of what a 53-point, fourth-quarter deficit feels like. 
</P>
<P>
 And only a Clipper, after falling behind by 53 points in Portland, would ever 
fathom the very idea of coming back. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming back by when, Terry? 
</P>
<P>
 Next Tuesday? 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the Clippers needed just 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, that and a return to the Orange County welcome wagon, also known the 
undiscriminating Pond, where the Clippers are treated like NBA royalty, greeted 
with a crowd of 17,277 one night after flirting with another franchise record 
for incompetence (Biggest Margin of Defeat -- 51 points -- in this case). 
</P>
<P>
 Well, that and a return to the Orange County welcome wagon and a visit by the 
Golden State Warriors minus one Don Nelson (in the hospital with pneumonia), 
one Billy Owens (in Miami), one Chris Webber (in Landover, Md., or last we 
heard) and one Tim Hardaway after bruising his knee in the first quarter and 
missing virtually the entire second half. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Clippers, that was all they needed, not counting the Warriors' 25 
turnovers, 40% field-goal shooting and goofball management of the game's final 
90 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 After leading by 15, the Clippers watched their lead melt to one with 1:28 
remaining, before holding their breath and holding on for an 89-82 escape. 
</P>
<P>
 That's three victories in the last five for the Clips, who are 3-18 now and on 
pace for 11.7 victories this season, which are about 5.7 more than most 
predictions around the country 10 days ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's see," Clipper Coach Bill Fitch said, ticking them off on his fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've won one on the road, one at home and one in Anaheim." 
</P>
<P>
 He beamed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're moving in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's U-turn was as unexpected as they come. Portland had been an 
out-and-out catastrophe, even by Clipper standards -- a 121-73 romp that left 
Fitch making shellshocked comparisons to the Bataan death march. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a good growth night," Fitch surmised. "If a team's ever going to 
step up and show some character, this was a good time to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 "That one (Wednesday) night could have cost us a dearly. A young team getting 
hit hard like that . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch was eager to purge that one from the memory, which is why he was happy 
to fly down the coast and promptly play the Warriors, jet lag or not. "Better 
this way," he said, "than to miss two or three night's sleep thinking about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Thursday morning, he gathered his players in the film room and showed 
them an edited-for-your-viewing-displeasure reel of "the ugliest parts of the 
Portland game. I used that as a demonstration -- 'This is not going to happen 
tonight.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Then, it was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Or so Fitch hoped. 
</P>
<P>
 By game time, Fitch threw this starting front line at Golden State: 6-foot-9 
Loy Vaught, 6-8 Charles Outlaw and 6-7 Lamond Murray. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch thought he hadn't deployed a front line so small "since college. That 
would be small for college nowadays. 
</P>
<P>
 "But, like we always say: 'Interchangeable parts.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Murray, Sealy, Outlaw, Vaught, Fish, Piatkowski. Interchangeable parts? As in 
who can tell the difference? 
</P>
<P>
 Hasn't that been the Clippers' problem all along? 
</P>
<P>
 This time, though, the Clippers' interchangeable parts outworked the Warriors' 
replacement parts. Tom Gugliotta still hasn't replaced Webber in any way, shape 
or concept. Clifford Rozier was also in the Warriors' starting lineup, mainly 
occupying space. And when Hardaway went out, Keith Jennings went in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Keith Jennings is a fine player," Fitch said diplomatically before breaking 
down and admitting, "If I've got to play them, I'd rather play them with 
Hardaway out of there." 
</P>
<P>
 So the mini-Clippers did just enough -- shot 43.9%, made two three-pointers, 
managed 89 points -- to slip past the semi-Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone asked Fitch if he had any sympathy for Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sympathize with Don Nelson," Fitch replied, "because he's sick. I hope it's 
not serious. You never want to see anybody get sick . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "As for the other trouble they've had, Webber and all that, well, everybody in 
this league's got trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble, mister. Fitch can show you trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sympathy?" Fitch said, chuckling at the very idea. "If you're looking for 
sympathy, you better get it out of a dictionary."

LAKERS DODGE ROCKETS; PRO BASKETBALL: CEBALLOS SCORES SEASON-HIGH 36 POINTS IN 
97-94 VICTORY OVER NBA CHAMPIONS IN HOUSTON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was on enemy turf this time, so the Lakers dug in and readied for Houston 
to take its best shot at revenge. The Rockets did too. But they missed. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirteen days after crushing the Rockets at the Forum, the Lakers delivered 
another blow to the suddenly staggering NBA champions on Thursday night, 
winning a close game this time, 97-94, at the Summit as Cedric Ceballos had a 
season-high 36 points and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news today in Houston: The Rockets don't play the Lakers again until 
late March. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the biggest win we've had all year," said Laker center Sam Bowie, 
who played a key role. "I was afraid if we weren't ready, they would come out 
and try to beat us bad after the way we embarrassed them at our place. But we 
were ready." 
</P>
<P>
 They were on several fronts. 
</P>
<P>
 The big numbers from Ceballos -- including 15 of 22 from the field -- came 
after he had 25 points and 16 rebounds in the first meeting, a 107-89 victory 
Dec. 2. Over the last 11 games, the all-star candidate has averaged 23.2 points 
and 8.7 rebounds while shooting 56.1%, bringing his season numbers up to 21.6 
points and nine rebounds and 50.1%. No small forward in the league is more 
successful on the boards, and only Jamal Mashburn, Scottie Pippen and Glen Rice 
are scoring at a better pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Ceballos also came up big when the Lakers needed his offense, this two nights 
after he took pride in his fourth-quarter defense against Mashburn in the 
victory at Dallas. In one stretch of about five minutes in the final period 
against the Rockets, he scored eight of the Lakers' 12 points for a 94-87 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston, which lost for the seventh time in 11 games after starting 9-0, 
stayed close, cutting the deficit to 96-94 on Robert Horry's short bank with 38 
seconds left. After Sedale Threatt's ill-advised three-point shot on the Laker 
possession, the Rockets came down the court with a chance to tie or move ahead. 
That chance ended with a miss -- Hakeem Olajuwon's 17-foot shot with about 
seven seconds to go hit the heel of the rim and ricocheted to Nick Van Exel in 
the lane near the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Exel was fouled immediately and made the first free throw. When he missed 
the next, the Rockets got the rebound and called time out with 4.8 seconds 
remaining and down, 97-94, hardly a panic situation for a team that is 
three-point crazy and would be taking the ball out at midcourt. 
</P>
<P>
 They got off a good shot too, an open jumper from behind the arc by Horry with 
about a second showing -- but it barely missed. Fitting on a night when the 
Rockets made only 38.9% of their attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 No more fitting, though, than the fact that Olajuwon got off only four shots 
in the final nine minutes, with the only basket coming at 8:58. He wasn't able 
to get to the line more than that lone visit with six minutes remaining. He got 
14 rebounds, but the Lakers limited him to 22 points, about four below than the 
season average, because of the combined defense of Vlade Divac, Elden Campbell 
and Bowie. 
</P>
<P>
 "Few teams can throw in three seven-footers that are very good players, and 
our three are," Coach Del Harris said after the Lakers won for the 10th time in 
12 games to improve to 13-7. They are 3-0 on this trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Divac, who had 11 rebounds, but made only two of 11 shots after early 
foul trouble: "We did a terrific job." 
</P>
<P>
 Bowie was the unexpected contributor. His last significant role had come Nov. 
29 at New Jersey, when he had 10 points and eight rebounds and made a key shot 
in the double-overtime victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Now this. He made only one of four shots, but collected seven rebounds in 26 
minutes and was a big piece of the blanket that covered Olajuwon. The last two 
times the Lakers have needed him most, he has delivered. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the MVP of the league," Bowie said. "We needed the 21 feet of defense to 
slow him down." 
</P>
<P>
 Olajuwon would hear nothing of the gang tackling that slowed him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't going to worry about their defense," he said. "It's about our game, 
our offense, our defense. We've lost chemistry and team spirit. That's what 
we're going through right now. We need to get back." 
</P>
<P>
 This is their chance. The Lakers are gone.

ROLE REVERSAL PUTS UCLA IN THE FINAL; NCAA VOLLEYBALL: JOHNSON EXCELS IN HITTER 
ROLE AS BUCKNER STRUGGLES IN FIVE-GAME VICTORY OVER PENN STATE. 
</P>

 All season, Jenny Johnson has played a supporting role for the UCLA women's 
volleyball team, passing and playing defense so that teammate Annett Buckner 
could put the ball away. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Thursday, those roles needed to change. And so deftly did the 
co-captains do so that UCLA recovered from early trouble and defeated Penn 
State, 3-15, 15-4, 15-9, 5-15, 15-11, in a semifinal match of the NCAA 
tournament before 7,077 in the Frank Erwin Center, earning their seventh 
appearance in an NCAA final. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins (32-3) will play Stanford, which beat Ohio State, 15-11, 15-9, 
15-7, Saturday night for the title. Versatility was the key for UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have five hitters out there who all are very capable and know that if they 
get hot, they are going to get the ball," UCLA Coach Andy Banachowski said. 
</P>
<P>
 So the Bruins got the ball to Johnson, and she finished with a team-high 18 
kills. 
</P>
<P>
 Buckner and Alyson Randick each contributed 12. Buckner needs 12 kills to 
break the UCLA single-season record, set in 1983 when Patty Orozco had 627. 
Randick had a remarkably efficient hitting night, making only two errors in 24 
attacks for a .417 hitting percentage. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who ranks third on the Bruins in hitting behind Buckner and Kim 
Krull, is aware that her usual role is to keep the ball in play so her 
teammates can get it to Buckner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think my purpose on the team is to put balls away," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 But it became apparent early that Buckner was struggling. Faced with at least 
two Penn State blockers every time she jumped to hit the ball, she made six 
errors in 15 attempts in the first game alone. After that, Buckner turned her 
attention to digging and blocking. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's when Johnson took over. Johnson had nine kills to help the Bruins 
win the second game and get back in the match. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just realized that we couldn't play the second game like we played the 
first game, so I just tried to pick up my level of play," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was more than that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we were embarrassed by the score of that first game," Banachowski 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams split the next two games to force a fifth game, in which UCLA 
capitalized on several errors by Penn State (31-4). The Bruins won when Krull 
took a set from Kelly Flannigan and sent it to the ground through two sprawling 
Penn State players. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came into the fifth game feeling very confident," said Salima Davidson, 
Penn State's senior setter. "But some critical points were given up at some 
critical times." 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State hit better than UCLA, .210-.156, in the match. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford (31-1) played well despite being awakened at 6 a.m. by a 
malfunctioning fire alarm in its hotel, the team trudging out in the rain in 
pajamas. 
</P>
<P>
 Kristin Folkl, a freshman, led Stanford over Ohio State (29-3) with 15 kills. 
She had only four errors in 26 attempts, hitting .423. 
</P>
<P>
 The final will be a rematch of the 1992 championship game, when UCLA went 
undefeated before losing the title to Stanford in four games at New Mexico.

OWNERS KEEP THE LID ON THE CAP -- FOR NOW; BASEBALL: THEY GIVE THE EXECUTIVE 
COUNCIL APPROVAL TO DECLARE AN IMPASSE AND IMPLEMENT THE PROPOSAL IF THERE 
ISN'T A SETTLEMENT WITH PLAYERS BY DEC. 22. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Major league baseball owners took the anticipated step Thursday, but not in 
the anticipated form. 
</P>
<P>
 They voted, 25-3, with the Baltimore Orioles, Toronto Blue Jays and New York 
Mets opposing, to give their executive council the authority to declare an 
impasse in their bargaining dispute with the players' union and implement their 
salary-cap proposal. However, they also gave their negotiating committee seven 
more days to break the stalemate with the union. 
</P>
<P>
 If that stalemate still exists on Dec. 22, the implementation goes into 
effect, acting Commissioner Bud Selig said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have repeatedly said that implementation isn't the long-term solution," 
Selig said. "We need to reach an agreement at the bargaining table, not in 
Congress or the courts, and if there's even a scintilla of hope we have to 
pursue it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, we're appealing to the union for reason and common sense. Seven more 
days." 
</P>
<P>
 The bargaining talks will probably resume under special mediator William J. 
Usery in Washington on Monday, which would reduce those seven days to four. 
</P>
<P>
 Union leader Donald Fehr, reached in New York, called it a positive 
development "but I can't tell you what it will lead to." 
</P>
<P>
 The implementation would have gone into effect today if the union had refused 
to postpone two roster deadlines, but Fehr said the players would agree to move 
Saturday's deadline for clubs to offer arbitration to their own free agents to 
Dec. 23, along with the Dec. 20 deadline for tendering 1995 contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without agreeing that an impasse exists or their right to declare an impasse, 
we're glad they've taken this step," Fehr said of the delay. "I think everyone 
would agree that there was a different and constructive tone (during the final 
48 hours of talks in Rye Brook, N.Y.)." 
</P>
<P>
 It is difficult to say whether the owners' decision to postpone implementation 
for a second time -- they canceled a Dec. 5 meeting at the urging of Usery -- 
is merely the latest chapter in what some believe has been a shameful attempt 
by both sides to establish evidence of good-faith bargaining if that becomes an 
issue before the National Labor Relations Board or whether their differences 
were legitimately narrowed in Rye Brook. 
</P>
<P>
 It was learned that the owners voted approval of implementation despite a 
warning by the attorney for Fred Wilpon, co-owner of the Mets. Wilpon brought 
his own attorney to Thursday's meeting for the purpose of advising fellow 
owners they can not win a union challenge on implementation before the NLRB. 
</P>
<P>
 Selig said the legal questions -- the NLRB has already announced it is issuing 
two complaints against the owners for failing to make a $7.8-million pension 
payment to the players from All-Star game receipts -- are not an issue. But the 
potential consequences, financial and otherwise, could be significant, and one 
aspect of a union challenge to implementation would be that an impasse doesn't 
exist. 
</P>
<P>
 "I seriously question whether they can prove it does after the last two or 
three days in Rye Brook," a union lawyer said, referring to an ongoing exchange 
of proposals and concepts and what seemed to be, sources on both sides said, 
displays of flexibility from both on the payroll tax and how the owners' 
revenue-sharing pool would be created and funneled. 
</P>
<P>
 A source said that even after Wednesday's talks broke off and the owners' 
negotiating committee arrived in Chicago there was clandestine contact between 
the sides. 
</P>
<P>
 John Harrington, chairman of the negotiating committee and chief executive 
officer of the Boston Red Sox, said the committee decided to recommend a delay 
while flying to Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 "The philosophical gap (relating to a mechanism that will produce a stronger 
drag on salaries and a closer relationship between revenue and salaries) is 
still so large it's hard to say we're any closer," Harrington said. "But the 
fact we're still talking is a measure of progress in itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're appealing to the players, their wives and families. Implementation is 
not in our hearts. We're extending an olive branch." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Fehr, of the olive branch: "I hope that's what this turns out to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, Atlanta Brave President Stan Kasten said, implementation will only 
"escalate the rhetoric, harden feelings and prolong this war." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday general managers were briefed on how the new system works in a 
morning meeting and quietly selected a committee to deal with the concept of 
replacement players if the camps open without an agreement next spring, when 
the union would resume the strike. 
</P>
<P>
 The ensuing decision to delay implementation pleased Dodger owner Peter 
O'Malley, who has lobbied for a partnership with the players. 
</P>
<P>
 "Implementation is the direct opposite of a partnership and should absolutely 
be the last resort," he said. "I had hoped common sense would prevail (in the 
negotiations). It makes no sense to have to implement." 
</P>
<P>
 Sense? The latest spending spree by the owners makes even less. How does it 
relate to the quest for cost control and certainty? 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of money in baseball," Kasten said. "There's a lot of money 
that can be paid out. 
</P>
<P>
 "But whether it's a salary cap or a tax mechanism, we're seeking a better 
connection between what's coming in and what's going out." 
</P>
<P>
 They will look for it at the table again. Only seven more days, they insist. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps. 
</P>
<P>

the Reds, meaning Kevin Mitchell is probably gone. C10

ORANGE COUNTY HALL OF FAME; HE HAS NEVER RUN SCARED; SCOTT, A STANDOUT DISTANCE 
RUNNER IN 1970-80S, DIDN'T GIVE UP IN HIS BATTLE AGAINST CANCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Here comes Steve Scott, running hard, legs churning, arms pumping. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this his final lap? Or is he simply breaking from another starting line? 
</P>
<P>
 Even he can't answer definitively. His career is at a crossroads, and he can't 
help but wonder whether there are more quality miles to be run. Certainly, he 
hopes he's not finished. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing is for sure: Scott will always be considered one of the two great 
American men's milers. He ran too well for too long to be thought of as 
anything less. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1970s, he set UC Irvine records for the 800 meters, 1,500 and mile, 
marks that might not be broken in his lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1980s, he made three U.S. Olympic teams and set a national record in 
the mile that might last into the next century. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1990s, he competed in his fifth consecutive Olympic trials, competing 
against much younger men. He didn't win a spot on the 1992 team, but they knew 
he was there. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, he's battling cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Unwilling to settle for anything less than a clear-cut victory, Scott said he 
wants to return to a high level of fitness, perhaps make another run at the 
Olympics and break 4 minutes for the mile when he's 40. 
</P>
<P>
 New challenges to be faced and conquered. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, Scott will be enshrined into the Orange County Sports Hall of Fame. 
You're supposed to be retired to enter, but Scott isn't ready to quit. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps that's why it's difficult for him to answer questions about his place 
in U.S. track and field history. In his mind, there's so much more running to 
be done. 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, his recovery dominates his days. He had successful lymphatic 
surgery in June. 
</P>
<P>
 "The recovery from surgery is lasting longer than I thought," said Scott, 38, 
who lives in Leucadia, in north San Diego County. "I have the drive and the 
desire, but I'm not sure my body is able to do anything seriously again. I'll 
continue running the rest of my life. I get a lot out of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if I'm going to run, why not race too?" 
</P>
<P>
 At present, Scott is reduced to jogging at an easy pace. It's frustrating for 
someone so used to covering ground so quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never had this much time off," he said. "Maybe when I was a freshman or 
sophomore in high school." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if he never runs another step, Scott's status appears secure. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, he said a track nut, a real student of marks and accomplishments, 
sent Scott a letter. In it, the man compared Scott's times and finishes to 
those of Jim Ryun. The man concluded that Scott was superior to Ryun. 
</P>
<P>
 Vince O'Boyle, UC Irvine track and cross-country coach since the mid-1980s, 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We recognize the Ryuns and (Marty) Liquoris, but Scott's got to go ahead 
now," O'Boyle said. "Look at his longevity. Steve is still basically at it. 
He's like a Nolan Ryan. He's still more competitive then some of the young 
people coming up. That says a lot for a human being." 
</P>
<P>
 Gratifying words to be sure, but Scott finds it difficult to look back. When 
he's asked to speak at school assemblies, he has to remind himself not to tell 
the same story again and again. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was competing it seemed to be good policy to look ahead, to grab 
whatever lesson was to be learned from a race -- good or bad -- and move on. 
There was always the next race, the next lap, the next mile. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I think I am (the best U.S. miler)," he said. "But you can't 
fight a legend. We're talking about a different era when Jim Ryun ran. It's 
like Babe Ruth and Hank Aaron. Babe Ruth will always be a legend. Even though 
Hank Aaron hit many more home runs, the home run king is still Babe Ruth." 
</P>
<P>
 A closer look reveals much in Scott's favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryun remains the fastest teen-ager in history, running a world record 3:51.3 
when he was 19 in 1966. A year later, he improved to 3:51.1, a mark that made 
him the favorite in the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 But high altitude and the gut-wrenching tactics of Kenya's Kip Keino left Ryun 
with the silver medal. Four years later, Ryun fell during a qualifying heat in 
Munich, and his career was essentially history. 
</P>
<P>
 Liquori picked up the torch through the mid-1970s, but the event was ripe for 
Scott's picking when he left UCI in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott quickly graduated from standout collegian to world-class miler. At 
Irvine, he ran 800 meters in 1:47.6, 1,500 in 3:36.1 and the mile in 3:53.93. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's mind-boggling to think a guy (from Irvine) could do that," O'Boyle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott then plunged headlong into the great mile wars of that era. 
</P>
<P>
 Great Britain's Sebastian Coe, who won gold medals in the '80 and '84 Games, 
and Steve Ovett (bronze in '80) were clearly the best. But Scott was never far 
behind. And on a cool July night in 1982 at Oslo, he ran a mile faster than any 
other U.S. citizen -- 3:47.69. It remains the fifth-fastest mile ever run. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott went on to finish second in the 1,500 at the 1983 World Championships, 
was a disappointing 10th in the '84 Olympics and a surprising fifth in Seoul in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
 He set American records, indoors and outdoors, in the 1,500, mile, 2,000 and 
3,000. And he ran under 4 minutes for the mile an amazing 135 times, far more 
than any other American. 
</P>
<P>
 In the years since 1982, some Americans have come close to Scott's mile 
record, but it still stands, a tangible symbol of his dominance in the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, it's difficult for him to come up with a U.S. runner capable of breaking 
3:47.69. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steve Holman has the potential to run faster than I did, but he won't have 
the long career or the consistency," Scott said. "He's very injury prone. The 
guy has the natural ability to go under 3:47. Will he have the opportunity?" 
</P>
<P>
 Scott always seemed to avoid serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be able to bounce back," he said. "The ability to get through 
hardship, whether it's a bad race or an injury that knocks you out for a year. 
One of the keys is mental tenacity, stepping to the line and getting the most 
out of yourself in a race." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Len Miller hammered that notion into Scott and his teammates at UCI. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was like a drill sergeant," Scott said, laughing. "He dedicated his life 
to us. He was my best, and worst, memory of Irvine." 
</P>
<P>
 Once on the European circuit, Scott found those same qualities of toughness 
and unyielding commitment to winning in New Zealand's John Walker, the first 
man to run a mile in less than 3:50. 
</P>
<P>
 "He taught me a lot about training, about the sport, about attitude," Scott 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 When cancer struck this year, Scott called upon a lifetime of tenacity. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, his doctor went searching for 15 possible cancerous lymph nodes. 
Scott said he felt more nervous before important races than before the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 There is less chance of recurring cancer with each passing month, Scott said, 
and so far, monthly X-rays have shown everything is fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Since June, he has had time to reflect. What stands out, more than medals or 
records, is his love of running. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a while there, in the early days, it was more difficult to get out the 
door to run," Scott said. "The thing that would drive me out to run was that I 
had to perform. I was on scholarship in college. I had to train because I 
wanted to make the high school team. 
</P>
<P>
 "After awhile, things changed. I was out there because I wanted to be out 
there. It was fun. The challenge was enough. I'd go for a 20-mile run and get 
rained on. It wasn't a drag. It was fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so hard when I had cancer and had to take all this time off. I love 
running long runs on the trails in the mountains. It's something I truly 
missed." 
</P>
<P>
 And he's not ready to give it up.

BETTIS LONE RAM TO MAKE PRO BOWL; PRO FOOTBALL: FOUR RAIDERS -- MCGLOCKTON, 
BROWN, MCDANIEL AND WISNIEWSKI -- NAMED TO AFC TEAM FOR FEB. 5 GAME IN 
HONOLULU. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ram tailback Jerome Bettis made the Pro Bowl for the second consecutive year, 
despite being on pace to fall short of not only his announced goal of 2,000 
yards rushing but also his 1,429 yards as a rookie last season. 
</P>
<P>
 But his 970 yards in 296 carries ranks fourth among NFC rushers behind 
Detroit's Barry Sanders (1,721), Emmitt Smith of Dallas (1,410) and Minnesota's 
Terry Allen (975). Bettis averages only 3.3 yards per carry and has ran for 
only three touchdowns -- the lowest among the top 10 NFC rushers in those 
categories. 
</P>
<P>
 Four Raiders were named to the AFC team for the game Feb. 5 in Honolulu. 
Defensive tackle Chester McGlockton, wide receiver Tim Brown, cornerback Terry 
McDaniel and guard Steve Wisniewski were selected by NFL players, coaches and 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering his stats on a 4-10 team, was Bettis surprised to be making 
another trip to Hawaii? 
</P>
<P>
 "This was definitely a pleasant surprise," he said. "It was a rough year, but 
I think I was still able to do some positive things. I'm just happy I'm 
considered one of the best backs in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people are looking past that whole thing of me having huge numbers. 
They're saying, 'How did he perform, is he having a decent year?' Look at the 
stats and I'm up there past a lot of backs who are having pretty good years. 
What does that say? Am I having a bad year?" 
</P>
<P>
 Struggling behind an injured offensive line for part of the season, Bettis 
hasn't rushed for more than 100 yards in a game since Oct. 2 against Atlanta. 
He was slowed by a back injury earlier in the season and has averaged 31 yards 
and 12 carries per game the past five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jerome has had a hard year," Ram offensive coordinator Chick Harris said. "He 
has fought through it. I'm sure the productivity he wanted isn't there, but he 
has been a lot of our offense, and a lot of people respect that when we've 
played against them." 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis took fullback Tim Lester with him as a guest to last year's Pro Bowl, a 
reward for Lester blocking for him. But with Lester on the bench this season, 
replaced by Howard Griffith, Bettis plans to take his mother to the game in 
Hawaii this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis was the Rams' only Pro Bowl selection. Defensive tackle Sean Gilbert, 
who made the team last year with Bettis, has been slowed by tendinitis in his 
shoulders and has only three sacks this season. 
</P>
<P>
 McGlockton gave himself four years to make the Pro Bowl when he was drafted in 
the first round from Clemson in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Said McGlockton, after beating his schedule by two years: "This is something 
that you want to achieve when you first get in the league, to be considered one 
of the best. It's like someone took a big weight from off my shoulders." 
</P>
<P>
 McGlockton's relief is understandable, considering the injuries he has had to 
overcome. As a rookie, he was limited to 10 games because of a preseason foot 
injury. Last season, he sat out the playoffs because of a broken leg he 
suffered in the final game of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 McGlockton, who has 49 tackles and 7 1/2 sacks this season, was the third 
defensive tackle selected, behind starters Cortez Kennedy of the Seattle 
Seahawks and Michael Dean Perry of the Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
 McDaniel has scored three defensive touchdowns this season and leads the team 
with seven interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Raider Coach Art Shell: "Most of the guys who make the squad are playing 
at a high level. Steve (Wisniewski) makes it every year and he's deserving of 
it. Same thing goes for Tim Brown. With Terry, this is his third selection and 
I thought that he should have made it a year or two earlier before that." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Wisniewski: "Personally, I think that I had a good year. But I'm in my 
sixth year in the league and I would love to trade (playing in the Pro Bowl) 
for a shot at playing in the Super Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
 Two-time Super Bowl champion Dallas, led by running back Emmitt Smith and 
quarterback Troy Aikman, put a league-high 11 players on the NFC team. The San 
Francisco 49ers had nine players, including wide receiver Jerry Rice and 
quarterback Steve Young.  
</P>
<P>
 The Pittsburgh Steelers led the AFC with six players voted to the team, 
linebackers Greg Lloyd and Kevin Greene, cornerback Rod Woodson, safety Carnell 
Lake, guard Duval Love and center Dermontti Dawson. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego tied the Raiders with four players: linebacker Junior Seau, 
defensive end Leslie O'Neal, running back Natrone Means and kicker John Carney.

<P>
 Angel first baseman J.T. Snow underwent arthroscopic surgery on his left 
shoulder Thursday at Anaheim Memorial Hospital.The surgery was to repair a 
partial tear of cartilage in the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow was injured while diving for a fly ball when playing left field in the 
Venezuelan Winter League. He is expected back for the start of spring training.

 Also Thursday, former Angel reliever Joe Grahe signed a triple-A contract with 
the Colorado Rockies with an option for the 1996 season. Grahe became a free

 Chairs were tossed, a locker room was trashed and 47 fouls were called -- all 
in a girls' high school basketball game in Vero Beach, Fla., that was called 
with more than a minute left in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Edward's was leading Lincoln Park Academy, 35-31, with 1:18 to play Monday 
when the referee stopped the game after Lincoln Park Coach Maina Mack refused 
to leave the gym after consecutive technical fouls, bringing the number to six 
for the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Players from Lincoln Park then tossed their chairs and damaged the visitors' 
locker room, ripping shower curtains and tearing up benches. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't a very nice game," observed Coach Mike Redstone of St. Edward's. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who was the first NHL player to score 50 goals in a season? 
</P>
<P>
 All aboard: The University of Pittsburgh's basketball team has a senior from 
the Bronx named Orlando Antigua, prompting Dan Shaughnessy of the Boston Globe 
to write:  
</P>
<P>
 "We're not sure if he's one-way or round-trip."

 Timber trashing: Dan Barreiro of the Star Tribune of Minneapolis on the 
still-struggling Minnesota Timberwolves, who are winless in 10 home games this 
season:  
</P>
<P>
 "A reporter likes to refer to these Wolves as the Trembling Timber-Chihuahuas. 
A year ago, he received an angry letter from a Chihuahua owner. 'I resent you 
likening my dog to that group of mongrels,' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "The man has a point. No self-respecting Chihuahua should have to carry that 
burden around his scrawny neck."

 Showtime: What does a baseball manager do while waiting out the strike? It's 
dancing, no less, for Tony La Russa of the Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 La Russa will perform today in the Oakland Ballet's performance of the 
Nutcracker, along with Athletic trainer Barry Weinberg and coach Dave McKay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the hardest thing is getting up in front of people out of your 
element," La Russa said. "It's hard to go up there and risk falling down or 
doing something embarrassing." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back: On this day in 1973, O.J. Simpson of the Buffalo Bills rushed 
for 200 yards in a 34-14 victory over the New York Jets and set an NFL season 
rushing record of 2,003 yards.

 Trivia answer: Maurice (Rocket) Richard of the Montreal Canadiens in 1944-45, 
making him the only NHL player to score 50 goals in a 50-game season.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / LAS VEGAS BOWL; BAILEY HANDLES ROLE CHANGE IN UNLV VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Henry Bailey had rushed 16 times for only 50 yards all season. Wide receiver 
was his position. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Thursday. Bailey rushed for three touchdowns and caught a scoring pass 
as Nevada Las Vegas celebrated its first appearance in the Las Vegas Bowl by 
routing Central Michigan, 52-24. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey scored the first two times UNLV had the ball as the Rebels opened up a 
31-10 halftime lead and cruised to the victory over a Central Michigan team 
playing without All-American running back Brian Pruitt, who missed the game 
because of a bruised knee. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a great back but there's a lot of things we didn't do," Central Michigan 
Coach Dick Flynn said. "His presence may not have made the difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey's did. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always wanted to do that with Henry," UNLV Coach Jeff Horton said. 
"Once No. 33 gets a step on you, look out." 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey had steps on the Chippewa defense all night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't expect us to come out and run so much but they gave it to us," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing before a home crowd of 17,562 that included as many Central Michigan 
fans as those from UNLV, the Rebels (7-5) scored 38 consecutive points to open 
the major college bowl season. 
</P>
<P>
 UNLV took only 41 seconds to score on its first possession of the second half. 
The Rebels went 75 yards in five plays on their next possession to go ahead, 
45-10. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey, alternating between lining up as a wide receiver and in the backfield, 
had 177 yards in the first half. He ran for two scores and caught a pass for 
another. He opened the second half for the Rebels by going over from a yard out 
for his fourth touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Central Michigan finished 9-3.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Major league baseball owners Thursday gave the go-ahead for television 
producer Tom Werner to sell the San Diego Padres to Texas computer software 
millionaire John Moores, who generated his fortune off a $1,000 stake in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale is expected to be completed in the next few weeks, said Larry 
Lucchino, a former Baltimore Oriole president who is assisting Moores. 
</P>
<P>
 A source said Moores will pay about $80 million to be majority owner of the 
worst team in the big leagues during the strike-interrupted 1994 season. Werner 
and 14 other Southern California businessmen bought the Padres from Joan Kroc 
for $75 million in 1990 and are expected to retain a minority interest.

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: FOX PLAYING THIS ONE FOR MORE THAN IT'S WORTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sports television has given new meaning to the term checkbook journalism.  
</P>
<P>
 The way it works is, a television network hires a big-name, out-of-work coach 
for $650,000 or so. Then when the rumors start circulating about the coach 
returning to coaching, the network doesn't have to chase down the story. It has 
already bought and paid for the exclusive. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC fined-tuned this practice with the likes of Bill Parcells, Pat Riley and 
Bill Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Fox is taking it to a new level with Jimmy Johnson. The former Dallas 
Cowboy coach has said he will announce his plans on Sunday's NFL pregame show 
and the network is using that as a promotional tool. 
</P>
<P>
 All week, Fox has been ballyhooing the big announcement, and today network 
publicist Vince Wladika is flying out to Los Angeles from New York for the big 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 More than likely, it's much ado about nothing. There's no way Johnson can 
announce that he's going to coach the Philadelphia Eagles or Tampa Bay 
Buccaneers, as rumored, since neither team has a coaching vacancy. And he 
certainly can't announce he will coach the St. Louis Rams, whose move is not 
yet official. 
</P>
<P>
 Odds are that Johnson will simply say he has decided to stay in television for 
another year. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, he could say he is going to pursue coaching opportunities, but why would 
he announce that now? 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Ackerson, who produces Fox's pregame show, said Johnson on his own said 
last Sunday he would have an announcement Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't plan this or script it," Ackerson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe not, but Fox sure seized the opportunity to boost ratings. Pretty foxy, 
actually. 
</P>
<P>
 And Johnson is no dummy. He is a quick learner and already knows how to play 
the network television game. The object is to get good ratings, and that's what 
this is all about. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Foxy network: Ackerson, asked earlier this week about where the 
announcement would be placed in the show, said, "We'll all sit down (today) to 
format the show." 
</P>
<P>
 But count on Johnson's announcement coming at the end, with plenty of teases 
beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox is in a ratings war with NBC, and the network knows it will win big on 
Sunday, beating its rival at its own game with a bought-and-paid-for 
"exclusive." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Johnson: He also works for HBO and was grilled about his plans on the 
pay-cable network's "Inside the NFL," which was aired Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though he didn't give a definitive answer, he said Fox had not pressured 
him to hold the announcement until Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox pays Johnson $650,000, HBO $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 As we said, Johnson is no dummy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last add Fox: Some rivals have criticized Fox for treating the Johnson story 
so frivolously. Last Sunday, Fox had Johnson trying on Tampa Bay Buccaneer and 
Philadelphia Eagle caps, even though Sam Wyche and Rich Kotite are still 
coaching those teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were spoofing ourselves," Ackerson said. "We were saying all these rumors 
and reports are getting ridiculous. Sam Wyche himself didn't think it was a big 
deal. He said, 'I've got a Fox hat.' He got the joke." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. rarity: With the Rams and Raiders both on the road Sunday, the Los 
Angeles market will get that rare extra NFL game. 
</P>
<P>
 The bonus game for L.A. is San Diego at the New York Jets on NBC at 10 a.m., 
and it will go up against the Rams and Chicago Bears on Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 The second game of an NBC doubleheader is also a good one, Cleveland at 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the Raiders' game at Seattle at 5 p.m. will be on Channel 9 and ESPN. The 
NFL requires an over-the-air station to carry games on cable television 
involving local teams. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday games too: It's quite a weekend for NFL fans, what with two games on 
Saturday as well. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be Minnesota at Detroit on Fox at 9:30 a.m. and Denver at San 
Francisco on NBC at 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC sideline reporter Jim Gray will be busy this weekend. He'll work the game 
in San Francisco on Saturday, then take a red-eye flight to Pittsburgh to work 
Sunday's Brown-Steeler game. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 End of an era: Roy Firestone will tape his final regular "Up Close" program 
for ESPN on Monday, when George Raveling is his guest. The show will air that 
night at 9:30. 
</P>
<P>
 Shows taped earlier will continue through the week until Friday. The final 
original show of the Firestone era, to be shown at 9:30 p.m. next Friday, will 
feature Wilt Chamberlain. 
</P>
<P>
 Firestone is discontinuing the nightly show to concentrate on specials and 
other television opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 New host Chris Myers takes over the nightly show Jan. 23. Between Dec. 23 and 
Jan. 23, ESPN will show "Up Close" repeats and specials. There will be a 
14-year retrospective Jan. 6 at 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Ticket's "Press Box," which is expanding to serve seven other regional 
sports networks beginning Jan. 1, has hired three new anchors. They are Andre 
Aldridge, Randy Sparage and Paul Sunderland. Aldridge, a USC graduate, worked 
at Channel 4 as a sports producer and reporter, was a regular at KMPC when it 
was all sports and has done fill-in work at several L.A. stations. Sparage, 
another USC graduate who was a Times sportswriter in the early 1980s, comes 
from the CBS affiliate in Dallas. Sunderland has done a variety of jobs for 
Prime Ticket and also works for NBC and ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern Section Division I championship football game between Mater Dei 
and Bishop Amat last Saturday on Channel 13 got an impressive 6.0 rating. The 
station used nine cameras to cover the game and it was a good telecast, but we 
sure could have done without sideline reporter Vic (the Brick) Jacobs, who was 
once fired by Channel 13. Particularly bad were Jacobs' interviews with Mater 
Dei players during the game. They were intrusive and unnecessary. "We didn't 
know he was going to do that," said play-by-play announcer Randy Rosenbloom. . 
. . At least Jacobs wasn't as bad as Randy Kerdoon last year. Kerdoon showed up 
to do halftime analysis in a Ram jersey and shoulder pads and tried a few 
inappropriate jokes. For example, he brought out a balloon with a women's face 
on it and pretended to be in a singles bar delivering a few "aerial passes." . 
. . It worked out nicely for Fox to use four Mater Dei defensive backs to 
illustrate defensive alignments on its NFL pregame show last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 For the record: The last Raider home game on "Monday Night Football" was a 
1985 San Diego game, not a 1983 Miami game. . . . UCLA radio commentator 
Marques Johnson believed he was unfairly criticized in this space last week for 
not questioning the call that sent J.R. Henderson to the free-throw line for 
his game-winning free throws against Kentucky. "When I saw the play on the 
monitor I immediately said, 'Boy, that wasn't much of a foul.' But we didn't 
have access to a TV monitor." XTRA should do something about that. Most radio 
announcers have a monitor nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Recommended viewing: "In this Corner . . . Boxing's Historic Battles" is 
another outstanding HBO documentary. The first showing will be Tuesday at 10 
p.m. The special examines four fights: Jack Johnson vs. Jim Jeffries in 1910, 
the second Joe Louis-Max Schmeling bout in 1938, the second Muhammad Ali-Sonny 
Liston fight in 1965, and the first Ali-Joe Frazier fight in 1971. Jim Lampley 
is the host. . . . On this week's edition of "This Is the NFL" Sunday at 8:30 
a.m. on Channel 11, NFL Films names the 1976 Raider offensive line as the 
greatest of all time. That line included Art Shell, Gene Upshaw, John Vella, 
George Buehler and Dave Dalby. 
</P>
<P>
 The taped Wendy's Three-Tour Challenge on ABC Saturday at 1:30 p.m. and Sunday 
at 12:30 p.m. from PGA West in La Quinta is the only golf competition that has 
players from the PGA Tour, the Senior PGA Tour and the LPGA Tour competing head 
to head. This is another event put on by Jack Nicklaus' production company, 
Golden Bear International. . . . On ESPN's "Outside the Lines" series Wednesday 
at 4:30 p.m., the state of high school athletics in the '90s is explored. . . . 
Doug Flutie has been hired to work the Sun Bowl on Dec. 30 with Jim Nantz. 
</P>
<P>
 Radio beat: Steve Edwards and Eric Tracy will do their 5-8 p.m. "Sportstalk" 
show today from Hollywood Park. . . . Brian Golden and Doug Krikorian will be 
on the air six days next week, beginning Sunday with a 2:30-5 p.m. show on 
KMPC. The rest of the week they will fill in for vacationing Edwards and Tracy 
on KABC. . . . Ram radio commentator Deacon Jones will do the sports spots on 
the KMPC morning show next week.

RAMS' LYLE FORCES FATHER TO SHIFT FOOTBALL ALLEGIANCE; NFL: ROOKIE FREE 
SAFETY'S DAD PLAYED WITH CHICAGO BEARS, L.A.'S OPPONENT ON SUNDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Garry Lyle knows that on Sunday he will remember his first game with the 
Chicago Bears at Soldier Field, and how the artificial turf there at the time 
turned as hard as concrete when the wind blew off Lake Michigan in December. 
</P>
<P>
 He will remember the team's last game at Wrigley Field, of starting at safety 
on a defense with Dick Butkus. 
</P>
<P>
 And he'll recall playing as a rookie under team founder George Halas in his 
final season as coach in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-seven years later, Lyle and his family will gather at a sports bar in 
St. Petersburg, Fla., on Sunday to watch a satellite feed of the Bear-Ram game. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Lyle will be rooting for his former team, mind you. His allegiance is 
with his son, Keith, a rookie free safety with the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do I have torn allegiances this weekend," Garry said, laughing. "I have a lot 
of warm thoughts about playing back in Chicago, but I want you to know this: I 
want the Rams to win, and I don't want it to be close." 
</P>
<P>
 Throw in an interception by Keith, and Garry just might buy a round of chilled 
ones for the gang. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to be there for that game, especially because it's where I 
played for so long," Garry said. "But I'm not going. It's tough to sit there in 
the stands, knowing how much he wants to start. I know it's driving him batty. 
It drove me crazy when I came into the league too." 
</P>
<P>
 Garry Lyle, a third-round pick from George Washington, played from 1967-74 
with the Bears. It took him three years to move into the starting lineup on 
teams that didn't make the playoffs once in his time there. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Lyle, a third-round pick from Virginia last spring, has been a standout 
on special teams for the Rams and has played in nickel packages on defense. He 
showed promise early in the season, intercepting a pass in his first 
regular-season game, against Arizona, and picking off one by Joe Montana at 
Kansas City in Week 4. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things have been working out well," Lyle said. "I got some early 
interceptions and breakups. The past couple games I haven't had an opportunity 
to make a play. I'm just learning a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Projected as the team's free safety of the future, Lyle has backed up Anthony 
Newman for most of the season and will play behind Marquez Pope, who moved over 
from strong safety, on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Rams, losers of five consecutive games, at 4-10 and out of the 
playoff race, young players such as Lyle are getting more playing time. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Garry, better than anyone else, understands what his son is going 
through. He played sparingly on a 7-6-1 Bear team his rookie season, and 
suffered through a 1-13 record in 1969, the year before he became a starter. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife and I were talking about Keith the other day," Garry said. "We 
realized that he has never been part of something that wasn't in a winning 
situation. All the way back to youth sports, he was always on winning programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've wondered about how he's handled it, but you know there's always going to 
be adversity in your life. The key is if he learns from it." 
</P>
<P>
 Garry was drafted as a running back by the Bears but played both safety and 
wide receiver his first three years. His best season was in 1973, when he came 
back from a knee injury the previous season and finished with 88 tackles and 
five interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 He played four seasons at Wrigley Field -- "an old wreck of a place, but it 
was home" -- before the team moved to Soldier Field in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 "Going to Soldier was quite an adjustment," Garry said. "It was an AstroTurf 
field back then, very hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can remember walking out from the locker room, looking up and seeing water 
running down out of the cracks in the place." 
</P>
<P>
 Soldier Field has undergone a face lift since then. The artificial turf has 
been replaced by natural grass, and many of the cracks in the stadium have been 
filled. But a sense of tradition remains, one that has stuck with Garry Lyle 
since he left the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, the younger Lyle will pull on jersey No. 35 in Soldier Field's 
visitors' locker room, the same room where his father watched game films a 
quarter-century ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've thought about that quite a bit," Garry said. "I've wondered where he 
will be in the locker room before the game, that maybe I had been sitting in 
that same spot years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "But that's just in my deepest thoughts. I know if I tell Keith, he'll say, 
'Aw, Dad, why are you bringing that up?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Quiet and unassuming, the younger Lyle knows his father's playing days only 
through scrapbooks and watching films and tapes. He and his twin brother, 
Brian, were 2 when their father left football. 
</P>
<P>
 But they grew more inquisitive as they grew older. What was their father like 
as a player? What did he look like in a Bear uniform? Did he really play with 
Butkus and Gale Sayers? 
</P>
<P>
 Garry gave them an answer by sending away to NFL Films for some highlight 
reels. The kids gathered around and. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Made fun of me," Garry remembers. "They kept saying, 'Dad, you can't do any 
better than that?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Keith smiled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I've seen a little bit of him," he said. "Not enough to study. But from 
what he tells me, we have a lot of the same characteristics -- quickness, 
reading and breaking on the ball, stuff like that." 
</P>
<P>
 His size -- 6 feet 2 and 204 pounds -- and quickness made him a natural for 
basketball at Marshall High in Falls Church, Va., where he played against Grant 
Hill, the Detroit Piston rookie and son of former Dallas Cowboy standout Calvin 
Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith played both quarterback and safety at Marshall, but moved to safety full 
time in the first week of practice at Virginia. A three-year starter, he 
intercepted five passes as a senior with the Cavaliers, who led the nation with 
22 that year. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith has been with the Rams for 14 games now, and Garry has made it to five 
of them. An executive with Xerox in St. Petersburg, Garry attends as many games 
as his business schedule and cross-country flights will allow. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole family was at last week's loss at Tampa Bay, and they're planning a 
trip to Anaheim for the Rams' finale against the Washington Redskins on Dec. 
24. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sunday will stand out for both father and son, former player and current 
player. Just don't ask Dad to pull for his old team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chicago is a great city," Garry said. "But it would be nice to see the Rams 
go in there and steal a win. 
</P>
<P>
 "They need it."

<P>
 Lowlights, dark nights and weird sights of Football, 1994, as culled from the 
Dead Season Scrolls: The Colleges  
</P>
<P>
 -- Cat Got Your . . . What? The University of Kentucky announced it would 
alter its official Wildcat logo after complaints that the animal's rolled 
tongue resembled a penis. 
</P>
<P>
 -- They Also Had to Listen to Barry Manilow: Florida State put its marching 
band on probation for three years after revelations that new members had been 
blindfolded and forced to drink alcohol during hazing rituals.  
</P>
<P>
 -- He Should Have Stuck with the "University of Spoiled Children": In a book 
on Stanford football, Coach Bill (the ex-Genius) Walsh dismissed USC as 
Yesterday University. Stanford later fell to Yesterday U, 20-27. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Yesterday's Coach: After a 7-14-1 record over the last two years, Walsh 
resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Sky Is Falling, the Sky Is Falling: Security officials at Iowa's 
Kinnick Stadium moved cheerleaders away from the student section because they 
were being pelted by eggs, marshmallows, bottles and, in one case, a dead 
chicken.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Glitch of the Year: In the second week of October, the New York Times 
computer rankings rated Kansas State as the nation's best team. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hangover U: Georgia Coach Ray Goff said the school might move the starting 
time of its games to 4 p.m. or later because students were too groggy from 
all-night parties to attend 1 p.m. games. The Pros  
</P>
<P>
 -- Where He'll Set a Record for Most Consecutive Appearances on the Floor: 
Steve Largent, the former Seattle receiver, was elected to the House of 
Representatives from Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A Case of Randall Cunningham Envy: After Arizona began 0-3, Coach Buddy 
Ryan promised: "I think you're going to see a different Eagle offense next 
week." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lost in Space: Cincinnati punt returner Corey Sawyer called for a fair 
catch on his own one-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wide Ref: Pittsburgh quarterback Neil O'Donnell, confused by the 
yellow-and-black striped jerseys worn by the Steelers for an anniversary 
tribute, threw a sideline pass to an individual wearing a similar outfit -- a 
member of the officiating crew. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It's Marion Butts' Team Too: New England Coach Bill Parcells told NBC that 
the team's ground game was hampered by linemen who were "blocking their men but 
turning and putting their rear ends in the hole" created for the running back. 
</P>
<P>
 -- We're Still Not Sold on Jerry Rice: The Bottom Ten predicted that 
Indianapolis' Marshall Faulk would be the Flop of the Year.

recognize him.

during the fourth quarter of a game. A restroom break. 
</P>
<P>
 What an Insult -- to Iowa State: Switzer said the Cincinnati Bengals reminded 
him of Iowa State. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers as National Symbol: After Rep. Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) was 
reelected as the Democratic House leader, an angry Rep. W.J. (Billy) Tauzin 
(D-La.) said: "When a team has a 1-9 record, they generally hire a new coach." 
</P>
<P>
 -- How's That New Anaheim Stadium Coming? Orange County's problems were 
foreshadowed by the Rams, whose offense was bankrupt all year.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; LINEBACKERS NOT AMONG THE CHOSEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tailback Jerome Bettis was the only member of the Rams' 4-10 team to make the 
Pro Bowl. Coach Chuck Knox says linebackers Shane Conlan and Roman Phifer might 
have been overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
 "They would be two players who would come to mind without a whole lot of 
thinking," Knox said. "But with our record as it is now, you're not going to 
have many on there. Teams that win have more people on there. I can remember 
when we would have seven or eight players on there going 12-2 or 12-4." 
</P>
<P>
 Conlan, a three-time Pro Bowl selection with Buffalo, leads the Rams in 
tackles with 95 and says he is playing some of the best football of his 
eight-year career. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably my best year but there are some great players out there," 
Conlan said. "I've been there three times, so let somebody else go. It's a nice 
honor and it would have been fun. It just didn't work out." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not always fair, but the majority of the time they get the right guys in 
there. There's some exceptions every year." 
</P>
<P>
 Ram coaches think Phifer, who's third on the team in tackles with 79, has been 
overlooked the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Phifer becomes an unrestricted free agent at the end of the season and the 
Rams have been trying, unsuccessfully, to sign him to a long-term deal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if the 30-degree temperatures expected for the game at Chicago could 
give the Bears an advantage, Knox turned to a tongue-in-cheek explanation of 
the conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scientists have told us that you have to be in a climate for 'X' number of 
years before the hair follicles grow longer, before the skin gets thicker and 
you become immune to the cold," Knox said. "I don't know how much the blood 
vessels will thicken. But the skin (will, but) I think it has to be over 
millions of years, running around in 20-below with nothing on but a T-shirt and 
loin cloth on. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're going to fight in the North Atlantic, you better train in the North 
Atlantic. That hasn't always worked out, either. Teams have gone back to those 
frozen tundra areas and tried to adjust in three or four days." 
</P>
<P>
 Translation: The weather should have no impact. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Israel continues to practice as the starting cornerback in place of 
Darryl Henley, but Knox expects Henley, sidelined with a groin injury, to be 
ready to play Sunday against Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox also expects linebacker Tom Homco (foot) to play, but added that the 
status of linebacker Chris Martin (calf) could change from questionable to out.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; SEASONS HAVE TURNED AROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Remember Sept. 11? On that day the winless Raiders were manhandled and 
embarrassed by an upstart, undefeated Seattle team at the Coliseum, 38-9. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, however, the Seahawks have gone from potential playoff contenders 
to a team in need of some changes, and the Raiders have changed from an 
overrated, lackluster bunch to a rallying playoff sleeper. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders' turnaround can be traced to the play of their defense. After that 
first game against the Seahawks, the Raiders had one of the AFC's worst 
defenses. Going into Sunday night's game at the Kingdome, they have the 
second-best in the AFC, behind only the Pittsburgh Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
 In their first meeting, the Seahawks boasted an exciting offense led by 
second-year quarterback Rick Mirer and running back Chris Warren. Now, Mirer is 
sidelined because of a broken thumb and Dan McGwire is at quarterback. Warren 
is playing despite cracked ribs he suffered in a traffic accident two weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that their game plan has changed (since the team's first 
game)," Raider cornerback Terry McDaniel said. "I think that they are still 
very explosive." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps they can be, but they haven't been lately. For the first three games, 
the Seahawks led the AFC in scoring. Now they rank 19th among the 28 teams. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Mirer, Seattle will be without starting safety Eugene Robinson, who 
has a torn Achilles' tendon, and left tackle Ray Roberts, who has a broken leg. 
They suffered their injuries in the Seahawks' 16-14 victory over Houston on 
Sunday. LONNIE WHITE

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE NFL; KELLY CONFIRMED OUT FOR SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Quarterback Jim Kelly would be sidelined for the playoffs even if the Buffalo 
Bills win their last two regular-season games, Coach Marv Levy confirmed 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether surgery had been ruled out, Levy said: "The doctor made no 
mention of surgery." 
</P>
<P>
 After a lengthy examination on Thursday, team doctor Richard Weiss gave Kelly, 
who sprained his left knee in Sunday's 21-17 loss to the Minnesota Vikings, the 
go-ahead to begin rehabilitation in six to eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "So, essentially, he will miss the remainder of the 1994 season," Levy said in 
a one-paragraph statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bills initially reported that the injury was to Kelly's anterior cruciate 
ligament, but Levy's statement said it is actually the lateral collateral 
ligament, which is on the outside of the knee. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cruciate ligaments are uninjured and the structural part of the knee is 
intact," Levy said. "The doctor said there is no damage to the inside of the 
knee." 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Reich will replace Kelly as the Bills' starter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, faced with the possible move of the Rams, Raiders 
and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, said it was premature to say what the league would do 
to try to prevent the moves. 
</P>
<P>
 He reiterated, however, that he hopes the teams stay where they are. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say that obviously when you're talking about one of the two largest 
population areas in the country, you really need an in-depth review to see what 
the long-term implications are," Tagliabue said of the Los Angeles situation in 
a conference call. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what we're preparing to do if we receive a proposal from the Rams or 
Raiders. We will focus on our policy guidelines on team location." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Smith, Willie Green, Randy Cuthbert and seven others went from NFL 
castoffs to original Carolina Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great to see some flesh and blood," said Panther President Mike 
McCormack, one of several team officials who introduced the players at a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10 free agents signed to 1995 contracts all play offense, including Smith, 
a first-round pick in the 1992 draft, and Green, who caught a touchdown pass in 
the 1991 NFC title game with the Detroit Lions. 
</P>
<P>
 They might not be big names, but the Panthers have some big people, including 
6-foot-9, 375-pound tackle Kevin Farkas and 6-3, 380-pound guard Carlson 
Leomiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to make room at the table for these guys," one official joked. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jacksonville Jaguars also signed their first 10 players in franchise 
history, all of whom were in NFL training camps earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Signing these first 10 players is the first step in putting together our 
roster for the 1995 season," Coach Tom Coughlin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive lineman Ernie Logan has the most NFL experience of the group, three 
seasons with Cleveland where he played in 39 games with six starts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore Oriole owner Peter Angelos says he plans to make good his 
$200-million offer for the Buccaneers, who he maintains are "eminently movable" 
because of weak fan support. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just had a football game down there with 35,000 people in attendance. 
That simply isn't enough fan support to justify, it seems to me, the retention 
of an NFL franchise," Angelos told the St. Petersburg Times in an interview 
published Thursday.

FERNANDEZ GOES TO YANKEES; MORRIS REMAINS WITH REDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Baseball owners delayed implementing a salary cap Thursday but continued to 
sign players, even though a strike could halt the 1995 season.  
</P>
<P>
 The New York Yankees signed former Cincinnati Red shortstop Tony Fernandez, 
and the Reds reached agreement with first baseman Hal Morris. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez, a free agent who was unhappy at third base last season with the 
Reds, signed a two-year contract for $3 million with the Yankees. He can earn 
$300,000 more each season in incentives. Fernandez, 32, apparently will take 
over as the Yankees' shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris, 29, signed a $3.3-million contract, meaning that Kevin Mitchell is 
probably through with the Reds. Morris led the Reds in batting (.335) and five 
other categories last season. He has batted .300 or better in four of his five 
seasons with Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reds will not try to re-sign free agent Mitchell because the team cannot 
afford both salaries, General Manager Jim Bowden said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Thursday, Pittsburgh third baseman Jeff King agreed to an 11% pay cut by 
signing a one-year contract worth $2.15 million with the Pirates. And the 
Cleveland Indians signed left-hander Dennis Cook to a one-year contract, 
bringing him back to the team he played for in the 1992 and 1993 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Angel reliever Joe Grahe signed a triple-A contract with the Colorado 
Rockies with an option for the 1996 season.

DUCKS' TVERDOVSKY IS BLACK AND BLUE IN CANADA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks' Oleg Tverdovsky was born in Ukraine and used to play hockey 
in Moscow, but the NHL lockout has taken him to a piece of the earth he never 
expected to see -- the Canadian town of Brandon, Manitoba. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little bit different than Moscow," Tverdovsky said. "Here, it's 
colder." 
</P>
<P>
 Tverdovsky, the second pick overall at the NHL draft in June, spoke little 
English when he arrived in Anaheim for training camp in September, and a groin 
injury made his preseason miserable. He missed all eight of the Ducks' 
exhibition games. 
</P>
<P>
 But the lockout has had its advantages -- if only it would end. His injury has 
healed, his English is so polished he can conduct interviews by telephone -- 
some Russian NHL veterans can't do that -- and for the last two weeks he has 
been playing Canadian junior hockey with the Brandon Wheat Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot of travel by bus, 10 hours, seven hours," said Tverdovsky, 18, a 
defenseman who has two assists after five games in the Western Hockey League, 
where he competes mostly against teen-agers who are working to get drafted. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't think he has gone unnoticed. The other players know they have a hotshot 
draft pick, who signed a three-year, $4.2-million contract, in their midst. 
They might even realize that none of them are likely to get that kind of money 
now that NHL players have agreed in principle to a rookie salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's all black and blue. They're running at him pretty good because of who he 
is," said David McNab, the Ducks' player personnel director. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good hockey," said Tverdovsky, who is still working to get back in 
playing shape. "A lot of hits." 
</P>
<P>
 Though he hasn't fought yet, it might not be long before Ukrainian fists fly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think so because I'm sick and tired of it, everybody hitting me," 
Tverdovsky said. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the lockout end, Tverdovsky would leave Brandon for Anaheim almost 
immediately -- he is guaranteed a spot on the Ducks' team. In the meantime, he 
will take a leave to join the Russian junior national team at the World Junior 
Championships in Red Deer in the Canadian province of Alberta, beginning Dec. 
26. Nikolai Tsulygin, a Duck prospect who is playing for Central Red Army, was 
supposed to join him, but a shoulder injury is likely to keep him from coming. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Tverdovsky) has made these last few months a benefit and I give him credit 
for that," McNab said. "He hasn't just taken his money (a $500,000 installment 
on his signing bonus this summer) and had a holiday, lived it up and had a big 
party. He made sure he learned English and got in shape. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first year a player like this comes over, that transition to the North 
American lifestyle is a tremendous hurdle. And the biggest hurdle he's overcome 
so far is the language barrier, which we never thought he'd be able to do so 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's with guys his own age and he's getting a chance to learn a lot of the 
ways of life. It's better to be with 18- or 19-year-olds than NHL players who 
have families. He's learning to play cards in the back of the bus." 
</P>
<P>
 Tverdovsky doesn't understand all the issues that have kept the NHL pucks from 
being dropped, but he does know -- for better and worse -- it would never 
happen where he grew up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't understand it, but it would never happen in Russia, because we don't 
have any players association there," he said. "Here, I hope the season is going 
to start, because it is difficult with no season this year."

MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK: BINKS IS LITTLE KNOWN; HER CLOUT ISN'T 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When women are mentioned in the motor racing world, the names Shirley 
Muldowney, Lyn St. James and Janet Guthrie might come to mind first. All are 
drivers. More likely, the one most often mentioned would be Linda Vaughn, the 
trophy queen. 
</P>
<P>
 But Marge Binks of San Diego might have accomplished more for women than any 
of the others. 
</P>
<P>
 She is the newly elected chairman of the board of directors for the Sports Car 
Club of America, the 55,000-member organization that sanctions more than 2,000 
amateur and professional motorsports events each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Binks, matriarch of a racing family, succeeds Carl Haas, co-owner of the 
Newman-Haas Indy car team. She is the first woman to hold the position in the 
SCCA's 51-year history and is believed to be the first to hold such a high 
office in any major motor sports organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at the SCCA as a club of people, and it will be my task to balance the 
wishes of the people with the budget," she said. "And to keep a balance between 
all the parts of the club -- the rally, solo and amateur club racing as well as 
the pro division. I want to work toward unity within the club, but I also want 
to give every member the opportunity to be heard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I should be able to handle another balancing act after years of balancing my 
family, my career and my racing habit. It's a lot easier when your whole family 
is immersed in racing." 
</P>
<P>
 Binks met her husband, Phil, at a race at Del Mar. He was a club racer and now 
competes in vintage events as well as serving as a starter at national 
championship races. Her son, Dan, has worked with car builder Jack Roush for 
nine years and is crew chief for Tom Kendall's Trans-Am car. Son-in-law Brad 
Filbey works on Chip Ganassi's Indy car team crew. Daughter Catherine is a 
former racer. Daughter Molly is a past board member for the Cal Club. 
</P>
<P>
 A nationally recognized chief steward, Binks has twice been race chairman at 
the Long Beach Grand Prix and held the same position for six years at the Del 
Mar road races. Last year, she worked at 29 races throughout the country in 
various capacities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to my first race on Labor Day weekend in 1959 at Santa Barbara, and 
I've been going to races ever since," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The SCCA consists of 11 areas, each of which elects a board member. The 11 
board members elect the chairman. Binks, the first woman elected to the board 
four years ago, represents the Southern Pacific area, which includes Southern 
California, Arizona, Nevada and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 As chairman, she and the board will set policy for the day-to-day operation of 
the club, which is administered in Englewood, Colo., by Nick Craw, former 
director of the Peace Corps; and Dan Greenwood, former president of Riverside 
International Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenwood, who joined the SCCA this year to head its pro racing division, 
remembers Binks from 1988, his last year at Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we had races where Marge Binks was involved, she always seemed to be the 
person in charge, the person everyone turned to when there was a problem," 
Greenwood said. "She is definitely a people person who carries a good deal of 
authority, but at the same time is easy to talk to."

 Motor Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 ALL-AMERICANS -- Driver of the year Dale Earnhardt, Indy car champion Al Unser 
Jr. and drag racing funny car champion John Force head a 12-driver team 
selected by the American Auto Racing & Broadcasters Assn. One unexpected 
selection was rookie Jacques Villeneuve in the Indy car category. The Canadian 
won only one race but was chosen over Emerson Fittipaldi, runner-up to Unser in 
the PPG Cup series; and Paul Tracy, a three-race winner. Jeff Gordon, winner of 
the Brickyard 400, was another surprise as a stock car selection over Rusty 
Wallace, who won eight races. 
</P>
<P>
 Other selections: Scott Pruett, Steve Millen, road racing; Don Prudhomme, drag 
racing; Steve Kinser, Tony Stewart, short track; and Rod Millen, Steve 
Robertson, at large. The Millens are the first brothers selected since Rick and 
Roger Mears in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 AWARDS -- Scott Parker, five-time Grand National dirt track champion, was 
named American Motorcyclist Assn. professional athlete of the year. . . . Jim 
Smith, a Buena Park wheel manufacturer, was named off-road man of the year by 
SCORE International. Smith, 47, won the trophy-truck division of the Baja 1000. 
. . . Dave Turner of Hemet, driving a Mitsubishi Eclipse, won the production 
class of the SCCA/Michelin PRO Rally series. 
</P>
<P>
 NECROLOGY -- Scotty Cain, who drove for more than 25 years in Southern 
California jalopy, sprint car, midget and stock car races, died of cancer last 
week at his home in Fresno. Cain, 74, was dubbed "the redoubtable Scotty Cain" 
by Dick Lane when the Jalopy Derby was a weekly event on television. Cain raced 
with Parnelli Jones, Jim Hurtubise, Nick Valenta, Bob Hogle and Allan Heath on 
local tracks in the 1950s and '60s. . . . Dean Batchelor, 72, a dry-lakes 
hot-rod racing pioneer and nationally renowned automotive journalist, died of a 
heart attack Nov. 21 at his home in Woodland Hills.

NBA ROUNDUP; SHORT A REBOUNDER, DALLAS BEATS BOSTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Roy Tarpley? Who needs Roy Tarpley? 
</P>
<P>
 Not Dallas on Thursday. The Mavericks dominated the backboards without their 
insubordinate seven-foot rebounder and matched last season's home victory total 
by beating the Boston Celtics, 122-113. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarpley was suspended for a run-in with Coach Dick Motta during Wednesday's 
game against the Lakers, but that didn't stop Dallas from outrebounding the 
Celtics, 49-30. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are we scoring enough to win? Yes," said Boston assistant Don Casey, filling 
in while Chris Ford recuperates from colon surgery. "But teams are rebounding 
with four players. We've lost the threat of our defensive rebounding to start 
the break." 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas had no such trouble. Its rebounding put Jim Jackson into position to 
score 40 points and Jamal Mashburn 27 in its sixth home victory. The Mavericks 
are 10-8 overall. They didn't win 10 games until April 12th, their 76th game of 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Popeye Jones had a career-high 25 points with 20 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Denver 101, Miami 99 -- Rodney Rogers hit a game-winning eight-footer with 
three seconds to play at Miami, where the Nuggets overcame 29 turnovers and a 
20-point deficit and sent the Heat to its fifth defeat in six games. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Utah 95, Washington 85 -- Jeff Hornacek scored a game-high 22 points, and Karl 
Malone added 17 points and 13 rebounds for the Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah's sixth consecutive road victory matched the franchise's longest road 
streak, set in 1983-84. Washington has lost four in a row and five of six at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 114, Portland 103 -- Shawn Kemp scored eight of his 26 points in the 
fourth quarter as the SuperSonics won at Tacoma, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
 Portland lost its fourth in a row on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 New York 94, Sacramento 84 -- Patrick Ewing had 27 points and 18 rebounds and 
John Starks broke out of a slump with 19 points to lead the Knicks at 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 NBA Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Lionel Simmons scored three points in playing for Sacramento for the first 
time this season after recovering from knee surgery. . . . New York's Charles 
Oakley sat out the game against the Kings because of a dislocated toe. That 
breaks his consecutive regular-season games streak at 268. . . . New York 
waived 12-year veteran guard Doc Rivers.

IHL TALKS ARE 'VERY FAR ALONG' ON THIRD HOCKEY TEAM IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hockey fans may have three area teams to choose from next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Comrie, owner of the San Diego Gulls of the International Hockey League, 
said he is "very far along" in negotiations to move his team to the Sports 
Arena.And if that falls through, Pat Lynch, the Sports Arena's general manager, 
said he will pursue another IHL tenant. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to turn over every stone to bring in a team," Lynch said. "We 
really think it can do well here." 
</P>
<P>
 The newcomer would compete with the NHL's Kings and Mighty Ducks, but its 
ticket prices would be far less. Prices in the IHL, a developmental league for 
the NHL, average about $11. NHL prices average more than $30. 
</P>
<P>
 The IHL expanded this season to Detroit, Chicago, Houston and Minnesota. It 
will add clubs in Orlando, Fla., and San Francisco next season. HELENE ELLIOTT

COMMENTARY; RILEY IS ALSO PART OF KNICK PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE LUPICA, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Everything Pat Riley says about the New York Knicks is true. There are too 
many basketball players and not enough spots on the roster. The shooting has 
been terrible, the defense gives up 122 points to teams such as the Miami Heat, 
and the attitude sometimes has been plain lousy. But when Riley starts listing 
the Knicks' problems, he does not go quite far enough. It is not merely the 
players who need to do a better job the rest of the way. So does he. Riley 
sounded the other day as if there are problems everywhere except where he sits, 
and that is not the way it goes, no matter how many championship rings you 
have. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the New York Rangers made their Stanley Cup run last spring and Mark 
Messier stole his thunder, Riley had been the biggest star at Madison Square 
Garden. There were times when he felt like the biggest sports star in town. 
There is no need to go over everything that Riley has meant to the Knicks, the 
Garden, even the whole idea of sports in New York. He has been tremendous from 
the start, and nearly won a championship six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 He has gotten all the credit a coach could get. Sometimes he even has gotten 
too much. When the Knicks play with a fierce and relentless attitude, there is 
much talk about Riley's ability to lead and his ability to motivate. Now when 
there is a problem with the Knicks' attitude, everyone acts as if it is 
strictly the players' problem. It's not. It's Riley's problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The other day, Riley stood in the hallway outside the Knick locker room and 
was asked about the quarrel between Patrick Ewing and John Starks in Atlanta on 
Friday night. Riley said, "(Ewing) has the right to dress people down." But 
after the Knicks lost to the Heat, Riley chastised the Knicks for talking about 
Starks in public. Ewing's dressing down of Starks could not have been more 
public, and Riley signed off on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley also stood in front of the media and worried that Starks was about to be 
"raked over the coals." Except that nothing that was going to be written was 
going to be worse than what Riley had said to him in the visitors' locker room 
in Atlanta. If the coach wants to change his approach with Starks now as a way 
of helping Starks out of his slump, that is fine. But no one has been any 
rougher on Starks than Riley. Riley is the one who brought up Game 7 of the NBA 
finals the other night, evoking the memory of Starks shooting two for 18. You 
can't hit John Starks any harder than that. 
</P>
<P>
 So much of what has happened has been out of Riley's control. He is not to 
blame because Ewing had knee surgery, or because Charles Oakley might need 
surgery on his toe or because Starks is in a terrible shooting slump. But Riley 
always is involved in personnel decisions, even when the Knicks are in the 
process of ending up with 14 guaranteed contracts. He knew Doc Rivers was going 
to be sound enough to play eventually. He knew there weren't going to be enough 
minutes for Rivers and Greg Anthony. It is not as if Dave Checketts and Ernie 
Grunfeld suddenly sandbagged him with all these basketball players. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley is a great coach. Great coaches work these things out. Great coaches do 
their best to frame their players, define their roles. Riley hasn't done a very 
good job with that so far this season. There is so much unrest once you get 
past his top six players, he has forced the rest of the Knicks to worry about 
themselves and their jobs, even as he talks about how players have to stop 
worrying about themselves all the time. Fear is a wonderful motivator 
sometimes. But not all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley demands an extraordinary work ethic from his players. He demands 
extraordinary loyalty. It doesn't work so well when players lose their jobs 
without explanation, and know they may be cut or traded tomorrow.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE ROUNDUP; BUTLER'S LATE BURST LEADS GOLDEN WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tyrone Butler scored the final four points of the game Thursday to lead Golden 
West to a 76-73 upset over Santa Monica, 10th-ranked in the state, in the first 
round of the Cypress men's basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler made a basket with 1:36 left to put Golden West ahead, 74-73, then 
sealed the victory by making two free throws with 10 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West (5-7) had four players score in double figures, led by Rod 
Scheuerman with 16 points. Butler and Michael Dean each scored 14 points and 
Greg Rosenberg had 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Damon Ollie had 25 points to lead Santa Monica (8-1). 
</P>
<P>
 In another tournament game: 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Valley 72, Cypress 65 -- Jeff Cummins scored 20 points and Matt Kennedy 
added 17 for Cypress. The Chargers (10-4) play El Camino in a consolation-round 
game today at 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Pasadena men's basketball Tournament: 
</P>
<P>
 Cuesta 109, Rancho Santiago 100 -- Nick Holt scored 28 points, including four 
three-point baskets, Jim Harris had 21 points and Jon Surface 16 for Rancho 
Santiago (8-3). 
</P>
<P>
 Colin Bryant led six Cuesta players in double figures with 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Valley 77, Fullerton 76 -- Jason Cunningham missed two shots that 
could have won the game in the final six seconds for Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton trailed by one point with seven seconds left after Marcus Austin 
made two free throws. Valley turned over the ball on the subsequent inbounds 
pass. Cunningham then missed an eight-foot jumper, got the rebound and his shot 
from about three feet away rolled off the rim as time expired. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcus Austin was Fullerton's leading scorer with 24 points. Scott Davis had 
17 points for the Hornets (7-7).

THOROUGHBRED RACING / BILL CHRISTINE; OLD RACETRACKS FADING AWAY AS ECONOMIC 
TRUTHS TAKE HOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The racetracks of my youth are fading. Cahokia Downs has been gone for two 
decades, and, more recently, the owners of Charles Town have said they're out 
of business unless an angel drops from the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 Cahokia Downs, near East St. Louis, Ill., was a bullring oval devoid of 
quality racing, but at least it gave Dave Johnson, a fine announcer, his start. 
Tod Creed, who preceded Johnson, was a fun-loving race caller with a macabre 
sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
 One Friday night, about an hour after the last race, two bartenders from the 
track got into a car, and when one of them hit the accelerator, a bomb exploded 
and killed them both. East St. Louis was a tough town, but those of us who grew 
up there didn't know how tough. Because we didn't travel much, we had no frame 
of reference. We thought all towns were that way. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities never figured out what the bartenders did to deserve such an end, 
but it was obviously something that couldn't have been prevented with a simple 
apology.  
</P>
<P>
 Creed's ritual after the last race every night was to say to the crowd: "Thank 
you very much for attending, and please be careful driving home." The night 
after the bartenders were killed, the devilish announcer couldn't resist. 
"Thank you very much for attending," he said, "and please be careful starting 
your cars." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Town was the first track that I ever traveled to by train. The special 
race train left Baltimore's Camden Station, where the Orioles' new ballpark 
stands, at twilight and meandered through the mountains of West Virginia, all 
but dropping you at Charles Town's door. 
</P>
<P>
 The scenic ride included a history lesson or two. The train went by Harper's 
Ferry, which I remembered had something to do with the Civil War. I looked up 
Harper's Ferry later, and that's where John Brown, the abolitionist, captured 
the U.S. arsenal in 1859. 
</P>
<P>
 In the club car, high-stake card games were rampant while conductors looked 
the other way. Small boys made their way from car to car, selling Baltimore 
newspapers and shouting things like, "The News has got the winners and the 
scratches!" 
</P>
<P>
 As a track, Charles Town was part of the leaky-roof circuit, not much better 
than Cahokia Downs. But it still had style. For one thing, it had a name like 
no other track. It wasn't Charles Town Race Track, or Charles Town Race Course, 
or Charles Town Downs, or Charles Town Park, or any other probable name. This 
place was called The Charles Town Races.  
</P>
<P>
 Sitting across the street from Charles Town was another track, Shenandoah 
Downs. They shared a mailbox. How practical, I thought. Charles Town runs its 
season, then the action shifts to Shenandoah, giving the Charles Town surface a 
chance to breathe. It was a self-contained circuit, perfectly suited for 
horsemen. But in 1978, the Shenandoah side of the racing operation was closed, 
remaining only as a training track. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Town didn't have anything except sore-legged horses to advertise, so 
it did the best it could. I remember the PR man sending complimentary bottles 
of whiskey to many tables. In an era when exotic bets were just learning to 
walk, Charles Town introduced the Twin Double. Bettors were asked to pick the 
winners of two races early on the card. Anyone successful with that bet could 
then exchange the ticket for a bet on two races later. Between halves of the 
Twin Double, the men's room looked like the floor of the New York Stock 
Exchange as bettors with live tickets tried to auction them. 
</P>
<P>
 My first chance for a modest score came in the Twin Double one night at 
Charles Town. I was holding a live ticket after the first two races. I got out 
of the men's room with the ticket still in my pocket and exchanged it for a bet 
on the last two races. The first was a winner, and riding my horse in the last 
race was Jesse Davidson, who was the national riding champion in 1965 with more 
than 300 wins. 
</P>
<P>
 Our horse -- Davidson's and mine -- broke poorly, which is death at Charles 
Town. The track has a stretch run about the same length as some Beverly Hills

stretch and just missed at the wire. The moon was blue as the train ride back 
to Baltimore seemed longer than usual that night. The card games in the club 
car were played without me.

 Charles Town opened in 1933, a Depression year but a time when state 
governments, desperate for tax revenue, encouraged the building of tracks. Now 
the West Virginia track appears to be at the end of its 61-year run. There was 
a county referendum in November, and video lottery terminals for The Charles 
Town Races were defeated by about 500 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Video lottery terminals, of all things, would have been the plasma that pushed 
quaint little Charles Town into another season. That is the state of racing's 
survival economics as the next century dawns.

 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 For the second consecutive year, only five horses will run in the Hollywood 
Starlet. Sardula, a winner at 1-5 odds, chased some horses away last year, and 
Serena's Song is the heavy favorite for Saturday's $250,000 race. Serena's Song 
won the Landaluce at Hollywood Park and the Oak Leaf at Santa Anita before she 
lost by a head to stablemate Flanders in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies at 
Churchill Downs. Trainer Brian Mayberry, who won with Sardula, will start 
Urbane, undefeated in two tries, in the 1 1/16-mile race. Kindred Soul drew the 
rail, and outside her come Urbane, Ski Dancer, Comstock Queen and Serena's 
Song. . . . Robert and Beverly Lewis, who race Serena's Song, have sold their 
multiple stakes-winning filly, Twice The Vice, to Marty Wygod for an 
undisclosed price. Twice The Vice, winner of the Del Mar Oaks and the Linda 
Vista Handicap at Santa Anita, was bought for $130,000 at auction by the 
Lewises last year as an unraced 2-year-old. Twice The Vice earned $269,416 
under trainer Ray Bell and switches to Ron Ellis' barn. . . . Kent Desormeaux 
has dropped his appeal of a five-day suspension and will begin serving the days 
Sunday. Because of California's designated-race rule, Desormeaux, Hollywood 
Park's leading jockey, will still be able to ride heavily favored Afternoon 
Deelites on Sunday in the $500,000 Hollywood Futurity.

NEWBURY PARK SHOWS IT'S BOSS IN THE MARMONTE LEAGUE, 57-36 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DESMOND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It could be a long year for the rest of the Marmonte League. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newbury Park High girls' basketball team entered the season ranked 10th in 
the state and won six of its first seven games going into league play. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley was to be the Panthers' top challenger. However, Newbury Park 
dispatched the Pioneers with ease in a 57-36 rout Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're a darned good team and they took it to us tonight," Simi Valley Coach 
Dave Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Panther center Kara McKeown scored 14 points and grabbed 17 rebounds, but it 
was her defensive play that stood out.  
</P>
<P>
 McKeown, a 6-foot-1 senior, was assigned the unenviable task of covering Simi 
Valley's Tawnee Cooper, Ventura County's leading scorer as a sophomore last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley's outside game was cold throughout, allowing McKeown and the 
Panther defense to climb all over Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
 The junior forward was limited to eight shots and finished with as many fouls 
(four) as points. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us to be successful, we have to get Tawnee 15 shots and that didn't 
happen tonight," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were plenty of shots to go around for Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Wastell scored 12 points, while Jann Thorpe and Amy Berman each scored 
eight. Christine Arguijo added seven points. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamie Griffin scored 10 points for Simi Valley and Carrie Billone added six. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone played well," McKeown said. "This was an important game for us to 
show we are a good team and that we can play with the great teams around." 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers made believers out of Simi Valley (8-2, 1-1 in league play), 
which trailed by as many as 28 points in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers (8-1, 2-0) have lost only to Alemany, the state's second-ranked 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't a rout all the way. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pioneers led, 10-6, before Newbury Park finished the first quarter with a 
7-0 run. 
</P>
<P>
 Berman's first of two three-pointers with two seconds left in the quarter 
broke a 10-10 tie and appeared to change the momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers forced six turnovers in the first four minutes of the second 
quarter and extended their lead to eight points. 
</P>
<P>
 Newbury Park had a 28-16 halftime lead. An aggressive defense limited Cooper 
to three points and three shots in the half.

NORTH HOLLYWOOD TOURNAMENT; CHATSWORTH WON'T FALL INTO TRAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL LAZARUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new day, a different defense to attack, but the result was the same for the 
Chatsworth High boys' basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chancellors survived a trapping defense that forced 10 second-half 
turnovers to defeat Banning, 65-63, Thursday night in the second round of the 
North Hollywood tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second consecutive day, the Chancellors lost a 13-point lead in the 
second half. On Wednesday, Chatsworth defeated Grant, 69-68, but committed 18 
turnovers in the final three quarters. Most of the turnovers came when Grant 
employed a full-court press. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Banning, the Chancellors committed 15 turnovers and survived a 
half-court shot by Haven Hall that hit the rim as time expired to advance to 
tonight's championship game against North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to use these games as practice for different situations," 
Chatsworth Coach Bill Whiting said. "We mastered the press well tonight, now 
we've got the trap. I'm glad we get to see all these defenses so early," 
</P>
<P>
 The half-court shot was Banning's second chance to tie or win in the waning 
seconds. Center Rick Sanchez had a chance to tie the score with 10 seconds left 
but made just one free throw. Chatsworth's Tariq Hill added a free throw with 
four seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting a little frustrated because the way we play sometimes it 
shouldn't come down to the last shot," Hill said. "We have to do a better job 
to put it away." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pilots (7-2) double-teamed junior center Eddie Miller throughout the game, 
freeing the perimeter for junior guard Jerome Joseph and senior forward Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 While Miller and Hill struggled from the field, Joseph had 21 points and eight 
rebounds. Miller finished with 14 points and 15 rebounds but made just four of 
sixteen shots. Hill had 12 points but missed his last six three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eddie might have been struggling because of the double-team but he was able 
to find the open man," Joseph said. "I was just able to knock down the jumper." 
</P>
<P>
 The Chancellors received a boost off the bench from Lee Larsen. Larsen 
connected on all five of his shots, including two critical baskets while 
Chatsworth (4-1) was trading the lead midway through the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Banning guard Brian Jones had 23 points and eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 North Hollywood 76, Monroe 61 -- Husky guard Arthur Lee scored eight of his 33 
points during a 13-0 run midway through the fourth quarter to break open a tied 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Smith-Harris added 15 points and 10 rebounds for North Hollywood (5-2). 
Shannon Johnson had 11 points and 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaka Steiner scored 20 points for Monroe (4-3), which led by two points after 
three quarters but was outscored, 26-9, in the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Johnson added 14 points for the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Mike Delano, who scored 24 points in a first-round victory over Granada 
Hills, was suspended indefinitely by North Hollywood Coach Steve Miller for 
breaking unspecified team rules and did not play.

BOYS' BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS; TUSTIN BEATS GRIFFINS WITH DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a game that featured two of the county's best point guards leading two of 
the county's best teams, it was a man in the pivot that made the difference in 
Tustin's 69-53 victory over Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure Tustin's highly touted point guard Doug Gottlieb, who has signed a letter 
of intent with Notre Dame, had a decent performance, scoring 19 points and 
adding 12 assists in the quarterfinal victory of the Tournament of Champions 
Thursday at Ocean View. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Tillers (8-0) needed to put the clamps on Los Alamitos center Jeremy 
Vandervoet before they could take control. 
</P>
<P>
 The Griffins (6-2) started strongly with point guard Ali Ton penetrating to 
help create easy baskets for Vandervoet, who scored 12 of his 23 points in the 
first quarter to help Los Alamitos take a 17-12 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Vandervoet) was killing us," Tustin Coach Andy Ground said. "We just needed 
to stop Ton's penetration and bump (Vandervoet) inside." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Los Alamitos dominated the first quarter, Tustin took control in the 
second. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Griffin scored seven of his 15 points in the second quarter to help 
Tustin outscore Los Alamitos, 13-2, in the first 4 minutes 8 seconds of the 
period to give Tustin a 25-19 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Vandervoet had only one field goal in the second half and the Tillers' defense 
forced the Griffins to shoot 29% from the field after halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Los Alamitos made the score 56-51 with 1:39 remaining on a layup by 
Shaun Russ. But Tustin made 17 fourth-quarter free throws and 27 of 38 (71%) 
for the game to ice it as Los Alamitos missed its final five three-point 
attempts while trying to mount a rally. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin advanced to tonight's semifinals to play Playa del Rey Westchester, 
which was ranked second in the state preseason poll. Mater Dei plays Ocean View 
in the other semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a good test to see where we're at right now," Ground said. "It 
will take a great effort from us to get a 'W' out of that one." 
</P>
<P>
 Ton, Los Alamitos' point guard, tried to help the Griffins get the victory, 
finishing with 13 points and seven assists. But the 6-foot senior was 
frustrated in the second half and finished with eight turnovers and made only 
four of 14 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 The point guard duel never materialized as Gottlieb also struggled, making 
only four of 15 shots while playing the entire game. 
</P>
<P>
 Another key for the Tillers was a good defensive job on Cory Johnson, who 
scored 17 points in a 60-47 victory over Los Angeles Dorsey in the first round. 
Johnson had only two points Thursday and took only four shots before fouling 
out with four minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 In a consolation game: 
</P>
<P>
 Servite 70, Los Angeles Dorsey 68 -- Mark Seaton had 21 points, eight rebounds 
and three blocked shots and David Downs added 17 points and four assists to 
lead Servite, which shot 57% from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 The Friars (5-1) led 21-12 after one quarter but Dorsey (1-2) chipped away at 
the lead and pulled within one point midway through the fourth quarter. But 
consecutive three-pointers by Servite's Andrew Higa and Downs made it 68-61 
with 3:25 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Verdel Baskin scored 19 points for Dorsey, which was ranked in the state 
preseason top 20.

LA CANADA WINS TOURNAMENT TITLE; HIGH SCHOOL SOCCER: SPARTANS AGGRESSIVE IN 4-0 
CHAMPIONSHIP VICTORY OVER HARVARD-WESTLAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRIS WYKES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 La Canada High used two goals by forward Josh Henderson and aggressive play to 
overwhelm Harvard-Westlake, 4-0, Thursday night in the championship of the 18th 
annual La Canada tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our field and our tournament," said La Canada Coach Lou Bilowitz, whose 
team has lost only 12 games in the past seven years and made it to the Southern 
Section Division IV semifinals last winter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The team played with pride and they weren't going to let anyone beat them 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Henderson, the Spartans' leading scorer with 12 goals, opened the scoring 16 
minutes into the match when he rose out of a pack of players in front of the 
Harvard-Westlake goal and headed a crossing pass over Wolverine goaltender Mike 
Young. 
</P>
<P>
 La Canada's hustling midfielders took over from there, utilizing superior 
height and speed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spartans pounced on virtually every loose ball, flustering 
Harvard-Westlake into errant passes and sloppy ball-handling -- especially in 
the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "They owned the midfield," said Harvard-Westlake Coach Rick Commons, whose 
team competes in Division III. "I told our guys at halftime to play it on the 
ground because (La Canada is) very good in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are a highly disciplined, impressive squad and they counterattack better 
than any team I've coached against." 
</P>
<P>
 Transition was indeed key for La Canada (8-0). 
</P>
<P>
 Time and time again, Harvard-Westlake (5-1-1) sent the ball downfield only to 
find itself on the defensive seconds later. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a great defense and it really allowed our offense to move forward 
quickly," Bilowitz said. "We play two defensive midfielders (out of four) and 
we send one forward on the attack, but it's a different one each time. 
</P>
<P>
 "That makes it hard to mark them and several times the referee even said he 
had to count the number of players to make sure we had 11 on the field." 
</P>
<P>
 La Canada stopper Gaston Haupert scored the Spartans' second goal midway 
through the first half after a Harvard-Westlake clearing attempt failed and 
left him with the ball 40 yards in front of the Wolverines' goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Haupert boomed a low, skidding kick that found its way through a maze of 
players and into the net. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spartans increased their lead to 3-0 at the intermission when midfielder 
Chris Sproule headed in a free kick by Chris Sawicki from 10 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second half, Henderson scored his second goal on a breakaway for the 
final margin. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior was shadowed all night by Wolverine defenders but was able to break 
free nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got impatient and tried to give (Henderson) too many balls," Bilowitz 
said. "Too many times we looked for him when there were two guys on him, but he 
got his chances nonetheless."

SIDELINES; VENTURA COUNTY BOASTS ITS SHARE OF STATE'S DEMONIC GOLF HOLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Any golfer seeking bucolic bliss on the links had better avoid a handful of 
country clubs in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Three holes in the county have been ranked among the 18 toughest in 
California, according to a publication to be released in January called Golf 
Courses of America: 
</P>
<P>
 * No. 17 at Saticoy Country Club in Camarillo, a nasty par four that measures 
474 yards from the blue tees. The monster was designed by William Francis Bell, 
who built the course in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
 * No. 18 at Sherwood Country Club in Thousand Oaks, a 427-yard par four that 
features a multitiered, elevated green guarded by a lake. The course was 
designed by Jack Nicklaus in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 * No. 1 at Wood Ranch Country Club in Simi Valley, a 415-yard par four fronted 
by a greenside creek. Wood Ranch was designed by Ted Robinson in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Wil Barnes, editor of the magazine, said he queried PGA players, area 
professionals and top amateurs while compiling the list. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd be surprised how many guys can recall holes that absolutely annihilated 
them," Barnes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Uh, no, we wouldn't. 
</P>
<P>
 For those masochists who'd like to try their luck, Barnes predicted a top pro 
would shoot "about 90" if he played each of the 18 holes, which carry a par of 
72. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 A shutout: The Glendale High boys' basketball team won the easy way in the 
Beverly Hills tournament last week in a consolation-round game against 
Leuzinger. Five minutes after taking the floor, the Dynamiters walked off with 
a 2-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 In an apparent oversight by the Leuzinger coach, the team failed to show and 
forfeited. Or maybe the Olympians were afraid to face Glendale? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure that wasn't it," said Glendale Coach Bob Davidson, whose team 
improved to 2-2. 
</P>

 Snow birds: College of the Canyons has received a shot in the arm from the 
unlikeliest of places -- The Great White North. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Canadians are on the school's golf team, which won the state title in 
1993 and will begin play in February. Here's how Coach Gary Peterson accounts 
for what he dubbed "the hoser connection," which landed Marshall Paterson, 
Jason Plose and Crandul Ruhal.  
</P>
<P>
 Peterson said Canyons was mentioned in a book published last year that 
detailed the top college golf programs in America. The book eventually migrated 
north, like a flock of geese, it seems. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're just now starting to get the word (about the '93 title)," Peterson 
said. "They said it takes a year for anything to make its way up there." 
</P>

 Road Warrior: Westlake High receiver Billy Miller will take the first of his 
five recruiting trips this weekend, and it won't be to any of the five schools 
he originally targeted. Miller, a record-setting receiver for the Warriors and 
a top college prospect, will visit Washington this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 He has dropped Florida State from his schedule. Miller plans to take his other 
four trips to USC, UCLA, Colorado and Notre Dame, with Texas as an alternate if 
anything falls through. Honors  
</P>
<P>
 When seniors Joseph Vaughn and Oscar Wilson were named NCAA Division I-AA 
All-Americans by the Associated Press this week, they joined some elite 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, only two other players in Northridge's 33-year football history have 
been recognized by the AP, both at the Division II level: punter-kicker Bryan 
Wagner (honorable mention in 1982, first team in '83) and offensive lineman Don 
Goodman (first team, 1991). Wagner is the punter for the San Diego Chargers.

 Hueneme boys' basketball coach Howard Davis, after last week's 77-12 victory 
against tiny Arroyo Grande Coastal Christian (enrollment 38), a rout that 
included a 51-3 second-half barrage: "We had a great half. It wasn't all due to 
them being horrible, but with 51-3, you've got to be pretty horrible." Stats  
</P>
<P>
 A record seven area teams took part in 13 high school football championship 
games last weekend. Sylmar, which won the City Section 4-A Division title, was 
one of four teams in Southern California to finish with a record of 14-0, 
joining Southern Section champions Mater Dei (Division I), Newport Harbor 
(Division V) and Bloomington (Division VIII).

 Feat of feet: When Eleazar Hernandez of Camarillo High and Antonio Arce of 
Palmdale finished fifth and seventh in the national cross-country championships 
in San Diego last weekend, it marked only the second time since the meet began 
in 1979 that two male runners from the region have recorded top-10 finishes. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Jeff Wilson of Newbury Park and Margarito Casillas of Hoover finished 
second and fifth, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez, Arce, Brett Strahan of Hart, Amy Skieresz of Agoura and Elaine 
Canchola of Nordhoff gave the region five participants in the event, tying the 
previous highest total in 1981. Things to Do  
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen schools, including Alemany and North Hollywood, will compete in the 
Simi Valley High girls' basketball tournament beginning today at 4 p.m. at the 
Rancho Simi Park and Recreation Center. The event runs through Dec. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 The Glendale College men's basketball team will face Harbor tonight at 8 in 
the semifinals of the Glendale tournament at the school gym.

GIRLS' BASKETBALL ESTANCIA CLASSIC; MARINA HAS NO TROUBLE BEATING ESTANCIA FOR 
TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sonya Bryant spoke in hushed tones, but her actions a few minutes earlier 
spoke louder than words. And her words were pretty exact. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I missed a couple of easy shots," she lamented, "but I got into it 
in the second half shooting-wise. I was always into it defensively." 
</P>
<P>
 Bryant, a Marina junior, excelled on defense and scored a game-high 15 points 
as her Vikings won the Estancia Classic, 61-37, with a victory over the host 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina (8-0), ranked No. 4 in The Times' preseason poll, bolted to a 13-0 lead 
and turned back every Estancia rally with one of its own in winning its second 
tournament of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryant, an all-tournament selection, missed three of her first four shots, but 
made three of four in the second and fourth quarters as Marina beat back the 
Eagles. She held Estancia's Cyndi Richards scoreless in the first half; 
Richards scored 10 in the second half after Bryant moved elsewhere to 
compensate for Shandy' Robbins' foul trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Richards was matched by teammate Jessica Waltz with 10 points; both made the 
all-tournament team, along with Marina's Natalie Nakase. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put together two or three good runs," Estancia Coach Russ Davis said, "but 
if you expect to play with one of the top two or three teams in the county, 
you've got to play four quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're on a different level than us -- let's be honest." 
</P>
<P>
 Estancia came back from the early 13-0 deficit and pulled to within six midway 
through the second quarter, then Bryant scored six points in Marina's 13-2 run. 
The Vikings stretched the lead to 22 points, 42-20, but after Estancia cut the 
lead to 13, Marina outscored the Eagles, 15-4, over the next eight minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We picked a bad time to play our worst game of the year," Davis said, "but a 
lot of that had to do with the way Marina played." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Marina Coach Pete Bonny: "When you play a team like us or Woodbridge, 
that's going to happen sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Estancia is 6-2; its other loss is to Woodbridge, the No. 1 team in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina got a well-rounded effort from its post players. In addition to 
Bryant's 15 points, nine rebounds and three steals, Robbins -- the tournament 
most valuable player -- had 13 points, eight rebounds and four steals, and 
Kirsten Cappel had 13 points and nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 As a whole, Marina made 25 of 49 shots from the floor; Estancia was 12 of 41 
(29%). 
</P>
<P>
 In other tournament games: 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine 53, Santa Fe Springs St. Paul 32 -- Jenna Bodholdt had 20 points and 12 
rebounds and Thea Christenson added eight points to lead Irvine (6-2) to the 
consolation championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Diamond Bar 70, Saddleback 48 -- Diamond Bar won the third-place game.

THE TIMES 1994 FALL ALL-COUNTY TEAMS; EVERY DAY WAS MAY'S ON COURT; ATHLETE OF 
THE YEAR: NEWPORT HARBOR OUTSIDE HITTER, PERHAPS THE BEST PLAYER IN NATION, WAS 
THE SAILORS' HEART AND SOUL.

 Misty May, The Times player of the year, was easily the finest girls' 
volleyball player in Orange County this season. 
</P>
<P>
 One publication named May the top high school player in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 May, a 5-foot-9 senior, earned her second consecutive player of the year award 
from The Times after leading the Sailors to their first State Division I 
championship this season. Newport Harbor lost in the State Division I final 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor, which won the 1992 State Division III championship in May's 
sophomore year, finished 33-1 and was ranked No. 1 in the nation by other 
publications this season. 
</P>
<P>
 So was the State title a perfect ending to her high school career? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," May said after the Sailors' three-game victory over Stockton St. 
Mary's in the State Division I final Dec. 3. Then a wide grin flashed across 
her face. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I'm looking forward to seeing some of my teammates on the other side of 
the net," May said. 
</P>
<P>
 May, who has orally committed to Long Beach State, could see some of her 
teammates in college. Middle blocker Melissa Schutz has committed to Colorado 
and Sara Fairborn, Tina Bowman and Laura Osborne also are being recruited. 
</P>
<P>
 May played mostly at outside hitter this season but probably will become a 
setter in college. Debbie Green, the U.S. Olympic team setter in 1984, is an 
assistant at Long Beach State and May has similar goals. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, May was the biggest cog in a Newport Harbor machine that will be 
remembered as one of the finest teams in county history. 
</P>
<P>
 A quick and powerful outside hitter, May, a four-year starter, also was an 
outstanding defensive player. Her all-around game is the result of countless 
hours of practice and play on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her defense and passing are incredible," Corona del Mar Coach Lance Stewart 
said. "She covers so much court . . . she scores more points for them with 
things outside of hitting."

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; THIS TIME, SOME CHEER AMID THE GLOOM; HOUSING 
PRICES LIKELY TO RISE IF BUILDERS ARE HIT WITH HIGHER FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOPE HAMASHIGE and JOHN O'DELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Housing prices in Orange County are sure to rise as a result of the county's 
Chapter 9 bankruptcy, local real estate experts said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Home builders expect to be hit hard with new user fees and increased building 
permit costs as cash-strapped cities, special districts and the county seek 
ways to shore up their depleted finances. 
</P>
<P>
 As in the past, developers will pass the added costs on to consumers in the 
form of higher home prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "They impose them on me and I pass them right on to you," said Roland Osgood, 
president of the South Coast division of Kaufman & Broad, a Los Angeles-based 
home builder. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, "construction won't stop, because there is market demand to be met," 
said Chris Taylor, vice president of Coto de Caza Ltd., a major South County 
land developer. 
</P>
<P>
 The county filed the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history last week 
after a high-risk, multibillion-dollar investment pool run by the treasurer's 
office collapsed. Losses to date have been set at $2.02 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past 20 years, mandatory construction fees -- such as charges to help 
build parks and install street lights -- have quintupled for builders in many 
of Orange County's cities, Osgood said. 
</P>
<P>
 The average price of homes sold in Orange County reached a peak of $271,000 in 
1989. Since the recession began in 1990, prices have dropped to an average of 
$256,000 for the first nine months this year, according to TRW-Redi Property 
Data Service Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the slightest fee increases could have a devastating effect on the local 
economy, which has just begun a modest recovery, said Jack Kyser, chief 
economist for the Economic Development Corp. of Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would put us in a non-competitive position," Kyser said. "These 
out-of-state raiders try to lure companies out of California all the time using 
information about high cost of housing. The decline in housing prices has put 
us in a better competitive balance." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, H. Fred Mickelson, chairman of the Orange County Chamber of Commerce 
and Industry, recently boasted that the housing price decline this decade has 
been a big selling point for the chamber in its efforts to retain and attract 
business to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1989, the price of new housing in the county has dropped by about 15%. 
But between 1980 and 1989, housing prices more than doubled, according to 
Riverside-based TRW-Redi. 
</P>
<P>
 "To solve the problems of the county, they (government officials) have leaned 
really heavily on new development," said Taylor, the Coto de Caza executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Building permit fees started rising after the 1978 passage of Proposition 13, 
which restricted government's ability to increase property taxes. Communities 
instituted builder fees to help make up the difference. And in rapidly growing 
areas like Orange County, the fees and soaring home prices combined to generate 
a substantial amount of money for governments. 
</P>
<P>
 Many now predict that higher fees will be a principal way governments in 
Orange County will try to cope with their investment losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Insofar as these agencies and cities decide to try to recoup their losses by 
raising new revenue, they probably will raise user fees," said Dean Misczynski, 
director of the state Library Research Bureau and an expert on special tax 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Buyers of new homes in Orange County already are shelling out plenty to cover 
building fees. School fees on a new house, for example, range from $3,500 to 
$5,500 depending on the district. And city-imposed fees for capital 
improvements, such as streets, sewers and lighting, can add from $2,400 to 
$22,000 to the price of a residence. 
</P>
<P>
 In total, such fees add $16,000 to $25,000 to the cost of a typical new home 
in the county, according to the Building Industry Assn. of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The bankruptcy, which has devastated the county's credit-worthiness, will also 
hamper the government-supported financing mechanism that developers have come 
to depend on. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the roads, sidewalks, sewers and street lights needed to 
build a new housing tract have been paid for by special development bonds, 
called Mello-Roos bonds. Since the early 1980s when such bonds were authorized, 
Mello-Roos bonds have been the preferred financing of local home builders, 
because they are the least expensive method of paying for infrastructural 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Mello-Roos bonds are issued by the county in which development is 
taking place, they are not repaid by county funds but by the homeowners. Still, 
real estate and municipal bond experts doubt that the market for Orange County 
Mello-Roos bonds will recover for some time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because it is connected with Orange County, nobody wants to touch it," Osgood 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, any Orange County building project -- no matter how financially 
strong the developer -- is plagued with a perception problem, said Robert 
Firring, partner at municipal bond underwriter Stone & Youngberg in Los 
Angeles. "The bankruptcy casts a pall on everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the long term, the situation will improve, but that could be many years 
from now, Firring said. 
</P>
<P>
 "To a certain extent New York's past problems plague it today," he said. 
"People don't forget negative things." New York City narrowly escaped declaring 
bankruptcy 19 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 An alternative for builders is to look to traditional bank loans or corporate 
bonds, which would cost at least three percentage points more in interest more 
than similar Mello-Roos issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Funding difficulties have already begun to appear. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Co. spokeswoman Dawn McCormick said this week that financing plans are 
now in limbo for a new development in lower Peters Canyon, a planned community 
to be built in unincorporated Orange County next to Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond crisis is forcing the Irvine Co. to look at other financing options, 
said McCormick, adding that the Newport Beach-based developer might consider 
paying for the sewer and street improvements itself. "The project is not being 
put on hold," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But such added construction costs are precisely what will likely drive up the 
price of homes, according to Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 "All they will do is ratchet up their housing prices and the people at the 
bottom of the market will have no opportunity to buy," he said. "The people who 
are going to suffer are the people of Orange County."

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; CRISIS MAY BE WINDFALL FOR BOND INSURANCE 
INDUSTRY; INVESTING: EXPERTS SAY BUYERS ARE NOW SHOPPING FOR SAFETY AND WILL 
FOCUS ON CUTTING RISK INSTEAD OF MAXIMIZING YIELDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shaken by the Orange County bankruptcy filing, bond investors are shopping for 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're scared to death," said James Gammon, president of Lebenthal Asset 
Management in New York, which manages municipal bond portfolios for wealthy 
individuals, mainly in the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts expect investors to focus on cutting risk instead of maximizing 
yields, which could be good news for the bond insurance industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that the Orange County bankruptcy works to the long-term benefit of 
the insurers," said analyst Gary Ransom of Conning & Co. in Hartford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 But the industry, which guarantees 38% of the nation's $1.3 trillion in 
municipal bonds outstanding today, could also face losses among bond issuers 
squeezed by Orange County's filing for bankruptcy protection Dec. 6 under 
Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 
</P>
<P>
 The two biggest players, Municipal Bond Investors Assurance Corp. and Ambac 
Indemnity Corp., which together control two-thirds of the market, said in 
separate announcements this week that they face a worst-case annual debt 
service totaling nearly $200 million from bond issuers that participated in the 
bankrupt Orange County investment fund.  
</P>
<P>
 But the insurers stressed that those kinds of payouts would come only in the 
highly unlikely event that every one of the 38 issues insured by MBIA and the 
21 insured by Ambac with Orange County exposure goes into default. 
</P>
<P>
 MBIA, with an annual debt service exposure of $127 million, announced that it 
does not expect any losses. Ambac -- with an annual exposure of $72 million, 
including $17 million from bonds issued by Orange County directly -- was more 
circumspect but said it expects "any default to be temporary" and that it 
expects "ultimately to receive full recovery of any payments made." 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street bought those reassurances -- and the stock. 
</P>
<P>
 After dipping to $49.125 on the day of the Orange County filing, MBIA has 
since bounced back strongly, closing at $55.25 on Thursday, up $1.25 in trading 
on the New York Stock Exchange. Similarly, Ambac fell to $31 last week but 
closed at $35 on Thursday, up $1 on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond insurance enables municipalities with credit ratings of A to obtain AAA 
ratings on their bonds. Since AAA bonds pay lower interest rates than A -- a 
trade-off that investors make in exchange for the additional safety -- a 
community can save money on interest payments by buying the insurance. (That 
is, of course, as long as the insurance premiums are smaller than the 
difference in interest payments.) 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1987, the insured segment of the municipal bond market has doubled, to 
38% from 19%. The dollar volume of insured bonds has also exploded, with more 
than $100 billion issued last year. 
</P>
<P>
 With all that supply, issuers of insured bonds have been forced to tweak their 
rates upward a little to attract buyers. That narrowed the "spread" between AAA 
insureds and uninsured AA or A bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 But evidence is starting to emerge that the Orange County crisis has caused 
investors to rediscover the value of insurance. Portfolio managers say 
increased demand is raising prices -- and reducing yields -- for insured bonds 
compared to uninsured bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before Orange County's filing, yields on insured bonds were only 0.15 to 
0.25 percentage points below those on some good-quality uninsured New York 
bonds, Lebenthal's Gammon said. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a $100,000 insured bond yielding 5% would pay $5,000 a year, 
whereas a good uninsured bond might yield 5.15% and pay $5,150 a year. The $150 
a year the investor sacrifices is a small price for security on a $100,000 
investment, Gammon says. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors are starting to feel the same way, he said, because investor demand 
has grown since Dec. 6, causing the spreads between insured and uninsured bonds 
to widen to 0.40 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
 "Investors are not going to take this kind of risk any more," he said. "It 
doesn't make sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all observers have seen such dramatic effects yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Duerson, who runs Franklin Group's $1.36-billion California Insured 
Tax-Free Fund, the largest mutual fund investing exclusively in insured 
California municipal bonds, said he has seen only a tiny increase in investment 
in his fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hasn't been what you'd expect, but we're hoping," he said.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; A BIT OF GOOD NEWS; DROP IN RATES HELPS GET BOND 
LIQUIDATION OFF TO STRONG START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The liquidation of $7.96 billion in bonds owned by Orange County's bankrupt 
investment fund got off to a strong start Thursday, helped by rising 
expectations that the Federal Reserve Board will defer further 
credit-tightening moves until next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Salomon Bros., the brokerage managing the liquidation, said it sold 
county-owned U.S. government bonds with a face value of $483 million in a 
wide-open auction that attracted $7.5 billion in bids. 
</P>
<P>
 A sharp decline in shorter-term market interest rates Thursday gave Salomon a 
tail wind in unloading the bonds, which were conventional issues maturing in 2 
1/2 to four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the bond market was cheered by two economic reports suggesting 
that the pace of growth is slowing. That may allow the Fed to delay another 
hike in short-term interest rates, which many analysts had expected would come 
when central bank policy-makers meet next week. 
</P>
<P>
 As shorter-term market interest rates eased Thursday, bidders for the county's 
bonds were willing to accept lower yields than they would have demanded a few 
days ago, traders said. Lower yields translated into higher prices paid for the 
bonds, which puts more cash back into the devastated investment fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Salomon said the bonds fetched between 89.5 cents and 94.5 cents per dollar of 
face value. "We were very pleased with demand," one Salomon trader said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, those prices were below the average value of 95.5 cents on the dollar 
that Salomon ascribed to the "conventional" part of the bond portfolio on 
Monday. At the time, many Wall Street analysts said Salomon's valuation of the 
portfolio seemed optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Wall Street traders at rival brokerages said the prices paid in 
Thursday's auction were far better than the market had expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "These prices are on the moon," a trader at a Salomon competitor said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bonds' prices were at a discount to their face value of 100 cents on the 
dollar because the securities had been issued at significantly lower interest 
rates over the last two years. When purchased by the county fund, the 
annualized fixed-rate yields on the bonds were in the 4%-to-5.7% range. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the discounted prices paid by the buyers translated into 
annualized yields of 7.90% to 8.02%, returns that take into account the 
interest coupon and the capital gain when the bond matures at full face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street's measure of the success of such an auction is the extent to which 
yields on these U.S. government agency securities top the yields available on 
bonds issued directly by the U.S. Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
 Because U.S. government agency securities, such as bonds issued by the Federal 
Home Loan Bank System, are considered slightly riskier than direct obligations 
of the Treasury, the former pay yields above those on comparable-maturity 
Treasury bonds. But that yield spread can vary. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thursday's auction, the average yields demanded by buyers ranged from 0.24 
point to 0.365 point above the market yield on the three-year Treasury note, 
which Salomon set at 7.657% at midafternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said investors' willingness to buy the bonds at those spreads 
represented a significant improvement in the market from last week -- when the 
county fund's creditor brokerages were liquidating $11.5 billion in similar 
government agency bonds they held as collateral for loans to the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Yields on U.S. agency bonds shot up to as much as 0.65 point above comparable 
Treasury yields last week, at the height of the collateral selloff, traders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone who bought last week now is looking like a genius," one bond trader 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The implication is that the brokerages that dumped the collateral bonds last 
week were doing so at "fire sale" prices, some traders said. That could boost 
the county's legal case against the brokerages: The county has sued one 
brokerage, Nomura Securities, and has pledged to sue the others on the grounds 
that they illegally seized and sold the collateral bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 The brokerages argue that they were within their rights to sell the collateral 
after the county defaulted on loan payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said a big reason Thursday's sale went well is that the market trusts 
that Salomon's auction of the Orange County portfolio will be orderly, as has 
been pledged by former state Treasurer Thomas W. Hayes, who is overseeing 
county finances. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, the bond market was fraught with uncertainty last week as the 
collateral bonds were liquidated and as traders guessed about the future of the 
rest of the portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 Salomon officials said Thursday that they plan to sell another $566 million of 
county-owned bonds today. Like the securities sold Thursday, those auctioned 
today will be conventional fixed-rate bonds, though they mature further in the 
future: 1999, 2001 and 2004. 
</P>
<P>
 Salomon's biggest challenge lies ahead: unloading the $4.7 billion in 
complicated derivative bonds that make up the bulk of the remaining portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say those securities could be sold via auctions -- with the most 
likely buyers major brokerages such as J.P. Morgan Securities -- but are more 
likely to be unloaded through restructurings negotiated with the government 
agencies that issued them. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say that by renegotiating or liquidating the bonds with those 
agencies, such as the Federal Home Loan Bank System and the Student Loan 
Marketing Assn., Salomon should be able to wring more value out of the bonds 
than it could by selling on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The agencies themselves, all of which say they have already been contacted by 
Salomon, are expected to cooperate in renegotiations, though they have 
indicated they will not offer the county fund any type of deal that could be 
construed as a bailout.

HOMEFED BANK PROBE YIELDS FELONY CHARGES; THRIFTS: THREE FORMER EXECS OF THE 
DEFUNCT SAVINGS AND LOAN ARE INDICTED ON FRAUD AND CONSPIRACY COUNTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Three former executives of failed HomeFed Bank of San Diego were indicted 
Thursday by a San Diego federal grand jury on 10 felony counts of conspiracy 
and fraud. The case stemmed from a federal task force's two-year investigation 
of the thrift's real estate development activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges focus on an alleged "sham sale" of property in 1990 by the S&L's 
real estate development subsidiary, Home Capital Corp., in order to get around 
new banking laws that restricted thrifts on the types of developments they 
could own. The alleged sham was also supposed to have helped HomeFed evade 
tougher capital requirements imposed by the law, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Charged with misapplication of bank funds, conspiracy and making false 
statements in bank books are William Dani, who was chief financial officer at 
Home Capital Corp.; Donald R. Faye, Home Capital regional director, and 
Jacqueline Ooley, senior projects manager. The charges carry penalties of up to 
$1 million in fines and 30 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictments were sought in connection with an investigation conducted by a 
white-collar crime task force set up in San Diego two years ago by the U.S. 
attorney's office and the FBI. The task force is still scrutinizing the 
failures of three local thrifts -- HomeFed, Great American Bank and Imperial 
Savings -- that cost taxpayers billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's charges center on HomeFed's purported sale of a partnership 
interest in its Rancho San Diego development to Sacramento developer Robert 
Coker. Under the 1989 law, full ownership would have required HomeFed to come 
up with more capital to meet tougher regulatory standards, and the sale was 
designed to relieve HomeFed of that requirement. Prosecutors allege that 
HomeFed made $57 million in loans to the new partnership and illegally provided 
Coker with his $5-million share of the necessary down payment.  
</P>
<P>
 The indictment said HomeFed "concealed from both government regulators and the 
bank's outside auditors the true nature and extent of the developer's 
participation in the purported joint venture."  
</P>
<P>
 The project ultimately failed, and $50 million of the loans was never repaid. 
Coker is now a witness for the government in its investigation, said U.S. Atty. 
John Radsan, a task force leader. He added that the group is continuing its 
investigation of HomeFed.  
</P>
<P>
 Sources said indictments of other former HomeFed executives could follow. 
</P>
<P>
 Dani's lawyer, James Riddet, criticized the indictment, saying it reflects a 
"fundamental misunderstanding by the government." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been trying for months to convince the U.S. attorney's office that 
Mr. Dani has done absolutely nothing wrong with regard to HomeFed Bank or any 
of its subsidiaries," Riddet said. "And I believe that Mr. Dani will be 
completely exonerated of these charges. I believe he should never have been 
indicted." 
</P>
<P>
 HomeFed was seized by regulators in July, 1992, after it had lost $1.05 
billion over two years. The thrift at one time was the nation's fifth-largest 
S&L, with $18 billion in assets and 210 branches. HomeFed holds the dubious 
distinction of being the largest of the 750 thrifts that have gone under in the 
last decade. The failures have cost taxpayers about $90 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Before its fall, HomeFed gained a preeminent position in the thrift industry 
under the leadership of former Chairman Kim Fletcher and Chief Executive Bob 
Adelizzi. During the 1980s, HomeFed rapidly grew and diversified into 
unconventional S&L activities after deregulation, earning big profits in the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 But HomeFed foundered after it embarked on a risky campaign of lending to 
out-of-state builders of apartments and commercial buildings and by stepping up 
its California-based real estate development activities. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, HomeFed had $1 billion invested in its various real estate projects. 
But California's economic problems and the devastating impact on real estate 
values dealt the thrift a fatal blow. Tougher regulatory standards contained in 
the 1989 Financial Recovery and Enforcement Act forced thrifts such as HomeFed 
to unload their real estate properties at huge losses.

PENTIUM CHIP FLAW COULD LEAVE INTEL LIABLE FOR DAMAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE HELM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an ominous new twist to the Pentium chip controversy, computer users in 
corporations around the world are rushing to establish whether a flaw in the 
Intel microprocessor may have resulted in miscalculations that could make them 
vulnerable to lawsuits or trouble from government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Food and Drug Administration told drug companies earlier this week that it 
is concerned about the accuracy of data on clinical trials for new drugs that 
might have been generated on computers using Pentium chips. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith Barney, a New York securities firm, has demanded that IBM replace 
Pentium chips in 600 of its personal computers because of concern that 
miscalculations could draw the ire of the Securities and Exchange Commission 
and generate lawsuits, according to an article in today's issue of 
InformationWeek, an industry publication. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a growing number of individual entrepreneurs concerned that the 
flaw might affect activities ranging from fund management to bookkeeping are 
pushing Intel Corp. for chip replacements. Intel's stock dropped $1.75 to 
$58.625 on Thursday on rumors that the trade journal Infoworld would print test 
results showing a higher error rate than that disclosed by Intel. 
</P>
<P>
 Intel acknowledged last month that its flagship Pentium microprocessor had a 
bug that could cause errors in some math calculations. The company insists the 
errors will almost never occur in the real world, but IBM Corp. said Monday 
that it was halting shipments of Pentium PCs because the problem is worse than 
Intel says. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts said Thursday that miscalculations resulting in economic loss, 
particularly in the five months between the time Intel discovered the flaw in 
June and when it was publicly disclosed in November, could leave Intel liable 
for damages. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is misrepresentation about the product, there is recognized tort for 
recovery of economic loss," said Robert Rabin, a Stanford University law 
professor.  
</P>
<P>
 Rabin noted that Intel's concealment of the flaw and the computer users' 
legitimate assumption that they could depend on the computer for critical 
calculations could give the users a strong case against Intel. 
</P>
<P>
 Intel said it is not concerned. "Heavy-duty users are rechecking their 
calculations all around the world," said Howard High, an Intel spokesman. "So 
far, Prof. (Thomas) Nicely is the only person who has seen a problem in a real 
calculation." Nicely is the Virginia mathematics professor who discovered the 
flaw. 
</P>
<P>
 Some lawyers argue that Intel is liable for damages regardless of whether the 
chip has caused errors in miscalculation. Bill Audet, a San Francisco attorney, 
has filed three class-action suits against Intel in Santa Clara County.  
</P>
<P>
 Intel initially said the flaw would cause a miscalculation only once in 27,000 
years. IBM suggested errors could occur as often as once in 24 days. After 
further testing, Intel said it has come up with new numbers based on a 
collection of spreadsheets used by businesses that suggest that for heavy 
users, errors could occur once in 2,700 years, 10 times more often than its 
initial estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, in a sign of the extent to which Intel chips have become a basic 
engine of the economy, worries about their performance are spreading. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Assn., a group representing 
about 100 drug firms, sent out a notice to its members on behalf of the FDA 
expressing concern about test data that might have been generated on Pentium 
PCs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The FDA hasn't told the companies what to do, they just said they were 
concerned," said spokesman Steve Berchem. Berchem said he expects the FDA to be 
more specific in a note to be published soon in the government's Federal 
Register. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith Barney declined to comment on reports that it has already replaced the 
Pentium processor in 200 of its 600 machines and will replace the rest by 
year-end, in part because of concerns about the SEC's stringent demands for 
accuracy in financial reporting. 
</P>
<P>
 SEC spokesman John Heine confirmed that computer errors are not a legitimate 
excuse for misreporting data. "Whether you use a paper and pencil or a Pentium 
chip, it doesn't matter; it has to be accurate," he said.

JUDGE THROWS OUT $89.5-MILLION BIAS JUDGMENT AGAINST HUGHES; COURTS: JURIST 
SAYS 'RUNAWAY VERDICTS' MUST BE REVERSED IF JURY SYSTEM IS TO SURVIVE. 
PLAINTIFFS' LAWYER VOWS APPEAL.

<P>
 A huge racial-bias judgment, in which a jury found that Hughes Aircraft Co. 
discriminated against two former employees and ordered the aerospace giant to 
pay them $89.5 million in damages, was thrown out Thursday by the judge who 
presided over the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The award, made in October, is "so unsupported by the evidence it shocks the 
conscience of this court to the point where the court cannot countenance such a 
result," Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Malcolm H. Mackey wrote in his 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that "if the jury system is to survive, runaway verdicts such as this 
have to be reversed." 
</P>
<P>
 The case was brought by engineer Jeffrey Lane, 39, who claimed he was denied 
promotions and pay raises because he is black, and by his former supervisor, 
David Villalpando, a 36-year-old Latino who backed up Lane's allegations. Both 
live in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Their lawyer, Ian Herzog, called Mackey's decision "an outrageous miscarriage 
of justice" and said he will appeal. The judge also gave both sides the 
opportunity to seek a new trial if desired. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes, a Los Angeles-based unit of General Motors Corp., had no immediate 
comment on the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the judgment against the firm had come in punitive damages, in which 
the jury awarded $40 million each to Lane and Villalpando. It was considered 
one of the largest such awards ever made in a discrimination case involving 
individual plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Lane, who worked for Hughes from 1977 through 1992, and Villalpando 
claimed that Lane was denied a promotion he was to receive because he lodged 
internal complaints with the company about racial discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 During the eight-week trial, Villalpando testified that he was pressured by 
Hughes management to give Lane negative performance grades, but that when he 
instead came to Lane's defense, he was eventually pushed out of his job. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes asserted that race played no part in Lane's treatment, saying he "had 
not shown the leadership or put forth the extra effort to merit being 
promoted." The company denied that it discriminates against its employees.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; SEC VOICES CONCERN ABOUT MONEY MARKET PRICING OF 
NOTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Securities and Exchange Commission said it is concerned that some money 
market funds are not using "appropriate" prices for the Orange County notes 
they hold. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not reflecting the fair value of these securities is illegal," said Robert 
Plaze, an associate director in the SEC's investment management division."Some 
funds have to focus on pricing issues raised by continuing to hold these 
securities." 
</P>
<P>
 Plaze declined to specify which fund companies may be using inaccurate prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Fund companies are battling to determine accurate prices because there is no 
organized market for Orange County securities. One Orange County note due in 
1995, for example, is being valued anywhere from $840 to $981 per $1,000 of 
face value, brokers said. 
</P>
<P>
 J. J. Kenny Co. and Muller Data Corp., which provide municipal bond prices, 
said in statements last week that they adjust their evaluations of muni bond 
prices where appropriate on certain Orange County bonds in recognition of the 
irregular trading activity. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, no money funds have fallen below $1 a share because of the Orange 
County bankruptcy. Still, the SEC said, there is a distinct possibility that a 
fund will, in industry parlance, "break the buck." Money funds make sure their 
price per share is always $1. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC said it has given about 25 money funds permission to take protective 
steps to ensure that their net asset values stay at $1. Kemper Financial 
Services Inc., Alliance Capital Management, Benham Group and Calvert Group are 
among the companies to receive SEC approval to protect their money funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very confident the prices we're using for the Orange County bonds in 
the California Tax-Free Fund are accurate," said Tom Rondell, Benham spokesman.

2 ACCUSED OF PLOT TO SELL EPOGEN FORMULA; BIOTECH: IT'S THE SECOND FOILED 
INDUSTRIAL ESPIONAGE ATTEMPT IN TWO YEARS INVOLVING AMGEN'S SIGNATURE DRUG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a case of industrial espionage with a blockbuster biotechnology drug as the 
prize, two men have been charged with conspiring to sell a patented formula for 
the genetically engineered Epogen to an FBI agent posing as a Russian spy. 
</P>
<P>
 Epogen is produced by Amgen Inc. of Thousand Oaks, the world's biggest 
biotechnology concern, and accounted for nearly half the firm's 1993 revenue. 
The widely used drug stimulates production of red blood cells. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said it was the second foiled espionage attempt in two years 
involving Epogen. 
</P>
<P>
 Charged in U.S. District Court in Boston on Thursday were Subrahmanyam M. 
Kota, 49, and Vemuri Bhaskar Reddy, 47, natives of India who live in the Boston 
area. Each was charged with one count of conspiring to transfer and transport 
stolen property with a value of $5,000 or more in foreign commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the U.S. attorney's office in Boston, Kota is president of Boston 
Group, a software consulting firm. Reddy was identified as a scientist who 
formerly worked at Integrated Genetics, which was acquired by Genzyme Corp. in 
the late 1980s. Integrated Genetics had earlier developed a patented version of 
Epogen but never commercialized the drug. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint alleges that in October, 1992, an undercover FBI agent, posing 
as a Russian KGB agent, contacted Kota and asked if he was interested in 
"renewing his relationship" with the Russian spy agency. It wasn't clear what 
prompted the FBI's contact or what Kota's alleged ties to the KGB might be. 
</P>
<P>
 Kota agreed and, in later meetings with the FBI operative, offered to sell the 
agent a patented cell line for Epogen that Reddy had stolen from Integrated 
Genetics, the complaint states. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the FBI affidavit, Amgen helped with the investigation by testing 
a sample of the stolen formula and concluding that it contained a form of 
Epogen consistent with the Integrated Genetics version. 
</P>
<P>
 Kota appeared at a hearing Thursday, but he will not enter a plea until he 
appears before a grand jury, according to Assistant U.S. Atty. Robert L. 
Ullmann. Reddy's hearing was continued until Wednesday at the request of his 
counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 The two were being held Thursday night without bail. If convicted, each faces 
a maximum of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 While U.S. Atty. Donald K. Stern stressed the importance of the case to the 
entire biotechnology industry, it is particularly significant for Amgen. Epogen 
sales accounted for about $600 million of Amgen's $1.3 billion in revenue last 
year, and court documents state that Amgen's 1994 sales of Epogen are expected 
to reach $700 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Amgen holds the exclusive rights to produce Epogen in the United States and 
receives international royalties on sales. 
</P>
<P>
 The drug is a genetically engineered copy of the naturally occurring 
erythropoietin hormone, which stimulates production of red blood cells. The 
drug is widely used by kidney dialysis and AIDS patients who suffer from 
anemia. Worldwide sales of Epogen total about $1 billion annually, court 
documents say. 
</P>
<P>
 Biotechnology analyst David Stone at Cowen & Co. in Boston said this type of 
industrial espionage is generally "not a big threat" to Amgen because Epogen is 
sold to hospitals and dialysis centers and not easily administered by 
individuals. He said it would be difficult to create a black market for the 
drug even outside the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't sell Epogen off the back of a truck. It's not like bootleg 
videotapes," he said. He added, however, that "it's important that we not treat 
this lightly. We want to make sure intellectual property is well respected." 
</P>
<P>
 This is not Amgen's first brush with industrial spying. Last year, the company 
-- along with the FBI and a private investigative firm -- thwarted an apparent 
scheme by a low-level employee to steal cells that would enable an outsider to 
reproduce Epogen. 
</P>
<P>
 In the new case, Amgen spokesman David Kaye said he was less concerned with 
any potential market damage to Amgen -- the company does not sell Epogen in 
Russia -- than with the injury that could be done to a patient who received an 
illegal and presumably lower-quality version of Epogen.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; SEC CHAIRMAN URGES VOTERS TO OUST BOARD OF 
SUPERVISORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. has advice for 
Orange County voters whose Board of Supervisors' lack of oversight led to the 
current financial crisis: Throw them out. 
</P>
<P>
 Levitt, at a luncheon meeting of the Town Hall of Los Angeles on Thursday, 
said the supervisors failed to adequately supervise former Tax 
Collector-Treasurer Robert L. Citron, who lost $2 billion in taxpayer money 
wagering that interest rates would fall this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "If your supervisors are so lax that they allow you the unique power, without 
oversight, to make that kind of speculation, I think the voters of that 
community should throw the whole bunch of (them) out of office," said Levitt, 
according to Bloomberg Business News. 
</P>
<P>
 Levitt also came out swinging against Orange County's chief administrative 
officer, Ernie Schneider, who complained over the weekend that Levitt had 
rebuffed his personal appeals for help. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Levitt told it in an interview with The Times, he telephoned Schneider 
repeatedly as the crisis unfolded and made several specific suggestions -- all 
of which Schneider ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider wanted Levitt to impose an immediate moratorium against brokerages 
selling the collateral they held on loans to the county investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Levitt refused, saying that "it would be exactly like closing down the stock 
market." 
</P>
<P>
 But what Levitt did do was telephone the chiefs of all the brokerages involved 
and ask them to voluntarily hold off on collateral sales. He said every 
executive complained that nobody in Orange County would return their calls. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was surprised and dismayed to see (Schneider) attack me afterwards," Levitt 
said.

ACTION TO OUST ABBEY EXEC IS RESCINDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A day after asking its president to step down, Abbey Healthcare Group Inc. 
said Thursday that it has withdrawn its request "pending further immediate 
discussions" between the home health care provider and its second-in-command, 
Jerilyn P. Asher. 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy M. Aitken, Abbey's chairman and chief executive, said in a prepared 
statement that he is "hopeful that there will be an appropriate outcome to 
these discussions." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that Asher has not been dismissed as the Costa Mesa company's 
president, even though a press release and comments from corporate executives 
Wednesday suggested that she had been. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither corporate executives nor Asher, who heads Abbey's Protocare Inc. 
subsidiary in Waltham, Mass., could be reached for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Had Asher been forced out, it would mark the second time this year that Abbey 
had ousted a president. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, the company pushed out Victor M.G. Chaltiel as president and 
chief executive. Chaltiel, who had come from a company acquired by Abbey only 
months earlier, has filed a wrongful-termination suit against Abbey. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Abbey issued a statement saying it had asked Asher to step down 
and "take a leave of absence." Abbey said it was removing Asher at least partly 
because of "personal pressures and the prolonged illnesses" in her family. 
</P>
<P>
 Asher has a daughter who was hospitalized recently with complications of spina 
bifida, an inoperable congenital spinal condition. In addition, Asher's mother 
is seriously ill in a Florida nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
 The company acknowledged, however, that Asher never asked for a leave of 
absence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It reached a point where the board feels a leave of absence is best for all 
considered," Richard J. Rapp, Abbey's chief financial officer, said Wednesday. 
"She may not have realized that this was an option."

MERGER OF INVESTMENT GIANTS COLLAPSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A deal that would have created the world's largest investment bank collapsed 
Thursday when U.S. investment house Morgan Stanley Group Inc. and its British 
counterpart S.G. Warburg Group called off merger talks. 
</P>
<P>
 But analysts said the main sticking point in the $7.8-billion deal -- how 
Warburg's 75%-owned Mercury Asset Management Group would be treated -- could be 
overcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "Remember, the two companies we're talking about here are world leaders in 
(mergers and acquisitions). So they know all the negotiating tactics," said 
Sanford Bernstein analyst Guy Moszkowski. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed merger stumbled over the price demanded by the minority owners of 
Mercury, the jewel in the Warburg crown, according to analysts and a source 
close to the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hang-up was the fairly high price tag attached to the minority interest 
in Mercury," Moszkowski said. 
</P>
<P>
 That stake is largely owned by Mercury managers, and "they wanted to be bought 
out at a high multiple," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed deal, Morgan Stanley would have ended up with two-thirds of 
the combined entity and Warburg with one-third. It would have merged the 
strongest London merchant bank with the old-line establishment firm of Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
 While Morgan would have given Warburg clients entree to the U.S. market, 
Warburg would have given Morgan an extensive shot at expanding its global 
business. Warburg's client list includes more than half the companies listed on 
Britain's Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Index. 
</P>
<P>
 "While the discussions between Morgan Stanley and S.G. Warburg were proceeding 
on the basis of a market-for-market merger, the price and terms on which 
Mercury Asset Management Group indicated it would be willing to participate in 
the transaction were unacceptable to Morgan Stanley," Morgan Stanley said. "For 
its part, Morgan Stanley was unwilling to proceed with a transaction excluding 
Mercury." 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the talks were called off, the treatment of Mercury, and in 
particular the minority 25% holding, had been identified as a possible deal 
breaker. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed likely that the British watchdog Panel on Takeovers and Mergers 
would have required an offer to be made for the minority holding on the grounds 
that Mercury was the main reason that the merger was taking place at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said that despite its excellent British and European client list, 
good market-making operations and high profile in corporate finance, Warburg's 
investment banking operation is making no money and has serious problems.

SETTLEMENT OF BANKERS TRUST CASE MAY HAVE EFFECT ON O.C.; INVESTIGATION: 
SOURCES BELIEVE TWO FEDERAL AGENCIES WILL MAKE SIMILAR AGGRESSIVE INQUIRIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The expected settlement of a federal investigation into the sale of 
derivatives by Bankers Trust New York Corp. means two federal agencies will 
make similar aggressive inquiries into Orange County's bond debacle, sources 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The action they will take (against Bankers Trust) has much broader 
implications," said a source familiar with the negotiations, which involve the 
Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the SEC and the CFTC have auditors poring over the Orange County 
investment pool, according to regulatory sources. It is rare for both agencies 
to be involved at the same time, but the complex activities that resulted in 
big losses in the county's investment portfolio could have involved futures 
contracts as well as conventional securities. 
</P>
<P>
 If fraud is involved, both agencies could make cases, according to regulatory 
officials, but preliminary inquiries have not yet turned up evidence that 
Orange County managers were defrauded by the brokerage firms selling the 
derivatives.  
</P>
<P>
 "It appears they had a sophisticated strategy and knew what they were doing," 
one CFTC official said, referring to the county fiscal managers. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he emphasized that the CFTC inquiry, still in a preliminary stage, is 
an intensive one involving personnel from the agency's Los Angeles office as 
well as a special auditor from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next several weeks, Bankers Trust expects to reach a settlement with 
the SEC and the CFTC that would involve filing civil lawsuits and a 
simultaneous consent decree, according to a knowledgeable source. It involves 
one employee of the securities firm and Gibson Greetings, the client that 
bought the often highly complex derivatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The basic sale of derivatives to dozens of clients is a legitimate activity of 
the bank and is not being challenged, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 The conducting of parallel inquiries by two federal agencies that usually 
cover different sectors of the investment world reflects the mounting concern 
and uncertainty over sales and promotions of derivatives as investments. 
Derivatives are financial instruments, often highly complex, linked to 
underlying stocks or bonds or to indexes connected with stock and bond markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The CFTC oversees futures contracts, which are agreements to buy or sell 
commodities for future delivery at prices fixed today. The commission also 
handles complex variations of these contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to see if there are instruments that fall under our jurisdiction," 
the CFTC official said.

 Mortgage Rates Hit 3-Year High: Thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgages averaged 
9.25% this week, up from 9.15% last week, according to a national survey 
released by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. It was the highest since Aug. 
9, 1991, when the average was 9.27%.The average hit a 25-year low of 6.74% in 
October, 1993. On one-year, adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an 
average initial rate of 6.75%, up from 6.56% last week. Fifteen-year mortgages, 
a popular option for those refinancing mortgages, averaged 8.89% this week, up 
from 8.77% a week earlier. The rates do not include add-on fees known as 
points.

 Business Inventories Continue Rise: In the latest sign of the economy's 
health, businesses are continuing to stockpile goods at a solid pace, 
indicating that they anticipate strong sales.The Commerce Department reported 
that business inventories rose in October for the seventh consecutive month, 
posting a 0.4% advance. Sales, which slipped 0.2% in September, rebounded and 
gained 0.2%. But some economists said they are concerned that rising interest 
rates mean trouble ahead. "The question is whether additional interest rate 
increases will slow consumer and business spending enough to cause production 
declines," said Ron Schreibman of the National Assn. of 
Wholesaler-Distributors.

 Sprint Forecasts Lower Income: The company said it expects fourth-quarter 
operating income in its long-distance business to decline from the third 
quarter, partly because of increased competition in the consumer long-distance 
market.Sprint Corp. and MCI Communications Corp. may be feeling the effects of 
stepped-up marketing efforts by AT&T Corp., the largest U.S. long-distance 
company. AT&T told a group of analysts that it added 300,000 customers in its 
consumer long-distance business in November, almost tripling its average 
monthly gain for 1994. Sprint, the No. 3 U.S. long-distance company, reported 
that its third-quarter operating profit was up 31%. Revenue for the division 
rose 13%, to $1.74 billion from $1.54 billion.

 Judge Approves Manville Asbestos Plan: U.S. District Judge Jack Weinstein of 
Brooklyn OKd a second attempt to save the cash-strapped Manville trust, 
approving a plan under which more than 100,000 claimants will initially get 10 
cents on the dollar for asbestos-related injuries. Weinstein said in a 222-page 
decision that the plan will ensure that all claimants are compensated to some 
degree. The restructuring also increases the trust's assets by at least $1 
billion.

CONSUMER GROUP PICKS YEAR'S 'MOST MISLEADING, UNFAIR AND IRRESPONSIBLE' AD

 A Washington-based consumer organization on Thursday announced its picks for 
the 10 most misleading ads of the year, but some advertisers accused the 
critics of being misleading. 
</P>
<P>
 The Center for Science in the Public Interest bestows its Harlan Page Hubbard 
Lemon awards to draw attention to what it considers to be the "most misleading, 
unfair and irresponsible ad campaigns." Among the recipients: 
</P>
<P>
 * Prudential Securities, for ads promising consumers "straight talk." The 
company recently paid a $600-million penalty for misrepresenting risky limited 
partnership stakes as safe investments. Prudential had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
 * Walt Disney Co., for its "Movie News" television commercials that look like 
news reports, complete with an anchor. A Disney spokesman could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 * Texaco Inc., for claiming its Clean System 3 gasoline provides "highest 
performance." A Texaco spokesman said that in response to a challenge from the 
Better Business Bureau, the company has reworded the claim to say "higher 
performance." 
</P>
<P>
 * GMC Truck, for claiming its Safari minivan is "safe enough for your precious 
cargo," even though the van ranked near the bottom in a government crash test. 
A GM spokesman said the Safari meets all government safety standards and that 
its fatality rate in actual driving is about average for minivans. "As usual, 
this group has taken information out of context and has ignored the full amount 
of available data," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Van Den Bergh Food, for Promise Margarine ads advising consumers to get 
"heart smart." The margarine is high in total fat, which is a factor in obesity 
and heart disease. A spokesman for the company said the ad has not been used in 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Johnson & Johnson, for its Arthritis Foundation line of pain relievers. The 
products consist of aspirin, acetaminophen or ibuprofen but may cost as much as 
$150 a year more than other brands. A J&J spokesman said customers can receive 
a free membership in the foundation, a $20 value.

CONSUMER BRIEFS: GENETIC SQUASH COMING INCOGNITO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal regulators gave final permission this week for a new genetically 
altered vegetable to go on sale in U.S. supermarkets, probably next spring. The 
yellow crookneck squash that was developed by Upjohn Co. is unlikely to carry a 
special label, however, which has drawn protests from some environmentalist and 
consumer groups. This will mark the first time a genetically engineered whole 
food has been sold in grocery stores unlabeled. The world's first genetically 
engineered food, the "Flavr-Savr" tomato that went on sale in October, has been 
voluntarily labeled by its producer, Calgene Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The Union of Concerned Scientists and the Environmental Defense Fund said the 
commercial planting of the squash could create new and worse plant viruses and 
significantly increase the wild squash weed problem through pollination. But 
developers of the vegetable discounted those criticisms. "Seed companies and 
universities have been breeding disease resistance into cultivated varieties 
for decades, and there's never been any indication that this has caused an 
increase in wild weed relatives," said David Tricoli, one of the developers of 
the squash. The squash has been under development by Asgrow Seed Co., a 
subsidiary of Upjohn, for four years. The vegetable cleared its first major 
hurdle last month when the Food and Drug Administration said the product and 
six other genetically altered foods did not pose any health risks. 
</P>

 Food Labels Found Accurate: New-style labels on food sold in U.S. groceries 
are accurate in 87% of cases, the Food and Drug Administration said this week, 
based on a random analysis of 300 foods on store shelves. The labels, 
introduced May 8, show the number of calories and the quantity of fat, 
cholesterol, fiber and other nutrients in processed foods. For fat, the diet 
hazard most Americans try to spot, the accuracy was 94%, and for calories it 
was 93%. FDA Commissioner David Kessler said inspectors also found that of a 
sample of 5,000 products surveyed since August, less than 1% were missing the 
new labels. The FDA sent warning letters to 28 companies involved, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 New Tax-Preparation Software: Intuit has a new CD-ROM to help prepare for 
income tax time. TurboTax Multimedia includes tax-preparation software and 
advice from tax experts Marshall Loeb and Mary L. Sprouse.  
</P>
<P>
 The program requires a 486 IBM or compatible personal computer, MPC-compatible 
double-speed CD-ROM drive, 4 MB of RAM, a 256 color VGA monitor, sound card and 
speakers and Windows 3.1 or higher. Intuit will sell two versions of TurboTax 
this year: a HeadStart version sold in the last quarter of the year and a final 
version available in January. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 New Diaper-Changing Pad: Each year more than 4,000 babies are injured in falls 
from changing tables or dressers, according to the Consumer Product Safety 
Commission. A Denver-based company, Basic Comfort Inc., has designed a changing 
pad that cradles and holds the baby while it is being changed or dressed.  
</P>
<P>
 The EZ-Change has a V-shaped indentation in the middle and an adjustable 
elastic safety strap to keep the baby secure. It is portable, made of 
non-allergenic, flame-retardant foam cushions and covered in washable 
waterproof terry cloth with Velcro closing tabs. It has a suggested retail 
price of $29.95.

AUTO REPAIR COMPLAINT SETTLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Parnelli Jones Inc. agreed Thursday to pay $800,000 to settle charges that it 
has bilked auto repair customers throughout California. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges stem from a two-year undercover investigation conducted by the 
state Bureau of Automotive Repair, which said its agents were overcharged an 
average of $218 for repairs not needed or work not done. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, Parnelli Jones President Dan Beach denied the allegations. He 
said the company agreed to settle because it could not afford prolonged 
litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Parnelli Jones, based in Ventura, has 50 auto repair facilities in the state, 
23 of them in Southern California. The privately held company has annual sales 
of about $32 million. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the third well-known firm to be charged with auto repair fraud in 
California in recent years. Two years ago, Sears, Roebuck & Co. paid $8 million 
to settle similar charges. Last year, Winston Tire paid $1.4 million to settle 
allegations of overcharging. 
</P>
<P>
 The bureau said it sent undercover agents to 22 Parnelli Jones outlets, 
including one each in Pasadena, Torrance, Anaheim and Buena Park. The agents 
were overcharged 90% of the time, the bureau said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cars used in the investigation needed modest repairs, typically new brake 
pads and alignment, the bureau said. Besides doing what was needed, Parnelli 
employees sold the agents unnecessary parts and services, the bureau said.  
</P>
<P>
 For example, a Pasadena store allegedly overcharged $427.25 for brake 
calipers, front and rear shock absorbers and semi-metallic brake pads. The 
agent was also charged for an alignment not performed, the bureau said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parnelli also agreed to a one-day suspension of its operating license. The 
settlement includes $250,000 in fines, $229,000 to pay for auto repair 
programs, $309,000 for investigative costs and restitution and $25,000 for a 
consumer protection trust fund administered by district attorneys. Parnelli 
must also make restitution to the 35 customers whose complaints prompted the 
probe. The bureau will investigate future complaints, a spokeswoman said.

HOSPITAL RATING PANEL MAKES REPORTS PUBLIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group that accredits 80% of the nation's hospitals released its ratings 
reports to the public for the first time Thursday, quickly drawing complaints 
from hospitals about the fairness of the studies and from consumer groups about 
the price of the reports. 
</P>
<P>
 The release of the reports by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of 
Healthcare Organizations has created a furor in the hospital industry.Last week 
the American Hospital Assn. declared a "crisis in confidence" in the 
commission, but it seemed to take a more conciliatory approach Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an important first step and will be useful to patients," spokesman 
William Erwin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, hospital groups in California and a dozen other states are so upset 
about the reports that they are considering withdrawing support from the group. 
</P>
<P>
 "We recognize that hospitals must be accountable for the services they 
provide," said Julie Hopkins, manager of accreditation issues for the Hospital 
Council of Southern California. But she said hospitals believe there are 
inconsistencies in the quality of the commission's inspections and in its final 
reports. The reports grade hospitals on services and safety issues.  
</P>
<P>
 The commission's reports Thursday cover almost 400 hospitals and 250 other 
health care institutions. Some of the Southern California hospitals include 
Sherman Oaks Hospital and Health Center, Orange County Community Hospital in 
Buena Park, Encino-Tarzana Regional Medical Center and Pioneer Hospital in 
Artesia. Details of the reports were not immediately available, but copies of 
the studies can be ordered by writing the commission at 1 Renaissance Blvd., 
Oakbrook Terrace, IL 60181. 
</P>
<P>
 While commission officials said the release of the reports is designed to 
inform the public, a consumers group said the cost of the reports -- $30 per 
hospital -- is "prohibitive."

WRITERS GUILD, MAJOR NETWORKS REACH AGREEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Negotiators for the Writers Guild of America, whose 1988 strike crippled the 
TV season that year, have reached an agreement with the production arms of the 
three major broadcast networks but remain at odds with a group representing 
independent producers and studios, guild officials announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The guild said board members of its Eastern and Western faction have endorsed 
a contract covering production by ABC, CBS and NBC that would take effect May 
2. 
</P>
<P>
 The guild did not release many specifics of the new plan, pending a mailing of 
the details to members after Jan. 1. But it did say that some of the highlights 
include a pioneering clause detailing rates of payments to writers for the use 
of clips from TV shows or movies in interactive technology such as CD-ROM 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the guild said the agreement calls for higher minimum 
compensation, an acceleration of residual payments in certain transactions and 
broadening the coverage of writers who work on so-called "reality programming." 
</P>
<P>
 The guild's deal with the three networks is significant because the networks 
are rapidly expanding the amount of news and entertainment produced internally. 
They are expected to boost production even more with the lifting of 
restrictions on their ability to own financial interests in the shows they air 
and profit from the reruns in syndication. 
</P>
<P>
 The guild said it will meet in January with the Alliance of Motion Picture and 
Television Producers, which represents the independent producers and studios 
who produce most television programming on the air, and that informal talks are 
continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 The schism between the networks and the alliance is unusual in that the 
parties almost always negotiate side by side in a united front. Negotiators for 
the networks did not return calls. Nick Counter, president of the alliance, did 
not comment on the schism, but said negotiations with the guild are not at an 
impasse. 
</P>
<P>
 But sources close to the guild side said they believe that the break stems 
partly from disagreements over the issue of how writers are compensated when 
they work on Fox network shows. 
</P>
<P>
 The three major networks believe that the playing field should be more level 
and that compensation for writers of shows on Fox should eventually be brought 
up to the standards set for writers on network shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Writers for Fox shows have received lower minimums and residuals, which has 
been viewed as an acknowledgment of Fox's smaller audience and the fact that 
Fox technically has not qualified as a network under Federal Communications 
Commission guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 As an example, the residuals a writer receives for a rerun of a 30-minute 
prime-time show on ABC, NBC or CBS is $7,863, compared to $3,145 the first time 
a show reruns on Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fox's rapid growth and its emergence as a major force -- marked by events 
such as Fox's gaining National Football League games -- has brought pressure to 
apply the same guild terms to writers on its shows. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar break in negotiations took place when the networks separated in late 
November from the alliance in negotiating with the American Federation of 
Television & Radio Artists, purportedly over the Fox issue. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, sources also said the failure of the guild to so far reach an 
agreement with the alliance also stems from the issue of compensating writers 
for the use of clips in interactive media, remains an open issue with the 
studios who are members of the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 Some creative issues remaining between the guild and producers are said to 
include the so-called "possessive credit" in which directors often start a 
picture with the words "A film by" along with their names. But sources said the 
compensation of Fox writers and the use of clips in interactive technology 
remain bigger issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The guild has been close to reaching an agreement with producers on a new 
contract several times. The current one expires in 1995. It was an extension 
worked out in 1991 of the contract that was agreed to in 1988, when the 
industry suffered a devastating 154-day strike that virtually shut down 
television and film production.

 Television: The Federal Communications Commission proposed Thursday to 
dramatically ease television ownership rules, a move that would let the four 
broadcast networks vastly expand their size and reach. As part of a broad 
reconsideration of rules for an increasingly competitive television industry, 
the commission unanimously voted to seek public comments on a plan to eliminate 
a provision that bars companies from owning more than 12 TV stations.It also 
proposed doubling to 50% the total percentage of American households that a 
network's TV stations can collectively reach. Currently, each broadcast company 
is barred from owning TV stations that together cover more than 25% of the U.S. 
population (most stations carrying network programming aren't actually owned by 
the networks). The FCC would increase the current limit by five percentage 
points every three years until the 50% ceiling is reached. Agency officials 
said they would also consider less sweeping ways to ease TV ownership limits as 
alternatives to the plan they put forth.

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: LAST STOP ON THE COMPANY TOWN WILD RIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON, Alan Citron is leaving The Times to become vice president of 
publications and media ventures at Ticketmaster. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five years ago I was quietly doing my job on the Metro desk, not really 
bothering anyone, when an editor asked me how I felt about the entertainment 
business beat. "I feel fine about it," I told her. "Except . . . I don't know 
anything about entertainment or business." 
</P>
<P>
 Not a problem, she said. You'll learn. It will be an adventure. And she was 
right. 
</P>
<P>
 Covering the entertainment industry is like visiting another planet on a day 
pass. I won't call it "Planet Hollywood," because that name's already taken. 
But the analogy works. No other people resemble those you meet there, and few 
other businesses are such a consistent roller-coaster ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Like everyone, I had my ups and downs. Some people befriended me and became 
valued sources. Others accused me of being obsessed with their foibles -- 
especially those at Sony Pictures. A few misled me. All in all, I have more 
good memories than bad, but now it's time to move on. Time to return to the 
real world. . . . Call it Planet I-Don't-Care-What-Sony-Did-Now. 
</P>
<P>
 I won't get sentimental. But since all reporters and native Southerners are 
inveterate storytellers, I will leave you with a few favorite anecdotes and 
life lessons: 
</P>
<P>
 There must be some mistake: People like to think that Hollywood columnists, 
even business columnists, spend most of their time cavorting at cocktail 
parties and premieres. Unfortunately, that's not true. I spent many more hours 
hunched over my cramped desk next to the office printer. 
</P>
<P>
 The most memorable exception was the time I was seated next to Arthur Krim -- 
the Hollywood legend and confidante of U.S. Presidents -- at an AIDS 
fund-raiser during the 1993 Cannes Film Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 This was a hot ticket event. The honoree was Elizabeth Taylor and the guests 
were whisked to Le Moulin de Mougins restaurant outside Cannes in a motorcade 
of Renaults, complete with police sirens wailing. Neither Krim, who died this 
year, nor I had any idea what I was doing next to him. But he was a good sport, 
and shared some unforgettable stories from his days running United Artists and 
Orion Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Never be upstaged by your food: That same year a Russian businessman who was 
trying to make a splash in Hollywood hosted a lavish party aboard a yacht 
docked next to the Palais des Festivals. 
</P>
<P>
 Overindulgence defines most Cannes events, but he managed to wow even the most 
jaded Cote d'Azur partygoers by stocking the yacht with mountains of the finest 
caviar, smoked salmon, lobster and vodka. His fatal mistake was doing a better 
job of catering than making deals. 
</P>
<P>
 People still talk about the party, but no one remembered the businessman's 
name until last week, when the Hollywood Reporter revealed that Serge Majarow, 
36, the illustrious-unknown Cannes party thrower, had been gunned down in 
Paris, an act that was linked to the Russian mafia. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe College: I have two Hollywood letters framed and hanging in my study. The 
first is a gracious note from Variety's Army Archerd wishing me well on Company 
Town. The second is from a major Hollywood figure who was worried about his 
education. The executive said that he was thinking of applying to graduate 
school, and wanted to know if I would write him a letter of recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 I figured it was a joke, since anyone worth tens of millions of dollars and 
running a major company can probably get into graduate school just fine on his 
own. But I was wrong. He subsequently called to confirm that I had received the 
letter. Luckily, it never came up again. But seeing it on my wall still gives 
me a good laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Has anyone seen my personality? Striking the right chord with Hollywood 
sources is a difficult thing. You have to maintain your journalistic detachment 
at the same time that you're trying to develop relationships within the 
hermetic entertainment world. 
</P>
<P>
 At the beginning I guess there was too much detachment in my deportment. 
During a getting-to-know-you dinner with one executive, we discovered that we 
came from similar middle-class Jewish backgrounds. I could tell something about 
that troubled him. Later in the talk he revealed what it was. "Are you sure 
you're Jewish?" he asked. "Well, yeah," I stammered. "Why?" "I dunno," he 
answered. "You just don't have much of a personality." 
</P>
<P>
 Personality goes a long way: Steve Ross, the late Time Warner chairman, was in 
the midst of a losing campaign to win Wall Street over to a controversial 
variable rights offering in 1991, when he agreed to see me at his Manhattan 
office. The meeting was supposed to last about 30 minutes. But once he got 
wound up, Ross was like a preacher who couldn't get enough of the sound of his 
own voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Two hours later he was still postulating the benefits of the offering, his 
arms flailing and his ingratiating smile growing more intense. I never saw the 
logic of the offering, but it was impossible not to be swept up in the passion 
he had for his ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 But not that far: I realized I was taking my own job way too seriously at the 
Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, last January, when a scheduling 
conflict forced me to choose between spending an hour with supermodel Elle 
Macpherson, who was there promoting her role in "Sirens," or the extremely 
unmodel-like Harvey Weinstein, the co-chairman of Miramax Films. 
</P>
<P>
 I chose Weinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Killer Diller and Simmering Sid: There's always been a certain aura around 
Hollywood's tough-guy moguls, including QVC Chairman Barry Diller and MCA 
President Sid Sheinberg. I got off to a rocky start with Diller when, in our 
first conversation, he paused and asked, "Why am I talking to you?" But I 
eventually came to appreciate his cut-through-it candor. Sheinberg was another 
matter. Talking to me seemed to pain him more than reading the grosses on 
"Junior." People insist that he's actually a good guy, so maybe it was just me. 
</P>
<P>
 No autographs, please: Business reporters don't have much cause to talk to 
celebrities, and that was fine with me, because the behind-the-scenes players 
are substantially more interesting, anyway. But it's impossible to do this job 
without occasionally bumping into a star. 
</P>
<P>
 I met Warren Beatty at his favorite hideaway once to talk about an executive I 
was profiling. It soon became clear Beatty had no intention of ratting on the 
executive, but he was happy to discuss the pop culture significance of Richard 
Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 Another time, Sylvester Stallone was talking about the vagaries of the 
industry. He had just finished "Cliffhanger," and I asked why he was returning 
to tough-guy roles after a string of movies aimed at a family audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because," he thundered, "the Earth is not a family-oriented spot!" 
</P>
<P>
 History doesn't always play like the movies: In September, outgoing Walt 
Disney Studios Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg and I were in New York at the same 
time, and he offered me a ride back to Los Angeles on the Disney jet. 
</P>
<P>
 I took him up on it -- both as a way to get out of coach class and for the 
chance to observe firsthand Katzenberg's last hours as chairman, since it was 
his final day on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 The frenetic future Dream Teamer was even more keyed up than usual during the 
flight. He checked his office for messages repeatedly, flipped aimlessly 
through his faxes and was distracted in conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 When the jet finally started its descent, I was still waiting for some 
memorable, historic gesture. Would he salute the stewardess? Kiss the Tarmac? 
Steal a Mickey Mouse towel from the jet lavatory? 
</P>
<P>
 No. Instead, he pulled an emery board out of his briefcase and began 
nonchalantly filing his nails. "Is that it?" I asked, realizing that the only 
insight I was taking away was a better understanding of his grooming habits. 
"Is that all you're going to do?" "Yep," he said. "That's it." 
</P>
<P>
 And it is.

FOREIGNERS MAKE GAINS IN JAPAN CHIP MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Foreign manufacturers held a record 23.2% share of Japan's lucrative 
semiconductor market in the third quarter, the U.S. government reported 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers should help defuse tension between Washington and Tokyo over the 
matter.A 1991 agreement between the United States and Japan calls for a minimum 
20% foreign share of Japan's market for the tiny computer chips, which are used 
in products ranging from toasters to automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
 The market -- which accounts for 34% of world sales of the chips -- is 
expected to be worth almost $30 billion this year, says World Semiconductor 
Trade Statistics, a U.S.-based research organization. 
</P>
<P>
 From July to September, foreign companies accounted for 23.2% of 
semiconductors sold in Japan, up from 21.9% in the previous quarter, the U.S. 
government said. The Japanese government, which counts some imports not 
included in the U.S. figures, said the share was 23.4%, up from 22.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only has the Japanese market become more competitive, but cooperation is 
replacing confrontation on the question of market access," said Andrew A. 
Procassini, president of the San Jose-based Semiconductor Industry Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Washington called for emergency steps to boost foreign 
market share in Japan after it fell below 20% for three straight quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of both sides expressed satisfaction with Thursday's figures.

TAKEOVER BID

<P>
 A three-judge panel of the Delaware Supreme Court may have killed the hostile 
takeover bid for US Facilities Corp. in a ruling that keeps the Costa Mesa 
insurance carrier's board of directors intact. 
</P>
<P>
 The court in Delaware, where US Facilities is incorporated, rejected an appeal 
by Fidelity National Financial Inc. in Irvine to place two Fidelity nominees on 
the board of US Facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision, which reinstates directors John A. Allison and John F. Kooken, 
was cheered by George Kadonada, US Facilities' chairman. "This ruling assures 
we can continue working successfully toward our goal of maximizing stockholder 
value," he said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 William P. Foley II, Fidelity's chairman, said that he still wants to buy US 
Facilities and that he will meet with his executives to plot the next step. 
"It's a disappointment," he said. "We can't compel a sale on the same 
expeditious route we had planned, but it is not over." 
</P>
<P>
 Investors, however, appear to have lost interest. The company's stock price 
closed Thursday at $9.75 a share, up 12.5 cents a share in Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity, which owns 9.9% of US Facilities' stock, had offered $15 a share, or 
about $79 million, at a time when US Facilities' shares were in a slump, 
trading at about $10. The price reached $14.38 a share when Fidelity won 
shareholder approval, but it has since fallen back. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity, the nation's fifth-largest title insurance company, had won an 
overwhelming vote by shareholders at the US Facilities annual meeting in May to 
sell the Costa Mesa company to the highest bidder. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fidelity's director nominees seemingly squeaked to victory by 23,808 votes 
after independent vote auditors threw out 80,386 shares that appeared to be for 
management's slate. Embarrassingly, the disqualified shares were owned by the 
company's employees through their 401(k) retirement plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Auditors disqualified the shares because they couldn't determine which side 
held the legitimate proxy--the right to vote those shares. Shareholders voting 
by proxy were supposed to turn in a white form if they were voting for 
management or a blue form if they were voting for Fidelity. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bank of New York, the 401(k) trustee, turned in both the white and the 
blue proxies. Furthermore, both proxies carried the same date, making it 
impossible to tell whether one superseded the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity acknowledged that the trustee intended to vote for management but 
simply failed to make that clear. But, in a nine-page decision, the Delaware 
Supreme Court panel said that "the investor should not be disenfranchised as 
the result of the record stockholder's mistaken submission of conflicting 
proxies."

THE SCENE / ORANGE: BUT DAD SAID . . .; 'MONEY DOESN'T GROW ON TREES'; WORKING 
AT A CHRISTMAS LOT GIVES STUDENTS WHAT THEY NEED TO GET INTO THE SPIRIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA JONES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ever dream of spending your crisp winter evenings among aromatic Douglas firs, 
Nobles and Scotch pines while hanging out with friends? Of being a part of the 
great American holiday machinery that turns our hearths and homes into 
picturesque Christmas settings? 
</P>
<P>
 Then you, too, can become one of the few, the proud, one of the staff at your 
local tree lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Costa Mesa junior Jacob Loyko, who's spent much of the past two weeks, 
including 12 hours a day on the weekends, unpacking hundreds of trees a foot 
taller than he is, shaking them, sawing off the ends to even them out, lining 
them up, hammering buckets and stands on to them and patiently attending to a 
never-ending parade of customers who can't leave without finding nature's 
arboreal masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
 To them, Jacob, 16, has this message: "That perfect tree everyone wants 
doesn't exist. It just doesn't exist." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacob should know. This is his second year employed at a tree lot, his first 
working for Noonan's giant lot on Newport Boulevard. He got the job through his 
friend Zeke Noonan, also a Costa Mesa junior and the owner's grandson. Two 
other classmates also work there. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most high schoolers who take one of the slew of odd, minimum-wage, 
temporary jobs that come with the season, Jacob says he "needed it to buy 
Christmas presents. You can make pretty good money in tips at this." 
</P>
<P>
 Why else would anyone want to put up with the "holiday cheer" that comes with 
retail, especially customers who are either pushy, frazzled and out-of-it or 
complicated (my mom visits at least six lots before settling on a tree that 
almost fits her requirements). 
</P>
<P>
 To keep from getting chilled to the bone, Jacob layers on long johns and 
sweats (top and bottom) under his jeans, a polo shirt and another sweat shirt. 
He also wears two pairs of thick socks, making for a snug fit in his tan work 
boots. The complete ensemble, he informs me, does keep him warm -- the same 
outfit has gone from his body to his bedroom floor and back these past few days 
without a visit to the laundry room. 
</P>
<P>
 "They smell like pine," he says. It's too cold for me to tell. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacob embraces the physical toil involved in this line of work out of some 
Zen-like pleasure in working with his hands. Of course, the first day at the 
lot, Jacob recalls, he just about killed his hands from all the hammering. Now 
he just goes home with sore legs. 
</P>
<P>
 During downtime -- when every possible task, from ensuring the trees are 
positioned in straight lines to preparing more stands, has been completed and 
gone over again -- Jacob and the other young workers read the paper, listen to 
the entertaining ramblings of an older employee or get real creative and play 
football in the back with a piece of wood. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacob returns to the topic of tips, explaining that the guys count on tips 
from customers when they haul the trees to their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get to know whether a customer is a good tipper or not before they even 
walk in here," he says. He couldn't explain the criteria except to say that the 
guys guessed I would be a good tipper by my funky dress and demeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 He says he encourages his classmates to stop by "his" lot instead of others 
expecting that if it's his friend's parents they'll tip better. That theory 
still has yet to materialize, he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can tell between the people who have money and don't want to let go of it 
and those that have it and don't mind spending it," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a total drag, however, when "you work real hard helping them pick a 
tree," says Jacob, "tying it up and putting it on their car and they stiff you 
on the tip. Or they give you a dollar" instead of the two or three dollars they 
hope to get. 
</P>
<P>
 That goes without saying at the American Explorers Youth Center tree lot in 
Brea, where the mostly teen-age staff forfeits a wage as part of its 
fund-raising efforts for the center. Proceeds from tree sales finance monthly 
outdoor expeditions for the more than 250 teens involved in the nonprofit 
program. So any tips are valued among these young volunteers because such 
gratuities are their only pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Lot manager Robert Aikins, a senior at Sonora High in La Habra, says he has 
learned not to expect anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "More people don't tip than tip," he says. "What's odd is you go to these 
total mansions to deliver these huge trees, and those people never tip. It's 
the normal people, the ones who aren't really rich or poor, that tip the best." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the 18-year-old's third year at this lot, but his fifth with American 
Explorers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first year I thought I was too cool, too busy," he says. "The next year I 
was going to come for a day, but something else came up." 
</P>
<P>
 He finally showed up the third year and worked his way up to his current 
responsibility, which entails five to six hours every day, except for the 14 
hours he puts in on the weekends as a service technician at Super K-Mart. 
Robert started this year the day after Halloween, erecting poles and wrapping 
wire fencing around the lot in the front of the youth center. He drove with 
director Randy Gamboa and other members of the teen committee to Riverside to 
pick up the buckets, stands and flocking.  
</P>
<P>
 "I have fun down here. We mess around," says Robert. "Plus it feels good that 
I helped out in my community. I've learned management, sales skills and values. 
I've learned to be a better person." 
</P>
<P>
 He's also honed his knowledge of tree flocking. It's among other skills he 
passes on to the staff. On this evening, he teaches Brea Canyon sophomore Jesse 
Ortiz, 15, to custom spray a tree with faux snow. He discreetly tells Jesse to 
keep the hose steady and not clump up the once-green branches with too much 
fluff. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my third year of flocking," Robert says. "I guess I have some hidden 
talent to doing that." Of the dozen flocked at the lot, he sprayed 10. "It's 
not as popular this year as it was last. You know, flocking is one of those 
things that goes in and out of style." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert's nose is purple from the chill in the air, and I'm trembling so much 
my writing has turned into doctor's script. Besides all the clothes he's 
wearing, Robert figures the dual coverage of a Santa's hat over a baseball cap 
keeps most of his body heat from escaping. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're required to wear these hats," he says, half apologetically. "We feel 
weird about it, but then, there are customers who come in wearing them too, so 
I guess it's OK." 
</P>
<P>
 It's this kind of spirit, parlayed by the Santa hats everyone wears or what 
Robert calls the Christmas tree shopping outfits ("those sweaters with bells 
and all sort of things hanging off of them"), that Robert and his friends 
thrive on and that keeps them coming back day after day, despite the cold, the 
physical work and the tip situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's weird because we'll help someone, and a couple of hours later they come 
back with a plate of cookies," he says. "It gets me in the Christmas mood and 
makes me want to help everyone find their dream tree." 
</P>
<P>
 He pauses to watch his breath in the early evening air. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only drawback is, I can't smell Christmas trees at all anymore."

RETURN TO HER CREATIVE ROOTS IS A NOVEL SUCCESS; BOOKS: TV WRITER AND PRODUCER 
APRIL SMITH TOOK A GAMBLE ON FICTION. HER 'NORTH OF MONTANA' IS WINNING PRAISE 
-- EVEN HOLLYWOOD IS INTERESTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MONA GABLE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Here is Ana Grey, tough-girl FBI agent, her .357 Magnum cocked, in the midst 
of nailing a bank robber: "I'm really nervous right now," confides the 
protagonist of "North of Montana," "so don't make me use this because I 
probably won't kill you. I'll just maim you for life." 
</P>
<P>
 Here is April Smith, the book's sweet-as-pie author, lamenting to a reporter 
how guilty she feels this morning because her husband had to take their 
3-year-old daughter to the doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 "She just has a cold," says Smith, whose gritty novel has won kudos from the 
likes of Scott Turow and James Ellroy, "but I felt bad I had to leave her and 
go to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith is sitting in her cozy two-room office in a medical building in Santa 
Monica. It's just down the street from the notably unglamorous Henley Hotel -- 
a setting in her novel -- around the corner from the trendy Third Street 
Promenade, and a few blocks from her home in an upscale Santa Monica 
residential neighborhood known as (what else?) north of Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in a plaid flannel shirt, khaki shorts and fashionable hiking boots, 
with honey-blond hair and creamy skin, the mid-40s writer looks like a model 
for an Oil of Olay ad. Hardly someone who would turn out lines like her 
description of a perfect arrest: "It was pure sex." Nonetheless, the 
soft-spoken Smith clearly has an instinct for snappy patter and the seamy side 
of big-city crime. 
</P>
<P>
 A successful TV writer and producer for nearly 20 years, she nabbed two Emmy 
nominations for her work on "Cagney and Lacey." She's also written several TV 
movies, including one about cops' wives called "Best Kept Secrets." 
</P>
<P>
 And now "North of Montana," her first novel, about the adventures of a female 
FBI agent in Los Angeles, seems to be generating terrific heat. 
</P>
<P>
 The book, for which the unknown author received six figures, had an initial 
printing of 200,000 copies. There have been stories in Vanity Fair and People 
magazine. Great notices in Kirkus Reviews and Publishers Weekly. Ballantine 
paid $550,000 for paperback rights. And, naturally, there's interest in 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, no one seems more stunned by all the hoopla than Smith, who spent 3 1/2 
years writing what she describes as a "gamble." Asked her response to the 
novel's success, it is the one time she sounds like her tough-talking heroine 
Ana. "Completely blown away," she says with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 With a rat-a-tat style and a narrative akin to a high-speed freeway chase, 
"North of Montana" follows the ambitious Ana through one professional and 
personal crisis after the next. It careens through L.A.'s most famous and 
disparate neighborhoods, from the wealthy Westside to the gritty streets of 
Pico Rivera.  
</P>
<P>
 As issues and life in Los Angeles go, it's got everything. There's rich whites 
and poor Latinos. There's a fading movie queen and Hollywood cynicism. There's 
bad cops, drug addiction, sex discrimination and drive-by shootings. There's 
family secrets, romance and, of course, murder. There's even that staple of 
L.A. culture, Dodger dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 For Smith, who has logged a lot of hours cruising with New York City cops and 
the Santa Monica police, the decision to write about law enforcement was a 
natural. 
</P>
<P>
 But this time around, Smith wanted to tackle the particular world and politics 
of the FBI. "The FBI really attracted me because it's not a blue-collar kind of 
job. Everyone has college degrees. I also think, kind of subconsciously, I'd 
read about the lawsuit that Hispanic agents brought against the FBI years ago, 
and that was percolating." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Smith's track record as a TV producer got her inside the bureau, she 
doesn't want to say too much about that aspect of researching the novel. The 
agents she talked with were so loath to receive any publicity that they didn't 
want mention in the book's acknowledgments. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't want to blow their cover," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps what is most remarkable about the novel's success, however, is Smith's 
tenacity. "I staked everything on this book," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating from Stanford's creative writing program in the early '70s, 
Smith published fiction in Ploughshares, Mademoiselle and the Atlantic Monthly. 
But then she moved to Los Angeles and got seduced by television. She didn't 
write fiction for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the 1988 Writers Guild strike. "My husband, Doug Brayfield, and I 
were in business together," she recalls. "We had a production deal at Republic 
Pictures. We had several scripts in development. When the strike happened, it 
basically wiped us out. It was devastating." 
</P>
<P>
 With that, she says, they made a drastic life choice. "We decided to return to 
our creative roots. I decided I was going to write this novel come hell or high 
water. Doug decided he was going to get his degree in poetry." 
</P>
<P>
 So while Smith worked on her novel, her husband was off attending a three-year 
program in North Carolina. Their life, she confides, was crazy. Their son, Ben, 
was only 4, they went through half their savings and, in the midst of all this, 
she got pregnant with their daughter and was forced to go back to writing for 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was enormous stress being pregnant with him gone," she sighs. "Oh, man. I 
did a lot of TV work during this time. I did a one-hour pilot, wrote a movie of 
the week, worked on staff of a half-hour comedy series. I also wrote two other 
TV movie scripts." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith would focus on her novel for six months, then do TV for six months. "It 
was hard and humiliating," she says. "I took assignments that were just awful." 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, she also ran into serious trouble with the book. Although Ana was 
always the narrator, originally the story centered on a troubled Westside woman 
named Claire and her relationship with her Latino housekeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going to do a story about greed in the '80s, about a modern Madame 
Bovary," Smith says. "I knew what I had was a story of betrayal between an 
upper-middle-class white woman and a lower-class Hispanic woman. What 
interested me was the power equation in that relationship and how it's abused." 
</P>
<P>
 But when Smith showed an early draft to her friend, writer Dan Wakefield, he 
found the manuscript problematic. "Whose story is this?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one of those devastating moments when you have 200 pages," Smith 
recalls. "That created the necessity for some very painful rewrites, in which I 
had to go back and tell everything from Ana's point of view." 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, Smith says she didn't tell anyone in Hollywood about her novel. 
The reasons: "Paranoia, obsessional thinking, insecurity," she says with a 
laugh. "But mainly the notion that Hollywood ideas are a dime a dozen and 
meaningless. I didn't want this novel to become an anecdote." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The story of how "North of Montana" got published is almost ridiculously 
Hollywood-esque. Smith and her TV agent from Creative Artists Agency drew up a 
list of New York literary agents and narrowed it to two. Both agents wanted to 
represent the book. Now it was time for Smith to hit New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was probably the most nerve-racking time for me because even though two 
agents were interested, I didn't know what that meant," she says. "I expected 
the worst. In TV, it means 'We like it, but you have to completely rewrite it.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 So Smith did what any normal career woman would do under such stressful 
circumstances: She went to her favorite boutique and bought a fabulous suit. 
</P>
<P>
 She flew to New York on a Wednesday, met with the agents on Thursday, and by 
the following Monday literary agent Molly Friedrich was sending the novel to 15 
publishers. The next morning, Smith got a call from Friedrich saying the book 
had gotten four offers -- including a lucrative deal that gave Smith only 45 
minutes to decide. 
</P>
<P>
 Describing that morning, Smith sounds like the typical harried working mother. 
"Here it is 8:30, my husband's off riding his (expletive) bike in Venice, and 
I've got these kids running around. So I said, 'Molly, I can't make this 
decision.' She said, 'You have to.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Now Smith's husband arrives home to total chaos. "He's all sweaty in his 
bicycle togs, I'm walking around in my nightgown completely crazed, and I'm on 
the phone writing down these numbers, and he's saying, 'Oh God, oh God!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Smith won't say who the publisher was, but she rejected the deal. The 
executive told her she could make the novel a bestseller, but only if Smith 
would make substantial editorial changes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Smith stuck to her guns, so to speak. She told her agent she felt it was a 
"deal with the devil. . . . I'd rather take less money and have it be mine." At 
which point Friedrich said, good, because Sonny Mehta, editor in chief of 
Alfred Knopf, was interested. And that's who Smith went with. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the future, Smith says she's agreed to do a sequel to "North of 
Montana," but maybe not for another 10 years. She's not interested in making 
Ana a "franchise character." Her next novel, which she's reticent to discuss, 
will be about something else. And she's probably through with television. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting on how she approached writing the novel, Smith says she thought, 
"I'd be lucky if it got published respectfully. There are a lot of 
screenwriters who've published novels. But I never thought it would be such an 
explosive change in identity."

AROUND TOWN: SPIRIT OF CHRISTMAS HAD A DICKENS OF A TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEVERLY BEYETTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pickwick Club's Christmas spectacular was the very Dickens. Even the queen 
and her prince were there. Victoria and Albert, that is. 
</P>
<P>
 "An evening of seasonal Victorian entertainments," the invitation promised, 
hosted by "the world-famous theatrical family of Mr. Vincent Crummles." 
</P>
<P>
 And there he was, straight out of the pages of "Nicholas Nickleby," greeting 
one and all, waving a pole from which dangled a clump of mistletoe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm too large a character to be confined within so small a book," explained 
Mr. Crummles (a.k.a. David Springhorn of Pasadena). 
</P>
<P>
 Ladies and gentlemen sipped cider (there were no stimulants), nibbled savories 
such as shepherd's pie and pasties and danced waltzes, polkas and something 
called The Portland Fancy. "I miss the old graces. This is a moment of grace," 
said a be-feathered Mrs. Vincent Crummles (Linda Underhill of San Rafael). 
</P>
<P>
 Ostrich feathers bobbed atop her head and black feathers ("chicken, madame") 
fluttered on the plunging bodice of her circa 1830s gown. 
</P>
<P>
 With logs ablaze in the greenery-swagged fireplace, one could almost forget 
for the moment that this was Davies Hall in Altadena, not Dickens' England. 
(The metal folding chairs, which grew harder with each passing hour, were a 
reminder.) 
</P>
<P>
 But, as Mrs. Crummles suggested, "It's more the spirit of Dickens than the 
letter of Dickens" when The Pickwick Club celebrates. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Crummles, a character as familiar to a true Dickens devotee as Mr. Pluck, 
Miss Squeers or Mr. and Mrs. Curdle, then took the stage to announce a 
performance by his theatrical troupe, renowned worldwide "or at least within 
the boundaries of several provincial parishes." 
</P>
<P>
 There followed an evening of truly terrible poetry, incredibly bad jokes and, 
in the true English music hall spirit, a sing-along or two, helped along by 
oversized cue cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Crummles introduced a pair of ladies "whose hearts are large, and whose 
bodies reflect that radius." Enter two plump, tiptoeing, wand-waving fairies, 
"Snowdrop" and "Gumdrop." (The 19th Century predated political correctness.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Snowdrop" sang of the injustice of being 40-plus: 
</P>
<P>
 "My magic wand is full of power, but this is not enough. They want their 
little magic from a younger bit of fluff." 
</P>
<P>
 And then there was a Sweeney Todd skit ("Sweeney Todd the barber. My God! He 
was better than the plague . . . "). All joined in a chorus of "Rule 
Britannia," led by Mrs. Crummles, who'd draped herself in a Union Jack. Queen 
Victoria and Prince Albert arrived with their nine offspring, including a 
cigar-puffing Edward, Prince of Wales. 
</P>
<P>
 A bit of an inside joke, Edward (Jonathan Graff, an actor from Playa del Rey) 
explained later: "Queen Victoria hated cigars" and it's said, on learning of 
his mother's death, the heir to the throne lighted a big stogie and announced, 
"Gentlemen, you may smoke." 
</P>
<P>
 Graff is a dedicated member of the Pickwick Club, a sort of literary society 
that meets quarterly in a Victorian Pasadena home to sip port and discuss the 
likes of Dickens, Poe and George Sand. This being 1994, it admits women, which 
wouldn't have happened in Dickens' day. 
</P>
<P>
 Springhorn, a portly actor who portrays W.C. Fields at Universal Studios, is 
founder/president and Darla Kruger ("Gumdrop"), a legal secretary in real life, 
is "recording secretary and everything else." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who join, said Graff, are hooked on "the genteelness of the era, the 
gentleness. You could talk and dance at the same time. And you could easily 
tell the men from the women." 
</P>
<P>
 At evening's end, guests pulled their chairs into a semicircle around the 
piano and sang carols. "We're bringing back our idealized version of the past," 
said Kruger. "I'm Jewish and I have a lovely time with this." 
</P>
<P>
 "Do not restrain yourselves," urged Mr. Crummles. 
</P>
<P>
 The finale: A rousing "Hallelujah Chorus." Cue cards were hoisted just in case 
anyone didn't know the words. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, the evening had a "very warm" feeling, reckoned Kruger. "Or maybe 
it's my corset." Not All Little Angels Have Wings and Halos 
</P>
<P>
 Just before noon on a Saturday, Clark and Donna Staub of Claremont arrived at 
the Angel Store in Pasadena with their little ones all freshly bathed and ready 
to sit for their angel portrait. 
</P>
<P>
 At least Hydra the Dalmatian and Laurie, a big black and brown mixed-breed 
hound, were ready. They blinked stoically as proprietor Bridget Fonger strapped 
them into satin halos and wings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dogs are awesome," said Fonger. Yes, agreed Donna Staub, amazed, "And 
they're both in heat." 
</P>
<P>
 Dylan Staub, 4, also seemed resigned to his otherworldly ordeal. He was 
thinking ahead -- to lunch at McDonald's, maybe, and a visit to the toy store. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can we get Grandma a dump truck?" he asked. His parents assured him Grandma 
would adore a dump truck, but first let's get on with this portrait for 
Grandma. 
</P>
<P>
 Fonger opened her doors in June, about the time the AIDS Service Center in 
Pasadena began a family and pediatric program. She took the coincidence as a 
sign. For each hand-tinted portrait, she donates 15%, or a minimum of $10, to 
the center. To date, about 80 angels or angel groups have been snapped. 
</P>
<P>
 Dylan's brother, Rainer, 20 months, wasn't up for this angel stuff. "He won't 
wear a hat," explained his father, as Rainer shook off his glittery halo. And 
those big, scratchy feather wings elicited more tears. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's OK," said Fonger. "He's a little angel who set aside his halo and 
wings for the moment." Sometimes, she said, "I feel like a dentist must feel." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dalmatian's halo had just slipped to a jaunty angle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your own wings! Wow!" said photographer John Emmons, trying a little 
psychology on Rainer, who only cried louder. 
</P>
<P>
 A compromise was reached. Even with one wingless, halo-less angel, the 
portrait is destined to be a family treasure. "I'm really happy with it," Donna 
Staub said later. "Everyone was looking at the camera and smiling, except the 
dogs, of course." 
</P>
<P>
 Hydra and Laurie were Emmons' third and fourth canine Christmas angels. 
Earlier, he'd immortalized a Labrador and a dachshund. No cats so far (the very 
thought makes him wince). 
</P>
<P>
 The family Staub departed and Nicholas Matute, 4 months, arrived from Glendora 
in the arms of his mother, Michelle. An angel with a pacifier. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time for your close-up," said Emmons, adjusting Nicholas' wings.

YOUR WHEELS: THE GOODS; WARM-UPS ARE NOW JUST A PRACTICE OF THE PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Question: Friends living on both sides of me drive late-model cars. I have 
noticed that whenever they start their engines, even on very cold days, they 
take off down the street at a good clip the moment the engine starts. I always 
warm up my cars and take off slowly. Even with 100,000 miles, I have never had 
a car that burned oil, even though I change my oil only once a year. Am I 
right? 
</P>
<P>
 -- H.S. 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: It's always hard to argue with success, but every expert will say that 
you are wrong on both counts. 
</P>
<P>
 New oils contain additives, so-called pour-point depressants, that allow them 
to flow at very low temperatures and provide very good lubrication to cold 
moving parts. 
</P>
<P>
 Auto makers have been recommending for years that owners use 5W-30 oils, which 
at low temperatures are thin and quickly rise to the correct pressure inside an 
engine's narrow passageways. New friction modifiers make these lubricants 
better than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with older 10W-30 oil was that its consistency was so thick at low 
temperatures that it would barely flow and very small volumes of oil would 
actually reach moving parts in a cold engine. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of improvements in oil, the whole concept of warming up a car is 
widely regarded as passe. Few owners manuals suggest any warm-up period, and 
experts, such as Valvoline's Norm Hudecki, recommend only enough warm-up for 
the engine speed to stabilize -- typically a few seconds. Still, it's hard to 
kill old habits and perhaps warming up an engine allows the new oils to do an 
even better job. 
</P>
<P>
 But experts would fault your oil-change routine. You ought to change your oil 
every 3,000 miles or every six months. 
</P>
<P>
 By going a year between changes, you risk contaminating the oil with sludge, 
water condensation and possibly acid. Although the petroleum itself stays 
healthy, the additives in the oil are subject to breakdown, particularly the 
chains of molecules that control the viscosity of the oil. 
</P>
<P>
 Another problem with long intervals between oil changes is that if you don't 
drive much, the engine can build up water condensation. After a while, sulfur 
gases that escape from the engine's combustion chambers combine with the 
condensation in the crankcase to form sulfuric acid, a nasty corrosive to 
engine parts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I have about $3,000 to spend on a car for my son at college. What would you 
suggest? 
</P>
<P>
 -- M.G. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Young men have a high fatal accident rate, so I would opt for the safest 
possible vehicle and worry about reliability second. 
</P>
<P>
 With $3,000, you are not going to find a late-model car equipped with air 
bags, so I would look for a full-size car that offers far better protection 
than a compact. Operating and repair costs will be higher, but the safety 
factor is important for a teen-ager.

THE GOODS; A MUCKRAKER FOR THE '90S; AS HEAD OF THE CONSUMER FEDERATION OF 
AMERICA, STEPHEN BROBECK SEES A MORE EDUCATED SHOPPER UNAFRAID TO TAKE ON A 
MORE COMPLEX MARKETPLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONNIE KOENENN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stephen Brobeck's office on the sixth floor of his building near Dupont Circle 
gives him a view of consumer activity throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
 What he sees are a lot of smart shoppers. "Americans are far more 
sophisticated shoppers today than they were 20 years ago," he says. "They have 
information coming from all directions." 
</P>
<P>
 Brobeck is executive director of the nonprofit Consumer Federation of America. 
Established in 1968 to represent consumers in Washington by lobbying Congress 
and appearing before regulatory agencies, the federation now links 240 consumer 
groups representing 50 million people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our growth reflects the maturation of the American consumer movement," 
Brobeck says. 
</P>
<P>
 He's not only talking about the increase in advocacy and regulatory groups 
monitoring the marketplace, but also a mountain of specialized magazines, 
newsletters, brochures and books. And the mass media have developed a taste for 
consumer stories too, which he applauds. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the encouraging trends is the rise of the TV network news magazines -- 
like '48 Hours' or '20/20' -- which cover consumer issues, especially hidden 
hazards and scams. And the network morning shows all have consumer reporters. 
They reach millions of viewers." 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, he says, most metropolitan daily newspapers have added such 
information as mortgage interest rates, a service that would have been 
"unthinkable" 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Of progress over the last couple of decades, his list continues: Products have 
better safety warnings. Food labels provide enough nutritional information to 
improve anybody's health. Auto manufacturers supply fuel efficiency figures. 
Banks promote the annual yields on savings accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of all these developments, he says, "Consumerism has become 
ingrained in American society over the last 20 years." The federation's cluster 
of offices -- jammed with computers, metal file cabinets and cardboard boxes -- 
houses a staff of experts in household product safety, indoor air quality, 
telecommunications, financial services and other specialties. 
</P>
<P>
 Churning out studies on all these subjects, the group provides a constant flow 
of consumer material -- books, pamphlets and an occasional hot line -- that 
serves members of Congress, members of the media and American shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are aware of themselves as consumers today in a way that is 
unprecedented," Brobeck says. A social historian as well as consumer activist, 
he is editing an encyclopedia of the American consumer movement, which he 
traces to the late 19th Century. He provides a quick breakdown:  
</P>
<P>
 * The Progressive Period at the turn of the century produced "muckraker" 
reformers such as Upton Sinclair, whose book "The Jungle" exposed the vile 
conditions in the meat-packing industry. Political leaders took the lead in 
reform, establishing the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Trade 
Commission, which "remain our two most important consumer agencies," Brobeck 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Reform Period, part of the 1930s New Deal, "didn't get a lot of press 
coverage," Brobeck says, "but Consumers Union was created, and so were the 
co-ops such as the Rural Electrification Administration and the credit unions 
that provided alternatives to banks." 
</P>
<P>
 * The current phase of consumerism started in the activist 1960s, Brobeck 
says, when the public imagination was captured by the publication of Ralph 
Nader's "Unsafe at Any Speed," critiquing the automobile industry. "When 
General Motors tried to suppress the book, it really made headlines and 
energized Nader, who recruited hundreds of bright law students to do consumer 
work and started forming consumer groups." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brobeck is a product of that period, having been active in the anti-war 
movement as a college student in the late '60s. "My parents were teachers and 
do-gooders, and passed on humanistic values to their children," he says. "I 
grew up in Swarthmore, Pa., and many of my friends were Quakers."  
</P>
<P>
 In 1970, while teaching at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, he 
was encouraged to form a consumer protection group. With the help of the 
Cleveland Legal Aid Society, he and his wife, Susan, set up a self-help 
organization to hear consumer complaints, investigate them and try to negotiate 
a settlement. "If a new car didn't run right, we'd try to talk to the seller." 
</P>
<P>
 If they believed that the consumer had gotten unfair treatment and talks broke 
down, the group would conduct a picket line. "My wife and I spent most 
Saturdays for nine years walking in front of car dealers and banks and other 
businesses." 
</P>
<P>
 The organization grew into the Cleveland Office of Consumer Affairs, which is 
still active. 
</P>
<P>
 American consumers today have a whole battalion of such groups working on 
their behalf. Washington is the headquarters for scores of lobbying groups, led 
by Congress Watch, Consumers Union and Brobeck's own Consumer Federation. They 
have made a vast difference in our lives, Brobeck says: "The most important 
thing that has happened is that consumer consciousness has increased throughout 
the population." 
</P>
<P>
 In an unprecedented way, he explains, American shoppers are aware of 
themselves as individual consumers with interests that can differ from those of 
sellers. "As a result, customers today are much more willing to negotiate a 
lower price and, if there is a problem, to complain."  
</P>
<P>
 But despite the arsenal of collective protection, consumerism eventually comes 
down to personal lifestyle choices and the patience to pick your way through a 
complex marketplace, Brobeck says. "You really have to sort out the options, 
call the vendors, make the comparisons and decide which one offers the best 
value to you. If you don't, over the course of the year, you could easily lose 
thousands of dollars. Certainly you will lose hundreds." 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with a trade-off of time versus money, many people won't take the time, 
he acknowledges. "For a product that may cost less than $50, my wife and I may 
not conduct an extensive search. On the other hand, before we would purchase a 
mortgage or a new car, we would spend quite a lot of time to learn about the 
choices and to negotiate the best deal." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As we approach the end of the century, Brobeck foresees consumers becoming 
increasingly knowledgeable, a necessity as markets become increasingly 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his basic advice to the American consumer is to maintain a "healthy 
skepticism," his outlook from his office is optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a wonderful marketplace," he says, "and there have been tremendous 
advances in consumer products over the last several decades, in large part due 
to technological advances." 
</P>
<P>
 The average consumer drives a car that is much better than 30 years ago and 
enjoys household appliances and services, such as electronic banking, that were 
only on the drawing board in the 1960s, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I value such conveniences and I suspect others do, too," Brobeck says. "In 
general, there have been many improvements in the marketplace. Sellers are more 
responsive to consumers and less willing to take advantage of them, but that's 
because consumers are more aware and more demanding. And they should continue 
to be."

CYBURBIA: THE JOLLY GUY IS NOW ON LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID COLKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Having trouble getting your modern-day kids to believe that Santa comes down 
the chimney? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe you'd be better off telling them the jolly fellow gains access to the 
house through the computer modem. 
</P>
<P>
 You better not cry,  
</P>
<P>
 you better not fret.  
</P>
<P>
 Santa's coming to you,  
</P>
<P>
 on the Internet.  
</P>
<P>
 So it won't replace "White Christmas" any time soon. But your kids in this 
digital age might be more comfortable E-mailing Santa, rather than going the 
old-fashioned analog route of taking pen in hand to write a letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Virginia, this year you can write to Santa Claus on the Internet at three 
different addresses. They are santa@north.pole.org, santa@newslink13.com and 
santa@northpole.net. All three are supposed to reply promptly with a dispatch 
from the North Pole. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have access through your Internet connection to the World Wide Web -- 
which allows you to browse full-color graphics, sounds and even videos on the 
'Net -- you can go another digital step further. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the WWW offers so much more than plain text and makes the Internet far 
easier to navigate, it has become hugely popular this year. The big online 
services, such as America On Line and CompuServe, provide only limited access 
to the Internet and don't yet offer WWW. But you can try it out if you use an 
Internet provider with a more direct connection, such as the popular Netcom 
service or the Los Angeles-based Earthlink, which offers relatively 
simple-to-use Macintosh and Windows interfaces (Earthlink's information line is 
(213) 664-9500). 
</P>
<P>
 The most entertaining and worthy WWW Santa site is sponsored by the Internet 
Multicasting Service, a nonprofit group that uploads public interest radio 
programs onto the Internet. At that address -- http://north.pole.org -- you can 
fill out a form to send a letter to Santa, Rudolph or the elves. 
</P>
<P>
 But the site goes much further, allowing you to click into little sound bites 
of "Jingle Bells" or a reading of " 'Twas the Night Before Christmas." You can 
also click into holiday texts by such notables as Shakespeare, Tennyson and 
Wordsworth, and learn about vegetation at the frozen north by moving into 
"Rudolph's Kitchen" and reading whimsical recipes for such reindeer delights as 
algae newtons and moss snaps. 
</P>
<P>
 Best of all, this site features a Cyberspace Christmas campaign that allows 
you to painlessly help several charities at this most appropriate time of year. 
All you have to do is click on one of the groups -- such as Plugged In, an 
organization that provides educational and other technological services to 
low-income youth in the Silicon Valley area -- and one of the campaign's 
corporate sponsors will automatically contribute 10 cents to the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Those small contributions can add up to a significant donation. One of the 
sponsors, Sun Microsystems, has pledged to give up to $25,000 to the campaign. 
So, click on the groups you like early and often. 
</P>
<P>
 The other two WWW Santa sites are more commercial. At the Canadian-based 
http://northpole.net, you can post a letter to Santa and get various messages 
from the elves, but you are also given information on how you can get your very 
own "I E-Mailed Santa" button for $5. 
</P>
<P>
 And at http://www.neosoft.com/citylink, you are invited to browse the "Santa's 
Christmas Favorites" area where you can order such items as silk scarves and 
glass dome-covered clocks. (Remember those from your Aunt's house?) 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, if you don't have an Internet hookup and still want to have a bit of 
digital fun at Christmas, there is a new children's CD-ROM for the holiday 
called "Follow That Sleigh!" It is compatible with both the Macintosh and 
Windows formats. 
</P>
<P>
 This CD-ROM, with clay animation sequences, does not feature any breakthrough 
technology and is not particularly striking, graphically. 
</P>
<P>
 But the rapping reindeer, backed by an enthusiastic chorus of penguins (OK, so 
they do not exist at the North Pole, but bah humbug if you care) is charming, 
as are several other features on this games and activities disc.

QUOTE ME: OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; OC HIGH ASKS: ARE YOU WORRIED THAT 
THE COUNTY'S FINANCIAL PROBLEMS WILL AFFECT YOU? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I've heard some of the teachers talking about how they might not get a 
paycheck. If they don't get a paycheck, they probably won't teach, and that 
concerns me quite a bit." 
</P>
<P>
 Katie Miller, 16, junior, Troy 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm worried because my mother is a state employee, but I have faith. Orange 
County has had a grim financial outlook for a few years now, and I see this 
crisis as yet another obstacle that we can overcome with a little patience." 
</P>
<P>
 Sabrina Hill, 16, sophomore, Brea Olinda 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard that by mid-March or something there will not be any more money. Are 
they going to cancel the school year, just like the baseball season and the 
hockey season?" 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Myers, 15, freshman, Santiago  
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, because my mom works for the school system. If we lose county funds, my 
home life would be seriously affected." 
</P>
<P>
 Rebecca Brown, 17, senior, El Toro 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds like my school district could be severely affected to the point of 
having to cancel school early. If it does, then I may have to finish my credits 
in summer school to graduate. I wanted to just enjoy myself this summer before 
college." 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Gango, 18, senior, Trabuco Hills 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to tell what's going to happen. Most likely it'll affect the 
schools because when money is needed, that's where money is cut." 
</P>
<P>
 Andrea Zelinko, 16, junior, Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it will affect us, but I will be gone when it does. They will cut the 
first- and second-year teachers, the salaries and the after-school activities. 
Students will also have to fund their own dances, so the prices will go up." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Howard, 17, senior, Capistrano Valley 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really think that it will affect me. Maybe it will teach investors to 
be wiser when they are dealing with so much money." 
</P>
<P>
 Brandon Abraham, 16, junior, Los Amigos 
</P>
<P>
 "A little bit, because my mother is a counselor for the Santa Ana Unified 
School District. But she says not to worry." 
</P>
<P>
 Sydney Witt, 17, senior, Brea Olinda 
</P>
<P>
 "If Orange County doesn't have money, then we won't have money to teach 
school, and everyone will grow up and not be able to have jobs and be dumb." 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Cherco, 15, freshman, Loara 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how it's gonna affect me, but I see the effect on teachers 
already. It's not fair for them, because some banks may not even cash their 
checks. It's Christmas, though." 
</P>
<P>
 An Le, 17, senior, Santiago 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that we'll really see that many significant changes in our own 
personal lives. Our country has a way of spending money it doesn't have 
anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Bernard, 17, senior, Rosary 
</P>
<P>
 "I am worried. The school system could diminish greatly, as well as public 
transportation." 
</P>
<P>
 Grant Smyth, 17, junior, Mater Dei 
</P>
<P>
 "I am worried because there will be a large budget cut from a school like 
Saddleback. In turn, there will be less funds for clubs, books and necessary 
equipment for the school." 
</P>
<P>
 Lynda Lo, 14, freshman, Saddleback 
</P>
<P>
 "Our (community) leaders have always done a great job at protecting us from 
financial burdens. I have a lot of trust in them now." 
</P>
<P>
 Matthew West, 18, senior, Foothill 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes. Now the band isn't getting any money from the board for new uniforms." 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Ellis, 15, sophomore, Newport Harbor 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not personally worried, but there are still a lot of uncertainties, so I 
don't really know what will happen. Something will happen, but the question is 
when." 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Chassagne, 17, senior, Villa Park 
</P>
<P>
 "My father is not employed by the county, and I will be moving away at the end 
of the school year for college, anyway. I think people in Orange County will 
feel something in the coming months, but not quite yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Cari Ota, 17, senior, Villa Park 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, because if they don't pay the teachers, then the seniors can't 
graduate." 
</P>
<P>
 George Bigney, 17, senior, El Toro 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid they will pull funding from the schools and cut programs like 
sports, music and art."  
</P>
<P>
 Tracy Derslinger, 15, freshman, Capistrano Valley 
</P>
<P>
 "It may not affect me now, but in the long run it will definitely have a big 
effect on me." 
</P>
<P>
 Bao Hoang, 16, junior, Los Amigos 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that the bankruptcy could definitely affect things in our school 
district, like spring sports, club funds and lots of other extra things that 
our school does and relies on district funding for." 
</P>
<P>
 Ann-Marie Froysaa, 17, senior, Trabuco Hills 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel it's going to affect us, because if the teachers don't get their 
payments for the next couple months they will be upset and angry, and will go 
on strike. Then, we'll have subs and not teachers." 
</P>
<P>
 Sadas Ahmed, 16, junior, Loara 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not too worried about the budget crisis because I live in L.A. County 
but my school is in Orange County. I know it will affect a lot of my friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Heather Shepherd, 16, junior, Rosary 
</P>
<P>
 "It will directly affect Orange County's educational system and budget, 
therefore taking away money our schools need to teach us." 
</P>
<P>
 Deanna Davalos, 17, senior, Foothill 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not that worried. I think the bankruptcy would not affect everyday 
people, but more the government people." 
</P>
<P>
 Shay McAfee, 16, junior, Mater Dei 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, because we don't get money to pay for the teachers, the supplies and the 
school in general." 
</P>
<P>
 Lei Shen, 15, sophomore, Loara 
</P>

OC HIGH STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; BREAK TRADITION; NO PLANS FOR THE WINTER 
VACATION? START SOMETHING. FUN ACTIVITIES MIGHT EVEN SPARK NEW RITUALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SABRINA FRIEDMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Sabrina Friedman is a junior at 
Canyon High School in Anaheim.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Do you ever get so bored during winter break that you actually find yourself 
wishing you were back in school? Do you succumb, year after year, to the winter 
blues? Here's a sampling of things to do and places to go that can help make 
the holiday break merrier and get you into the spirit of the season. 
Ice-Skating 
</P>
<P>
 Ice-skating is a true winter activity. There are several ice-skating arenas in 
the area. Public sessions run about $8 with skate rentals, but prices vary. 
Some are: Glacial Gardens in Anaheim, (714) 502-9023; Ice Chalet in Costa Mesa, 
(714) 979-8880, and Side by Side Rinks in Huntington Beach, (714) 847-8333. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes: Dress warmly. Great date idea; fun with friends. Christmas Caroling 
</P>
<P>
 Christmas caroling can be a lot of fun. Gather a group of friends or family 
and stroll your neighborhood, equipped with your holiday voices and some song 
sheets. Popular selections include "The First Noel," "Silent Night," "Winter 
Wonderland," "Joy to the World" and the eternal classic "Jingle Bells." Then 
hop back to your house for cookies and hot chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes: Dress warmly; fun with friends and family. Midnight Services 
</P>
<P>
 Midnight services commemorating the birth of Jesus are held in many churches 
on Christmas Eve. Singing, candlelight and holiday decorations all combine to 
make the ceremonies especially beautiful.  
</P>
<P>
 Notes: Call ahead for times, as services don't necessarily begin at midnight. 
Volunteering 
</P>
<P>
 Shelters and convalescent homes are just some of the places that need help 
during the holidays. Discover the spirit of giving -- of yourself. Contact the 
Volunteer Center of Orange County at (714) 953-5757 to offer your services. 
Here are a few places to start: ARK Services for Abused Children, (714) 
978-0340; CASA Youth Shelter, (310) 594-6825; Child Guidance Center, (714) 
953-4455; HUMAN Options, (714) 497-5620; Laguna Niguel Sunshine Outreach, (714) 
837-6199, and Olive Crest Center for Abused Children, (714) 777-4999.  
</P>
<P>
 Notes: Free. Rewarding experience that can be done on your own or shared with 
friends or family members on a one-time, seasonal or long-term basis. New 
Year's Eve Party at Disneyland 
</P>
<P>
 A fun-filled evening. The place is usually packed, but the spectacular 
fireworks display at midnight makes fighting the crowds worthwhile. The park 
opens at 8 a.m. and the party continues until 3 a.m. The crowds usually thin 
out by 1 a.m., leaving two hours for some serious partying. What a way to bring 
in the New Year. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes: Tickets are $31 for adults; $25 for ages 3-11. Great date idea; fun 
with friends; transportation needed. Skiing/Snow Play 
</P>
<P>
 For skiers, there are local resorts such as Mountain High, Snow Summit and all 
the resorts in the San Bernardino and Mt. Baldy areas. But what about those who 
don't ski? Now there's snow play at most ski resorts, designed to keep children 
and non-skiers happy and busy. Most feature rides, snow-related games and a 
"bunny-size" hill for sliding down in inner tubes. Tubing can be expensive if 
you pay by the ride. A better bet is usually to buy an all-day ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes: Dress warmly, maybe even take a change of clothes. Great date idea; fun 
with friends; transportation needed. Save some money for hot chocolate 
afterward. Secret Santa Parties 
</P>
<P>
 Organize a group of friends, put your names into a hat, then have each person 
draw a name. You become a Secret Santa to the person whose name you drew. 
Mysteriously deliver low-cost gifts to your designated person several times 
before Christmas, keeping your identity a secret. Then give him or her a larger 
gift on Christmas day, revealing yourself as the Secret Santa. Or you can 
decide to keep your Santa identity a mystery until the stroke of midnight at a 
New Year's Eve party, when the group gets together again and Secret Santas tell 
all. Anything goes. Add a few touches of your own, and off you go. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes: You can keep costs down and encourage creativity by putting a low limit 
on spending. Mall Outings 
</P>
<P>
 Most malls and shopping centers feature special decorations and entertainment 
during the holidays. Some of this "mall magic" includes carolers, balloons and 
visits with Santa Claus. Call the information center at a nearby mall to find 
out the entertainment schedule. Then get a group of friends together for an 
outing.  
</P>
<P>
 Notes: Free, if you can resist shopping. Cookies and Movies 
</P>
<P>
 Invite a few friends over for a night that can be lots of fun. Get out the 
cookie cutters and rolling pin and get dusty with flour while you make some 
good, old-fashioned Christmas cookies. While you're experimenting with cookie 
creations, pop a Christmas classic into the VCR. Some suggestions: "Miracle on 
34th Street," "It's a Wonderful Life" and "Babes in Toyland." For more recent 
hits, try "Home Alone" (the original and sequel) and "National Lampoon's 
Christmas Vacation." 
</P>
<P>
 Notes: Fun with friends; great date idea; free, if you already have the videos 
and cookie-making supplies. Holiday Scavenger Hunt 
</P>
<P>
 This can be a part of a party or an activity in itself. Organize a group and 
create a list. Some suggested items for a holiday scavenger hunt: different 
colored ornaments, a non-working Christmas light, a piece of mistletoe, a 
signed drawing of a Christmas tree, a Christmas cookie, a holiday sticker of 
some sort and a green M&M. Add your own items, and turn your party into a wild 
and crazy event. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes: Fun excuse to meet neighbors and visit those you know but haven't seen 
for a while. High School Shows 
</P>
<P>
 Performances vary from school to school, but most high school drama or choral 
departments put on inexpensive holiday shows. Plan to meet friends at the 
production and then head out to someone's house for dessert. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes: Seeing your classmates on stage is a fun change of pace; many have 
talents you might not have realized. Girls/Guys Night Out 
</P>
<P>
 Pull out the formals, grab the heels, iron that tux and head to -- Goofy's 
Kitchen? Yes! It's fun to go formal to a place that's casual. Anything can 
happen! Some suggestions: Goofy's Kitchen, at the Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim; 
Ruby's on the Balboa Pier; the Cheesecake Factory in Newport Beach; Hard Rock 
Cafe in Newport Beach or Los Angeles; Planet Hollywood in Costa Mesa.  
</P>
<P>
 Notes: The fun of dressing up without an expensive event to go to; no corsages 
or limos needed. Decorate a Tree 
</P>
<P>
 Decorating the Christmas tree can become a magical family evening. Get out the 
ornaments, string the lights, play some Christmas music . . . brew some tea, 
cider or hot chocolate. Afterward, admire the tree and discuss your wishes for 
the holiday season, or any other relaxing topic. Some ideas for homemade 
ornaments: popcorn strings and clothespin soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes: Great with friends or family. Special Performances 
</P>
<P>
 "The Glory of Christmas" is the annual holiday play performed at the Crystal 
Cathedral in Garden Grove. The cast consists of people of all ages and is fun 
for friends, dates or the entire family. Shows continue through Dec. 30. 
Tickets $20 to $30. For reservations, contact the Crystal Cathedral at (714) 
544-5679.  
</P>
<P>
 Notes: Keep your eye out for other special events keyed to the holidays. 
Hockey Games 
</P>
<P>
 Just because the NHL can't get its act together doesn't mean hockey fans 
should be left stranded! The holiday season is an excellent time to watch 
hockey, especially in person. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Diego Gulls, minor league/IHL affiliate of the Mighty Ducks of 
Anaheim, continue to play at their home rink, the San Diego Sports Arena. 
Tickets are inexpensive ($18 will score you a glass seat, if available), and 
the games are lots of fun, even for new fans. Several of the Mighty Ducks have 
moved to the San Diego team during the NHL lockout, so look for them on the 
opening roster. Car-pool with a group of friends, and make it an evening to 
remember. For tickets or more information, contact the San Diego Sports Arena 
box office at (619) 224-4176 or Ticketmaster at (714) 740-2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes: Fun with friends; great date idea; transportation needed. Light 
Displays 
</P>
<P>
 Around the holidays, traffic in residential areas seems to move slower than 
ever. The reason: spectacular displays of Christmas lights. From a simple 
strand of lights to an elaborate display -- complete with fake snow, a plastic 
St. Nick and reindeer -- decorations on individual houses turn many 
neighborhoods into festive places. Check the paper or ask around to find the 
best light and decoration displays. Then, round up the gang, hop in the car and 
enjoy the view. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes: Free, except for gas money; fun with friends or family. All-Night 
Restaurants 
</P>
<P>
 After caroling or cruising around to view Christmas lights, check out your 
local Denny's or Denny's-equivalent. Snuggle up with friends in a booth (the 
later, the better) for a cup of hot chocolate or an early breakfast. Both hit 
the spot after you've been out in the cold. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes: Inexpensive; fun with friends or dates. Holiday Scrapbook 
</P>
<P>
 If you are creative, try putting together a family scrapbook of previous 
holidays. Ask family members from far and near to contribute to your scrapbook 
with memories, cards, photos and more. Present it to another family member as a 
gift or leave it on the coffee table for all to view during the holiday season. 
You can be sure the book will be appreciated and enjoyed by all who browse 
through it. It's fun to relive holidays past. When the holidays of 1994 come to 
an end, add those photos and other mementos. Be sure to take a camera to all 
the holiday events you attend this season. Start a tradition. Notes: Free; 
great family activity.

<P>
 U.S. students would tackle some of science's thorniest controversies -- for 
example, the ethics of fetal-tissue research -- under newly proposed teaching 
standards that would add lessons in social issues to traditional course work in 
biology, chemistry and physics. 
</P>
<P>
 Released this month in draft form, the new standards would also put more 
emphasis on historical topics, such as the thinking that led to Copernicus' 
conclusion in the 16th Century that the Earth revolves around the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 The standards, the development of which are the result of three years' work 
funded by $6.5 million in federal grants, are intended to upgrade science 
lessons throughout the nation starting with kindergarten, and to set guidelines 
for what students should know by the ends of grades four, eight and 12. 
</P>
<P>
 While some teachers question whether schools will have the money to meet the 
ambitious new standards, others expect the impact to be dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
 Copies of the proposed standards may be obtained by writing to the National 
Science Education Standards, 2101 Constitution Ave. NW/HA 486, Washington, D.C. 
20418.

 In the news: Comedy writer Bob Mills, on Boris Yeltsin's nose surgery: "It was 
so successful that he can now do the moonwalk." 
</P>
<P>
 Comedy writer Tony Peyser, on President Clinton's middle-class tax cut: "To 
appease Republicans, families earning more than $150,000 a year will be given 
emergency subsidies for country club greens fees and beach house mortgages." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, reports Peyser, Republicans are very traditional when it 
comes to cutting social programs: "Women and children first." 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Leno, on Joycelyn Elders last act as surgeon general: "She pardoned Pee 
Wee Herman." 
</P>
<P>
 Leno, on the difficulties staging the show "A Christmas in Washington": "Where 
are they going to find three wise men and a virgin?" 
</P>
<P>
 Comic Argus Hamilton, on Hillary Clinton lowering her profile and spending 
much of her time visiting elementary schools: "Politics is a humbling business. 
In just one year, she's gone from leading a revolution to singing 'Itsy Bitsy 
Spider' to 6-year-olds." 
</P>

<P>
 Like O.C.'s bond prices, the jokes keep falling: 
</P>
<P>
 * "A fool and his money are soon audited." (Bob Vogel) 
</P>
<P>
 * "Brokers say Orange County will soon be back in the black. That means 
they've stopped betting on red." (Hamilton) 
</P>
<P>
 * "O.C.'s woes continue to take their toll on Disneyland. Donald Duck says he 
can no longer afford his speech therapist." (Mark Miller) 
</P>
<P>
 * "Orange County has conceded. Huffington hasn't. No wonder -- he's got more 
money." (Stan Kaplan) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the news: Comedy writer Paul Ryan, on a million people losing power 
during a western U.S. blackout: "The last time this many people were in the 
dark was the '92 presidential campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Pearlstein of Redondo Beach, on rumors TBS may buy NBC: "Ted Turner's 
wife, Jane Fonda, said she can hardly wait to get Willard Scott in a leotard 
and puffing like a steam engine." 
</P>
<P>
 Comedy writer Gary Easley, on Rep. Sonny Bono: "When he takes his seat on the 
House Judiciary Committee, he plans to protect his music by making sure that 
the legal definition of obscenity does not include just bad taste." 
</P>
<P>
 Reader Ed Hartnett of Temple City, on naming a highway for living dignitaries 
such as Ronald Reagan: "It's happened previously, and for a foreigner -- the 
former prime minister of Israel. It's called Begin Freeway." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reader Kathy Moses of Fullerton says daughter Gina, 5, had made plans with 
friends. Mom told Gina that she must let the "chauffeur" know if she would need 
a ride. Later, in a discussion about Christmas, Moses asked Gina if she knew 
who drove Santa when he delivered his presents. 
</P>
<P>
 Replied Gina: "His mother?"

OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; A COSTLY LESSON THAT WILL BE FELT IN SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Being a student at Corona del Mar High School, I felt isolated from the 
effects of Orange County filing for bankruptcy because it never occurred to me 
that my education might be on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 But as days progressed, the outlook became worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers and many other workers have not been guaranteed their paychecks after 
December. 
</P>
<P>
 I then learned about San Jose High School, which declared bankruptcy a couple 
of years ago. People from the state were sent in to try and figure out ways for 
the school to save money. The school closed for a month, and with it almost all 
of the teachers were furloughed and all the elective classes cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now I fear the worst for our school district, which invested $47 million 
(in the county fund). As it is, the school districts are underfunded and much 
of our new equipment is provided by fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
 I think the quality of my education should not be based on playing the stock 
market or silent auctions. My education is crucial to me and ultimately to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 I resent that my education should be taken away from me because somebody had a 
bad day on Wall Street.

<TEXT>
<P>
 One in five American teens is overweight, the government reports, and experts 
are blaming everything from too much junk food and TV to lack of exercise and 
baggy, figure-concealing clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the 1970s, the percentage of overweight children ages 12 to 19 held 
steady at about 15%, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. But 
that rate had jumped to 21% by 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 While baby fat can melt away as hormones shift into adolescent overdrive, many 
overweight teens end up struggling with their weight the rest of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The CDC encourages teens to exercise and eat sensibly rather than diet to help 
control weight.

MY TURN: OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; UNITY SMORGASBORD: FOOD FOR THOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JHOANNA INFANTE, Jhoanna Infante is a senior at Sunny Hills High School in 
Fullerton, where this article first appeared in the student newspaper, the 
Accolade. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the feast is over, they go their separate ways. So it has been -- and, in 
all probability, will continue to be -- at the Sunny Hills High School's 
International Day Smorgasbord. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year, on the day of the smorgasbord, students of various heritage -- 
Asian, European, Latin American, African and others -- mix in the quad. The 
diverse mass of students, parents, younger siblings, teachers and 
administrators eradicates normal hangout designations. It looks like a melting 
pot, but, in truth, ethnic ingredients are simmering in their own juices in 
isolated parts of the caldron. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after the smorgasbord, the hangout designations return: one group in 
the center of the quad, others all around. The segregation returns -- or 
perhaps cultural understanding did not exist, even for that day. Nothing 
remains of the smorgasbord, except for a few foam cups and toothpicks beneath 
the quad benches. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gluttony is the great unifier," as one student said. It's a sad statement, 
indicative of the lack of real racial integration at Sunny Hills, despite the 
spirit of International Week and the existence of the Inter-Ethnic Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody anticipates the smorgasbords. Even seniors like me, who've bought 
the same French sherbet in an orange peel, Korean barbecue, American 
chocolate-chip cookies, Chinese chow mein and Filipino shish kebabs for the 
past three years, enjoy it. 
</P>
<P>
 But does food appreciation lead to integration or have anything to do with 
cultural understanding? 
</P>
<P>
 The smorgasbord, despite the range of represented groups, reflects the 
antithesis -- racial Balkanization. Food stands representative of different 
ethnic groups are separate, suggesting an emphasis on cultural differences 
rather than integration. 
</P>
<P>
 In the movie "The Godfather," the Corleone family eats Chinese food yet 
despises Chinese people (as well as Cubans and African Americans.) 
</P>
<P>
 It is possible to love a country's food and hate its people. A person can hate 
beer but love Bavarians; love pastry, but hate Parisians. 
</P>
<P>
 The smorgasbord food itself is somewhat stereotyped. Greek baklava, Chinese 
egg rolls, Italian spaghetti, Korean kimchi, German pretzels, French crepes and 
Mexican quesadillas. I'm not so sure that Germans subsist on pretzels and root 
beer. Do Americans eat hot dogs and chocolate chip cookies at most meals? 
</P>
<P>
 A final word: Economic interchange does not facilitate integration or cultural 
understanding. American businessmen who distrust Japan will trade with Japan, 
because it means profit.  
</P>
<P>
 We will only understand other cultures when we cross lines and truly 
integrate.

IT TAKES A LOT OF PATIENCE AND A LITTLE MOXIE TO NAVIGATE THE NET; COMPUTERS: 
GOING ON-LINE CAN BE LIKE HACKING YOUR WAY THROUGH THE JUNGLE. BUT IF YOU FIND 
THE RIGHT GUIDE, IT CAN BE AN INTERESTING TREK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSHUA QUITTNER, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I just got E-mail from someone named Moxie. He writes that he can't pull up my 
.plan file. (A .plan file is kind of like a business card that anyone should be 
able to read on the Internet.) 
</P>
<P>
 One solution, he writes, is to "simply type: chmond ug+r OME/.plan" in the 
command line. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply? 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly Moxie, whoever he is, has a different view of complexity than me, and 
I am impressed. While I'm contemplating that, Moxie, who happens to be on-line 
on the same system I'm on, beeps me -- indicating that he wants to "chat." 
("Chatting," on-line, usually takes the form of two people typing at each 
other, in real time.) 
</P>
<P>
 We chat. Moxie is pleasant and articulate, which you can't help but notice in 
a world that's jammed full of science/engineer/don't-read-literature types. 
Eventually, he helps me remove an electronic pebble from my virtual shoe. (The 
last line of text always gets cut off on my PowerBook when I'm reading news in 
Usenet. "Why, Moxie, why?" I type. He tells me to check the configuration file 
of my communications program. Of course!) 
</P>
<P>
 Moxie, clearly, is a valuable find. Sensing the opportunity to bag another 
brain for my source collection, I type, "What do you do for a living?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you sure you want to know?" Moxie types back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course I want to know," I reply, thinking, what can be so bad? Is he a 
lawyer? A dentist? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," types Moxie, "I'm 13 years old and go to junior high school" on Long 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
 Thunk. That's me passing out. 
</P>
<P>
 I feel like that guy in "The Crying Game." All this time, I've been chatting 
with -- no, getting educated by -- a 13-year-old!  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now, I'm no age bigot or anything. I know teen-agers are important to . . . um 
. . . the economy, because they buy all those baggy, way-long shorts that droop 
below their knees. And, if it weren't for 13-year-olds, there'd be no "Beavis 
and Butt-head," no bar mitzvahs either. But still, I never imagined I'd be 
having a chat with one who was intellectually stimulating. 
</P>
<P>
 It was kind of an epiphany. It shouldn't have been. It makes perfect sense 
that Moxie, whose real name is Mark Mentovai, is 13: 
</P>
<P>
 The Internet belongs to 13-year-olds; cyberspace is as much their world as 
mine. When you're 13, life itself is still new, surprising and yet tough to 
navigate. Just like the Internet. A 13-year-old gets on-line and finds out he 
needs to learn a little Unix to get around the Net. Fine, he learns Unix. What 
else is he going to do? His taxes? 
</P>
<P>
 Just to be sure Moxie isn't really, say, a 58-year-old legal secretary giving 
me the business, I do a little database work, finding out his real name, 
running his family's name through a list of registered voters on Long Island. I 
find a telephone number for the family and call. A kid picks up the phone on 
the first ring. When he says, "Hello," his voice cracks, and I think: (a) He 
really is 13 and (b) It's great to be 37. Compared to 13, 37 is like being Cary 
Grant. 
</P>
<P>
 Moxie tells me he got his first computer for Christmas, four years ago. The 
modem came later, "for graduation from sixth grade last year." Moxie explains 
his technique for getting the modem: "I bugged my parents. I had to bug them 
for a year. You know, every now and then, 'Mom, can I have a modem?' Or, 'Dad, 
can you go out and ask Mom to get me a modem? Kevin's getting one. . . .' " 
Kevin is Moxie's friend. I don't think he has a modem yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Moxie gets his modem, naturally; no parent could withstand his scorched-earth 
attack and he also gets an account on CompuServe, so he can correspond with an 
uncle in Connecticut. "We were both E-mailing each other and telling cool 
places we found." It only whetted Moxie's appetite. His mother, already worn 
down by the Modem War, launched a preemptive strike: 
</P>
<P>
 "For my 13th birthday this year, my mom made this booklet that said 
'Internet!' on every single page, 20 pages of it. Finally, on the last page it 
said that I could research the local providers and find out which one would be 
cost-efficient, and subscribe," Moxie says. "I like researching that stuff." 
Moxie shocker. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At first, his parents showed the usual concern any parent might have about 
opening up their child to 25 million people. "My parents would look over my 
shoulder a lot, especially when I read E-mail. After a while, they got bored 
with it," he says, noting that occasionally now, when they do angle in for a 
shoulder surf, he blocks their view. "Some stuff I don't let them read because 
they shouldn't read it," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like what?" I ask. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, you probably shouldn't know either," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, I know there's lots of stuff on the Net that a 13-year-old kid shouldn't 
be exposed to, at least until he's say, 14, and, I'm all too aware of the 
hapless hysteria emanating from television news magazines about cyberperverts 
and all the rest, so I ask Moxie how he handles it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't get into that stuff," he says, referring to the many news groups that 
provide forums for adult discussions. He also practices safe computing. "My mom 
and dad warned me about 10,000 times: I never give out information about myself 
to people. My name is my limit." 
</P>
<P>
 We talk about what it's like being 13 years old on the Internet and how it's 
fun to talk to adults who don't have any preconceived notions of who you are 
(hmmmm, maybe they're not really adults either?) and Moxie said that there are 
a lot of people out there like him. Thirteen years old, that is. In fact, he 
points me to a little-known Usenet group, called K12.chat.junior that exists 
solely for sixth- through eighth-graders. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Well, I've gone this far. 
</P>
<P>
 I check into the Usenet group to see what sixth- through eighth-graders talk 
about on-line. It was not a pretty sight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'M BORED," says one message's subject line. "Key pal wanted!!!!!" say lots 
of others. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing happened today," writes a person named Lisa. "A stupid grade-eight 
loser took my seat on the bus and of course the bus driver is too dumb to make 
a seating plan." 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey dudes and dudettes! How's it going? Just wanted to say hi," someone else 
writes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am in grade seven and turning 12 November 14th. I live in Alberta, Canada. 
I have a few fish, two dogs (Maltise Poodl), two turtles, one cat and one 
iguana," writes a third. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm starting to get dizzy from the correspondence. There are more than 700 
posts from the past week. One thing you see immediately is, the hype about how 
computers are geared for boys is ridiculous: Most of the people here are girls. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone named Fern, who apparently just got back from a vacation in Canada, 
asks: "One thing I did wonder (never stopped to see) is if McDonalds has 
Quarter Pounders or like .5 kilogrammers. Any Canadians know?" 
</P>
<P>
 A Canadian eighth-grader responds: "We have Quarter Pounders. . . . What's a 
.5 kilogrammer??" 
</P>
<P>
 I can't take any more of this. I need to talk to an adult. Wonder what Moxie's 
up to.

 Timed for holiday shopping, the December Consumer Reports is a roundup of best 
buys in gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We work on this all year," says staffer Jeffrey Asher."It focuses on the best 
we have tested, as well as the products we think are appropriate for the 
holidays -- it would probably not be a steam iron for your wife." 
</P>
<P>
 In large gift categories, the magazine's testers report on games, toys, TV/VCR 
combos, stereo components, compact cameras, boom boxes, cordless phones, 
phone-answering machines and sweaters. 
</P>
<P>
 As a bonus, the issue opens with some "Holiday Tidbits," including: 
</P>
<P>
 * Best color-print film for shooting family pictures: Most of the major brands 
in ISO 100. 
</P>
<P>
 * Best antacids after you've eaten too much: Mylanta Double Strength and 
Maalox Plus Extra Strength, with Alka-Seltzer tablets close behind. Best road 
atlas if you're going to Grandma's house: The $8.95 Rand McNally. 
</P>
<P>
 * Best way to shop for a Christmas tree: Slide your hand along the branches to 
make sure the needles don't come off, sniff for fragrance and be sure it's 
green. 
</P>
<P>
 * The best wishes from Ebenezer: Try to avoid the tempting offer from stores 
and credit-card companies to skip the December payment. With accruing interest 
rates it's like taking out a loan at 10% to 18% interest. CONNIE KOENENN

INK: THE NEW YORKER MOVES TOWARD MORE FICTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL D. COLFORD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Paul D. Colford is a columnist for 
Newsday. His column is published Fridays. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move that heralds a heightened interest in storytelling at the New 
Yorker, Bill Buford will join the weekly magazine as fiction and literary 
editor. Buford has championed new fiction and what he calls "literary 
journalism" as editor of Granta, the London-based quarterly. 
</P>
<P>
 Buford's appointment, effective April 1, was announced Tuesday by New Yorker 
Editor Tina Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 It follows recent word that deputy editor Charles (Chip) McGrath will leave 
the magazine to become editor of the New York Times Book Review. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath has edited fiction since fiction editor (and baseball bard) Roger 
Angell, 74, cut back to do more writing. The former senior literary editor, 
Daniel Menaker, recently left the magazine to edit books at Random House. 
</P>
<P>
 The Louisiana-born Buford, 40, has expanded Granta to a circulation of 100,000 
and made the quarterly one of the more influential showcases for good writing 
during his 15 years as editor. Bylines have included Nadine Gordimer, Milan 
Kundera and Mikal Gilmore, brother of executed killer Gary Gilmore, whose 
striking proposal for "Shot in the Heart" was printed by Granta two years 
before the book reached stores. 
</P>
<P>
 As publisher of Granta Books, Buford also has brought out titles by such 
literary lights as Salman Rushdie and Gabriel Garcia Marquez. He is the author 
of "Among the Thugs," a gripping account of his experiences among Britain's 
violent soccer fans that was reissued by Vintage Books last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The New Yorker has run fewer fiction pieces in many issues since Brown became 
editor two years ago. In a prepared statement, she praised Buford's "energy and 
taste" and said they were what the magazine needs as it continues to discover 
and develop writers of fiction. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Cult Magazines: At the peak of popularity in the mid-1950s, Confidential was a 
colossal hit on newsstands, selling about 4 million copies a month by offering 
pieces such as "My Night With Elvis Presley" and "This Ordinary Joe Sure Made 
Time on That Couch With Marilyn Monroe." 
</P>
<P>
 But judging from the evidence displayed in "The Illustrated Price Guide to 
Cult Magazines," Confidential was only one of myriad scandal and exploitation 
mags that came and went during the postwar period. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective mags were big (True Detective, Daring Detective and Detective 
Cases). So were a surprising number of periodicals aimed at black readers, such 
as Hep, Sepia and Our Grapevine ("What Really Killed 'Yardbird' Charlie 
Parker?"). 
</P>
<P>
 "Copies of these magazines are now very hard to find, but I thought it was a 
good time to show how many there were during the years we associate with a kind 
of 'Leave It to Beaver' innocence," said Alan Betrock, who assembled the 450 
covers that make up this one-of-a-kind guide, published by his Shake Books in 
Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
 The guide indicates it's a sleepy market for these collectibles -- an attic 
full of cult mags probably would be worth far less than a collection of rare 
stamps or old comic books. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marilyn Monroe Story, a one-shot mini-mag that sold for 25 cents in 1955, 
is now worth up to $175 -- and that's a fortune, seeing that few of these 
issues would command more than $50. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Illustrated Price Guide to Cult Magazines" is available in selected 
stores or by sending $16.95 to Shake Books, 449 12th St., Brooklyn, N.Y. 11215.

YES, DIALING FOR DOLLARS IN 900-LAND IS WORTH EVERY LAST NICKEL; COMMUNICATION: 
SURE, PAY-PER-MINUTE PHONE CALLS COST BIG BUCKS. BUT HOW CAN YOU PUT A PRICE ON 
THE SHARK LINE AND THE PSYCHIC NETWORK? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lupe the psychic was on the phone from somewhere in Arizona, and her 
fortunetelling wasn't coming cheap: $3.99 for each minute we spoke over the 
LaToya Jackson Psychic Network. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, I got Lupe by chance. A recording answered LaToya's 900-number: "If 
you know the extension number of the psychic you'd like to talk to, press 1." 
As a first-time caller, I took pot luck, and pressed 2. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hi. Welcome to the LaToya line. This is Lupe. Who's this, please?" 
</P>
<P>
 "You're the psychic," I said. But sarcasm wouldn't do; sarcasm wasn't 
cost-effective. 
</P>
<P>
 "My name's Steve," I said. For the money this 900-number cost, I got to the 
point. "I wanna know what the future holds for Michael and Lisa Marie." I 
figured if anyone knew the real dope on the Jackson-Presley affair, LaToya 
would. And she'd pass the dirt on to her psychics. 
</P>
<P>
 "OK, Steve," said Lupe, pronounced Loopy. "For Michael and Lisa Marie, that 
marriage is not really hanging in right. I feel that Michael does love her, 
though." 
</P>
<P>
 She had a slightly slurred voice and an accent I couldn't place. She sounded 
bored. I wondered if she, being a psychic, knew I was thinking that. But the 
meter was running, faster than a taxi slaloming down Manhattan's Second Avenue. 
I pressed on. 
</P>
<P>
 "Will they have children?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I see two girls." 
</P>
<P>
 "Did she marry Michael for the money?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No, she's got enough money that her father left." 
</P>
<P>
 Aha. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you see what Elvis is thinking?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Elvis is gone." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, but maybe his spirit . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see his spirit," Lupe said decisively. 
</P>
<P>
 "What about my future?" 
</P>
<P>
 "For your future, Steve, I see good things coming in your life." There was the 
usual psychic stuff: a broken heart, a better future, a large sum of money 
awaiting me, a love interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are in love with someone right now," ventured Lupe. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife?" 
</P>
<P>
 "How long you been together?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Ten years." 
</P>
<P>
 "I see the relationship between you and her will get stronger. But she needs a 
little romance in her life." 
</P>
<P>
 "We ordered in Italian the other night." 
</P>
<P>
 "Wine her and dine her, Steve." 
</P>
<P>
 Final cost for my encounter with Lupe: about $30. And no Elvis, even. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Touch-toning through 900-Land is an adventure not unlike a blind date. 
</P>
<P>
 First, there's the anticipation. Punching up the digits, one awaits the first 
response, never certain what it will be. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the suspense of expense: For a 900-number that charges upward of 
$4 a minute, the cost of a call can easily parallel the price of dinner and a 
movie. Instead of asking Dad to borrow the car, you've got to borrow the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 But while a blind date can end in hard reality -- or profound relief -- a 
900-call almost always aims to please. And you don't have to dress up. Or dress 
at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Lupe was my first blind date in 900-Land. She was more entertaining than the 
mechanic at 900-AUTO-HELP who diagnosed a rattle under the hood of the car, not 
nearly as sultry as the suggestive lady-on-tape at 900-HOT-DUCK who described 
how her "knowing fingers" would "barely graze" my "firm flesh." And not as 
mundane as the factoids at hand on the 900-lines. Via the pay-per-listen lines, 
I spent upward of $300 punching up the current temperatures in Rome (it was 81 
that day, the dew point 66), learning how to report a lost pet ("Press 2 to 
report a lost cat. . . . Enter the tail length: Press 1 for short, 2 for long") 
and checked the closing quote on a stock on the Dow Jones line. 
</P>
<P>
 But beyond the ordinary, many of the so-called "information providers" who 
have established 900-phone numbers have refined the art of the gimmick. 
</P>
<P>
 There's the latest lawyer jokes on call, medical updates on an injured 
funny-car driver via the Quaker State Speedline, and Band-Aids for the psyche 
on lines like Summit Solutions, a therapy "advice" line for $3.99 per minute 
set up this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Establishing a therapist's couch on the information superhighway apparently 
hasn't met with great success. The Summit line is currently out of service as 
its sponsors reorganize. In fact, I was unable to connect with three other 
therapy lines. However, the Culinary Consulting Service did relay to me a 
lovely recipe for crown roast of pork with stuffing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even after hours of dialing, I'd just scratched the surface of 900-Land. 
Unexplored were the personal ads, the fax lines, the job listings and the soap 
opera updates. 
</P>
<P>
 More than $1 billion was collected through 900-phone lines in 1991, when phone 
sex and live "chat" lines were driving the industry, before the bottom fell out 
in 1992 and revenues were cut in half. The trashy aura of store-bought sex also 
dominated the early years of another technology -- the videocassette recorder 
-- and the 900-number industry, which has rebounded in the past two years, is 
hoping for similar validation. 
</P>
<P>
 With dial-a-porn, now only one segment of the 900-service, other portions of 
the market are prospering. InfoText magazine estimates billings will again 
reach $1 billion annually by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with a wealth of digits culled from 900-newsletters, directories and ads 
from the back pages of Cosmopolitan and the Village Voice, I had mixed success 
in the 900-ether. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine my disappointment when I discovered that the Tonya Harding line, set 
up to solicit contributions to pay the ice skater's legal fees stemming from 
the attack on Nancy Kerrigan, was out of business. So was the John Wayne Gacy 
line. Gacy, a convicted serial killer, was executed in May, which probably 
explains why the number doesn't answer. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Shark Line was on. After the standard warnings -- it will cost this 
much, you must be 18 years old, if you hang up in three seconds you will not be 
billed -- the recorded lawyer jokes began, at $1.49 a minute: 
</P>
<P>
 "A lawyer was talking to a friend. He said, 'People take an instant dislike to 
me when they find out I'm a lawyer. Why is that?' 'It saves time,' the friend 
replied." 
</P>
<P>
 Next. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I tried the News from Ireland line; 99 cents per minute. 
</P>
<P>
 "The IRA said it carried out this afternoon's bomb attack in the Grove Bar. . 
. ." 
</P>
<P>
 What I really enjoyed was my chat with Paige. 
</P>
<P>
 Paige worked for the Info Services Entertainment Line, conducting one-on-ones 
with men in search of conversational diversion. To be honest, I reached her by 
accident: I'd dialed 900-USA-SURF to find how the waves were breaking in 
Redondo Beach, but instead got Info Services, where, a sexy voice explained, 
"All your fantasies can come true." 
</P>
<P>
 Paige was one of the "hot choice" fantasies, for $3.49 per minute. 
</P>
<P>
 She was on the line from Reno, Nev. We made introductions. I spoke tacitly, 
nervously, and she was drawling. She pronounced "Steve" as if it were four 
syllables. 
</P>
<P>
 "How old are you, sweetie?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ahhhhhh," I said. "Let's talk about you. How'd you get this job?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Oooohhhh." Paige, who is 23, said she answered a newspaper ad for "telephone 
actresses." "I'm a showgirl at one of the casinos. When I'm not at the phone 
I'm working at the casino." 
</P>
<P>
 "You must love your work." 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," she giggled, "I've only been doing this three months. There are guys 
out there that are dying of boredom and in desperate need of somebody to talk 
to. Some are into some really weird stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 "What weird stuff?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "One guy wanted me to go find balloons, blow them up and pop them." 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the phone." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah. Then there was the guy who wanted me to make sounds like I was starting 
my car. And my car wouldn't turn over. Vrooommm, vrooomm. 
</P>
<P>
 She did a pretty good imitation of a broken starter, and I couldn't think of 
much more to ask after that, so we said goodby. Paige turned out to be an 
expensive call, but she sure beat the News from Ireland.

 The Scene: Wednesday's West Coast premiere of Miramax's "Ready to Wear (Pret a 
Porter)" at the Avco Cinema. A party at Neiman Marcus hosted by the department 
store and Elle magazine followed. This is director Robert Altman's film about 
the fashion industry, which, he said, "is about as vacuous as Hollywood -- and 
Hollywood is pretty vacuous." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: Altman; the film's stars, Sophia Loren (who was introduced to 
wild cheers), Rupert Everett, Kasia Figura, Sally Kellerman, Richard E. Grant 
and Sam Robards; Miramax chairman Harvey Weinstein (who came with Madonna); 
plus 800 guests including Sean Penn, Uma Thurman, Michael York, Louis Malle, 
Lesley Ann Warren, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Terry Stanfill, James Galanos, 
Neiman's Burt Tansky and John Martens, Elle's Carl Portale and designer Thierry 
Mugler, who said, "I don't know if this film is reality or fiction. I guess it 
would be funnier for us if it was fiction." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "The movie's about nakedness and how we hide it," said Altman. "Every 
one of those stories has to do with what we wear, why we wear it and what it 
can do for us. We all dress to communicate to other people who we think we are, 
or who we want them to think we are. It's all disguise." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Topic of Discussion: When one guest said the film reminded him of a "Seinfeld" 
episode -- "It's about nothing" -- another said, "Then why are so many people 
offended by it. Altman has clearly placed the skewer in the right part of the 
sausage." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Noted: There was a New York premiere of the film earlier in the week. One 
fashion writer said the difference between East and West coasts is, "People are 
too nice here. And it was too easy getting in. There wasn't any of that 
elbow-sharpening madness at the door." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Epiphanies: Men perusing the designer clothing on Neiman's second floor 
learned that simple, little black dresses sell for thousands of dollars. There 
were wonderful moments observing middle-aged men staring incredulously at price 
tags. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Overheard: "It made me want to wear Levis for the rest of my life." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Why Fashion Will Always Be With Us: After seeing the film, with performances 
by everyone from Sophia Loren to Julia Roberts, one woman said, "I'm just 
amazed Kim Basinger let her hair look that bad."

<P>
 It came to Janeen Quinn this summer when she hired two neighborhood boys to 
mow her yard. 
</P>
<P>
 A Hartford, Conn., mother of three preschoolers, Quinn, 36, was unaccustomed 
to the deference shown to her by the polite 14-year-olds. They called her 
"Mrs." They shuffled, caps in hands, while she gave instructions about the 
hydrangea bush. When she cracked what she thought was a pretty good joke, they 
just looked at her. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, Lord, she thought. They think I'm a mom. 
</P>
<P>
 Which she is, and is proud to be. But there was something empty about the 
whole thing, some kind of assigning of a role to Quinn that didn't take into 
account that she might be more than a mother, more than a woman who needed her 
lawn mowed. 
</P>
<P>
 If it were a onetime thing, Quinn might have laughed it off. 
</P>
<P>
 But slowly during the past few years, Quinn notices more and more. She has 
entered -- without her say-so -- that zone of invisibility women 25 or so hit 
when they're around young people. And this is entirely awful, because we, the 
generation that once was worshiped for our youth, are now being shunned by the 
people we once were. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a mother, and I'm happily married," Quinn said. "But around younger 
people, I feel that trapped inside this body, there's a 17-year-old dying to 
get out. Make that 12. No, 9." 
</P>
<P>
 It's why teen-agers don't hear when their mothers talk. It's why pinup girls 
are in their teens or, at the most, mid-20s. It's because women over the age of 
25 or so are supposed to be sexless wonders. 
</P>
<P>
 For that, we have that old whipping post, the media, to thank, said Cindy L. 
White, assistant professor of communications at Central Connecticut State 
University. By and large, older women are background noises or shrill harpies 
who plague the cool people -- the youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this age, we begin to show up in the media as the 'professional woman,' or 
'disgruntled housewife,' " White said. "And that is a double-edged sword for 
women. If you're younger, you're portrayed as an object of desire. If you're 
older, you're sexless." 
</P>
<P>
 Older men aren't entirely without their own image problems. Television males 
are either unrealistically perfect super-heroes or doofusses from "Home 
Improvement." Even the new, critically acclaimed "My So-Called Life" has a 
father who's nearly devoid of soul and backbone. The show comes from the same 
people who brought us "thirtysomething," during which in one episode a male 
character decried this very invisibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Preston Jackson of Newington, Conn., was picking up his family's 15-year-old 
baby-sitter so he and his wife could go out, and she kept calling him "Mr. 
Jackson," "which made me think she was talking to my dad." 
</P>
<P>
 Wouldn't she be impressed with Jackson's various acts of vandalism performed 
as a willful teen? Wouldn't she like to hear about the tattoo he had -- and 
later had removed? 
</P>
<P>
 Probably not. If Quinn told the boys who mow her lawn that she once drove a 
'72 Camaro with a spoiler, they'd think she was lying -- or, sadder still, 
trying to recapture a long-gone youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "The point is: I had a life, a good, young life, and sometimes I feel like 
reminding younger people of that," Quinn said. 
</P>
<P>
 We are probably -- as a generation -- going to take the expectation of 
ourselves as merely backdrops as gracefully as we've taken every other 
expectation. (Not very.) 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the ways the younger generation is encouraged to identify itself is in 
opposition to the older generation," White said. "It's not a new thing. In 
'Rebel Without a Cause,' his parents are an absolute nightmare. Now you and I 
have stepped into that role, and we're really (mad) about it. James Dean was 
ours, not theirs." 
</P>
<P>
 Add that to a kazillion other portrayals of media moms, and you've set up an 
entire culture that thinks television (and movies, magazines, etc.) is how life 
is supposed to be rather than how life is. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't talk about mothers separate from their children," White said. 
"This is something generations of women have confronted -- silently, I think. 
We are a lot more vocal about it. We're getting a pretty bad rap for it -- 
discontented boomers, 'When are they going to stop whining?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Probably when they figure it out, which could be their entire lifetime. Aren't 
we sufficiently young-thinking? Don't we read their Bret Easton Ellis? Don't we 
wear street wear? Don't we -- and this is important -- listen to Arrested 
Development? Our parents hated Creedence Clearwater Revival. 
</P>
<P>
 "The generation before the boomers had music for dating, which they outgrew 
and went into classical music," said Richard A. Peterson, sociology professor 
at Vanderbilt University. "They grew out of childish things. The boomer 
generation took Chuck Berry literally with his 'Roll Over Beethoven.' They 
thought rock 'n' roll was significant music, good music." 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson said some of the discomfort about the younger generation may be 
jealousy. We're groovin' on the gym floor, but we think the fun is probably in 
the mosh pit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember someone saying in '74 or '75, 'You know what's wrong with the 
younger generation?' And I thought, 'Oh, no, Vietnam . . . ' And he said, 'It's 
that we're not part of it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, we must eventually get used to the idea that we really are 30 or 40 
or 50. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember the most defining moment in my life as far as age goes was when I 
was 27 I got those little coupon books you get for a loan," said White, who is 
in her mid-30s. "It was a graduate school loan, and I remember sitting in my 
little apartment, decorated in graduate school chic, looking at these coupons 
and laughing my head off. 'I'll be 37 by the time these are finished.' That was 
unthinkable."

THE MYSTERY WOMAN WHO CAN DO IT ALL; MURDER. RACISM. ABUSE. ROCHELLE MAJER 
KRICH -- WRITER, TEACHER, MOM -- KNOWS HOW TO MAKE CONFLICTS BETWEEN GOOD AND 
EVIL JUICY. 
</P>

<P>
 Why, the question occurs, is a nice Jewish woman -- mother, wife, educator, 
daughter of Holocaust survivors -- writing mystery novels about serial killers, 
rapists, abusers, psychopaths, racists and the problem of sexual harassment in 
the Los Angeles Police Department? 
</P>
<P>
 Rochelle Majer Krich laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I have to get out my frustrations. No, no, no." She shakes her head as 
the laugh returns briefly. "I would not connect the Jewish with the mystery, 
except for two things. One, Judaism in general deals with good versus evil in 
the Biblical sense. And, two, mysteries deal with good versus evil. Period." 
</P>
<P>
 A smile replaces the laugh. "That's why I explore the psychological aspects of 
a crime, not just the puzzle aspect." 
</P>
<P>
 The West Los Angeles writer has become a sort of California cottage 
industrialist, producing a rapid succession of L.A.-based novels about all of 
the above -- murder, abuse, etc. -- with subplots that venture into such 
sectarian concerns as the get , the traditional Orthodox Jewish divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 Example: Her latest novel, "Angel of Death" (Mysterious Press/Warner Books, 
1994), deals not only with murder and abuse but also with an unpopular ACLU 
case, a neo-Nazi march, militant Jewish activists and a female LAPD detective 
who discovers a secret about her background. 
</P>
<P>
 Krich's first novel came out in 1990, two years after she had decided she 
would take on a third career along with her teaching and family 
responsibilities. Since then, four other novels have been published and a 
sixth, "Speak No Evil," is due in early 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 And Hollywood has made its inevitable call. Her first published novel, 
"Where's Mommy Now?" (Windsor NY), has been adapted by film producer Bruce Cohn 
Curtis, who changed the title to "Perfect Alibi" with Teri Garr, Hector 
Elizondo and Kathleen Quinlan. Curtis has optioned another of Krich's books 
while her two female-detective mysteries have drawn the attention of other 
producers. 
</P>
<P>
 Much about Krich seems to be in such multiples: 
</P>
<P>
 * Mother of six children, ranging from 10 to 22, all at home except for one 
college student. 
</P>
<P>
 * English department chair for both the boys and girls campuses of an orthodox 
private high school in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 * Teacher for 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wife for 23. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder, she says, that her children teased her when her first published 
book came out with the title "Where's Mommy Now?" 
</P>
<P>
 Well, if it's a Monday, Wednesday or Friday, Krich would be in the classroom 
or department office or grading papers. 
</P>
<P>
 If it's Tuesday or Thursday, she would be writing or doing research. 
</P>
<P>
 If it's Friday night or Saturday, she and her family would be celebrating 
their Sabbath. 
</P>
<P>
 And Sunday? "So often it, too, becomes a writing day," she says. "But not 
everything is balanced that neatly. Sometimes you agonize over the choices you 
have to make. For example, my cooking since I began writing has suffered 
tremendously. At one time I envisioned myself as a sort of Julia Child. That's 
no longer the case. I just don't have the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I do momentarily forget to pick up the kids when I am writing but 
they are all self-sufficient now. I no longer have infants who need physical 
attention, but the older children need more emotional attention and when that 
occurs I have to put away the writing. Their emotional needs take precedence." 
</P>
<P>
 Why, along with the careers of motherhood and teaching, did she pursue a third 
career -- the always unsettling business of writing? 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a fantasy," she says. "In elementary school I thought of being a 
Broadway musical star, but it was writing that mesmerized me. Writing was, I 
thought, something that happened to others. So I have to give a fellow mystery 
writer, Jonathan Kellerman, some credit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew each other at the Rambam Yeshiva High School in Los Angeles and then 
he became famous as a writer. Now here was someone famous that I knew, someone 
from our community who had gained recognition. He wasn't a remote Tom Clancy or 
a John Grisham, but someone real so I told myself, 'You know what? I'm going to 
try this.' 
</P>
<P>
 "What also helped was that my husband, Hershie, who is an engineer at TRW, had 
been bugging me, telling me to stop talking about writing. 'Sit down and do 
it,' he said. I did." 
</P>
<P>
 Nine months later, Krich had 700 pages of her first mystery, then titled "The 
Get," going out to publishers . . . and coming back . . . and going out . . . 
and coming back. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I quickly became sick of one phrase that is used so often in the rejection 
letters: 'In this crowded marketplace. . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
 She put that manuscript away, started another and seven months later sent 
"Where's Mommy Now?" to an agent who, she says, said he liked the plot, the 
characters, the dialogue, the narrative. 
</P>
<P>
 "I began to visualize a Beverly Hills home, a Rolls Royce," she says, "until a 
few weeks later he told me, 'You know, I'm not so sure about the plot, the 
characters, the dialogue, the narrative and if you redo the book I'll take 
another look.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'No.' A friend introduced me to another agent and in three months the 
book was sold and it later won an Anthony Award as best paperback mystery 
novel. After 'Where's Mommy Now?' was published, I got a call from an editor at 
Avon who said she had read my book and thought it was one of the best suspense 
novels she had read and asked if I had anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 What she had was that earlier 700-page manuscript in a drawer at home. She had 
been working it over after joining Sisters of Crime, a national group of women 
mystery writers. She sent it to the Avon editor, received a two-book deal, then 
saw the title change from "The Get" to "Till Death Do Us Part." 
</P>
<P>
 Film producer Curtis, Krich says, wants to make "Till Death Do Us Part" into a 
movie, but has indicated he plans to use the book's original title, "The Get." 
</P>
<P>
 The German-born UCLA graduate finds herself attracted to mysteries because of 
the unique requirements of the genre. 
</P>
<P>
 "The structure in mysteries requires that the writer ends up somewhere," she 
says. "You have to know where you are going. And you have to make all the parts 
fit by the end of the story. You also have to make the story believable and 
provide adequate clues without giving the story away. I like that tension. 
</P>
<P>
 "But a mystery can provide something else. It can deal with an issue, such as 
abuse and harassment. In 'Till Death Do Us Part,' I wanted to take a 
manipulating, blackmailing person and punish him. Here was a man who would not 
give his wife a 'get,' a Jewish divorce. I had a lot of anger and resentment 
toward people who do that. This was not something fictional. The issue troubled 
me and I thought a mystery would help destroy the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Subsequent to the book, three friends of mine found themselves in a similar 
situation -- their Jewish divorces held up by their husbands. Some of their 
real-life incidents paralleled conversations I had invented in the book. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 'Fair Game,' I wrote about the problems of a young woman detective and the 
problems she faced in a largely male environment. While I was writing that book 
the newspapers seemed to have daily pieces about sexual harassment accusations 
against the LAPD, so in the book I borrowed this headline from The Times, 
'Women Doing Well at LAPD but Not Welcome.' The book literally wrote itself." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Krich was 4 years old when her parents emigrated from Germany to the United 
States. Both parents had survived internment during World War II and met and 
married afterward while staying in Germany until their move to the United 
States in the early 1950s. She recalls growing up and learning of her parents's 
experiences in the camps. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some survivors do speak about it, others don't, others keep silent for years. 
My parents did tell us and I feel that it has affected me. It is why I feel 
uncertain often about my security. Persecution happened in Germany and I don't 
want to delude myself that it is impossible that it could happen here. It can 
happen anywhere. It frightens me hearing of a David Duke and a Tom Metzger."

 Racism and hate crime are major themes in her latest book, "Angel of Death," 
another Los Angeles-based mystery and the second with her character Jessica 
Drake, a female police detective. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was rejected 16 times for the book that became 'Fair Game,' my first 
Jessica Drake novel," Krich says. "Originally in my manuscript the detective 
was a male and the general criticism I got back was that he was bland. If a 
couple of people say the same thing in criticism then it merits attention. I 
got rid of the male, brought in Jessica, researched what it would take to be a 
female detective in the LAPD and rewrote most of the book. There is, I found, 
real hostility in some quarters to women cops. I have not yet faced that kind 
of hostility in my careers, but I know from my own experiences that women 
generally have to fight harder for equal footing." 
</P>
<P>
 Krich is the only female teacher in the English department she chairs. "I feel 
like a dominatrix," she says, the laugh returning. "They (the male teachers) 
have to listen to me. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see, in my orthodox Jewish community, the woman does not have an inferior 
status. In the Bible, women are given credit for being the more rational ones, 
the more loyal ones, the ones who, for example, are given the care of children 
because God has entrusted children with them knowing they will be taken care 
of."

A FITTING HONOR FOR PIONEERING SCIENTIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY NACHTIGAL, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Born to a slave two weeks before the end of the Civil War, George Washington 
Carver rose to stunning heights as a scientist, educator and humanitarian. 
</P>
<P>
 The Diamond Grove plantation, where the man who would revolutionize American 
agriculture spent his boyhood, is now the George Washington Carver National 
Monument, administered by the National Park Service. It's the first monument of 
its kind dedicated to an African American. 
</P>
<P>
 The park sweeps across 210 acres of rural southwestern Missouri. Its prairie 
grassland, dotted with shaded woods and shallow streams, is a gentle oasis of 
singing birds, wildflowers and butterflies where young Carver's fascination 
with plants developed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just being on the farm and spending 10 to 12 years wandering through the 
woods, we believe this environment influenced him to become what he did later 
in life," park ranger Lana Henry said. 
</P>
<P>
 The park's visitor center features films about Carver's life; a museum 
displays exhibits of his scientific research, his artwork and other artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-quarter-mile hiking path winds through the park, with interpretive 
stops showing where Carver was born, Moses and Susan Carver's plantation house, 
the Carver family cemetery and a bronze statue of the scientist as a boy. 
</P>
<P>
 The monument was created under an Act of Congress in 1943, shortly after 
Carver's death; then-Sen. Harry Truman of Missouri was a sponsor of the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Carver gained worldwide fame for developing more than 300 industrial uses for 
peanuts and sweet potatoes. He also rescued the South's economy by persuading 
cotton farmers to rotate crops and use natural fertilizers to restore worn-out 
soil. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in a one-room log shanty, Carver was kidnaped by bushwhackers as an 
infant, along with his mother. He later was found in Arkansas and returned to 
the Carver farm, but his mother never was found. 
</P>
<P>
 He was raised as one of the Carvers' own children and took their last name. As 
a child, he spent hours in the woods studying plants, soils and insects. 
</P>
<P>
 Around age 12, he went off to the only school for black children in the area, 
eight miles away. Then for the next 20 years, he worked odd jobs to finance his 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1896, Carver started an agriculture department at the Tuskegee Institute in 
Alabama, where he saw a chance to achieve a goal he established early in his 
life, "to be of the greatest good to the greatest number of 'my people.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Besides his scientific breakthroughs with peanuts and sweet potatoes, Carver 
worked with Henry Ford to perfect a process to extract rubber from the milk of 
goldenrod; created paving blocks from cotton and rubber from sludge, and 
developed new strains of cotton. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what impresses me most about Carver is his spirit," Ford said. "He 
taught himself how to read and became a very good artist and musician. He 
didn't have a school to go to and yet had the thirst for knowledge to walk 
eight miles to find a school that would take black children. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just had quite a determination."

NOT ALL THAT GLITTERS IN A FRIENDLY SMILE IS GOLDEN; HEALTH: THOSE SPARKLING 
TOOTH COVERS MAY BE EYE-CATCHING BUT BEWARE: DENTISTS WARN THEY CAN DAMAGE 
TEETH AND GUMS. 
</P>

 Few words were spoken when Jerome Broady and Peggy Sneed fell for each other. 
Words weren't needed; he flashed a smile, and she melted. She grinned, and he 
knew she was the right woman. 
</P>
<P>
 When Broady smiled, his two front teeth gleamed with gold, one with a star. 
Only one of Sneed's teeth sparkled, but its glow caught his eye. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew that she was what I was about when I saw it. We had something in 
common right off," Broady said. "She had a nice face, but what set it off was 
that gold. That just made me say 'Yeah, she's all right with me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Sneed found a deeper meaning in Broady's golden smile. 
</P>
<P>
 "It showed me he was a man of substance, someone (who) wants a lot of things 
and plans to go out and get it," Sneed said. "The gold said a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple, both 25, enjoy golden moments together. 
</P>
<P>
 But not all teeth that sparkle are golden. What often appears to be a gold 
tooth is actually a gold-colored tooth cover -- called a sleeve or cap -- made 
of brass or copper. 
</P>
<P>
 The gold sleeves are primarily for cosmetic reasons. One local dentist likened 
them to cheap jewelry that "makes your skin turn green if you leave it on too 
long." 
</P>
<P>
 The American Dental Assn. warned that because the existing tooth must be filed 
and altered for the gold sleeve to fit, the cap will ruin the tooth and 
possibly cause gum disease later. 
</P>
<P>
 But that possibility didn't stop Carl Coffman from getting "a gold" with a 
star cut out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something I wanted for a long time, and not because my friends have 
them," said Coffman, 18. "It makes me want to smile more because it's fancy 
like jewelry, but it's more permanent." 
</P>
<P>
 Several of his friends have gold caps, Coffman said, including one who has a 
combination of gold- and silver-capped teeth filling his mouth. The sleeves 
range in price from $25 to $100 and are available in many inexpensive jewelry 
and clothing stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know anybody who has real gold in their mouth, just the caps," 
Coffman said. "I don't even know if they make real golds." 
</P>
<P>
 The mouths of celebrities such as rapper Flavor Flav, boxer Mike Tyson and 
professional basketball player Larry Johnson may be adorned with real gold, but 
it is unlikely, dentists said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gold is the best material to use for dental work, but the gold teeth you see 
on most people is not gold at all," said Richard H. Price, a practicing dentist 
who also works in the consumer affairs division of the ADA. 
</P>
<P>
 The gold sleeves come in a variety of eye-catching models, including some 
emblazoned with dollar signs, champagne glasses, initials, suit symbols for 
cards, stars, moons (all phases) and various designs. 
</P>
<P>
 Men and women of various ages said they find the gold sleeves at local stores 
and have a dentist install them or attempt to do it themselves, which is not 
recommended by dentists. 
</P>
<P>
 When installed by a dentist, the sleeve is cemented to the tooth. 
Non-professionals have tried to wedge them between teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Fredrickson, who has a gold sleeve with a heart on one of his front 
teeth, said he squeezed the cap over his tooth and between adjacent teeth 
before having it put on properly by a dentist. 
</P>
<P>
 "It kept coming off when I ate, or sometimes when I was talking," said 
Fredrickson, 23, who has had "a gold" for five years. "I was talking to this 
girl once, and it started slipping, and I had to use my tongue to push it up. I 
think she saw it falling." 
</P>
<P>
 Fredrickson's problem now is that he doesn't want the gold sleeve taken off 
because his tooth is brown and looks decayed. "It's become embarrassing, and I 
don't have the money for a denture. So the gold's going to be on for a long 
while." 
</P>
<P>
 Katherine G. Collier, a dentist for 14 years, said she, like many dentists, 
refuses to fit patients with gold teeth. "I'm concerned about hygiene. The 
tooth decays under that gold-looking thing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the gold sleeve is not properly fitted, particles of food and bacteria can 
get between it and the tooth and cause tooth damage, Collier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many patients now are asking to have gold teeth removed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad to do that. I love doing that. I get real excited when I do that," 
Collier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Clay got his gold tooth with an ace of spades in it two decades ago, 
when he was 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, at 37, he regrets having the gold tooth. Its only redeeming factor, he 
says, is that women seem to like it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still me and will always be me," Clay said. "The gold doesn't matter. 
People look at me, the person."

MOVIE REVIEWS; AS GUMP'S MOMMA USED TO SAY . . .; 'STUPID IS AS STUPID DOES' IS 
AN APT DESCRIPTION FOR JIM CARREY AND JEFF DANIELS IN 'DUMB AND DUMBER,' WHICH 
IS VERY DUMB, AND ALSO EXTREMELY TASTELESS, SILLY -- AND FUNNY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 "Dumb and Dumber" is a heap o' gags about dumbness. Most of the jokes are dumb 
dumb but some of them are actually smart dumb. The film seems to have been made 
for precocious 7-year-olds and their parents -- at least the type of parents 
who stay up to watch "Beavis and Butt-head." 
</P>
<P>
 Bathroom humor isn't exactly an acquired taste. Either you think it's funny or 
you walk. "Dumb and Dumber," which stars Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels as two 
low-wattage buddies, Lloyd and Harry, abounds in potty jokes and gross-out 
gags. The real joke is that grown men are actually doing this stuff. And Carrey 
and Daniels go all the way with the ridiculousness; they really get inside the 
buddies' euphoric blankness. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Peter Farrelly, who co-wrote the grab-bag screenplay with Bennett 
Yellin and Bobby Farrelly, doesn't stage the gags particularly well, and a lot 
of comic payoffs misfire just because the camera isn't in the right place at 
the right time. But Farrelly isn't trying to pull our heartstrings either. He 
has the good sense to stand back and indulge the two actors' nutball riffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The pedigree for this scattershot, anything-for-a-laugh movie has already been 
set for a new generation by the "Naked Gun" films, and many others. And, in 
only his third starring vehicle, Carrey is already such an established comic 
presence that he holds the audience even when he's just mugging or making 
screwy little movements with his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 With his bowl cut and chipped tooth, and his jointless gyrations, Carrey is 
like a more elasticized Jerry Lewis; he may be the most freakishly cartoonish 
of all the star comedians (which is why he was so well cast in "The Mask"). 
Lloyd is a variation on the characters Carrey has played in "Ace Ventura" and 
"The Mask," but he's more triumphantly dim. And Lloyd is never so dim as when 
he thinks he's being smart: The spark in his eye is greater than the spark in 
his brain. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd starts out as an airport limo driver; his roomie, Harry, runs a canine 
grooming operation out of his truck, which is outfitted to look like a shaggy 
puppy. Harry (Daniels) is pretty shaggy himself. He's unkempt in a blotto kind 
of way; he's not concerned with his appearance because he's not really aware 
that he has an appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 The two guys spend half the movie traveling in circles from Rhode Island to 
Colorado in order to return a misplaced briefcase containing a fortune in 
ransom money to a socialite (Lauren Holly) who has stolen Lloyd's heart. (He 
took her to the airport and she actually listened to his inane banter.) 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way there are run-ins with rowdy roughnecks and cops and a kidnaping 
team (Mike Starr and Karen Duffy) who think Lloyd and Harry are actually master 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of the movie hinges on this smart-dumb misperception: It's "Being There" 
for the kiddies. When both boys take turns romancing the socialite, the film 
totters into its full tastelessness. Just before his big date, Harry is slipped 
a bottle of laxative by his jealous friend. Guess what happens? He also sticks 
his tongue on a frozen ski-lift pole. Lloyd, who is more debonair, accidentally 
assassinates a snow owl at an endangered species benefit with a popped 
champagne cork. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dumb and Dumber" isn't exactly the sort of movie you can recommend to people 
-- at least not to people you don't know really well. But it's got more laughs 
than "Junior" or "Speechless" -- granted, no great achievement. It also has a 
love of silliness that isn't all that dumb. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: PG-13, for off-color humor. Times guidelines: It includes lots 
of bathroom humor scenes of people gagging.

HOWARD ROSENBERG / TELEVISION: REAL FAMILY VALUES, THE GOP AND PUBLIC TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Public television and family values. 
</P>
<P>
 On some days it reeks of must, timidity and irrelevance. Whatever public 
television's failings, however, they're insufficient at this stage to merit the 
capital punishment that incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich and other 
muscle-flexing conservatives appear to have in mind for the system they 
mistakenly insist is a hotbed of lefties. Sure, like those Marxists John 
McLaughlin and Bill Buckley. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder, then, that a recent caller who made a point of identifying himself 
to me as a conservative Republican was fiercely indignant about Gingrich's hope 
to end federal funding of public TV (and, by the way, that other target of 
right-wing wrath, the National Endowment for the Arts). 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a very misguided, dangerous step," said the caller, who added 
that he relishes the cultural sustenance he draws from public TV, the same 
outfit that many of his fellow conservatives regard as the liberal Antichrist. 
</P>
<P>
 In an ideal world, the nation's troves of artistic and intellectual enrichment 
would be underwritten by limitless private bequeathals. No government or 
corporate masters to serve, no irritating pledge pitches for viewers to endure. 
Just total independence and money, money, money. And speaking of wish lists, it 
would be swell too, if some of us had awakened this morning and found a zillion 
dollars on our doorsteps. 
</P>
<P>
 But you know how it is. Reality intrudes. 
</P>
<P>
 Just what public television would substitute for the massive chunk of federal 
funds it would lose -- Monopoly money, perhaps? -- is a question that Gingrich 
has yet to address. Nor can he in a realistic way, given how charities 
everywhere are bemoaning the decline in private donations during these 
lingering economic doldrums. 
</P>
<P>
 Public TV traditionally has a battle on its hands from White House and 
congressional budgetmeisters, whether Republican or Democrat, who prefer giving 
public funds to ballet rather than to the bold and boisterous. Yet the 
anti-public TV verbiage is now especially loud and shrill. And as a newer, even 
more conservative Congress prepares to consider legislation authorizing funds 
for public TV's own Big Daddy -- the Corporation for Public Broadcasting -- the 
death penalty is at least a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, Gingrich and Crew would get plenty of fight from his colleagues who still 
love not only their "Masterpiece Theatre" and "MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour," but 
also the votes of upper-crust constituents who regard even a flawed public TV 
as a personal birthright. If not an instant lethal jolt, though, a slow, 
gasping, dawdling death may loom, with public TV going semi-comatose as its 
panicked leaders continue jumping through conservative hoops and shying from 
controversy in order to convince congressional cost-cutters of the system's 
worthiness. 
</P>
<P>
 What has this to do with family values? 
</P>
<P>
 Only that public TV tonight offers the first of "TV Families," a rewarding, 
five-part series of short films from the Independent Television Service (ITVS). 
It turns out that the possibly endangered Corporation for Public Broadcasting 
gives about $6 million a year to the non-profit ITVS, which itself was created 
by Congress in 1989 "to encourage the development of programming that involves 
creative risks and . . . addresses the needs of unserved and underserved 
audiences, particularly children and minorities." 
</P>
<P>
 Did someone say "creative risks"? These are words that terrify even public-TV 
stations themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet only recently, ITVS gave public-TV viewers "The Ride," an arresting series 
of related documentary films about, for and by teen-agers. Its refreshing 
brashness represented what public TV should be airing even more frequently. 
</P>
<P>
 And much nearer the edge is "TV Families," small films that depict families 
mostly in dysfunctional ways rarely seen on television (except, of course, on 
"Ricki Lake" and "Sally Jessy Raphael"). 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's "The Secret Life of Houses" is Adrian Velicescu's challenging film 
about the overlapping realities and fantasies of a somber 9-year-old (Penny 
Ryan) left to fend for herself as her mother (Laurie Metcalf) lies critically 
ill in a hospital. Velicescu creates a drab world of constantly droning TVs 
where battling guests on daytime talk shows share the extreme dysfunction of 
little Margaret's own family. And things get worse for her with the arrival of 
a predatory aunt (Shirley Knight) who prematurely rifles her sister's 
belongings and shops for a casket. 
</P>
<P>
 TV is also ever-present in Todd Haynes' "Dottie Gets Spanked," which shares an 
hour in Episode 2 with "Night Ride," Andrew Garrison's dreamy slice of boozing, 
shooting and coming of age in rural Kentucky. In contrast, "Dottie Gets 
Spanked" is almost surreal, its depiction of the erotic impact that a TV series 
along the lines of "I Love Lucy" has on a 7-year-old boy, filling the screen 
with harsh, outrageous images. 
</P>
<P>
 A subsequent episode introduces Ayoka Chenira's bittersweet "MOTV," in which a 
loving couple's lives become a sort of home-video scrapbook before they are 
victimized by the violent neighborhood they hope to escape. The next grouping 
is the satirical "A Psychic Mom," from Shelli Ainsworth and Steve Busa, and 
Tamara Jenkins' darkly witty "Family Remains," whose Gothic tone -- a loopy 
mother and daughter only coexist bizarrely in their creepy house -- is enhanced 
in black and white. 
</P>
<P>
 "TV Families" saves its most provocative film for last, concluding with 
"Terminal, USA," Jon Moritsugu's amusing, self-bleeping, self-mocking soap 
opera whose politically incorrect Asian family communicates mostly through 
ribaldry and spermspeak . "Married . . . With Children," eat your heart out. 
</P>
<P>
 This series resulted from ITVS asking independent filmmakers to rethink the 
notion of family. Although their work is uneven, that they were given the 
opportunity to take chances is gratifying in itself. And a reminder that some 
members of Congress need to rethink their notion of public TV. 
</P>
<P>
 * "TV Families" premieres at 11 tonight on KCET-TV Channel 28.

N.Y. CRITICS GO OWN WAY, PICK 'QUIZ'; MOVIES: UNLIKE WITH OTHER CRITICS' 
GROUPS, ROBERT REDFORD'S FILM TAKES THE TOP PRIZE. QUENTIN TARANTINO'S 'PULP 
FICTION' WINS BEST DIRECTOR AND SCREENPLAY. 
</P>

<P>
 Defying conventional wisdom, parting with their fellow critics' groups and 
perhaps changing the complexion of the Oscar race, the New York Film Critics 
Circle Thursday selected "Quiz Show," Robert Redford's character-based 
examination of the '50s television scandals, as the best picture of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pulp Fiction," which many had expected to win the top prize, took two awards: 
best director and best screenplay, both for Quentin Tarantino. 
</P>
<P>
 The Critics Circle, voting for the 60th time since its inception in 1935, 
chose Paul Newman as best actor for his performance in Robert Benton's 
"Nobody's Fool." It was a close vote between Newman and Samuel L. Jackson, 
picked for his highly regarded work in "Pulp Fiction." 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Fiorentino, the femme fatale with the heart of ice in John Dahl's "The 
Last Seduction," was chosen best actress, over some healthy support for 
Jennifer Jason-Leigh ("Hudsucker Proxy" and "Mrs. Parker and the Vicious 
Circle") and newcomer Crissy Rock of Ken Loach's "Ladybird, Ladybird." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Landau was chosen best supporting actor for his portrayal of Bela 
Lugosi in "Ed Wood" on the first vote. Dianne Weist, the centerpiece of Woody 
Allen's "Bullets Over Broadway," was selected best supporting actress. 
Krzysztof Kieslowski's "Red," a strong contender for best picture honors, won 
instead for best foreign film. Likewise, "Hoop Dreams," which took best 
documentary. 
</P>
<P>
 When the awards are handed out at the Circle's annual dinner Jan. 22, a 
special award will be bestowed on French director Jean-Luc Godard for his 
"influence on world cinema." At the other end of the career spectrum, newcomer 
Darnell Martin will be feted as best first-time filmmaker -- an award given 
only on a year-by-year basis -- for her exuberant "I Like It Like That." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the New York and Los Angeles critics differed on the best picture and 
best actor awards -- John Travolta ("Pulp Fiction") and Jessica Lange ("Blue 
Skies), who won the L.A. awards Saturday, got virtually no support in New York 
-- they agreed more than they didn't: Landau, Weist, "Red," "Hoop Dreams" and 
cinematographer Stefan Czapsky ("Ed Wood") have all been honored by both 
groups, as was Tarantino for best director.

MOVIE REVIEWS; ALL IS FAIR IN LOVE AND POLITICS; 'SPEECHLESS' FEATURES KEATON 
AND DAVIS IN A ROMANTIC COMEDY THAT CROSSES PARTY LINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Machines don't make movies in Hollywood just yet, but when they do, 
"Speechless" is what they'll be like. 
</P>
<P>
 A mild romantic comedy so full of familiar feints and dodges it plays like a 
rerun the first time you see it, "Speechless" contains very little that hasn't 
been on view elsewhere in a better light. And the few clever bits it does 
contain tend to feel out of place, nervy escapees from a funnier piece of work. 
</P>
<P>
 Although real life has caught up with the film's premise with the marriage of 
Clinton campaigner James Carville to Mary Matalin, his opposite number in the 
Bush camp, screenwriter Robert King's notion of constructing a romance between 
warring speech writers in a contentious political campaign is a clever one. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Vallick (Michael Keaton) and Julia Mann (Geena Davis) meet high-concept 
cute, both reaching for the last container of Nytol at an all-night emporium in 
a New Mexico town. The stuff must not be too effective, because the two of them 
meet again a few hours later at a we-never-close diner where they trade 
insomnia cures and wide grins. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the plot initially keeps the pair in the dark about it, Kevin and 
Julia have something big in common. He is a speech writer for the Republican 
candidate for U.S. Senate, a politician she considers "a simpleton." She, 
meanwhile, does the same thing for the Democratic candidate, someone he 
considers "a tax-and-spend, knee-jerk liberal." 
</P>
<P>
 And although Kevin is a wacky TV-sitcom writer who was once voted most likely 
to embarrass his family while Julia is a former class valedictorian who 
believes politics is about changing the world more than merely winning, the 
film heavily hints that they are Hollywood's latest candidates for the perfect 
couple. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the pair's initial connection is made, "Speechless" has a tendency to go 
on autopilot. None of the succeeding events -- from a late-night drive where 
the car (surprise) runs out of gas, to the couple playfully splashing water on 
each other in a public fountain, to the inevitable rifts, misunderstandings and 
huffy glances they share -- offers enough of a spin on standard situations to 
be of much interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Quirkier and more engaging are the fleeting glimpses into the vicissitudes of 
political campaigns "Speechless" provides, such as the way candidates mangle 
their carefully crafted speeches and how a fuzzy, heart-tugging story about a 
bear down a well can keep nominally more serious political news off all the 
channels. 
</P>
<P>
 The best performance in the film, in fact, comes not from the leads but 
Christopher Reeve as smug network TV reporter "Baghdad Bob" Freed, the kind of 
self-satisfied operative who lives in his flak jacket and tells everyone to 
just "call me Baggy." 
</P>
<P>
 Although cast as Julia's former fiance and a romantic rival to Kevin, Reeve is 
best as a comic stiff, and his brisk series of tongue-limbering exercises 
before going on air may be the funniest moment in the film. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Keaton and Davis, who also co-produced the film with husband 
Renny Harlin, give uninspired performances. Although both began their movie 
careers in off-beat roles and in fact shared screen credit in the decidedly 
nutty "Beetlejuice," they are intent here on recasting themselves as 
conventional matinee idols, complete with high-gloss grins and perky twinkles 
in their eyes. The result is certainly mainstream, but it is also less 
involving than what either of them has done in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Pushing everybody the wrong way is the film's loopy music (by Marc Shaiman) 
and glib direction (by Ron Underwood). Underwood, whose major credit is "City 
Slickers," has produced a series of overly ingratiating set pieces from which 
recognizable humanity has been surgically removed. Causing neither noticeable 
pain nor pleasure, "Speechless" just sits there with its mouth open, catching 
flies. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: PG-13, one use of strong language. Times guidelines: It 
includes a passionate embrace in a parked car.

 Reinstated: Artist Willie Middlebrook, who was fired in April from his city 
civil service position for alleged wrongdoing, has been reinstated as an 
instructor at the Los Angeles William Reagh Photography Center. In a report 
issued in early October but only implemented this week, the Board of Civil 
Service Commissioners ruled that the Cultural Affairs Department failed to 
sustain claims that Middlebrook had engaged in payroll fraud by falsifying a 
neighborhood worker's time sheets while serving as director of the Watts Towers 
Arts Center in 1993. Middlebrook was transferred to the Photography Center 
after the alleged incident, and later terminated. He served as curator of 
exhibitions at Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions while his appeal was 
pending.

 Bidding War: "Oranges and Wrappers," a sparkling early 20th-Century still-life 
by William Joseph McCloskey, was sold for $464,500 on Tuesday at Los Angeles' 
Butterfield & Butterfield. The auction house had estimated the painting's value 
at $100,000 to $150,000, but the price soared as two East Coast bidders 
competed by telephone against members of the audience. An unidentified private 
collector in L.A. finally won out, setting an auction record for the 
little-known American artist. TELEVISION

 Vegas Tales: Grammy-winning rap music star Sir Mix-A-Lot (real name: Anthony 
Ray) has been cast in the title role of "The Watcher," an hourlong drama series 
set to premiere Jan. 17 on the new United Paramount Network. The rapper's 
character, who is secretly holed-up in a darkened Las Vegas hotel room, watches 
numerous TV monitors that pick up every sound and movement in the city. He then 
narrates tales of "power, lust and greed gone awry in a city whose cast of 
characters . . . symbolize the best and worst of the American dream."

 Supporting Public TV: U.S. Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) is asking colleagues to 
join him in urging Speaker-elect Newt Gingrich (R.-Ga.) to reconsider his 
proposal to "zero out" federal funding for the Corp. for Public Broadcasting. 
In a letter to fellow representatives, Engel says: "As a father and former 
educator, I appreciate the value of the programming on public television. I 
dare say there is not a member of Congress with children who has not relied on 
Big Bird or Fred Rogers to help teach important lessons to our youngsters." 
Engel's letter lauds the "MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour" and William F. Buckley's 
"Firing Line." It also says that "public broadcasting enjoys widespread 
support" and that a Republican-led attempt earlier this year to rescind its 
funding was defeated by a vote of 384-42.

 Anchors Away!: NBC's "Weekend Today" is facing some changes. Co-anchor Jackie 
Nespral is leaving after the Jan. 1 broadcast to become an anchor at WTVJ, an 
NBC-owned station in her native Miami. Anchor Mike Schneider, who was brought 
in to be on a subsequently canceled newsmagazine, reportedly has not been happy 
on "Weekend Today" and plans to leave this spring. And weatherman Al Roker, who 
will be subbing several weekdays for "Today" weatherman Willard Scott this 
spring, also may cut back on his time on "Weekend Today." MOVIES

 Whistling With Lloyd Webber: Broadway composer Andrew Lloyd Webber is working 
on a $15-million musical film version of the 1961 British movie "Whistle Down 
the Wind," which starred Alan Bates and Hayley Mills. Lloyd Webber is writing 
the film's music, pop composer-lyricist Jim Steinman ("Total Eclipse of the 
Heart") is writing the lyrics, and the screenplay is being written by Patricia 
Knop. No studio has been attached to the film, which is being financed through 
Lloyd Webber's Really Useful film company, although talks have reportedly been 
held with Polygram Filmed Entertainment. Lloyd Webber and Steinman have 
mentioned Johnny Depp and Kirsten Dunst ("Interview With the Vampire") as 
possible stars, but a Lloyd Webber spokesman on Thursday called news of their 
casting "very premature." LEGAL FILE

 Looming Jail Time: A New York judge sent Tupac Shakur's manager to jail 
Wednesday to await sentencing on a sex abuse conviction and said he plans to do 
the same with Shakur once the rapper recovers from gunshot wounds received in a 
robbery two weeks ago. State Supreme Court Justice Daniel Fitzgerald said he 
usually jails convicted defendants when he plans to sentence them to prison. "I 
believe some jail time will be appropriate," he said. "The only question is how 
much." Fitzgerald issued an arrest warrant for Shakur, but stayed it for at 
least a week after Shakur's doctor said that moving the rapper could endanger 
him. Shakur, 23, and his road manager, Charles Fuller, 24, were convicted Dec. 
1 of sexually abusing a 21-year-old woman in 1993. Both men will be sentenced 
on Jan. 17.

 Wayne Newton's Side: Entertainer Wayne Newton admitted in federal bankruptcy 
court in Nevada on Wednesday that he bought a sculpture and a painting by 
Renoir from Sotheby's auction house after filing for Chapter 11 protection in 
August, 1992. But he denied creditors' accounts that he frittered away nearly 
$163,000 in auctions on other artwork, a guitar pick used by Elvis Presley and 
a cigarette case that belonged to Errol Flynn, saying that those purchases were 
either gifts or bought by friends using his Sotheby's account. Newton also 
disputed creditors who said he didn't have the earning power to justify his 
financial reorganization plan. Responding to one lawyer's comment that his 
popularity has waned, Newton said, "I guess I'd rather be somewhat of a 
has-been than a never-was." SHAUNA SNOW

MOVIE REVIEW; A MUSICAL-MYSTERY SEARCH FOR BEETHOVEN'S 'BELOVED' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is a classic mad maestro look, half-rabid, half-rhapsodic, and seeing it on 
Gary Oldman's face unmasks "Immortal Beloved" even before you read the 
breathless prose on the rest of the poster: "The genius behind the music. The 
madness behind the man. The untold love story of Ludwig van Beethoven." Oh, 
brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, this is another one of Hollywood's silly symphonies, an unintentionally 
amusing bit of piffle that allows mortals a privileged glimpse into the private 
life of a legendary composer, letting us watch in awe as the great man indulges 
in passionate romantic liaisons and says things like, "I am writing a new 
symphony. It will cause a scandal." 
</P>
<P>
 And great he was, worthy of the somber funeral oration delivered in 1827 by 
Beethoven factotum Anton Schindler (Jeroen Krabbe): "He was an artist and who 
will stand beside him? The thorns of his life wounded him deeply, but he held 
to his art. He carried the music in his heart even when he could no longer hear 
it." And so on. 
</P>
<P>
 Devoted as Schindler was to the maestro, he is as shocked as the next person 
when a hidden document reveals that Beethoven left everything to the great love 
of his life, the never identified "Immortal Beloved." "The maestro was nursing 
a secret passion," Schindler all but gasps. "Who could this be?" 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with a list of likely suspects, Schindler ignores the composer's gruff 
surviving brother who wants the big bucks for himself, and sets off on a grand 
tour of former girlfriends, determined to solve this musical mystery because, 
and you can quote him, "There can be no peace without the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 The first stop is a sprawling hotel in Carlsbad where Beethoven and the I.B. 
were scheduled to have a rendezvous years before. But the lady mysteriously 
stormed out mere seconds before the maestro's arrival, causing the bereaved man 
to smash furniture and heave armchairs out the window like a rampaging rock 
star. 
</P>
<P>
 Next is Vienna and a visit to the Countess Julia Guicciardi (Valeria Golino), 
an early Ludwig groupie who locks the door and insists, "What I shall tell you 
will never leave this room." Though Beethoven had the personality of a common 
oaf, she reveals, he first became her piano teacher and then won her heart. But 
her snooty father, upset at the maestro's increasing deafness and his humble 
birth, nixed the match. 
</P>
<P>
 Deafness also forged a bond between the composer and another woman in the I.B. 
sweepstakes, the Countess Anna Marie Erdody (Isabella Rossellini), encountered 
by Schindler in a roadside tavern knocking a few back with the hearty peasants 
of her Hungarian estate. 
</P>
<P>
 She met the composer at the first performance of one of his concertos when 
Beethoven's hearing disorder, which made the world sound like a jet, was 
forever revving its engines, causing him to act strangely and provoking 
audience laughter. "His fire offended their small brains," the countess 
grumbles, still upset at the tyranny of petty minds. 
</P>
<P>
 The last important woman in the composer's life is his sister-in-law Johanna 
(Johanna Ter Steege), a no-nonsense, self-reliant type who got on Beethoven's 
bad side by running off with his favorite brother.  
</P>
<P>
 Given how over the top he's been recently, Oldman is actually restrained (for 
him) as the romantic composer who storms through life railing against the 
commonplace, but the role is conceived in such a formulaic way, it can't arouse 
much interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Immortal Beloved" does have a few things to look forward to, especially the 
snippets of the man's splendid music, here played by soloists Murray Perahia, 
Emanuel Ax and Yo Yo Ma and the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Sir 
Georg Solti. 
</P>
<P>
 But though Bernard Rose's interest in Beethoven is doubtlessly genuine, that 
has not stopped him from taking liberties with history and turning out an inane 
piece of work, the kind of movie where you can actually see the irate master 
scratching Napoleon's name off what came to be known as the "Eroica" Symphony. 
Those wild and crazy composers, they really knew how to live. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: R, scenes of violence and sexuality. Times guidelines: It 
includes nudity and a scene of rape, though not by the maestro.

MOVIE REVIEW; MINI-BUDGET 'RISK' A COMPLEX AND WELL-TOLD LOVE STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Deirdre Fishel's captivating debut feature, "Risk," a love story of 
exceptional insight and reflection, reveals how a passionate affair can lead to 
a devastating confrontation with self. It's one of those mini-budget films with 
a raw, unpolished look and feel that complements rather than detracts from its 
material. 
</P>
<P>
 While her film has a steady, rhythmic flow, Fishel wisely focuses steadfastly 
on her people, which results in an unfussy, natural style; there's no artiness 
here, no fancy camera angles. At the same time, "Risk" has a sense of nuance, 
of a comprehensive illumination of emotions, that seems distinctly feminine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Risk" really lives up to its title. Joe (David Ilku), a pleasant-looking, 
friendly young man zeros in on Maya (Karen Sillas), a striking young woman, 
while riding one evening on a New York bus. Although Maya, a struggling 
painter, backs off from his advances, she finds herself, a day or so later, 
letting him in her crummy apartment -- and almost immediately joining him in 
her bathtub. 
</P>
<P>
 Maya and Joe, both so very attractive, are ripe for each other: she's finding 
it so hard to make it in her work that she's wondering what she should be doing 
with her life; for Joe reaching out to Maya is a way of breaking out of his 
self-described "anonymity" -- living at a YMCA, apparently drifting from one 
minimum-wage job to another. They unleash a spirit of recklessness in each 
other to the extent that they're quickly off to rural Connecticut in a stolen 
car. (Not to worry, Fishel, though inspired by a news item, refuses steadfastly 
to turn her material into yet another "lovers-on-the-run" adventure.) 
</P>
<P>
 Fishel reveals what a fine writer she is in the deft way, in the course of the 
couple's journey, she shifts focus from Maya to Joe. Joe winds up on the 
doorstep of his pregnant older sister Nikki (Molly Price, in an admirably 
complex portrayal), with the hope of finding shelter for him and Maya and work 
from his builder brother-in-law Karl (Jack Gwaltney), who is leery of Joe. But 
what has Maya gotten herself into? Why is Nikki's loving concern for her 
brother so intense? Why is Karl's resentment of Joe tinged with jealousy? 
Ultimately mature but made vulnerable through love, Maya becomes one of a 
zillion women who has let herself get carried away by an ardent lover she 
really doesn't know and may well be more deeply troubled than she could ever 
imagine. 
</P>
<P>
 Fishel is as skilled a director as she is a writer, and the portrayals of 
Sillas, seen recently -- and impressively -- in "What Happened Was . . . ," and 
Ilku have a completeness that's extraordinary. Ilku is as touching as he is 
unsettling as a young man for whom love releases at once terrible demons and a 
deep yearning to make something of his life. (In time we realize Joe's 
confident pursuit of Maya was in fact a remarkable act of courage.) Sillas' 
Maya, in turn, discovers her inherent resiliency and honesty tested as never 
before. "Risk" ends abruptly, leaving us confounded, which seems exactly as it 
should be. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: Unrated. Times guidelines: It includes some strong language, 
some nudity, discreet lovemaking, complex adult themes .

MOVIE REVIEW; 'CAMILLA' PAIRS TANDY, CRONYN ONE LAST TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Camilla" affords the late Jessica Tandy with a delightful final starring role 
and also a final teaming with her husband, Hume Cronyn. Although the film has 
considerable charm, the Cronyns and Tandy's co-star Bridget Fonda are much 
better than it is. 
</P>
<P>
 Beautiful and elegant in the title role, Tandy and Fonda's Freda meet while 
the younger woman and her husband Vince (Elias Koteas), who live in Toronto, 
are vacationing on Peabo Island along Georgia's coast. Camilla, a former 
Toronto resident, is a violinist given to harmless exaggerations about 
professional triumphs and romantic conquests while Freda is a struggling 
composer whose husband dismisses her efforts as merely a hobby. A woman of 
spirit and imagination, Camilla is exactly the kind of person Freda needs to 
encourage her; Camilla in turn warms to Freda's friendship. 
</P>
<P>
 So far so good, especially since Vince, a commercial artist, quickly lands an 
advertising/promotion assignment with Camilla's son Harold (Maury Chaykin), an 
Atlanta-based soft-porn film producer. Meanwhile, the women are beginning to 
think how much fun it would be to take off for Toronto, where, according to 
Camilla, she experienced her greatest triumph at the landmark Elgin/Winter 
Garden Theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Writer Paul Quarrington unfortunately makes a major mistake at this point. 
Instead of simply informing Vince and Harold of their plans, the women just 
take off. This not only has the effect of making them seem callous and 
irresponsible but also means that every time Tandy and Fonda are working up a 
lovely scene, director Deepa Mehta has to cut away to show Vince and Harold 
becoming increasingly and understandably distraught over the women's 
disappearances. 
</P>
<P>
 Structurally, "Camilla" is a mess, but Tandy and Fonda are wonderful together 
as a fast friendship between Camilla and Freda develops. The reunion between 
Camilla and the Niagara Falls violin maker (Cronyn) who was her true love is 
inevitably poignant. 
</P>
<P>
 The chance to experience America's greatest acting team since the Lunts for 
one final time, plus the appealing Fonda, does in fact tempt you to forgive 
"Camilla" its various shortcomings.

 Worried that Santa might not know what to bring your favorite jazz fan? Worry 
no more. Here's a selection of items in a variety of media and a range of 
prices to please even the choosiest grooving Grinch: 
</P>
<P>
 Art: Sculptures by Paul D. Wegner. His imaginative images of jazz players cost 
a bundle, but, as superbly crafted collectibles that reflect the real feeling 
of jazz, they're worth it (if you can afford them, of course). Wegner, a 
lifelong lover of the music, has created a series of limited edition metal 
works 20 to 35 inches high that depict scenes ("Meeting at Preservation Hall" 
and "After Hours," for example) as well as specific characters ("Dizzy, Louis, 
Handy" and "Mr. New Orleans: Pete Fountain"). The musicians and their 
instruments are meticulously rendered, and Wegner uses an innovative technique 
that makes his subjects seem suspended in air. Editions are generally 
restricted to between 100 and 300 pieces, and prices range from $1,950 to 
$13,500. 3rd Wish Studio, (805) 649-5562. 
</P>
<P>
 Books: "My Singing Teachers," by Mel Torme. A relaxed and chatty look at the 
veteran performer's musical life and times. His "teachers" are the singers -- 
from Bessie Smith and Louis Armstrong to Ella Fitzgerald and Nat (King) Cole -- 
who influenced him. In barely more than 200 pages, Torme provides an engaging 
anecdotal overview of popular singing in the pre-rock era. Oxford University 
Press, $19.95. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sweet Swing Blues on the Road," by Wynton Marsalis and Frank Stewart. The 
trumpeter-author captures the boredom and the exhilaration, the audience 
interaction and the not-infrequent loneliness of the life of a traveling jazz 
musician. Stewart's atmospheric black-and-white photos make perfect companions 
to Marsalis' 12 chapters (reflecting the 12-bar blues). In his narrative, 
Marsalis also raises some compelling questions about jazz and racial attitudes 
and interracial relations in American society. A fascinating book from a 
thought-provoking artist. W. W. Norton & Co., $29.95. 
</P>
<P>
 Video: "Bix: Ain't None of Them Play Like Him Yet," a documentary produced and 
directed by Brigitte Berman. The star-crossed Bix Beiderbecke -- he died in 
1931 at age 28 -- became a model for the image of the jazz musician as 
misunderstood outsider. Because the cornetist was virtually unknown before he 
died, Berman had little source material other than still photographs and film 
footage from the 1920s (although not of Beiderbecke). But by combining classic 
Beiderbecke recordings with interviews with Louis Armstrong, Hoagy Carmichael, 
Artie Shaw and several of Beiderbecke's contemporaries, she has put together an 
absorbing portrait of a legendary figure. Playboy Video, $29.95. 
</P>
<P>
 Spoken Word: "Buddy Collette, a Jazz Biography." Buddy Collette has been one 
of L.A.'s woodwind players of choice since the 1940s. In addition to gigs with 
Charles Mingus, Duke Ellington and, most notably, the Chico Hamilton quintet, 
he has done hundreds of studio sessions with everyone from Groucho Marx to 
Frank Sinatra. This two-CD set is like a slowly unfolding interview with 
someone who knows chapter and verse on every aspect of the last four decades of 
the L.A. jazz scene. The format is simple enough: Collette plays a few 
passages, unaccompanied, on flute, clarinet or saxophone, then launches into a 
monologue revolving around a topic such as "Meeting Charles Mingus," "Bird's 
Nickname," "Nat Cole" or "Eric Dolphy." An innovative approach to aural 
biography, although one that may not appeal to the casual jazz listener. Issues 
Records, $24.98. 
</P>
<P>
 World Music: "AFRICA Never Stand Still." No other continent can boast the 
variety of music Africa can. This three-CD collection, complete with a 48-page 
booklet, pays colorful tribute to that diversity. Many of the names that have 
gradually become familiar to Western audiences are present: Ladysmith Black 
Mambazo, Papa Wemba, Youssou N'Dour, Thomas Mapfumo, etc. But there are dozens 
of others, equally appealing. More to the point, the anthology is a 
far-reaching survey of contemporary music stretching from Algeria to South 
Africa, from the Cape Verde islands to Madagascar. What emerges is an 
enormously eclectic picture, a multicolored tapestry that illustrates the 
connections as well as the differences among a vast and vital melange of 
musical expressions. Ellipsis Arts, $44.95. 
</P>
<P>
 CD-ROMs: "Jazz: A Multimedia History: Jazz Series: Louis Armstrong, Count 
Basie, Billie Holiday." The Multimedia History is the first attempt to bring 
jazz to CD-ROM. As an initial effort, it is moderately successful, blending 
video clips (including rare footage of Holiday and Charlie Parker, among 
others) with a useful if not especially extensive database of historical and 
biographical material. The three "Jazz Series" CDs were produced by historian 
Herb Wong with a similar combination of video and data, supplemented by a dozen 
or more full-length audio tracks. These are not CD-ROMs that makes full use of 
the medium's dazzling potential, but there's no denying their value as basic 
references for the jazz collector. Compton's New Media, $29.95.

JAZZ NOTES: CDS PRESENT A YEAR OF LISTENING PLEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the shopping days of the holiday season whittle down to a precious few, 
it's good to remember that CDs make inexpensive, thoughtful presents that last 
the whole year. 
</P>
<P>
 For the jazz lovers on your list, here is the second annual Jazz Notes Top 10 
CDs, composed of a tasty batch of mostly post-be-bop albums that include works 
from some seasoned vets, some rising new stars and even a couple of debuts. The 
albums are listed alphabetically and are generally available, unless otherwise 
noted, at major record stores. 
</P>
<P>
 TOSHIKO AKIYOSHI JAZZ ORCHESTRA, "Desert Lady/Fantasy," (Columbia). Akiyoshi's 
keen arranging and composing abilities are showcased, as is her splendid crew 
of improvisers. Lew Tabackin offers breathy flute against dusky, shifting 
backdrops on the title track, then on the bustling "Hiroko's Delight," 
baritonist Scott Robinson plays a superb essence-of-be-bop solo, with 
trumpeters Joe Magnarelli, Greg Gisbert, John Eckert and Mike Pinella and 
fellow saxman Walt Weiskopf not far behind. 
</P>
<P>
 CHICK COREA, "Expressions," (GRP). Playing unaccompanied, decided modernist, 
and individualist, Corea exhibits his extensive knowledge of jazz history on 
his piano. He gives Bud Powell's "Oblivion" an Art Tatum sweep, and swirls 
sounds on "Stella by Starlight" a la Bill Evans. Then tunes like Strayhorn's 
"Lush Life," moving forcefully due to an uplifting four-note bass line, are all 
his. 
</P>
<P>
 STEVE GROSSMAN, "In New York," (Dreyfus). Working with pianist McCoy Tyner, 
the tenor saxophonist comes up with a mostly explosive, although occasionally 
meditative work. Recorded at New York's Sweet Basil, the album fully captures 
the exhilaration of hearing a great band in a nightclub. Grossman, Tyner, 
bassist Avery Sharp and wham-bam drummer Art Taylor (a very young 61 at the 
time of the date) gloriously stretching out on "Impressions," "Speak Low" and 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 ROY HARGROVE, "With the Tenors of Our Times," (Verve). The trumpeter, now just 
25, is maturing rapidly. Performing here alongside noble tenorists Joe 
Henderson, Johnny Griffin, Stanley Turrentine, Joshua Redman, Branford Marsalis 
and Ron Blake, he's classy and impressive, issuing crisp, listenable ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 KEVIN HAYES, "Seventh Sense," (Blue Note). This is the debut of a magnetic 
pianist who writes, arranges and improvises with equal aplomb. Aided by a front 
line of Steve Nelson (vibes) and formidable tenor upstart Seamus Blake, Hayes 
and company probe an appealing repertoire, from the luxurious "Black Narcissus" 
to the expressive "My Man's Gone Now." 
</P>
<P>
 STEPHANIE HAYNES AND DAVE MACKAY, "Two on a Swing," (Why Not, P.O. Box 1323, 
San Juan Capistrano, CA 92693, (714) 496-0537). The superb jazz vocalist teams 
with the resourceful pianist. There's a splendidly diverse range of tunes, with 
the emphasis on intimacy and tenderness, as on the evocative "Someone to Light 
Up My Life" and the rarely sung "Out of the Night" by Horace Silver. (Note: 
Haynes and Mackay offer tunes from the album on Wednesday and Thursday at 
Legends of Hollywood in Studio City. Information: (818) 760-6631). 
</P>
<P>
 KEITH JARRETT, "At the Deer Head Inn," (ECM). Another example of the magic 
that can happen at a live nightclub recording. The pianist, Gary Peacock (bass) 
and Paul Motian (drums) romp with elan through "You Don't Know What Love Is," 
outfitted with a Spanish-tinged vamp, the natty Jaki Byard be-bop blues, 
"Chandra," and "Bye Bye Blackbird," where the pianist is, as Ellington might 
say, excruciatingly ecstatic. 
</P>
<P>
 HANK JONES, "Upon Reflection," (Verve). Here pianist Jones explores tunes by 
his younger brother, the late Thad, with sibling drummer Elvin on board -- 
resulting in jazz at its elegant best. Aided by bass master George Mraz, 
pianist Jones is sublime as he offers renditions of "A Child Is Born," "Mean 
What You Say" and others that are simply mesmerizing.  
</P>
<P>
 CHARLES LLOYD, CEDAR WALTON, DAVID WILLIAMS, BILLY HIGGINS, "Acoustic Masters 
I," (Atlantic). An ingenious idea places the saxophonist Charles Lloyd in front 
of the rock-solid yet often fiery trio of Cedar Walton (piano), David Williams 
(bass) and Billy Higgins (drums). Lloyd's a rhythmic dynamo here, swinging on 
tunes like "Sweet Georgia Bright" and "Hommage."  
</P>
<P>
 DAVID SANCHEZ, "The Departure," (Columbia). With his bold, captivating sound 
and exotic, affecting improvisational style, saxophonist Sanchez presents an 
auspicious initial release. Succulent mixed-tempo versions of "Woody N' You" 
and "Cara de Payaso" are original in flavor, and show Sanchez to be a genuine 
storyteller. Trumpeter Tom Harrell and pianist Danilo Perez assist.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; JACKSON TALKS DOWN TO WILTERN AUDIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Poor Joe Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 The dapper Englishman wants to be taken seriously as a real musician and 
composer, not just a pop star.But early in his show at the Wiltern Theatre on 
Wednesday, as Jackson began a solo piano version of "Nocturne No. 4" from his 
ambitious new semi-classical "Night Music" album, some guy in the audience 
shouted out for "Nineteen Forever" -- a Jackson song that is, appropriately, a 
paean to arrested development. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a Holiday Inn outside of town with a really good band that takes 
requests," Jackson said later in response to more shouts for favorites.  
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't so much talking back to the audience as talking down to them. 
Jackson did the same thing musically, too: The hits were either radically 
rearranged for Jackson and his versatile three-piece combo or sloughed off in 
medleys. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the new album's wee-hours impressions were spread throughout the 
show rather than performed in a block, which would have served them better. You 
got the feeling that Jackson believes his "serious" music is just too good for 
the masses. 
</P>
<P>
 In earthy contrast was opening act the Murmurs -- two young guitar-strumming 
women who were engagingly loopy both in appearance (wildly dyed hair, shiny 
vinyl trousers) and manner. Heather Grody and Leisha Hailey's chatty, 
between-song streams of consciousness offset the aggressive earnestness of 
their alternafolk songs and won over the wary audience with sheer, goofy charm.

THEATER REVIEW; SOUTH COAST'S 'POSADA': WARM, BUT ROUGH AROUND THE EDGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At this stage of its development, "La Posada Magica," which had its premiere 
Wednesday night at South Coast Repertory, is a sweet, earnest, gentle Yuletide 
show that preaches love, faith and hope with a Latino flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 SCR's Second Stage production, festooned with holiday lanterns and colorful 
decorations, glows like a Christmas ornament. Played as simple street theater, 
it's directed by Jose Cruz Gonzalez to look as though a community troupe has 
arrived on a flatbed truck eager to entertain the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 But while "Posada" has the warmth of Latino folklore -- and a wonderful guitar 
ensemble to lend musical charm -- the play itself is a work-in-progress: short 
on drama, long on narrative and laced with doggerel. 
</P>
<P>
 Octavio Solis, who wrote the original script, has said the play "requires a 
childlike imagination to buy into." He's right. "Posada" takes the format of a 
children's show largely aimed at the middle-school set. Unless you're between 
the ages of 9 and 12, your attention is liable to wander. 
</P>
<P>
 The story centers on Gracie (Ruth Livier), an unhappy teen-ager who has lost 
her faith in God. She lit "all the right candles" and said "all the right 
prayers," but God still let her down. 
</P>
<P>
 Will she regain her faith? The answer arrives with a traditional Las Posadas 
neighborhood procession that comes to her house on Christmas Eve, re-enacting 
Mary and Joseph's search for shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 The trio of musicians -- led by composer Marcos Loya, who also is a dazzling 
guitarist -- plays with gusto and polish. It offers jazzy versions of 
traditional Christmas tunes and a handful of Loya's own songs (performed by the 
cast, lyrics by Solis). 
</P>
<P>
 The show also is spiced with some irreverent touches of humor. Vic Trevino's 
Elvis parody stands out. There's also a running gag about guardian angels and a 
cute bit of business with a walkie-talkie. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news, though, is the lack of dramatic momentum and all that bad verse. 
Most of that is given to Ruben Sierra (Horacio, the narrator and leader of the 
troupe). Fortunately, Sierra is a sturdy pro and sells his lines as well as 
anybody could. But it's a tough sell. ("Out of the darkness like whipped cream 
/ Came a vision as in a dream.") 
</P>
<P>
 Livier's Gracie could be more affecting. She pouts, as she's meant to, but her 
whiny tone wears thin. Portraying Mary, Teresa Velarde supports the company 
with a strong singing voice. Still, her climactic moment is undermined by 
special effects. When her belly lights up, it's a howler. 
</P>
<P>
 Since SCR plans to make "Posada" an annual holiday show to go with "A 
Christmas Carol," Solis has a whole year to make revisions to his dutifully 
didactic script. Meanwhile, the music, the masks and the festive production 
design don't need to be touched. 
</P>

ALBUM REVIEW; VARIOUS ARTISTS, "STOLEN MOMENTS: RED HOT + COOL" ( GRP ) *** 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Stolen Moments" is the hip-hop generation's "Fathers and Sons," as a variety 
of rap and pop stars jam with the jazz players whose music they've absorbed. Of 
the two CDs, the first is tipped decidedly in the pop direction, the second, 
with Branford Marsalis' tribute to John Coltrane and vintage recordings of 
Pharoah Sanders and Alice Coltrane, looks the other way. 
</P>
<P>
 The best numbers jump out from the mundane few. M.C. Solaar and bassist Ron 
Carter (who's crossed over before with A Tribe Called Quest) work up 
heavyweight grooves, while Me'Shell NdegeOcello makes for a tight fit with a 
funky Herbie Hancock. Groove Collection's "Rent Strike" jumps without benefit 
of words while the Watts Prophets, rap's elder statesmen, take a strong 
political stance on their cut with trumpeter Don Cherry. Best all around is 
Digable Plants and Lester Bowie, whose Brass Fantasy recordings have 
infrequently matched the soaring trumpeter with pop material. 
</P>
<P>
 But not everything works. Trumpeter Donald Byrd, one of the most sampled jazz 
men around, finds his work with guitarist Ronny Jordan defaced by lazy-paced 
raps from Guru (Keith Elam) and Natty. The Pharcyde's safe-sex message on "The 
Rubber Song" is buried in laughably crass lyrics. And the disc's sound quality 
is strictly boom-box, fine for the rappers, but demeaning to the 
instrumentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Hip-hop fans may find United Future Organization's rhythmic rehash of "Stolen 
Moments" too slick. But for jazz fans looking for something new, it's a fine 
introduction to the rhythms of the street. BILL KOHLHAASE

'STOLEN MOMENTS' DRAWS TOGETHER JAZZ, HIP-HOP ARTISTS; MUSIC: A FIFTH RED HOT 
RELEASE AIMED AT RAISING AIDS AWARENESS FEATURES UNUSUAL PAIRINGS FROM US3 AND 
JOSHUA REDMAN TO PHAROAH SANDERS AND THE LAST POETS.

 First it was Blue, most recently it was Country and now its Cool. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Hot organization is back with "Stolen Moments: Red Hot + Cool," its 
fifth album to raise money to fight AIDS.This album definitely breaks new 
ground with musical compilations that are as unexpected as they are 
provocative. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider these pairings: Herbie Hancock's mellifluous keyboard tones 
accompanying the soothing voice of Me'Shell NdegeOcello. Joshua Redman offering 
torrid sax lines with hip-hoppers US3. Pharoah Sanders uttering edgy cries on 
top of a straighten-your-spine recitation by one of the Last Poets. 
</P>
<P>
 The album, released in late October on GRP Records, is a melting pot where 
such jazz and hip-hop artists as NdegeOcello, Redman, Branford Marsalis, rapper 
Guru, the Digable Planets, Donald Byrd and Ramsey Lewis come together to 
proffer fresh, original material that has a single cause: AIDS awareness. 
</P>
<P>
 As with previous albums, all services by the musicians on "Stolen Moments" 
were donated. All proceeds from the album will be distributed to organizations 
that promote AIDS education and relief, with special emphasis on aspects of the 
epidemic that tend to be chronically underfunded. "For instance, it's difficult 
to attract corporate donors to programs like needle exchanges, so Red Hot is 
happy to provide funds for those socially problematic but very necessary 
programs," says Brian Hanna, a spokesman for Red Hot.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; GEORGIA'S COLLECTIVE SOUL MAKES VITAL DEBUT AT ROXY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ready for a down-home Bono? Or maybe Eddie Vedder Lite? That was the persona 
suggested by Ed Roland as he led the Georgia band Collective Soul in its L.A. 
debut at the Roxy on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The singer-guitarist conveyed U2's conviction that what happens on his stage 
is real, vital and serious stuff, and he recalled some of Vedder's taut 
intensity, complete with voice of steel and eyes whose pupils roll up and out 
of sight. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Vedder and Pearl Jam, Collective Soul -- whose hit "Shine" earlier this 
year launched its debut album toward the million-sales mark -- is an 
anti-fashion, hard-rocking guitar band that confronts feelings of pain and 
confusion. But instead of anguish or rage, Roland and company respond with a 
message of hope that's couched in vaguely spiritual terms. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Roxy, the quintet opened with a stretch of monolithic, riff-based new 
songs that didn't have much immediate identity. When they dipped into the 
melodic hooks, dynamic contrasts and atmospheric touches of the album's 
material, things picked up considerably, peaking with "Shine." 
</P>
<P>
 That hit's urgency was enhanced by an almost subliminal double-time throb, 
more a pulsing of the air than the sound of an instrument, and its play of 
gentle, reassuring passages against thundering riffs make it both catchy and 
compelling. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a hint of self-importance in Collective Soul's music and manner, along 
with a sense of purpose that could inject some needed substance into mainstream 
rock. 
</P>
<P>
 * Collective Soul and Moist play tonight at the Roxy, 9009 Sunset Blvd., West 
Hollywood, 8 p.m. $8 (benefit for the Pediatric AIDS Foundation). (310)

HOME ENTERTAINMENT; LOW-END CAMCORDERS, HIGH-END FEATURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If a low-cost camcorder is on your shopping list, here are a few tips. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices dropped again this year, so that "low end" now means $400-$600, with 
$500-machines very common. Quality remains surprisingly high, as machines in 
this price range continue to improve. Today's $500-unit is superior to the 
$500-machine of a few years ago, as more features from the top-of-the-line 
models have filtered down and become standard. Low-end models now routinely 
include automatic exposure control, auto-focusing zoom lens and sound-level 
controls. 
</P>
<P>
 The big difference between the low-end and higher-end models ($700 to $1,000) 
is that the more expensive ones offer higher quality parts and features that 
make shooting and playback easier. 
</P>
<P>
 Some low-cost units now provide better close-up capabilities than in the past. 
Often you still get a 6:1 lens, but you can find camcorders with a better 8:1 
lens for under $500. Two years ago, it was hard to find such machines for even 
$700. 
</P>
<P>
 When choosing a format (VHS, VHS-C or 8mm), consider which features are more 
suitable for you or whomever you're buying for. 
</P>
<P>
 You're more likely to find bargain prices in the most popular format -- 8mm. 
There's no significant difference in picture quality provided by the formats at 
the low end -- no matter what the salesmen tell you. But if sound is crucial, 
go for an 8mm unit, since they have better sound than the basic models in the 
other formats.  
</P>
<P>
 If size is a prime consideration, the compacts -- 8mm and VHS-C, weighing in 
at two to three pounds -- might be preferable. If you have big hands, however, 
using these small machines can be awkward. A five- or six-pound, full-size VHS 
model may be more comfortable for a large person. 
</P>
<P>
 If playback convenience is important, the full-sized VHS may be your best bet. 
You can play the finished tape in a standard VCR without an adapter (as 
required for the compact VHS-C) and without hooking the camcorder directly to 
the TV (as required with the 8mm camcorder). Also, the full-sized VHS units can 
use standard VHS tapes, which are the least expensive.  
</P>
<P>
 In the lower-price range, don't be swayed by claims that one model is far 
superior to another when shooting in dim light. No low-end units really shoot 
well in such circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 At the low end, you won't find a camcorder with the mini-TV viewfinder, like 
the Sharp models that are frequently advertised on TV. It will take a few years 
for that feature to be available on low-end units. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding brands: In a survey of experts, many recommended RCA's low-end 
camcorders in general and singled out Sony in the 8mm format and Panasonic in 
VHS-C. Many mentioned General Electric's CG818, an 8mm machine, and RCA's 
CC188, in the VHS-C format, as great buys. You can find both for under $500. 
What's New On Video 
</P>
<P>
 "Blown Away" (MGM/UA): In this action-thriller, Tommy Lee Jones plays a 
revenge-crazed Irish terrorist who escapes from a Northern Ireland prison and 
uses his explosives expertise to torment a former friend (Jeff Bridges) who's 
working on the Boston police's bomb squad. Despite a few exciting sequences and 
Jones' enjoyably over-the-top performance, it's still basically a "Cape Fear" 
clone that rarely rises above the routine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baby's Day Out" (FoxVideo): Anyone over 10 will probably think this is an 
insufferably stupid slapstick flick. It's the preposterous adventures of a 
9-month-old Chicago boy who escapes his kidnapers and crawls in and out of 
hair-raising situations. It stars Lara Flynn Boyle as one of the toddler's rich 
parents and Joe Mantegna as one of the kidnapers. A version of the 
wealthy-kid-in-peril, "Home Alone" formula, produced and co-written by John 
("Home Alone") Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I Love Trouble" (Touchstone): Trashed by critics and a box-office 
disappointment last summer, this resembles those romantic comedy/mysteries that 
were big in the '60s. Nick Nolte and Julia Roberts play rival Chicago reporters 
chasing the same story. While they're getting in and out of trouble and 
constantly needling each other, romance blooms -- naturally. Because of the 
sub-par script and the glaring lack of chemistry between stars, it's mild 
entertainment at best. Special Interest 
</P>
<P>
 According to several fitness experts, one of the best stomach exercise tapes 
on the market is "Tamilee Webb's Abs Abs Abs, " which offers effective workouts 
for both beginners and the super-fit. The routine for beginners, they said, is 
especially sound. For $20 from A*Vision, (212) 275-2900. . . . Anyone who likes 
to watch puppies romping and frolicking will get a kick out of "Puppy Love," 
which is simply 35 minutes worth of puppies -- of all breeds -- at play. It's 
the ultimate feel-good tape. For $10 from ABC, (800) CALL-ABC.

HOME ENTERTAINMENT; BEAUTIFUL MORNING FOR 'OKLAHOMA!' LASER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA SALTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oh, what a beautiful laser disc! 
</P>
<P>
 Fox Video/Image's new Todd-AO edition ($60) of Rodgers & Hammerstein's classic 
musical "Oklahoma!" is an eye-opener. The difference between this latest 
release and the 1990 laser release is the difference between the two versions 
of the film that director Fred Zinnemann shot for the 1955 release -- one in 
Todd-AO and one in Cinemascope. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the credits aren't the same, and the dramatic differences don't stop 
there. When Gordon MacRae as Curly rides through that rich green meadow in 
Todd-AO, the corn really is as high as an elephant's eye and it looks like the 
blue, blue sky is coming right down to meet it. In Cinemascope, the corn seems 
a little thinner and shorter, maybe reaching only as high as Curly's horse's 
lower eyelash, and the sky looks a lot paler. 
</P>
<P>
 Zinnemann doesn't seem to know he is directing a Great Broadway Musical. The 
result is a well-staged drama that just happens to have great songs in it. 
Since he shot the Todd-AO version and then pretty much went through the motions 
with the more familiar Cinemascope edition (he apparently wasn't too happy that 
he was being asked to shoot two films for the price of one), it is this new 
version that has the snap and crackle of good cinema. 
</P>
<P>
 The historic ballet within the film, choreographed by Agnes de Mille, is 
beautifully done and has never been so alluring, frightening, foreboding or 
achingly tender. Shirley Jones, in her motion picture debut, never looked as 
fresh-faced as she does in the Todd-AO version. MacRae was still in good voice 
and physical condition and seems perfectly natural as a civilized cowpoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Every performance -- from Gloria Grahame's sly Ado Annie to Gene Nelson's 
stalwart Will Parker and Rod Steiger's evil Jud Fry to Eddie Albert's conniving 
peddler -- sparkles. And all of the sound is fully captured in the THX laser 
sound. The laser was mastered directly from the 65mm film negative, and it 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox/Image also gives Joshua Logan's production of Rodgers & Hammerstein's 
"South Pacific" its due in Todd-AO and THX ($60), but the 1958 film lacks the 
zest and joy of the Zinnemann-directed "Oklahoma!" 
</P>
<P>
 There can be no complaint about the transfer -- it's crisp and rich with 
full-bodied sound. But for reasons only known to them, Logan and 
cinematographer Leon Shamroy decided to wash every song in filters trying to 
capture in color the mood of each one. It's a disaster. The telegraphing of the 
emotion becomes cloying, overdone and unnecessary, even in the exotic "Bali 
Hai." 
</P>
<P>
 Hard as stars Mitzi Gaynor and Rossano Brazzi try, they are not Mary Martin 
and Ezio Pinza meeting on "Some Enchanted Evening." The best efforts of Ray 
Walston, Juanita Hall, France Nuyen and John Kerr and the classic Rodgers & 
Hammerstein songs can't save Logan's folly. 
</P>
<P>
 For Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers fans, one of the most awaited laser packages in 
years is Image's "The Fred Astaire & Ginger Rogers Collection" ($125). Four of 
everyone's favorite dancing team's memorable efforts have been newly remastered 
for this boxed set: "Top Hat," "The Gay Divorcee," "Follow the Fleet" and 
"Shall We Dance." Unfortunately, there are still enough blips spotted 
throughout the eight sides to be distracting, and the flaws can be readily 
spotted in almost any freeze-frame. 
</P>
<P>
 It's great fun to be able to freeze-frame every step the incomparable Rogers 
and Astaire take as they romp through enough numbers to remind you why you are 
sitting through some of the dumbest plots and character acting in film history. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the highlights, all noted in chapter indexes: From Irving Berlin's 1935 
"Top Hat": the title number, "Isn't This a Lovely Day (to Be Caught in the 
Rain)?" and "Cheek to Cheek." From 1934's "The Gay Divorcee": "The Continental" 
and Cole Porter's "Night and Day." From 1936's "Follow the Fleet," Berlin's 
"Let's Face the Music and Dance," "Let Yourself Go" and "I'm Putting All My 
Eggs in One Basket." "Shall We Dance," Astaire & Rogers' first film 
collaboration with the Gershwins, has none less than "They Can't Take That Away 
From Me," "They All Laughed," "Let's Call the Whole Thing Off" and the terrific 
title tune.

THEATER BEAT: 'CHRISTMAS TALES' IS NO 'MIRACLE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of this theater season's neediest cases is "Twice Told Christmas Tales," 
Judy Soo Hoo's comic fantasy at East West Players. It's in dire need of a 
reason for being. 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to forgive some rough edges in a new play. But "Twice Told" is so 
haphazardly written and staged, you wonder whether the creators succumbed to a 
bad case of holiday rush. 
</P>
<P>
 The plot follows Sam (Shaun Shimoda), a Salvation Army Santa Claus estranged 
from his wife and kids. For reasons that never become clear, he is chosen by a 
would-be angel (Consuelo Aduviso) to spread the message of Christmas -- on 
daytime talk shows, no less. In the meantime, Sam befriends a precocious little 
girl named Dorothy (Alex) whose well-meaning but misguided mother (C. Souza Ma) 
forbids her to believe in Santa Claus. 
</P>
<P>
 The dual plot strands are of course reminiscent of the films "It's a Wonderful 
Life" and "Miracle on 34th Street," though there is virtually no acknowledgment 
of either source in the play or program. Torn between two narratives, Soo Hoo 
burdens the text with plot twists that go nowhere and colorful street people 
who endlessly digress. 
</P>
<P>
 The cast includes some fine performers -- Irma Escamillais especially 
memorable as a grandma with the spirit and wardrobe of a '60s activist -- but 
their efforts are sabotaged by the mawkish writing and Betty Muramoto's 
snail-paced direction. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Sam is finally allowed to broadcast a rambling bit of Christmas 
uplift on a sleazy call-in radio show, the viewer's faith in the playwright 
roughly equals Dorothy's faith in Santa Claus. 
</P>
<P>

THEATER BEAT: 'EMMETT TILL' TELLS OF A FAILING MARRIAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Emmett Till," Brian Burrell'sone-act at Theatre/Theater in Hollywood, has 
nothing to do with the real Emmett Till, the black youth whose murder became a 
cause celebre during the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 Burrell's play instead details the nasty marital breakup of Devon Moore 
(Darrow Igus), a world-weary black sitcom writer, and his rotund white wife and 
co-writer, Madeline (Royce Herron).The producers characterize it as a "brutally 
tragic comedy" in the manner of Edward Albee's "Who's Afraid of Virginia 
Woolf?" 
</P>
<P>
 It's certainly brutal. In front of a group of nonplussed colleagues at his 
house, Devon criticizes Madeline as fat and overbearing and compares her to a 
cow. Madeline responds by mocking Devon's guests and suggesting that he married 
her to advance his career. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's difficult to be much moved by Burrell's play, partly because the 
Moores' situation seems so far-fetched and partly because they fight so 
viciously and relentlessly that they seem inhuman. Director Sean Fenton further 
dulls the impact by staging the show with a laugh track, as if it were a sitcom 
taped before a live audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the bill is "H.I.V. Jokes," a brief curtain-raiser about a man who 
deals with his son's having AIDS by cracking homophobic jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Emmett Till," Theatre/Theater, 1713 Cahuenga Blvd., Hollywood. 
Fridays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m. Ends Jan. 29. $10. (213) 850-6941.

THEATER BEAT: 'HAND' MIXES SPIRITUALITY, IMPULSIVENESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By F. KATHLEEN FOLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Scenes From a Broken Hand," Andrew C. Ordover's expressionistic drama, is a 
sort of New Age "On the Road" that mingles an inchoate spirituality with the 
throbbing impulsiveness of its Beat predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
 A veritable primer in semiotics, Ordover's saga concerns two youths, Mordecai 
and Jim, who embark on a cross-country odyssey in search of "signs" to explain 
the recent murders of Mordecai's parents, civil rights activists slain in the 
line of duty. During his obsessive quest, the bereaved Mordecai (Mike 
Borrelli), a flighty, sardonic young man, becomes progressively more vulnerable 
and volatile. Mordecai feels that he is coming into his godhead. His more 
pragmatic pal Jim (Douglas Fields), an upwardly mobile African American law 
student who is only along because of a sense of loyalty to Mordecai, suspects 
quite the contrary, that Mordecai is flirting with madness. 
</P>
<P>
 During the course of their journey, Mordecai and Jim meet up with a succession 
of eccentrics, including a couple of itinerant lesbian folk singers (Laura 
Becker and Abigail Rockwell) and a 'Nam vet turned biker (Albie Selznick) whose 
whimsical Carrollian nonsense masks a pathetically ravaged psyche. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordover's work has obvious flaws. Using the stereotypically polar opposites of 
Mordecai and Jim as his exponents, Ordover is occasionally guilty of writing a 
dialectic -- and a reiterative dialectic at that. 
</P>
<P>
 However, this and other failings are mere ripples on the surface of Ordover's 
dreamlike drama, authoritatively directed by Deborah Calla, who shows a keen 
sensitivity to Ordover's intellectual intent. Selznick particularly impresses 
in this fine cast, which also includes Howard Mungo and Granville Ames.

THEATER BEAT: 'PAQUITO'S CHRISTMAS' KEEPS IT SIMPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By F. KATHLEEN FOLEY

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Paquito's Christmas," a heartfelt musical at the Los Angeles Theatre Center 
downstairs hall, is as choppy and amateurish -- and occasionally as charming -- 
as a home movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Paquito (Jason Guadalajara) has been promised a beautiful toy sailboat for 
Christmas if he gets a good report card.But his father, Paco (Angelo Pagan), is 
forced to renege when he is laid off from his factory job. Paco and Paquito 
quarrel. Paquito runs away. After various adventures, during which Paquito 
befriends a garrulous Jewish widow (Lores Jayne Jacoby), Paquito happily 
reunites with his dad and his mom (Lamar Aguilar), newly cognizant of the 
importance of family and the true meaning of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 That's it in a nutshell -- a somewhat old and hoary chestnut shell. Although 
sometimes sweetly simplistic, the show is more often merely simple-minded. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Luis Avalos also wrote the book and lyrics, which include such 
egregiously memorable lines as: "Whether they stink/Or dress up in mink/It 
always comes down to/They just didn't think," and "I'm betting on you/You're my 
hombre/ Especially when you do the laundry." (Music is by Bobby Rodriguez.) 
</P>
<P>
 Still, points have to be given for intent, if not execution. Despite its 
roughness -- or perhaps because of it -- "Paquito's Christmas" is endearing and 
persistently watchable. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Paquito's Christmas," Los Angeles Theatre Center Theatre 3, 514 S. Spring 
St., Los Angeles. Tonight-Saturday, 8 p.m. ; Saturday-Sunday, 2 p.m. Ends 
Sunday. $8-$15. (213) 485-1681. Running time: 2 hours. F. KATHLEEN FOLEY

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: GIVE THIS CAFE A BIG BIZOU FOR REASONABLE FRENCH FARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. IRENE VIRBILA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When l'addition (French for "the bill") shows up at the new Cafe Bizou in 
Sherman Oaks, you may feel inspired to give someone a bizou or "kiss": Dinner 
for four, including appetizer, soup or salad, entree and dessert for under $75? 
Sacre bleu!  
</P>
<P>
 Chef Neil Rogers and maitre d' Philippe Gris, who virtually ran the show for 
the past six years at Cafe Katsu (renamed Cafe Neil in June), have gone out on 
their own at this storefront cafe and are determined to offer good French 
cooking at bargain prices.  
</P>
<P>
 The hard-working young partners have obviously opened the modest 45-seat 
restaurant on a shoestring. But they haven't stinted a bit on the warm, 
considerate service or the heartfelt cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 Habitues of Cafe Katsu should be happy to find Rogers' signature dishes on the 
other side of the hill at much lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Start with his stuffed mushrooms in balsamic sauce or the rich lobster and 
salmon ravioli. Order any entree -- sauteed sesame-seed salmon with potato 
pancakes and mushrooms, roasted monkfish with shrimp and saffron risotto or 
cracked black pepper steak with veal jus and mashed potatoes -- and a dollar 
more buys either soup or salad. He also has been offering an occasional 
special; whole Maine lobster with black linguine has sold out every night -- 
small wonder at $15.95. 
</P>
<P>
 Wine lovers take note: The cafe has as yet no wine and beer license, which 
means the only way to drink wine is to bring your own. You'll have to open it 
yourself and pour it yourself -- but there's no corkage fee, a policy the 
partners intend to continue once they do get their license. Time to dust off a 
few of those bottles tucked away in your closet or under the bed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cafe Bizou, 14418 Ventura Blvd., Sherman Oaks , (818) 788-3536. Open seven 
nights a week for dinner, Monday through Saturday for lunch. Major credit cards 
accepted. Parking on the street. No alcohol served. Appetizers $4-$7.75; 
entrees $9.95-$14.95; lunch items $6.50-$7.95. S. IRENE VIRBILA

RESTAURANT NOTES: HERE'S A SECRET ABOUT CONCIERGES' CLOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHIE JENKINS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's this old notion that you have to be a powerful agent or a studio chief 
to get a reservation at a decent hour at a dozen or so Hollywood-heavy hot 
spots. And concierges at certain hotels allegedly are never turned down when 
requesting tables at a prime time. The rest of us, however, are at the mercy of 
the owner or worse, a temperamental maitre 'd. 
</P>
<P>
 The hot restaurant hype is so heavy that Conde Nast Traveler recently put up a 
writer for one night at each of four different L.A. hotels to test and compare 
concierge clout. Each night, the concierge was asked to book reservations at 
several top restaurants during peak dining hours. The writer was floored when 
one concierge booked her into Mortons on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems no one ever writes about Monday night at Mortons without mentioning 
the crowds of table-hopping insiders, and how impossible it is for non-celeb 
types to get a table. But the reality is: If you want dinner at Mortons on 
Monday, it's yours. I know. I called on a recent Friday at 4 p.m. and made a 
reservation for the following Monday night in the name of Robinson and was 
given a choice of dining at 7:30 or 8:30. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, if you had wanted to eat out that Friday, you could have called at 4 
that afternoon and gotten a reservation for two in any popular restaurant in 
town. After calling Mortons, I tried 25 other places, including Drai's, 
Eclipse, Patina, Pinot Bistro, the Ivy, Campanile, Citrus, Matsuhisa, Parkway 
Grill, Locanda Veneta, Toscana, Cicada and all of Wolfgang Puck's restaurants.  
</P>
<P>
 True, some places were not prepared to feed us at 8. Citrus, Shiro, Drai's and 
Le Chardonnay had nothing until 9:30. Matsuhisa could accommodate me at 6:30 or 
I could, "walk in and sit at the sushi bar." Spago and Chinois wanted me to 
wait until 10 -- which, granted, is almost the same as a brush-off. Eclipse 
could "fit me in" at 8:45. 
</P>
<P>
 Then a former maitre 'd, who has worked at some of the hippest spots, spilled 
the beans and suddenly everything made sense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to make people think I was doing them a favor," he said. "The real 
trick is to make everyone think everyone else has been excluded and if you are 
real good at it, nobody catches on. 
</P>
<P>
 "But everybody gets in." 
</P>
<P>

 Spice of Life: Just a few weeks ago, David Slatkin was cooking his spicy 
Caribbean cuisine at Descanso in the South Bay. Descanso's owners, however, 
wanted to take the food in a different direction, so owners and chef parted 
ways. Slatkin, who hasn't given up on his style of cuisine, is now negotiating 
to open his own place on Melrose in Hollywood. He hopes to have the 80-seat 
restaurant open by February and already has a name: Spice Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be very exotic," Slatkin says, "a mixture of everything I've 
learned, flavors from California, Hawaii, the Caribbean." 
</P>
<P>
 Slatkin also added that there were no hard feelings when he left Descanso. "I 
got a handshake and a nice letter of recommendation. They are fine 
restaurateurs and hopefully someday I'll have five restaurants of my own." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Sweet Charity: There's no such thing as a free lunch, but breakfast is another 
matter entirely. The Daily Grill chain now provides local charities with a 
meeting place and continental breakfast free of charge at many of its 
restaurants. Participating locations include Brentwood, Los Angeles, Newport 
Beach, Encino, Studio City and Palm Desert.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; DREAMS OF THE COUNTRY AT WEST HOLLYWOOD BAIT SHOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A couple of years ago, I visited Alabama with high hopes for finding good 
Southern barbecue and country ham. A friend and I asked everyone we met where 
to eat these specialties. We were directed to a backwoods hideaway " 'bout 10 
miles to the lake turnoff, then another six, seven miles, just past the power 
station, little spur to your right . . . etc." We drove in and out of fields 
and woods, through a town with ruined mansions, past general stores and 
homesteads. We drove until there was nothing but kudzu and the two-lane 
blacktop dipping like a sea serpent before us and behind us. 
</P>
<P>
 Amazingly, with only one backtrack, we found the place, an ugly brown stucco 
building in a red mud parking lot. Inside were wobbly tables and chairs with 
ripped vinyl cushions. Half the letters had fallen off the menu mounted behind 
a grimy refrigerator. On weekends, the place no doubt hopped. That day, a 
gospel station played on the radio. A large woman struggled to her feet to take 
our order. We ordered a chopped barbecue sandwich, a country ham biscuit and 
tumblers of headache-sweet ice tea. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd lived in the South before and some of my most memorable meals emerged from 
just such surroundings. But the barbecue was dull and not warmed through; cole 
slaw was bound with Miracle Whip; ham and biscuit both had a bad chemical 
taste. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, one need not noodle around back-roads in the Deep South for such an 
authentic American dining experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Located in the former Fabula site in West Hollywood, the Bait Shop has the 
great, roomy, low-budget look of a contemporary backwoods country cafe -- 
red-and-white checkered oilcloth on the tables. Drinks come in screw-top jars, 
coffee in heavy-walled mugs. The decorative theme is fishing: Exterior walls 
are bumpered in old tires. Inside, pillars are wrapped in rope, black nets 
garland beams, pilings cluster in the corners. On the wall are ocean maps and 
fishing rods, and displayed in the glass counter by the register is a colorful 
collection of plastic wiggly worms. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu looks at first to be a sportfishing magazine and opening it, I think 
I've gone to some kind of juke joint/soul food heaven: fried oysters, seafood 
gumbo, soft-shell crabs, catfish, pan-fried chicken (a house specialty), 
country ham, beignets.  
</P>
<P>
 When the food starts arriving, however, I get that old oh darn feeling: Fried 
oysters are delicious, but seafood okra gumbo has that muddy fishiness peculiar 
to boiled catfish -- and no okra. Plump sweet shrimp are blackened with their 
shells on: tasty, but a mess to eat. The only hint of clams in clam fritters is 
a resilient bounciness. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pan-fried chicken is a greasy bust, and soft-shell crabs are in a cornmeal 
breading so salty it is almost inedible. Deep-fried catfish is also greasy, the 
fish muddy without any redeeming sweetness. So called "country" ham here is 
pink, soft, "regular" ham and bears no resemblance to the insanely flavorful 
meat that put Smithfield, Va., on the map. A few side dishes are good -- 
collards steamed with bacon, and well-spiced black-eyed peas -- but most have 
spent too long in the steam table, and a few are misconceived, like red beans 
and rice heavily dosed with thyme and baby-sized carrots steeped in honey. 
</P>
<P>
 At breakfast, beignets look as if they've been made by someone who has never 
ever seen a beignet: like weird-looking roots, like ginseng. And they're way 
too greasy. Battered fried green tomatoes are good with eggs, but biscuits 
taste as if they've been made with sawdust and glue. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the only dish that this fledgling restaurant offers that makes it 
worth a trip is the upside-down pancake with peaches, apples or blackberries. 
Go for the blackberry version: Buttery, crusty on the outside, cakey and full 
of berries within, it's a knock out. 
</P>
<P>
 I could really like this place -- the decor's a hoot, the service is pleasant, 
the menu reads like a dream-come-true, and prices are gloriously low. All it 
needs is a good cook. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Bait Shop, 7953 Santa Monica Blvd., West Hollywood, (213) 654-2295. Open 
seven days for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Full bar. Major credit cards 
accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $24-$56.

THEATER REVIEWS; CAST CONSTRUCTS A LIVELY 'WHOREHOUSE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas" is such a simplistic and exuberant 
little musical saga that it sort of survives on its own impetus, like a toy 
bird that drinks forever out of a water glass. 
</P>
<P>
 Its plot -- about a long-established country bordello pushed into the national 
spotlight -- is slight. All a director can do is give it driving tempos and 
fill it with as much pepper as you'd stir into a pot of Tex-Mex chili. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's exactly what director Phyllis B. Gitlin has done with this brash 
production at the Garden Grove Community Theatre. It's an in-your-face, 
foot-tappin' staging that takes advantage of the primary colors and the 
stereotypical Texans it exploits. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Goff's energetic musical direction and Kysa Cohen's by-the-numbers 
choreography fit the show like a glove, and a hyper cast has a good idea of the 
cut-and-dash required to bring the shenanigans to life. 
</P>
<P>
 Gitlin has cast the show impeccably. The supporting actors include many good 
singers who, along with the lead dancers, have a ball with the lively score. 
</P>
<P>
 The two leads couldn't be better. Cara Corren has a firm grasp of the feisty 
and savvy Mona, the madam from Amarillo who started out as a working girl and 
has maintained the high class of the Chicken Ranch. The strongest performance, 
though, is Ric Watson's good ol' boy Sheriff Ed Earl Dodd, Mona's special 
customer and protector. Watson knows his Texas lawman, from the heel-and-toe 
skip that punctuates his comfortable cussin' to the tender heart hidden beneath 
the cowhide veneer. Watson gives the production the solid base it needs to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 John M. Duerler's flashy TV do-gooder "Watch Dog" is over the top, but no more 
than most real TV do-gooders are, and he's funny. Patricia Miller's bordello 
housekeeper also is very strong, and her "Twenty-Four Hours of Lovin' " is a 
high point. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chicken Ranch girls all are attractive, and their ensemble vocal sound is 
excellent. Alice Williams is particularly effective as Shy, just off the bus 
and ready for her first tour of duty. 
</P>
<P>
 The direction shows how impressively a large show can be staged in a very 
small space -- and what a little heat can do for a musical that doesn't have 
much fire of its own.

TV REVIEW; MTV'S 'YEAR' LOOKS AT COBAIN, WOODSTOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This year in rock, by most media accounts, pretty much consisted of Kurt 
Cobain going to his grave, Elvis Presley rolling over in his grave, Trent 
Reznor wishing he were dead and the kicking of a dead horse at Woodstock II. 
</P>
<P>
 MTV focuses on Cobain, Reznor and Woodstock (stock having been the operative 
word there) in the 1994 edition of "The Year in Rock," eulogizing the late 
Nirvana leader at greatest length but stopping just short of wistfully 
proclaiming the day the music died. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike past years, the wrap-up gives only a brief nod to the woolly world of 
gangstas in trouble, quickly summarizing Tupac Shakur's legal run-ins, for 
example, with a map outlining his four-city "national courtroom tour." 
Congressional hearings instigated by a black women's caucus on the ill effects 
of violent rap are represented mainly by Dr. Dre's defense, as he tests the 
waters, perhaps, for a political career of his own: "The only thing they're 
trying to do is take away jobs. This is our job." 
</P>
<P>
 Non-music news that overlaps on MTV's demographics is given a breezy 
once-over, from A.C. Cowlings boogying with porn stars to school prayer issues 
to the Bobbitts to co-host Tabitha Soren's incongruous but tenable apologia for 
the Clinton Administration. Soren takes the position that a hostile media have 
brushed over Clinton's pushing through more substantial legislation than 
several preceding Presidents combined and she believes in this so much that she 
respectfully waits till the end credits to reprise her part in the 
"boxers-or-briefs" scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 The hour passes so quickly that individual artists rarely get much due, though 
the vigilant MTV editors work in at least subliminal glimpses of most of the 
relevant newcomers. Non-Woodstockians may feel that a bit too much time is 
devoted to justifying how the network bought rights to Woodstock coverage, 
though the Kurt 'n' Trent segs are duly illuminating. 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, Soren and Kurt Loder seem to be trying to compensate for any 
perceived lack of chemistry with a markedly Howard Hawksian kind of rapid-fire 
banter. You watching, Dan and Connie? 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Year in Rock" airs at 7 tonight on MTV, with repeat showings Saturday

CLUB SCENE: CLOSE-KNIT AND CASUAL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 To say this is a family bar would be an understatement. This is a place where 
the regulars welcome you as if you're a long-lost relative. By the end of the 
night, not only will you know their names, you'll know where they live, their 
Social Security numbers, mothers' maiden names. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 THE SCENE: The place is small, with booths on the left, tables in the middle 
and the bar to the right. A game area is in the front, with one pool table, two 
dartboards, a pinball machine and several video games. Two TV sets hang on 
either end of the bar area and a small stage sits at the far end of the room. 
</P>
<P>
 THE CROWD: Strictly an after-work, blue-collar crowd, meaning lots of jeans, 
flannel, sweat shirts and T-shirts. Although you'd only need two hands to count 
the number of people this particular Wednesday, the group was lively in its 
conversations at the bar, as well as enthusiastic about the live entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 MUSIC: A jukebox is available to fill in the lulls between the live 
entertainment ranging from blues to rock. Karaoke is featured Tuesdays and 
Sundays, live bands Thursdays to Saturdays. Wednesday nights belong to 
bluesy-folk singer/musician Mary White. She is a favorite among the regulars, 
who often request her original tunes. 
</P>
<P>
 THE GOOD: Tom Baetz, 43, has been a regular for eight years. "This is an oasis 
for me after a long day of working for the state," said the Van Nuys resident. 
"I can come here and feel like it's home. It's my 'Cheers,' but don't you dare 
say I'm Norman." 
</P>
<P>
 THE BAD: The dance floor, if that's what it is, has room for maybe five 
couples if they're willing to keep their movements to a minimum. Also, there's 
only one pool table. 
</P>
<P>
 THE WORD: "I used to like that song until I heard someone do it on karaoke 
night," said a patron at the bar.  
</P>
<P>
 McRed's Cocktail Lounge, 13235 Victory Blvd., Van Nuys. Open 8 a.m. to 2 a.m. 
daily. No cover. (818) 980-2845. CHERIE SAUNDERS

VAN BUREN'S WIFE SERVES TIME OF OWN; AFTERMATH: SOFTBALL PITCHER FROM NEWBURY 
PARK PUT DIVISION I ON HOLD UNTIL HER HUSBAND COMPLETED JAIL SENTENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In today's early hours, just barely after midnight, the waiting game played by 
Marcie Van Buren ended and she started the Rest of Her Life. 
</P>
<P>
 If things had been normal, the gifted softball pitcher from Moorpark College 
would be enrolled at an NCAA Division I university readying for the start of 
the 1995 season. Instead, Van Buren put her college plans on hold and existed 
in a self-imposed suburban limbo. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren, whose maiden name was Marcie James, chose to live in her parents' 
Newbury Park home with her 2-year-old daughter and wait for her husband, 
Leodes, to be released from jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Leodes Van Buren -- himself a star Newbury Park High athlete -- was scheduled 
to be freed this morning after serving four months in Ventura County jail for 
firing a gunshot through the back door of Marcie's home last April. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back in August (when her husband was sentenced) I felt like this day was 
never going to come," Marcie said. "It feels so good. But I'm kind of nervous 
because all eyes are going to be on Leodes and with me being his wife . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 She lets the sentence hang in the air for a moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm excited." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A new life awaits. Dreams of college and a future together can finally be 
hammered into reality. 
</P>
<P>
 After spending more than eight months embroiled with the fallout from the 
shooting, Marcie, 20, spent Thursday packing. 
</P>
<P>
 She and Leodes' belongings were to go into their car in anticipation of his 
phone call, in the wee hours of the morning, to pick him up from jail. (Such a 
release time is common, a jail spokeswoman said, because a brief morning period 
will count as the final day of the prisoner's sentence.) 
</P>
<P>
 The couple planned to drive to his mother's home in Corona, rent an apartment 
somewhere in Southern California (Marcie wouldn't disclose the location) and 
try to restart their stalled college athletic careers. 
</P>
<P>
 Leodes, 19, earned a football scholarship to Colorado after a record-setting 
high school career at Newbury Park. But the scholarship vanished when Colorado 
denied his admission in August, citing a review of his academic records. It was 
virtually a moot point because he already had been convicted of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Leodes will attempt to play football for a four-year college, Marcie said. 
Leodes could not be reached for comment. Marcie said he would not speak to the 
media until after he was released from jail. But he has spoken with colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're coming to him," she said. "And saying things like, 'It's unfortunate 
what happened to you, but we're looking at your skill in athletics and your 
mind for academics, not your criminal record.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Marcie has college plans of her own. Last season at Moorpark, she was named 
the Western State Conference pitcher of the year and was an all-state 
second-team pick. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she was contacted last spring by Arizona State, Oklahoma and Hampton 
(Va.) College. But she did not make a commitment because of the ongoing legal 
proceedings stemming from the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 She has not played serious softball since, she said, but has remained in 
contact with Arizona, San Diego State and Cal State Northridge. Still, her 
plans depend at least in part on those of her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wants (us) to go to the same school," she said. "But I feel that whatever 
happens, happens. It's a matter of seeing who wants Leodes. We can go to the 
same school or to different schools if they were close enough." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, she simply wants to spend time with her husband -- finally. 
</P>
<P>
 The two became close friends during her freshman year at Newbury Park. When he 
entered the high school two years later, they began dating. They were together 
constantly, "hanging out, riding bikes, playing basketball, whatever," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcie gave birth to their daughter, Andreya, near the end of her senior year. 
But in November, 1993, the two broke up, though Leodes saw Andreya and Marcie 
often. 
</P>
<P>
 After several emotional months, the two became involved in a dispute last 
April 8. After arguing on the telephone, he went to her home, but she would not 
let him in. 
</P>
<P>
 A shot was fired through the back door of Marcie's house. 
</P>
<P>
 Then matters got complicated. Leodes initially admitted he fired the shot, 
then said he had lied to protect a companion who actually pulled the trigger. 
Marcie's subsequent testimony changed, depending on the state of their 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the two soon reconciled because of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "It brought us together," Marcie said. "He realized he made a mistake by 
breaking up with me and we talked about it and we realized we do genuinely care 
for each other, and that we were just going to work it out no matter what 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the tumult, the two planned to marry. And in early July, they decided 
to elope. 
</P>
<P>
 "One day we were sitting there talking about our feelings for each other," 
Marcie said. "And he said, 'Why don't we just get married? I've never been to 
Las Vegas and it'll be fun. We're going to do it anyway. Why not now?' " 
</P>
<P>
 "And I was thinking to myself, 'Well, yeah, I was on the outs with my 
parents,' and he was on the outs with basically everybody in Newbury Park 
because of what happened. And so we were like, 'All right.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The two were married July 8 -- two months after the shooting -- but they hid 
the fact from Marcie's parents, who only learned of the marriage when Marcie 
testified at his trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were hurt because they wanted to give me a big wedding, a church 
wedding, a reception and all this," Marcie said. "But it didn't work out that 
way. And on top of that, you've got Leodes -- who supposedly did this to our 
house. They were like, 'Wow, I can't believe that,' and then they find out 
that's their new son-in-law." 
</P>
<P>
 Leodes was convicted July 29 and sentenced to six months in jail. He and 
Marcie have refused to discuss the shooting since then. 
</P>
<P>
 And though Marcie said her parents, Curtis and Catherine James, are now 
supportive of their daughter's marriage and of Leodes, the months have been 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 She visited Leodes twice each week, the maximum allowed, and spoke to him by 
phone several times a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard," she said last month. "Considering that we used to spend every 
single solitary second together. More than being my husband or the baby's 
father, he's always been there when I've needed him and he probably always will 
be. 
</P>
<P>
 "And he has so much love for that little girl. Even when were broken up he'd 
come over here play with her, bring her clothes and gifts. He disciplines her 
like any good father would, but he loves her I think more than his own life." 
</P>
<P>
 She realizes public perception of her husband is far from the idyllic picture 
she paints. But she shrugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are going to form their opinions of him," she said. "One way or the 
other they're going to think he's violent. All I can say is, don't judge a book 
by his cover." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, she packed. Scattered around her bed were blue plastic trash bags 
crammed with clothes and other belongings. A framed picture of the couple from 
a school dance stood next to a collection of athletic trophies. 
</P>
<P>
 There was much to do. The couple is still arranging to get an apartment -- 
"about an hour or two south of here" -- but first Leodes must arrange for his 
five-year probation agreement to be transferred from Ventura to the county to 
which they move. 
</P>
<P>
 Holiday plans are vague. "We're just going to enjoy being together," she said 
with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 It surely will be a busy time. But before all the hubbub and errands came a 
reunion, one for which Marcie Van Buren has awaited for nearly four months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to sleep tonight," she said Thursday. "Around one or two, he's 
going to call me and say, 'I'm done, come get me' -- he acts like it's no big 
deal but I know differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll take off, throw our stuff in the car and we're out."
