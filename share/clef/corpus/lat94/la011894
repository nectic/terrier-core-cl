TICKET BROKERS AND ROSE BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * We are back home in Wisconsin where the weather is cold, the air is clean, 
the water can be drunk, and people who sign a contract don't swindle their 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 I am a graduate of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. When the Wisconsin 
Badgers beat Michigan State in Tokyo, I booked five Rose Bowl tours for myself, 
my wife, and my three sons, all University of Wisconsin students. 
</P>
<P>
 My family was looking forward to the "trip of a lifetime," a little California 
dreamin' going on around Christmastime. We wanted to see our beloved Badgers 
play your Bruins in the 80th Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 You cannot believe the incredible sadness and disgust my family experienced 
when we were told we had no tickets. We were guaranteed five tickets when we 
left Madison, but had our dreams destroyed by your ticket brokers. 
</P>
<P>
 I paid our $6,000 to bring my family to your city to watch the Rose Bowl. 
Instead I spent the week full of stress and in a search with seedy and 
unethical people to attempt to secure five additional tickets that I had 
already paid for but never received. Finally on Dec. 31, I secured five tickets 
from a broker for the astronomical sum of $2,750. I am not wealthy, but my back 
was against the wall at the eleventh hour, as were about 10,000 Wisconsin fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Scalping tickets is illegal in Wisconsin. Violating a contract is illegal in 
Wisconsin. The way we were treated is disgusting and should be a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Our dream trip was turned into a trip from hell. 
</P>
<P>
 People of Los Angeles, come visit us in Wisconsin some day. You can see our 
beautiful lakes and forests, meet our friendly people, drink our water and 
breathe our clean air.  
</P>
<P>
 But, the most important thing, if we make a deal with you, we'll keep our 
word; we just don't treat people here the way we were treated in your city.

 * This letter is in response to a letter from Lance Keller, general manager of 
Murray's Tickets (Jan. 11). He claims several ticket agencies lost a great deal 
of money on the Rose Bowl. Lost money? Didn't make as much as they'd like is 
closer to the truth. Ticket brokering has been making it impossible to get 
front-row tickets at a reasonable price for years. First they send out dozens, 
sometimes hundreds of employees to various stores where tickets are initially 
sold. Then the ticket agencies resell the monopolized tickets for four times 
the cost of the ticket. Front-row seats can cost even more; only the well-off 
can sit there. In short, maybe it's time for the ticket agencies to be 
regulated.

RECOVERING FROM EARTHQUAKE: NOW THE COMMUTING QUESTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are two immediate priorities as Southern California tries to pick itself 
up from the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 We must get as much relief as possible, as rapidly as possible, to the people 
in need. Food, drinkable water and shelter must be provided to residents of 
those San Fernando Valley neighborhoods hardest hit. 
</P>
<P>
 REPAIRING THE TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE: And efforts to repair the 
region's transportation system must begin immediately. Even those Angelenos who 
got through the awful shaking without much damage to their homes or businesses 
will be sorely tested in the months to come by all this damage: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Santa Monica Freeway. Interstate 10 from Santa Monica to downtown is 
perhaps the busiest freeway in the nation. The worst damage is in the area 
where the freeway crosses over La Cienega Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Golden State Freeway (Interstate 5) and the Antelope Valley 
Freeway/California 14. Both were severely damaged where they intersect in the 
north San Fernando Valley. The collapse of Highway 14 will hamper commuter 
traffic from the Santa Clarita Valley, Palmdale and Lancaster. The collapse 
also has blocked Interstate 5, the main artery between Los Angeles and both the 
San Francisco Bay Area and the Central Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Simi Valley Freeway/California 118. Bridges on this major commuter road 
between Ventura and Los Angeles counties also collapsed. That will slow traffic 
throughout the northern San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The San Diego Freeway (Interstate 405) was closed at two points in the San 
Fernando Valley because the roadway is buckled and at its intersection with 
Route 118. 
</P>
<P>
 In a region so wedded to the automobile, this freeway damage could create 
commuter nightmares of monumental proportions. One alternative that commuters 
may be able to look to is rail service. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SAFETY VALVE OF THE NEW RAIL OPTIONS: Fortunately, last year the region's 
new Metrolink system began to run regular commuter train service from both the 
Simi and Santa Clarita valleys, as well as suburbs to the east. Although there 
is concern that some of the tracks may have been damaged by Monday's temblors, 
they can be repaired more quickly than a freeway can. Officials will want to 
focus on getting all rail lines leading into and out of the region open, and 
getting as many trains running as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the damage this latest earthquake did to the region's transportation 
system, there may be a sliver of silver lining in the cloud hanging over us 
all. Hard to envision just now, of course, but the truth is that if this 
experience gets enough people out of their autos and traveling to work by bus 
or rail, this quake may help put Los Angeles on its way to a more efficient, 
far less vulnerable 21st Century transit system. If people will put the extra 
effort into taking public transit, as they did in the 1984 Olympics, a real 
transportation nightmare may be avoided. Thus transit officials will have to 
respond with their own special effort. 
</P>
<P>
 THE TIMING WAS A GREAT BLESSING: We can thank our lucky stars that the quake 
occurred early in the morning of the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, part of a 
three-day weekend for many people. Because most were asleep when the first 
major jolt occurred, injuries were held down; and because of both the holiday 
and the time of day, roads were not clogged with work-bound traffic. A fearsome 
toll might have occurred in rush-hour traffic on a workday. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this is a reminder of our vulnerability, even with the best-laid plans 
for earthquake preparedness. One seismologist said that quakes such as Monday's 
basically are report cards on California's preparedness for temblors as severe 
as the giant 1857 Tejon quake and San Francisco's in 1906. His assessment was 
that readiness has improved since the 1971 Sylmar quake -- but, alas, is still 
not what it might be.  
</P>
<P>
 NEW QUESTIONS ABOUT ELEVATED FREEWAYS: One giant gap in our preparedness is 
the overall safety of our freeways. A good question can be asked about having 
any elevated roads at all in earthquake zones, in the wake of the damage caused 
by 1989's Loma Prieta quake and by Monday's, in which some elevated freeway 
sections were damaged even after having been rebuilt following a previous 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge earthquake should accelerate efforts to improve the safety of 
freeways -- just as the collapse of an Interstate bridge in Connecticut 
prompted a major highway review in that state in the 1980s. Is the Harbor 
Freeway double-decking project not now worth a long second look? 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the policy questions related to preparedness, there is plenty of room 
for ordinary Southern Californians to take stock of readiness in their own 
homes and workplaces. With so many demands on emergency personnel, having such 
things as the proper equipment for power outages -- flashlights, batteries, 
radios -- and knowing how and when to turn off the gas and the like are 
crucial. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this is a test of the character of each of us. Los Angeles Mayor 
Richard Riordan, in sensibly urging people to stay off the roads Monday and to 
take care of their safety first, pointed out that the people of this region are 
resilient, that they have been through much before. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton's quick response was welcome and reassuring. It's also 
comforting to know that the Federal Emergency Management Agency seems to have 
improved its ability to respond to disasters in the nearly two years since the 
Los Angeles riots, in which the federal agency was widely criticized for 
failing to deliver. Los Angeles can do a lot for itself, but for a while at 
least we're also going to need all the help we can get.

LET'S GET TO THE POINT; ANOTHER DRAWN-OUT KING TRIAL? NOT IF THE CITY CAN HELP 
IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles -- rocked not only by geologic upheavals but also, just 20 months 
ago, by quakes in the civil order -- will be in court soon to defend itself in 
the Rodney King case. This time the issue is the amount of damages to which 
King is entitled under the law. 
</P>
<P>
 At least that ought to be the issue -- that and no other. If the judge hearing 
King's suit against the city sides with the city's helpful proposal to bypass 
what amounts to a top-to-bottom retrial of the case, Los Angeles will be much 
the better for it. 
</P>
<P>
 THE CITY'S PROPOSAL: There is no question that police officers beat King. No 
one quarrels with that -- including the Los Angeles City Council, which voted 
unanimously to acknowledge liability for the excessive and illegal use of force 
by the LAPD members who arrested King after he was stopped for a traffic 
violation on March 3, 1991. In fact the council has asked that the trial 
stemming from King's federal civil suit jump immediately to deciding the amount 
the plaintiff should be paid. 
</P>
<P>
 The growing hope is that the city's wise proposal will hasten the end of this 
most unfortunate and incendiary affair. If U.S. District Judge John G. Davies, 
who is presiding over the trial, agrees with the city's position, a third jury 
need not rehash the traumatic events of March 3, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 King, an African American who was arrested for speeding and evading arrest 
after a wild chase on a freeway and through city streets, initially sought $57 
million -- $1 million for each time he claimed police struck him. That figure 
is absolutely absurd, of course, but he does deserve fair compensation for his 
injuries, emotional distress and lost wages. 
</P>
<P>
 But must the process take forever?  
</P>
<P>
 A proper out-of-court settlement would compensate King both fairly and 
expeditiously; unfortunately, negotiations have failed to close the gap between 
the $9.5 million most recently requested by the plaintiff's lawyer and the 
$1.25 million offered by the city. Is a deal still impossible? 
</P>
<P>
 AN UNNECESSARY REPLAY: Absent an out-of-court settlement, a jury must decide 
how much the city should pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Does that jury need to examine everything that took place on that fateful 
night in Lake View Terrace? No, argue attorneys representing the city: Because 
the council accepts responsibility, a jury need not revisit the vicious beating 
captured in a videotape that wouldshock much of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 If the judge accepts the city's motion, as we hope, he can direct the jury to 
go straight to the damages phase. Los Angeles already has endured two trials 
stemming directly from the King beating. Acquittals in the first trial, a state 
proceeding, touched off riots. Convictions in the second trial, a federal civil 
rights proceeding, produced cheers in many areas of Los Angeles and jeers in 
many others. These divisions need time to heal, and another painful look at 
what the police officers did to King won't speed the process. 
</P>
<P>
 Trials resulting from the 1992 riots, such as the controversial cases of 
Damian M. Williams and others charged in the beating of trucker Reginald O. 
Denny, also have contributed to tensions that will not go away easily. Each new 
trial has forced Los Angeles to once again live through events that clearly and 
deeply traumatized its civic equanimity. 
</P>
<P>
 How many more times must Los Angeles suffer? A jury should decide how much 
King should get, promptly, and that should close the book on that awful night 
in 1991 and the awful days and nights it spawned.

'ENSLAVEMENT' OF THE MIDDLE CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Alexander Cockburn (Column Left, Jan. 6) is misled by his attraction to the 
wrong historical analogy. Imperial China is a better model for understanding 
what's wrong with contemporary America than medieval Europe is. We are not so 
much divided economically into lords and peasants as we are divided socially 
into power classes: coolies, landlords, mandarins and the imperial court. But 
for most of us, the real problem isn't the landlords, it's the mandarins. 
</P>
<P>
 Planners, regulators, facilitators, coordinators, staff aides, commentators, 
experts, and every other imaginable category of trained, professional, 
certified public intellectuals and recognized authorities govern all modern 
"democracies" -- and they govern with an iron hand, under absolute and plenary 
dispensation from the awesome and distant Court of Heaven. 
</P>
<P>
 The Euro-American left will continue to be a marginalized and ridiculous 
political force unless it can somehow learn to see around its Marxist 
spectacles, abandon its false analogies, and rededicate itself to the ancient 
Western ideals of personal liberty and social concord.

 * Cockburn describes the sharply lowered earning power of the middle class 
over the last 30 years, and then presents a class-warfare explanation. He 
ignores another possibility: We have too many people. 
</P>

 In the period Cockburn is describing, America's population and the world's 
nearly doubled. With a finite amount of land providing food and space for an 
increasing number of people, competition for resources increases, causing 
prices to rise and living standards for many to fall. 
</P>
<P>
 It is time for governments and churches the world over to encourage parents to 
have no more than two children. The tax and welfare systems, which both reward 
childbearing, should be changed. Note that a one- or-two-child policy, followed 
for one or two generations, will result in a population drop. If we don't 
encourage birth control now, we will need to require it within 50 years.

THE YEAR 2000

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * As Peter Larsen and Don Edberg correctly observed (Letters, Jan. 9), the 
21st Century and third millennium will begin on Jan. 1, 2001. This is the sort 
of pedantic observation historically informed people trumpet to the masses as 
each new century approaches. 
</P>
<P>
 But let's be practical also. At least 95% of the people are going to find far 
more reason to celebrate changing all four digits of the year (from 1999 to 
2000) than in the mere change of the last digit (from 2000 to 2001). 
</P>
<P>
 In the movies "Cavalcade" (1933), "King's Row" (1942) and "The Time Machine" 
(1960), the 20th Century is considered to have begun on Jan. 1, 1900. Even 
filmmakers know it's safer to be wrong and seem right than to be right and seem 
wrong.

STATE COURT ON PROP. 68

<TEXT>
<P>
 * Tom Hayden is absolutely correct (Column Left, Dec. 30). "An increasingly 
angry public will not be stilled." Politicians, employing technical legalisms, 
have won this round and deprived us of our vote in favor of campaign finance 
reform.It's only business as usual when politicians make themselves look 
ridiculous, but this time the joke also impugns the once-prestigious California 
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the court's reputation for fair-mindedness is the very basis of its 
authority, suddenly the question of money's effect on the judicial process has 
become urgent. Many issues that come before the court have significant economic 
consequences that often reach far beyond the boundaries of the particular case. 
The increasingly angry public is not going to accept submitting to the best 
justice, as well as the best government, that money can buy.

really a mystery? It might be time for another tea party, folks.

PERSPECTIVES ON THE NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE; CROUCHED TOGETHER IN COMMON PRAYER; 
A FAMILY, LIKE THE CITY, COMES TOGETHER AS THE LAND IS SHORN APART, ASKING FOR 
ANOTHER 100 YEARS OF SUNLIGHT.

 The power came on at 1:26 in the afternoon, and then we could see it: the 
broad slabs of the Santa Monica Freeway -- not severed, but sagging massively, 
across a narrowed gap of overpass; 20 miles to the north, the gray cement 
section of Interstate 5 snapped off, trailing its twisted rebar; the frantic 
milling around the wreckage of a shattered apartment building out in 
Northridge. More than 20 dead, hundreds injured. On the television we could see 
it, as the country, as the world had been watching it for hours on CNN. Los 
Angeles, the city that only appears together as it is shorn apart. 
</P>
<P>
 And to us who live here, huddled in our common terror to the sound of bridges 
snapping, freeways rupturing -- feeling the connections pulling closer, tauter, 
even as they are cut adrift. The bed goes leaping, now, across the wood floor 
in the darkness; the dog is skittering and howling, pressing close. The old 
house strains against the root of its foundation. Somewhere down the hall, the 
shattering begins; glass and cupboard doors, then heavier thumps and pounding 
and, suddenly in the dark, the cool shock of a cabbage rolling past my foot. 
</P>
<P>
 And from my tired, shipwrecked family, crouched in the pitching, fragile 
doorway, down on hands and knees inside the darkness, whispering to ourselves a 
common prayer: Come on, mother, let it out, urge it out, let out your terrible 
pressure, let it go and do your worst. Then let us rest and have another 100 
years of sunlit peace again. 
</P>
<P>
 The shaking eases; slowly, we release our tender grip and then survey the sea 
of unlikely wreckage in the flicker of a flashlight: a slender glass lamp that 
survived the fall from a mantelpiece; familiar dishes, joined in heaps upon the 
floor. We move gingerly across a shifting tide of aftershocks, the Earth still 
swaying, across shattered glass and back eventually to bed. What can we do? 
</P>
<P>
 By dawn, things seem quite precious -- a holiday! Rearranging a wave of books 
that block the hallway give us glimpses of words we have not seen in years; 
and, in a dusty closet, a morning spent sorting through old letters from a 
friend. The day begins to pass, so like another. Then calls from home; "No, 
we're all right. No, really. Yes." 
</P>
<P>
 We search for water, jug in hand. People on the street seem lost and strangely 
happy; a neighbor calls out across the street: "Yes, we're OK." And now the 
damage; a chimney hanging by a pipe, a line of telltale cracks creeping up a 
wall of bricks. The side of a building, fallen away to reveal a shelf in 
someone's bedroom, hanging in the sunlight, a candle still upright. 
</P>
<P>
 And the wonder: How could buildings take such a thrashing and still be 
standing? The damage seems, in all, so little in a city still so big. And then 
to learn, in disbelief, the numbers: What, a measly 6.6? 
</P>
<P>
 Then quickly follows a second awful thought: How much is there still out 
there, waiting in the Big One. The One that levels blocks and buildings into 
rubble? The one that brings our families together for an instant, then lets the 
city rest, in sunlit peace another 100 years -- to begin our slow departure 
from each other once again.

BUT WHAT ABOUT MICHELLE KWAN?; WHY PENALIZE THE TORRANCE GIRL? PETITION THE 
OLYMPICS FOR AN EXCEPTION TO ALLOW ALL THREE SKATERS.

<P>
 No matter what happens, Michelle Kwan is Olympic material. She and her family 
deserve gold medals for graciousness and good sportsmanship. 
</P>
<P>
 As the bizarre events unfold, the 13-year-old Torrance figure skater may yet 
strut her triple jumps and double axels on the Olympic ice rink in Lillehammer, 
Norway. But whatever the outcome, why was Kwan asked to step aside? 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, Kwan competed in Detroit, Mich. at the U.S. Figure Skating 
Championships, which served as the Olympic trials. She was the youngest 
competitor there, with the technically most difficult freestyle program. 
</P>
<P>
 First- and second-place winners earn the right to go to the women's skating 
competition at the Winter Olympic Games. Despite a fall during her routine, 
Kwan took second place to Tonya Harding.  
</P>
<P>
 There are only two Olympic berths in women's figure skating this year. 
According to the rules, Harding and Kwan should go to Norway next month.  
</P>
<P>
 But the 45-member international committee of the U.S. Figure Skating Assn. 
asked Kwan to relinquish her rightfully earned spot. They offered Kwan first 
alternate and voted unanimously to offer Kwan's berth to Olympic champion Nancy 
Kerrigan, the bronze-medal winner in the 1992 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 As everyone reading or watching the news knows, Kerrigan, 24, was unable to 
skate in the trials after she was injured by a baton-wielding assailant. 
Arguably, if Kerrigan had competed, Kwan probably would have come in third and 
cheerfully wished Kerrigan and Harding well on their Olympic journey.  
</P>
<P>
 Skating officials justified their decision citing Kerrigan's favored status 
among experts. And Harding, 23, from Portland, Ore., was cause for high medal 
hopes as well. But what guarantee is there? What crystal ball says an uninjured 
Kerrigan would have won first or even second? All it takes is a bad fall, a 
crucial jump deferred or missed, a stumble, a wobble, even the insidious flu 
bug. In the world of competitive sports, as in life, anything can happen. 
</P>
<P>
 So why was Kwan asked to make the sacrifice? Why were Kwan's dreams of Olympic 
competition postponable? Why should she, and not Harding or Kerrigan, be asked 
to wait until the next Olympics? Are Kwan's ambitions less valued? Are they not 
as valid as Kerrigan's dreams? As Harding's dreams? 
</P>
<P>
 In trying to justify the decision, Kwan's youth has often been cited -- 
"she'll see another Olympics." No doubt she will. Kwan is young, intelligent, 
self-possessed and healthy. She'll probably have her day to bask in the glow of 
the Olympic torch, if not this year then in the next Olympic year. But who can 
guarantee it? 
</P>
<P>
 And what about the potential loss to Kwan's financial future, the thousands of 
dollars from possible endorsements she might have garnered, as Kerrigan or 
Harding undoubtedly will if they win the gold?  
</P>
<P>
 Was it easier to defer Kwan because she and her family would make no waves, 
cause no violent protest, lodge no formal complaint? And why couldn't the U.S. 
committee simply petition the International Olympic Committee to expand the 
women's team to include the rightful winners as well as Kerrigan.  
</P>
<P>
 Why penalize Kwan, who did nothing wrong except work hard, skate beautifully 
and make no loud protest. Can winning a medal be more important than fulfilling 
the promise of a young Asian-American girl?

CAPT. COOK'S LEGACY TO THE MODERN WORLD; HAWAII: HIS DISCOVERY LINKED THE 
INHABITED WORLD BUT ALSO OPENED THE DOOR TO WORLDWIDE SIEGE OF NATIVE PEOPLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK WEATHERFORD, Jack Weatherford is a professor of anthropology at 
Macalester College in St. Paul, Minn. His latest book Savages and Civilization: 
Who Will Survive? (Crown Publishers, 1993). 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On this day, Jan. 18, in 1778, Capt. James Cook sailed into the Hawaiian 
Islands, establishing permanent contact between the Hawaiians and the outside 
world. In this, his final voyage of exploration across the Pacific for the 
British navy, Cook contacted the last great nation not yet known to the outside 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook named the islands the Sandwich Islands after the Earl of Sandwich, a 
corrupt Lord of the Admiralty who is better known to us as the inventor of the 
sandwich, which he could eat with one hand while still gambling with the other 
hand. Even though the food still bears his name, the natives of the islands 
refused to give up their ancient and sacred name of Hawai'i. If the modern 
world has a birthday, it should be this day. With the inclusion of Hawaii into 
the world system, virtually all parts of the inhabited world had been united 
into a single system of transportation, communication and trade. That system 
stretched across every ocean, uniting every continent and island chain from the 
Arctic to Antarctica. 
</P>
<P>
 These contacts did not always prove beneficial to the people who made them or 
those upon whom they were thrust. Cook was more of an explorer than a 
conqueror, but he had little sense of the rights of people who were not 
British. On Valentine's Day, 1779, Cook created a skirmish with the Hawaiians 
that resulted in their clubbing him to death on the beach where he had been so 
warmly welcomed a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The real victims of the era, however, turned out to be the Hawaiian people 
themselves. In 1893, a little more than a century after Cook's death, the 
Hawaiian monarchy was overthrown and native Hawaiians became a disenfranchised 
and impoverished minority in their own land, a situation from which they have 
not yet recovered. The population of several hundred thousand at the time of 
Cook's arrival had declined to only 60,000 by 1900. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past two centuries from the time of Capt. Cook, the thin lines of 
international trade grew steadily stronger connecting Europe, America, the 
Pacific, Asia and Africa into a single world system. From a spider web of 
tentative contacts across the seas, the ties became strong ropes that tightly 
bound more and more native people under the yoke of colonialism. 
</P>
<P>
 The natives of the South Pacific from Hawaii to Australia suffered much the 
same fate as the natives of the Americas. In most of these areas the population 
declined by 90% in the first century of contact. They died from new diseases 
and plagues, and they died in conquest. They steadily lost control of their 
land and their resources. The new colonial governments pushed the native people 
deeper into poverty and into the most inaccessible and inhospitable reaches of 
their homelands. Unable to cope with the disease and destruction around them, 
many tribal peoples disappeared from history. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though it has been more than 200 years since Cook's arrival in Hawaii, 
the siege of native people has not yet ended. The Hawaiians still struggle for 
legal recognition of their basic cultural rights. In the South Pacific, the 
Maoris struggle for their treaty rights within New Zealand Society. The 
Tahitians struggle against French use of nearby islands as nuclear testing 
zones, while the Kanaks of New Caledonia struggle for complete independence 
from the particularly ethnocentric rule of the French government. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Americas the struggle for cultural dignity and survival continues on a 
continental scale from Tierra del Fuego to the Yukon. In Canada and the United 
States, native people struggle to protect their treaty rights, while in many 
parts of Latin America, they struggle for mere survival. Over the last 
generation, about 100,000 Mayans have been slaughtered by a series of 
repressive dictators in the mountains in Guatemala. The campaign against the 
indigenous people still continues. 
</P>
<P>
 It is already too late to save the Caribs and Arawaks of the Caribbean or to 
save the aborigines of Tasmania, but we can save those cultures that are still 
here and are now endangered. 
</P>
<P>
 We may be the last generation in the history of the world to have an influence 
over the fate of some of these people. If we do not act to ensure their rights 
to live in their homeland and have a livelihood, some of them such as the Penan 
of Borneo or the Yanomamo of Brazil may disappear forever. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though we cannot undo past injustices, we can be the ones who stop them 
and thereby prevent future ones. The choice belongs to us, and the 
ramifications of that choice will echo forever through the future.

YOUR BODY / KATHLEEN DOHENY: OPEN HOME MEDICAL GUIDE AND SAY 'AHH' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Suddenly, your back hurts in a place you've never noticed. Or a strange rash 
on your neck draws you into that familiar dilemma: Do you spend time and money 
at the doctor's office, or is this something you can fix yourself? 
</P>
<P>
 Home medical guides -- those hefty bibles that clue you in on everything from 
diaper rash to schistosomiasis (a tropical parasitic disease) -- might just 
hold the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Many physicians see a role for such books; some even recommend specific 
titles. The key to their proper use, of course, is knowing when you need simple 
reassurance from a book and when you need professional medical care. In the 
future, thumbing through these guides might become passe, as more consumers 
turn to computerized versions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Survey: In a random polling of area physicians, the guides most often 
mentioned good sources of information were: 
</P>
<P>
 * "Take Care of Yourself" by Drs. Donald Vickery and James Fries. The fifth 
edition, published by Addison-Wesley, is $17.95 and includes easy-to-follow 
flow charts that help the reader decide when it's time to call or visit the 
doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Better Homes and Gardens' New Family Medical Guide," edited by Edwin 
Kiester Jr. and published by the Meredith Corp., sells for $19.95. Chapters are 
organized by organ (lungs, skin) and problems (arthritis and related 
disorders). 
</P>
<P>
 * "AMA Encyclopedia of Medicine," published by the American Medical Assn. and 
Random House, sells for $44.95. Described as "an A-to-Z Reference Guide," the 
1,184-page book includes an index of commonly prescribed drugs and information 
on more than 5,000 medical terms and conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 For Young Patients: Families with young children might also want to consider a 
pediatric health guide. "Your Child's Health" is recommended by Dr. Russell 
Spadaro, a Thousand Oaks pediatrician. Published by Bantam, the $16.95 book by 
Dr. Barton Schmitt lists emergencies first in alphabetical order and includes 
information on common newborn health problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Susan Keisner, a family practice physician with FHP Plaza Medical Center, 
Long Beach, recommends "Dr. Mom," by Dr. Marianne Neifert. The $5.99 paperback, 
published by Signet, includes sections on normal development and care of sick 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Also recommended: ""When Do I Call the Doctor?" by Los Angeles area 
pediatrician Loraine Stern, which promises speedy information for nervous 
parents. Published by Doubleday, the $12.50 book provides answers to "200 
common and not so common childhood complaints in 60 seconds." 
</P>
<P>
 How to Shop: "Look for something that is well-organized, by problem or 
symptom," suggests Dr. Stephen Brunton, a physician on staff at Long Beach 
Memorial Medical Center. "Look for a book that tells you when to relax and when 
to call the doctor," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Brunton especially likes guides that advise readers what information the 
doctor will need during a telephone consultation. Taking body temperature is 
often overlooked, he finds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm amazed at the number of people who don't even own a thermometer and who 
don't expect that the doctor will ask the patient's temperature," Brunton says. 
</P>
<P>
 Look for books with preventive health and practical information, doctors 
suggest. For instance, Stern's book includes a chapter on "How to Make the Best 
Use of the Telephone." Like auto repair shops, she notes wryly, pediatricians' 
offices can be busy on Monday mornings. So if parents can wait until a less 
frantic phone time, they might get more attention. Some books, including the 
Better Homes and Gardens' guide, include timetables for checkups. 
</P>
<P>
 How-To: Use home guides to obtain basic information about common diseases such 
as chicken pox, colds and flu or to reinforce the information about a specific 
condition or treatment already discussed with the physician. "It's amazing how 
much confidence is built by a doctor who says the same thing as the book," 
Keisner says. 
</P>
<P>
 Caveats: Even so, Keisner adds, "I worry some of these books might cross the 
line and give people false reassurance that everything is OK. I have patients 
who will grab onto any excuse not to see the doctor." 
</P>
<P>
 The Downside: Even very intelligent, well-read consumers can be steered awry 
by home medical books. One Los Angeles woman who normally doesn't get headaches 
turned to her home medical guide when one struck. When she matched up her 
headache and other symptoms, she feared meningitis. The emergency room doctor 
diagnosed sinusitis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Future: Computer whizzes are already getting medical information (and 
viewing surgery) from their home PCs. Experts predict that the practice will 
become more common. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mayo Clinic Family Health Book CD-ROM," released in 1992, is a computer 
medical guide included as a package on some CD-ROM equipped computers, says 
Karl Kortepeter, an account executive at Connecting Point computer store in 
Burbank. Besides basic information, there's a bonus for strong-of-stomach 
viewers: they can watch surgery, including an animated arthroscopic knee 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 The program has sold more than 250,000 copies, according to IVI Publishing, an 
electronic publisher offering the title in cooperation with Time Life. Another 
CD-ROM program includes information on heart health and yet another on pharmacy 
questions is due out in 1994.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; SURF SPIRIT FLOWS FROM 'PIPELINE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Remember the Chantays? Sure you do. They were the group who did that 
fair-to-middling cover version of "Honky Tonk Women," right? Or weren't they 
the ones who did the interminable Eric Clapton imitation on "Have You Ever 
Loved a Woman?" 
</P>
<P>
 We may as well get the negative aspects of the Chantays' "30-Year Anniversary 
Celebration of 'Pipeline' " show out of the way first, so we might finish with 
the number of positive things that also can be said of the veteran Santa Ana 
surf band's appearance Sunday at Randell's. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the Chantays did indeed play those Stones- and Clapton-associated 
tunes, as well as a variety of other oldies, the real reason why folks have 
remembered them for 30 years is "Pipeline," one of the first, coolest and 
certainly most globally recognized instrumental anthems ever twanged. 
</P>
<P>
 The song was a great Southern California success story. Within six months of 
getting their first electric guitars, Santa Ana High students Bob Spickard and 
Brian Carman got together after school one day and came up with an instrumental 
they originally called "Liberty's Whip," inspired by the film "The Man Who Shot 
Liberty Valence."  
</P>
<P>
 Shortly afterward, though, they saw a Bruce Brown surfing film, and changed 
the title to "Pipeline." Released on the local Downey label in late 1962, it 
was picked up by the major Dot label early the following year and became an 
international hit. (Sunday, Spickard acknowledged that the anniversary "is a 
bit belated. You know we're kind of old and forgetful.") 
</P>
<P>
 "Pipeline" reached No. 4 nationally on the Billboard pop chart, and led to 
tours of Japan and even an appearance by the group on "The Lawrence Welk Show." 
It has been covered by both every garage band on Earth and by Dick Dale and the 
late Stevie Ray Vaughan, whose 1988 duo rendition earned a Grammy nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the song is an evocative, enduring classic worthy of its own museum, 
you can also hear gobs of adolescent enthusiasm in it, the thrill of kids 
getting loud, cool sounds to come out of their shiny new amps.  
</P>
<P>
 The Chantays of 1994, though, could benefit from having a little more respect 
for their own achievements, and from a tad more of the youthful fun which the 
band surprisingly still possesses after all these years. 
</P>
<P>
 Spickard (guitar) and Carman (guitar and bass) are still in the band, as is 
original drummer Bob Welch. Rounding out the lineup are guitarists Gil Orr (a 
member since 1967) and '80s addition Ricky Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 As there are now support groups and therapy for aging child stars and other 
victims of neglect, there should perhaps be similar help for old surf band 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 With the advent of the British Invasion in 1964, surf players overnight went 
from being the coolest thing in town to yesterday's news. The final coffin nail 
may have been driven by Jimi Hendrix, who on his debut 1967 album declared 
"You'll never hear surf music again," while using his Fender Stratocaster -- 
the same instrument once used to produce the clean tones of surf tunes -- to 
sonically destroy and reinvent all that had come before him. 
</P>
<P>
 In those divisive times, surf music became the most hokey thing around, and 
one-time surf heroes took refuge in love beads, long hair and fuzztones. Many 
even went so far as to paint their blond (the "official" color of surf guitar 
gear) Fender amps black. 
</P>
<P>
 When bands like the Chantays and the Surfaris started to play their old hits 
during the nostalgia boom of the '70s, it was generally done with a pronounced 
'70s sensibility: Hawaiian print leisure wear replaced the suits and striped 
shirts, while distortion and "hip" effects were added to the music, which often 
would be played with a tongue-in-cheek, we-don't-really-mean-this attitude. 
Those songs would make up only a fraction of sets crammed with rote oldies or 
bland hits of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Given that context, the Chantays on Sunday were a good sight better than might 
have been expected, playing their originals and other surf classics with both a 
youthful verve and a regard for the tone and character of the style, with one 
consistently glaring exception. Where Spickard, Carman and Orr generally played 
with the clean-picked tones of the surf era, 36-year-old Lewis instead plowed 
through with the gimmicked-up, distorto-tone, zillion-note approach that made 
the '70s such a long decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis is a fine player, as indicated by his ensemble playing and a dexterous 
pedal steel-emulating solo in a Bob Wills tune Orr sang. But nearly all of his 
solo work on the surf tunes was in a style not consonant with the era, sort of 
like dropping a leisure-suited John Travolta into a beach party movie. 
</P>
<P>
 In doing cover tunes, the group isn't actually straying from the practice of 
surf bands in the '60s, which often would pad their dance shows with the hits 
of the day. The Chantays schedule these days includes private and corporate 
parties, where danceable covers are probably still an asset for them. For a 
sit-down listening audience, though, most of the songs -- ranging from "Earth 
Angel" to Bob Seger's "Fire Down Below" -- just sounded flat and derivative. 
</P>
<P>
 There were exceptions to that, the most notable being their cover of the 
Kingston Trio's "Greenback Dollar."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The saving part of the show, and the part that really matters, is that the 
qualities that brought the Chantays to prominence in 1963 are still there. They 
kicked off their performance with "Pipeline," and despite what must be the 
thousands of times they've played it, Orr's shimmering opening glissando and 
pulsing rhythm and Spickard's sparkling lead made it evident they still find a 
thrill in it.  
</P>
<P>
 The other instrumentals were scarcely less engaging. 
</P>
<P>
 Those included "Move It," Jorgen Ingmann's "Apache" and the Ventures' "Walk 
Don't Run." For some of the songs, Carman switched from bass to his original 
instrument, guitar, to take the lead on the Belairs' "Mr. Moto," the 
Astronauts' "Baja" and an impromptu version of "Miserlou," on which Carman's 
enthusiasm made up for the few flubbed notes.

 I'd hate to be the one to suggest that the Chantays should stick with the 
sound they found 30 years ago, but it does seem to be the only sound through 
which they express much verve or individuality. There's enough of both there 
that it could be worth their while to create some new material they can feel 
equally close to.

 Could It Be Magic?: Chevy's gone, but there's still Jay, Dave and Arsenio. And 
pretty soon there might be Magic. Magic Johnson will interview country singer 
Garth Brooks, actress Whoopi Goldberg and basketball star Shaquille O'Neal for 
a special Fox will broadcast next month. "It might be a recurring special if 
Magic has a good time doing it," Fox programming chief Sandy Grushow said 
Friday. Fox wanted to do a Barbara Walters type of interview special with 
someone like Johnson as host, Grushow said.

 Miniseries, Mini People: Fox's Children's Network will offer a miniseries as 
part of its Saturday morning lineup. "The Tick," based on Ben Edlund's cult hit 
comic book, will be a six-part animated series about a giant blue 400-pound 
arachnid doing his best to take a bite out of crime. It will premiere in March. 
. . . Also coming for kids on Fox will be an animated version of "Where on 
Earth Is Carmen Sandiego?" The series, based on PBS' live-action game show and 
the popular computer game, will join the Fox Saturday morning lineup on Feb. 5.

 Grandpa Al: Al Lewis says he can't bear to see himself on the screen. Lewis, 
who earned fame as Grandpa on "The Munsters" and as Officer Leo Schnauser in 
"Car 54, Where are You?," says he never watched either TV show. "I've done 
about 400 TV episodes, and I never saw a single one of them," the actor, now 
83, says in the Jan. 22 TV Guide. Lewis says he will attend the premiere of the 
movie version of "Car 54," in which he returns to the Schnauser role, but he 
won't be there for long. "The moment you start the picture, I'm gone," said 
Lewis, who gives a simple explanation for his boycotts: "I just don't want to 
see me." POP

 Playing Vietnam: Bryan Adams said it didn't take much to get Ho Chi Minh City 
rocking. "It's entertainment. They want it. They're starved for it," Adams, a 
Canadian, said after his concert Sunday. "You can tell by the reaction of the 
audience." The concert was the first by a major Western entertainer since the 
end of the Vietnam War in 1975. At first, the audience clapped politely. But by 
night's end, Adams had them on their feet. Some even gyrated. "I like it; I 
like it very much," said student Truong Huong Trung, 20, who was singing and 
dancing in the aisle. The ticket prices of $15 to $35 amounted to several 
weeks' pay for average Vietnamese workers.

 I Thank My MTV: John Mellencamp says MTV did him a favor by censoring portions 
of his new video, "When Jesus Left Birmingham." The cable TV music video 
station put computer-generated video blocks over images it considered 
inappropriate, such as characters in blackface and whiteface and people using 
needles. Mellencamp publicist Jody Miller said the video was meant to highlight 
a deteriorating society and show the temptations that children face. But the 
singer said the MTV changes might actually be for the better. "Their standards 
and practices edict has brought more attention to the very issue I'm talking 
about in the song and the video anyway," Mellencamp said.

 Fender-Bender: The Fullerton Museum Center will extend its hours Wednesday

Leo Fender. The center will be open noon to 4 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday; noon

 That's the Ticket: Don't mess with fans of country singer Vince Gill. In North 
Carolina, Tina Wolfe is so determined to be first in line to buy tickets for a 
Gill concert that she's already camping outside the Asheville Civic Center box 
office -- even though seats don't go on sale until Feb. 12. The concert is 
March 24. Through sleet and snow and below-zero cold, the Asheville woman and 
relatives have camped in a van outside the arena's front doors since Tuesday. 
Friends bring food and drink. Said Wolfe: "I promised Mama front-row seats."

DRIEHUYS ABLY CONDUCTS SANTA BARBARA SYMPHONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Diversity has reigned over the Santa Barbara Symphony for the last year, as 
the organization publicly seeks a new conductor by live concert auditions. Now, 
at mid-point in the proceedings, the concertgoers seem to be getting restless, 
yearning for some coherency or familiarity at the helm. 
</P>
<P>
 Leo Driehuys, at present director of the Charlotte Symphony and the fifth 
contender to take the Santa Barbara podium, led the orchestra Saturday night at 
the Arlington Theater in a mostly Romantic program. If short on surprises or 
profundity, the performance had polish and passion on its side. 
</P>
<P>
 Copland's "El Salon Mexico," played energetically, served as a meaty 
appetizer. The deceptively casual work, driven by polytonality, rugged rhythmic 
designs and vernacular evocations, still transcends its surface exoticism. 
</P>
<P>
 Violinist Eugene Fodor was reliably fluent in the technical and emotional 
challenges of Mendelssohn's E-minor Concerto, though occasionally overwhelmed 
by the interwoven orchestral forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendelssohn's restrained Romantic impulses were answered in the second half by 
the moodier, high-Romantic contours of Sibelius' First Symphony, written in 
1899. Between the haunting clarinet introduction and the final, post-crescendo 
pizzicato minor chord, the terrain is turbulent.  
</P>
<P>
 This first-numbered Symphony of the Finnish composer has an abstractly 
programmatic sweep that makes for a bold orchestral showpiece. Here, the 
orchestra, despite a few ragged moments, ably rode its heroic waves of feeling, 
with Driehuys providing lucid and able-minded direction. Whoever ultimately 
wins the baton in Santa Barbara, the raw orchestral materials are highly 
refined. All involved, on both sides of the stage, are primed for action -- and 
continuity. JOSEF WOODARD

 What's In a Name?: The Mark Taper Forum's award-winning Improvisational 
Theatre Project has been re-christened P.L.A.Y. (Performing for Los Angeles 
Youth). The aim is to reflect the company's gradual shift, since 1971, from 
story theater and improv to fully produced, scripted plays relevant to the 
concerns of L.A. area youth. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past 11 years of transition under director Peter C. Brosius, the 
professional company has commissioned and developed plays that creatively 
explore freedom of expression, civil rights, cultural differences, the 
environment and immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 The name change, Brosius said, "arcs toward future growth, broadens the scope 
and talks about the depth of the commitment." 
</P>
<P>
 P.L.A.Y. will continue to tour schools and community centers throughout Los 
Angeles and Southern California. 
</P>
<P>

TV REVIEW; 'FRONTLINE' COOLLY LOOKS AT 'MADNESS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Questions, questions and more questions bombard us in "A Place for Madness," a 
new "Frontline" report on the deinstitutionalizing of the mentally ill (at 8 
tonight,KCET-TV Channel 28). A good deal of the questions, however, seem to 
have no good answers. 
</P>
<P>
 The real head-scratching is going on in Northampton, Mass., where the state 
psychiatric hospital by court order has permanently closed its doors and 
released patients -- with few exceptions -- to non-institutional settings. The 
town, as the report coolly terms it, has become "a national laboratory" as 
former patients try to integrate into life beyond the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only is the place a lab but a debating center on the issue, and "A Place 
for Madness" airs every side. Attorney Stephen Schwartz, who engineered the 
court order known as "the Northampton consent decree," is an unflinching 
advocate and harsh critic of those who would treat the mentally ill as 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz doesn't even blink at what appear to be very real problems in 
Northampton. The violent cases are rare, but they still shake up the 
townspeople. They especially shook up the Rev. Leroy Moser and his wife, Jane, 
whose mentally ill son, David, is legally free although he once violently 
assaulted his parents. Massachusetts judges must be shown beyond a reasonable 
doubt that a mentally ill defendant is not a threat to himself or others: 
David's judge viewed him as ill, but not a threat, and granted him freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Mosers reel from this decision, they wonder about a system that 
prevents them from getting treatment for David, who denies his illness. The 
balance of public safety and individual liberty is unsure in "A Place for 
Madness"; the only certain thing is that the old system of closeting the 
mentally ill is a thing of the past.

KERRIGAN, HARDING PRACTICE; FIGURE SKATING: THEY TAKE TO THE ICE AT OPPOSITE 
ENDS OF THE NATION AS NEW QUESTIONS SURFACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 America's two women Olympic figure skaters returned to the practice ice Monday 
while a new report surfaced and seemed to further implicate Tonya Harding, or 
someone very close to her, in the rink-side attack on rival Nancy Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC News and the Portland Oregonian newspaper said that investigators now 
suspect the assault on Kerrigan was financed with money that supporters donated 
to Harding through the U.S. Figure Skating Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The amount involved was $6,500, the newspaper said without revealing its 
source. Previous reports said conspirators in the case spoke of amounts as high 
as $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC also said that authorities have bank and wire transfer records that could 
tie Jeff Gillooly, Harding's former husband, to the three men already in 
custody.  
</P>
<P>
 Harding, a native of the Portland area, has not been charged with any crime, 
and her coach said the skater categorically denies involvement and is angry 
that someone around her may have been involved. A sheriff's spokeswoman said 
the case remained under active investigation Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The county district attorney disclosed that he has arranged a tentative 
meeting with Harding, the first since last week's arrest of three men in the 
case. At least one suspect has a two-year tie to the skater, although an 
attorney denied that the man was a full-time bodyguard. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Times, in today's editions, said Harding has earned about 
$200,000 since 1991, including $150,000 from ice skating tours. It also said 
that in the past three years, she received $12,000 from the U.S. Olympic 
Committee through a trust fund, and additional sums through private donors, 
including $20,000 from New York Yankee owner George Steinbrenner, who is also a 
USOC vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 The trust funds are supposed to be used only for training, competition and 
education, and skaters are required to provide an accounting of expenditures. 
Throughout her career, Harding, the daughter of a waitress, has been uncommonly 
dependent on the largess of fans and skating supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the pre-dawn hours Monday, Harding returned to skating practice at 
her home-town rink near Portland, and said she was trying to cope with the 
situation. And she also acknowledged that she has a hard-boiled reputation 
among figure skaters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an obstacle to get over and I may not be the normal figure skater image 
that everybody wants me to be, but I'm my own person and I may be a little 
rough around the edges sometimes, but overall I think I'm a good person," she 
said on ABC's "Good Morning, America." 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan also skated Monday, at a hometown rink in Stoneham, Mass., her first 
public practice session since she was struck on the knee Jan. 6 by a man 
wielding a baton. The attack occurred in a hallway near the ice before the U.S. 
skating championships in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 For an hour Monday, she glided in circles and spins, executing small hops. She 
attempted none of the jumps or other complicated moves required in the 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was kind of stiff at first -- my knee, especially," Kerrigan said at a news 
conference later. "After I kept going, it loosened up more and more and I felt 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 Said orthopedic physician Mahlon Bradley, who is attending Kerrigan: "With 
cautious optimism, Nancy is doing very well." 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan said she had not been contacted or received a letter from Harding, 
although Harding's coach said such a letter expressing regret was in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything's going great, couldn't be better, better than we hoped for," said 
Kerrigan's coach, Evy Scotvold. The coach said it would be two weeks before 
Kerrigan starts to do more complicated maneuvers, and that might mean that she 
will skip the opening ceremonies of the Olympics next month in Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd love her to be there, but all that matters is how well she can be 
prepared for Feb. 23 to 25," the coach said. Those are the dates of the skating 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Portland, Gillooly issued another denial of involvement in this 
"bizarre and crazy event," said his lawyer, Ron Hoevet. Gillooly and Harding 
have conducted a stormy seven-year relationship, and currently are reconciled 
and living together. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillooly has been implicated as the mastermind of the assault by a suspect, 
Shawn E. Eckardt, frequently described as Harding's bodyguard. 
</P>
<P>
 Eckardt, who was photographed at Harding's side when she returned from 
Detroit, was arrested and confessed a role in the crime. He is believed to have 
helped arrange the attack. Hoevet told the Associated Press that Eckardt was 
hired only once to help with Harding's security and that he should not be 
considered her bodyguard. Harding's long-time coach has also said she saw the 
man only twice in two years and could not believe he was hired as a bodyguard. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other men, both of them formerly from Portland and now residents of 
Phoenix, have been charged with conspiracy to commit assault in the case: 
Derrick B. Smith and his nephew, Shane M. Stant. Authorities suspect Stant, a 
bodybuilder and martial arts experts, committed the attack on Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Stant was scheduled to fly to Portland today under guard by sheriff's deputies 
after waiving extradition, the Multnomah County Sheriff's Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the U.S. Olympic Committee has given itself until Feb. 21 to decide 
whether Harding will remain on the team.

HE'S SIMPLY; A CUT ABOVE THE REST; HAKEEM OLAJUWON, IN 10TH SEASON, PROPELLING 
ROCKETS AND HIMSELF TO LOFTY HEIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He was too good to be true. 
</P>
<P>
 Akeem Olajuwon was innocent as a fawn, gifted as a god. In a world of head 
cases, he was pleasant and easygoing. He would have been the All-American boy 
except he was from Nigeria. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to worry. 
</P>
<P>
 In the years that passed, he got Americanized. 
</P>
<P>
 He became rich and famous, not to mention notorious. He was paid millions of 
dollars and blamed for many Houston Rocket disappointments that weren't his 
fault. 
</P>
<P>
 He learned it was a business and discovered a new favorite word: renegotiate. 
His fans grew callous. His employer accused him of faking an injury to get a 
new contract. Had it not been for a salary-cap technicality, he might have been 
traded. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen months later, the Rockets are flirting with elite status and people 
are saying he's the game's best player, the front-runner for the 
most-valuable-player award.  
</P>
<P>
 And he's still pretty much the same guy, except for the H he added to his 
first name to reflect the Arabic pronunciation. It's enough to make a young man 
laugh or cry or something. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to look at the career span, from when I came in in my rookie year," 
says Olajuwon, choosing to ignore the irony. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my 10th year in the league. I've had a successful career. I'm still 
on top of my game. No injuries, so I'm very blessed. I look at it from that 
point of view." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a serene point of view and a relatively new one for Olajuwon, whose skin 
used to be thinner, whose sunny disposition used to cloud over. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a young man who just wanted to get the ball, throw it on the floor and 
run up and down," says Robert Reid, a Rocket for Olajuwon's first five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember a time when I was playing point (during) Dream's rookie year. He 
said in his accent, 'Bobby, gimme the ball, mon.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'But Dream, you've got four guys hanging on you.' He said, 'That's 
OK, I dunk on all of them.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Rocket coaches, who had only expected a player as good as their other Twin 
Tower, Ralph Sampson, were amazed at what they had. 
</P>
<P>
 So was everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody's gotten to him and distorted his mind," said then-Laker coach Pat 
Riley, laughing during a break in the '86 Western finals, in which Olajuwon and 
the Rockets surprisingly ousted the Lakers, 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "Centers in this league are supposed to pace themselves. Nobody's told him to 
pace himself. He's irrepressible. He just never stops playing. He pursues the 
basketball and pursues the basketball. You can't block him out. He's so 
persistent and so strong. He just comes through people." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Rockets went from the wave of the future into a ripple breaking on the 
last years of the Laker dynasty. The blame fell first on Sampson, who was 
traded; on the Rockets' flotsam-jetsam guards, three of whom went into detox 
programs; on coach Bill Fitch, who was fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the perennial disappointment began to reflect on Olajuwon himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was getting scarred up a bit," Reid says. "In Dream's mind, if you didn't 
get upset or play as hard as he did, he felt you were leaving something. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I can remember a couple times, if I missed Dream if he was open down low or 
if I threw a ball away, he would scold and get mad and you would argue with 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "This team that has matured around Hakeem and Rudy T (Coach Rudy Tomjanovich), 
they now have a focused leader -- Hakeem. Think about it. Two to three years 
ago, who was the leader on the floor? You didn't have one. Who was the guy who 
stood in front of everyone and said, 'Damn it, we're not going to lose?' Or if 
things went down, who spoke out first? No one did." 
</P>
<P>
 Two seasons ago, the Rockets went on a 15-2 run while Olajuwon was sitting out 
because of an eye injury. Houston talk shows burned up with calls for Hakeem to 
come back as the sixth man, or to be traded. 
</P>
<P>
 Olajuwon, his eyes always on Los Angeles, said it was OK with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, they could always trade me," he said. "You know how long that would 
take the Rockets? (Snapping his fingers), I'd be gone like that. The Rockets 
would get two or three players and probably some money. And I know that I'd get 
more money. So I guess everybody could be happy. I could be happy with more 
money if that's what everybody wants." 
</P>
<P>
 Olajuwon added that if hard work wasn't good enough for the man in the street, 
"He can go to hell." 
</P>
<P>
 Years later, however, he understands. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people that make suggestions, that put their opinions about, oh, trade 
this, do this, it's very easy to say than when they don't have their money 
where their mouth is," he says. "I don't listen to outside people because it's 
just talk. Anybody can talk. But who are the decision-makers? They know it can 
cost them a lot of money for any mistake. They have to pay for their mistake. 
People on the street just talk." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the decision-makers were coming after him, too. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, Olajuwon, seeking a one-year $15-million extension of a contract 
that paid him $3 million annually, found himself at an impasse with the 
Rockets. General Manager Steve Patterson said later that their last meeting 
ended with Olajuwon's telling him: "You do what you have to do, I'll do what I 
have to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The next night, Olajuwon scored 21 points and took down 18 rebounds in a 
victory over the Clippers. He came out complaining of a hamstring twinge, but 
returned in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 When he sat out two games, the Rockets suspended him. In all, he was out for 
four games -- $130,000 worth. 
</P>
<P>
 Olajuwon filed a grievance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockets produced an expert who said there was no injury. Other doctors 
said a soft-tissue injury, or the absence of one, would be difficult to prove. 
Management backed down, but the Rockets were a demoralized team. Kenny Smith 
said the atmosphere was worse than Sacramento's. Vern Maxwell said it was worse 
than his season in San Antonio, when the Spurs lost 61 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Just to prove it, the Rockets finished 1-5 and missed the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockets set out to trade Olajuwon. They reportedly agreed with the Lakers 
on a deal for Vlade Divac, James Worthy and Elden Campbell, but it couldn't be 
made. Although Divac had just signed an extension paying him $3.6 million a 
year, for salary-cap purposes he had to be listed at his old $975,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Olajuwon came back to camp, an unhappy Rocket. On media day in the fall of 
1992, he called team owner Charlie Thomas a coward. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas was trying to sell the team, but it was a slow process. Instead, he and 
Olajuwon made up on the team's long flight to Tokyo to open the '92-93 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Thomas: "I'm a businessman. He's a businessman." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockets started 14-16, but finished 41-11. Olajuwon, passing out of 
double-teams, patting teammates on the back after mistakes but otherwise 
playing the same way he had for a decade, was chosen defensive player of the 
year and ran a strong No. 2 to Charles Barkley in the MVP voting. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas found a buyer, Les Alexander. Alexander signed Olajuwon to a 
$26-million, four-year extension with a clause that makes him a free agent in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't look at it -- oh, the owner call you this," says Olajuwon. "I look at 
my position, my career, where I am today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, you're talking to me today. He's no longer the owner. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends say Olajuwon's serenity flows from his new devotion to Islam. Now 
everything has fallen into place and if it falls back out, well, he's an 
innocent no longer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I've had a wonderful career," he says. "I don't look at the bad, I 
look at the good. The good way overrides the bad. It hasn't been easy, but it's 
been fun."

SHOCK WAVES REACH BEYOND THE SOUTHLAND; EARTHQUAKE: CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE, 
CLIPPER PLAYERS FEAR FOR FAMILIES FROM LONG DISTANCES. ANAHEIM STADIUM IS 
DAMAGED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The earthquake that was centered in Northridge early Monday morning led to the 
postponement of a game between the Sacramento Kings and the Lakers in Inglewood 
and left many local athletes, at home or on the road for games, frantic about 
the safety of their friends and family. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake also crumpled the "Big A" sign inside Anaheim Stadium and the 
massive scoreboard above the left field stands collapsed. There was no apparent 
damage to any of the other Southland sporting venues. In fact, Santa Anita in 
Arcadia ran its regular racing card. 
</P>
<P>
 The Forum in Inglewood did not sustain any major damage, but officials chose 
to postpone the scheduled afternoon game between the Lakers and Sacramento 
Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was power in the building, but basically I think it was just more of a 
common sense decision since the police were telling everyone to stay at home 
and because of the problems with the freeways being closed," said John Black, 
the Lakers' public relations director. "It was pretty obvious that we couldn't 
play the game." 
</P>
<P>
 The game will be rescheduled. A new date could be set today. The Lakers are 
scheduled to play at Seattle at 7 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, in Miami for tonight's game against the Heat, spent Monday 
morning phoning their families to see if they made it through the earthquake 
unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
 The family members of the team suffered no serious injuries, but General 
Manager Elgin Baylor's home in Woodland Hills was slightly damaged, a team 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Safety, the Clippers' communications director, said Friday night's game 
against Cleveland at the Sports Arena is still scheduled to be played. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cal State Northridge men's basketball team, on the road for a game at the 
University of Colorado, spent Monday watching news of the earthquake's damage 
on television and waiting for phone calls from family. It was difficult for 
team members to contact their families because long distance telephone service 
into and out of the Southland was extremely limited. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the media in Boulder realized that Northridge was playing in town, the 
team was besieged by requests from reporters. At noon, the Matadors held a news 
conference, during which team members were very upset about waiting to hear 
from family members.  
</P>
<P>
 But as Monday wore on, most team members heard from their families. Many had 
sustained damage to their homes and apartments, but none were seriously 
injured. Isidore Gold, Northridge's student assistant, and Ozan Korkut, a 
freshman from Turkey, were still waiting to hear from friends and family hours 
before tip-off. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Monday afternoon, Matador staff members were considering flying the team 
home today and postponing Wednesday's game at Air Force, but they had not been 
able to reach school administrators to make travel arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in the Southland, the earthquake's damage reached far from 
Northridge, which was considered the epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
 Some 50 miles away from the epicenter at Anaheim Stadium, the Sony Jumbotron, 
about 800 square feet in area and weighing 17.5 tons, broke from its moorings 
atop the stadium's roof and landed in a partially upright position in the upper 
deck, taking a portion of the roof with it. Late Monday morning, the board was 
held precariously in place at a 45-degree angle by some of its beams. At least 
800 seats were damaged or destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Damage to the stadium was estimated at $3 million to $4 million by city 
officials, who said the size of the deductible on the city's liability 
insurance might mean that the loss will not be covered. 
</P>
<P>
 It also was unclear when repairs could be made, officials said, or if this 
weekend's motorcycle races at the stadium will be postponed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have contacted our engineering firm to have them do a technical evaluation 
of the stadium," assistant city manager David Morgan said. "Our goal is to be 
back in business as quickly as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Stadium General Manager Greg Smith said he was "surprised" that the scoreboard 
would collapse in an earthquake that caused only minor damage elsewhere in the 
immediate area. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings' Wayne Gretzky, in Philadelphia after Sunday night's 5-2 loss to the 
Flyers, said that his home in Beverly Hills is "pretty much ruined inside." He 
said the fireplace separated from the wall and there is a big hole in the 
kitchen floor and most of the furniture is destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Anita Park race track was structurally sound and went ahead with its 
race card on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing we did was we got an outside engineer to come in and inspect 
the entire plant and he could find no structural damage or danger and gave us 
the go-ahead," said Jack Disney, a media liaison for Santa Anita. "Then we 
checked with the Arcadia police department to make sure that there was no 
problem with surrounding roads. Everything considered, we decided to go ahead 
and run the race program . . . it was not an easy decision." 
</P>

OILER MESS: RYAN TO STAY, BUT MOON MAY BE GONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Having disposed of the 1993 season in their traditional messy manner, the 
NFL's masters of rudeness looked toward the future Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 For once, the Houston Oilers cowered. 
</P>
<P>
 They saw a future with Buddy Ryan, and without Warren Moon. 
</P>
<P>
 They saw a future with more craziness, and without the veterans who gave that 
craziness some texture. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kind of scary," said safety Bubba McDowell, one of two Oilers who signed 
long-term deals this winter. "I'm sure next summer, me being human, I'll 
wonder, 'What did I do?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps he should ask himself sooner. Like now. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching the Oilers react to their 28-20 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs Sunday 
in the AFC semifinals, the question of how they lost was pushed aside for a 
larger issue: How were they able to spend three hours together on the same 
sideline? 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan threw a final subtle jab at offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride. 
</P>
<P>
 Players threw not-so-subtle jabs at Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
 Players criticized teammates for lack of intensity. 
</P>
<P>
 All this, even though they won't play another game for seven months. 
</P>
<P>
 And the ever-composed Moon wonders, what did he do so wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 He has led the Oilers to the playoffs in seven consecutive seasons but it 
appears that he will be blamed for the seven consecutive times they have failed 
to reach the conference championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 Indications are that Oiler management, unwilling to pay a combined $6.25 
million to Moon and backup Cody Carlson next year, will trade Moon and his 
$3.25-million salary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would not be surprised if that happens," McDowell said. "That is what 
everybody has been talking about. 
</P>
<P>
 "Warren is getting older and Cody is coming into his prime, ready to take the 
controls." 
</P>
<P>
 The move would make particular sense if the Oilers, as expected, change their 
offense to a condensed version of the run-and-shoot. Carlson, who has led the 
Oilers to a 10-4 record as a starter, is better suited to a more traditional 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would love to be back here . . . but I'm not really sure of my future," 
said Moon, 37, who is signed through 1995. "Everybody is asking questions, even 
my kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Only on the Oilers would their leading citizen be shown the door while their 
combative defensive coordinator is embraced. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan certainly is not getting fired, at least if you believe owner Bud Adams. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a great defensive staff, and a great offensive staff," Adams said 
after Sunday's game. "We got through all those distractions, didn't we? I don't 
see anything wrong with what we're doing on the field." 
</P>
<P>
 And Ryan apparently does not see anything wrong with keeping alive his feud 
with Gilbride, whom Ryan punched during a sideline fight at the end of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can only speak for my side of the ball," Ryan said just before leaving the 
Oiler complex. "But we had a Super Bowl defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlson, already sounding like the new team leader, said he could only speak 
for his side of the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 But he wished certain arrogant members of the staff would keep their mouths 
shut. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody on the team was disappointed with the way the (coaching dispute) 
was handled this year," he said. "People around here have to start bending a 
little. People have to start thinking of something other than themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer Tillman, veteran running back, said egos interfered with defensive 
play calling in the second half Sunday, when Joe Montana led the Chiefs to 28 
points in overcoming a 10-0 halftime deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fine that Buddy has confidence in his defense, but we have to be 
cognizant of our opponents' strengths, and recognize them, and deal with them," 
Tillman said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that while Montana and the Chiefs made adjustments, the Oilers did 
not, thinking that a 10-0 lead would be safe. 
</P>
<P>
 In the locker room at halftime, defensive end Sean Jones actually screamed at 
his teammates to wake up and realize that 10 points is nothing to Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we never did," Tillman said. "We never understood what we were dealing 
with here. We never realized that if you let a West Coast offense stay close, 
it will get you in the end. Our emotions were lacking." 
</P>
<P>
 McDowell agreed, saying, "Something was wrong. The intensity just wasn't 
there. We were lackadaisical, and I can't understand it." 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, Ryan showed no remorse. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the Oilers would have won except for two unusual passes by Montana -- 
the 18-yard touchdown pass behind Willie Davis and the lob that became a 
41-yard pass to Keith Cash, setting up the final touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "You got a helicopter pass and a pass that I have no idea how he threw it," 
Ryan said. "We're the hottest defense in the NFL, and yesterday doesn't change 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 This spring's activities should change that. There are 28 potential 
unrestricted free agents on this team, including 10 opening-day starters. 
</P>
<P>
 The speech given to the team by Adams at the start of training camp -- he said 
they had better win because many would be gone in 1994 -- still holds true. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Moon, they could lose running back Lorenzo White, receiver Haywood 
Jeffires and guard Doug Dawson from the offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, end William Fuller, linebacker Al Smith and cornerback Cris Dishman, 
among others, could be gone from the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I get here, I don't know who else is going to be here," McDowell said. 
"Nobody does." 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing certain, Tillman said, is that the Oilers had better change 
their style of business. Appropriately, he referenced a recently published 
cartoon strip. 
</P>
<P>
 "In one frame, there are these people standing underneath this cliff, looking 
up at a big boulder at the end of the cliff," Tillman explained. "The caption 
is, 'Risk Awareness.' 
</P>
<P>
 "In another frame, the boulder is falling over the edge, and the people are 
running away. The caption is, 'Risk Management.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Tillman sighed. "That's our problem around here. We don't understand risk 
management." 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, that boulder was named Montana. But one gets the feeling it could 
have been anybody.

TEMBLOR EVOKES TRAINER'S PAIN; SANTA ANITA: EARTHQUAKE IN JUNE OF 1991 LED TO 
DEATH OF LERILLE'S FIANCEE AND SERIOUSLY INJURED HIM AS THEY SAT IN THE 
GRANDSTAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As usual, trainer Art Lerille's alarm clock in San Dimas was set for 4:30 a.m. 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, Lerille was awake about five minutes before the alarm went off. 
Dozens of years of working with horses will condition a man that way. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of Lerille's morning, though, was anything but usual. When the 
Northridge earthquake rocked the 58-year-old trainer's house, there was an 
inevitable flashback. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lived in Southern California all my life," Lerille said. "I grew up in 
East Pasadena. And like a lot of Californians, I was never paranoid about 
earthquakes. But I started feeling differently after what happened on June 28, 
1991." 
</P>
<P>
 That innocent summer morning, Lerille and his fiancee, Juli Nickoley, were 
watching one of his horses work out from the Santa Anita grandstand. When the 
earth started moving, they began running down the stairs. It was the right 
thing to do, getting away from danger overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 But they didn't quite make it. The earthquake centered in neaby Sierra Madre 
that day caused $1.1 million in damages at Santa Anita, and part of it was a 
20-foot steel beam that fell on Lerille and Nickoley. It took three men to 
carry it away. 
</P>
<P>
 Nickoley was killed instantly. 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Jerry Fanning, who was sitting on his pony near the outside fence of 
the track, saw the accident, dismounted and ran to help his friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was so much blood -- I couldn't believe Art was still alive," Fanning 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lerille suffered multiple injuries. Doctors needed 22 stitches to close a gash 
in the back of his head. Three times, they have operated on his left shoulder, 
which has been fused together with a rod and screws. His left leg and left arm 
were broken, and he suffered a dislocated left ankle. He has had a bone graft 
and still walks with a limp. 
</P>
<P>
 All of that flashed by Lerille when the earthquake shook him at 4:31 a.m. 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't exactly hit the deck after that," he said. "I've got a couple of 
cats, and they went bananas. I waited a couple of minutes and called the barn, 
to see if everything was all right." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Lerille, the trainer's son, who keeps even earlier hours than his father, 
answered the phone and said that their six-horse stable was OK. A couple of the 
horses had gotten loose for a few moments, but by the time Art Lerille called, 
they were under control. 
</P>
<P>
 Lerille hung up, not knowing what he was going to do next. On another 
earthquake day, could he go out to the track where his fiancee had been killed, 
conducting business as usual? For 10 months after Juli Nickoley's death, he had 
talked over hypothetical questions with a psychologist, but they had never 
covered this situation. 
</P>
<P>
 A year to the day after the Sierra Madre earthquake that hit Santa Anita, 
there was the Landers-Big Bear quake on June 28, 1992, but that one didn't 
count as a test for Lerille. He was at his sister's place at Dana Point that 
day, and hadn't planned on being at Santa Anita, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Lerille finally gathered himself and headed for Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was late, though," he said. "It took me a little time at home to get it all 
together. I think that if I didn't have those two horses to breeze (work out), 
I would have stayed home." 
</P>
<P>
 When Lerille got to Santa Anita, he knew he had made the right decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt a lot better after I got there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing Lerille will not do, however, is return to the spot in the 
grandstand where Juli Nickoley was killed. Vincent and Scarlett Timphony, who 
have a small string of horses at Santa Anita, might have been there, too, that 
day in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our jock -- it might have been (Corey) Nakatani -- was late to work our horse 
that morning," said Scarlett, Vincent Timphony's wife. "If he'd been on time, 
we'd have been right there, standing with Art and Juli." 
</P>
<P>
 The Timphonys have told Lerille that story. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still think about why we were there," Lerille said Monday. "That's a place 
where I had never been to watch a horse work." 
</P>
<P>
 All of that hardware in Lerille's shoulder has caused problems. One of the 
screws wasn't right, and an infection set in. He's going to need three more 
screws inserted, and another bone graft is likely. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure when they're going to do it," he said Monday, after making it 
through another earthquake and the heartache that went with it. "I'm going to 
try to talk them into waiting, at least until Santa Anita is over."

JIM MURRAY: SOME THINGS PREDICTABLE AS THE SUPER BOWL LOOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I can't imagine anyone in Southern California caring today but, back in the 
toy department, the Super Bowl picture is down to the final four now. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know who will win. But I do know how: 
</P>
<P>
 1. One team will punt the ball out of bounds on the opponents' two-yard line 
and their fans will go crazy. They shouldn't. The easiest yards to make in 
football are from your own goal line. The defense has too much field to cover 
and too often the team comes out from the shadow of its own goal post with 
relative ease and within two or three plays might be in field goal range or 
better. 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, 90-yard marches are common. They used to call this maneuver 
kicking out at the "coffin corner," but too often the corpse rises up and beats 
you.  
</P>
<P>
 2. Look for two teams that have struggled manfully to score 10 or 13 points 
between them for nearly 55 minutes to suddenly start scoring at will in the 
final few minutes of a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Check the Kansas City-Houston game Sunday. At the start of the fourth quarter, 
it was Oilers 10, Chiefs 7. It ended up 28-20, Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
 When those teams go into what I would call their "Woolworth store" defenses -- 
the nickel and dime sets -- they get like Mitch Williams serving up gopher 
balls. You stop rushing (or blitzing) Joe Montana, you might as well go home. 
The scoreboard gets a nervous breakdown in the final minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 3. Get used to the idea that the pass rush is a thing of the past. Nobody has 
anything like the "Fearsome Foursome" or the San Francisco "Gold Rush" anymore. 
You don't see players like Deacon Jones, Lamar Lundy, Merlin Olsen and 
Roosevelt Grier throwing blockers to one side as they meet at the quarterback 
in a foul mood these days. More likely you'll see the "Feeble Foursome" and the 
"Tin Rush. " 
</P>
<P>
 Those old-time pass rushers didn't need blitzes (or "red dogs," as they called 
them). They would have treated a blitzing linebacker or safety man as an 
interloper sticking his nose in where it wasn't wanted. Or needed. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Look for the AFC to get its annual licking. The AFC lost its competitive 
edge a long time ago because it got away from its rootsdaring, high-risk, 
take-a-chance, attack-boldly football. Instead, it adopted the 
close-to-the-vest, strong-arm football of the older conference. It was like 
trading bites with a lion, getting into the water with the sharks. The results 
were predictable. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Expect to see a team with fourth and one on the opponents' 40-yard-line 
punt the ball -- and gain, maybe, 20 yards in the process. This is a craven 
tactic that has the effect of telling your team you think they're no damn good. 
And even if you kick the ball out of bounds on the three -- well, see Item 1 
above.  
</P>
<P>
 6. Expect the teams in the Super Bowl to be the teams with the best 
quarterbacks, as usual. Not the teams with the best running backs. Emmitt Smith 
can have a good game, but he won't be in the Super bowl if Troy Aikman has a 
bad one. Ricky Watters may be the new San Francisco treat, but Steve Young's 
arm is the 49ers' killer weapon. Marcus Allen is good, but Joe Montana better 
have another three-touchdown-pass day. Thurman Thomas is good, too, but Jim 
Kelly will be the reason the Bills win.  
</P>
<P>
 7. Look for a key game to be decided by a field goal. Maybe, an overtime field 
goal. No playoff game should be decided by an overtime field goal. It is the 
cheapest score imaginable. With these guys kicking them 50 yards with ease 
nowadays, it could boil down to a game being decided by the coin toss. It's 
like seeing a pennant decided by a balk, Wimbledon by a foot fault.  
</P>
<P>
 8. But if seeing a game decided by an overtime field goal is counter-sporting, 
how about deciding one by a pass-interference call? 
</P>
<P>
 This is one case where the punishment hardly fits the crime. A pass defender 
needs a warrant to cover a receiver these days, but an official has to make an 
assumption, and only an assumption, that the receiver will catch the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 But guys wide open have been known to drop passes. It's like winning a 
Kentucky Derby on a foul claim -- which it is interesting to note that no horse 
has ever done. The interference call is often like giving the death penalty for 
double-parking. 
</P>
<P>
 9. Look for the return of the sweep that Vince Lombardi used to call the "run 
to daylight." The 49ers dusted it off and buried the Giants with it. Properly 
executed, it's as unstoppable as a glacier. 
</P>
<P>
 10. Remember, in an obvious passing situation, any quarterback not on crutches 
can help himself to 15 or more yards running. Notice how often he passes 
anyway, even though the pass rush has deteriorated and no one is within a first 
down of him.  
</P>
<P>
 11. If Joe Montana can win a Super Bowl with an AFC team, check him for a halo 
and wings -- or, at least, a cape and a block S. He's not human.

MORNING BRIEFING: HE HOPES THAT FEMALE PLAYER WILL LET HIM FORGET THE PASTA

 UC Santa Barbara women's basketball Coach Mark French has seen enough of Long 
Beach State's Danielle Scott. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just hope some Italian league volleyball team makes her a huge contract 
offer this week so we don't have to face her again," French said. "I'll be on 
the phone with some Italian teams telling them how great she is." 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-2 senior was voted volleyball player of the year during four years 
in which she wore out the Gauchos. Then she switched to basketball and scored 
27 points and took down 23 rebounds to help Long Beach end a six-game losing 
streak against the defending Big West champions. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who has the highest scoring average in the NBA for players with 
10,000 points or more? 
</P>
<P>
 The big one: Pin collecting has been a big-time Olympic fad for years, but the 
Norwegian School of Marketing and Management in Oslo might have come up with 
the ultimate in pins for the Lillehammer Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
 It measures 9 feet 8 inches by 6 feet 5 inches and weighs 250 pounds. It will 
be auctioned off to help Norway's Olympic movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Anything else? New Orleans cornerback Vince Buck, after the Saints had lost 
eight of 10 games and failed to make the playoffs, reviewed the season this 
way: 
</P>
<P>
 "Disappointment, embarrassment, shame, disbelief," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Quick success: The quickest way to make the Ryder Cup team is to win a major 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Winners of the Masters, U.S. Open, British Open and PGA get 225 points for a 
victory, and the winners of all other tour events get 75 points. 
</P>
<P>
 In the majors, the distribution is 225-135-120-105-90, with the sixth place 
finisher getting 75, the same as the winner of a weekly tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Mutual admiration: Toronto's Joe Carter was the World Series hero with his 
winning home run, but he was highly impressed by the Philadelphia Phillies' 
Lenny Dykstra. 
</P>
<P>
 "The little guy is some baseball player," he told Pat O'Brien forInside 
Sports. "Is there anything he can't do? I mean, Rickey Henderson is a great 
leadoff batter, but Lenny -- man, that guy can flat-out play. He's like a 
bowling ball out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Quick turnabout: Jay Siegel, two-time U.S. Amateur champion and a nine-time 
Walker Cup team member, gave up his amateur standing this year at 50 to play on 
the PGA Senior Tour as a professional. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like getting divorced and getting remarried the same morning," Siegel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 No wipeouts: When he won the Hawaii Open tennis tournament, Wayne Ferreira's 
victory was worth $42,000 and a surfboard.  
</P>
<P>
 Ferreira said he didn't actually surf during the tournament, and that he had a 
good reason: "I didn't want to kill myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Michael Jordan, 32.3 points in 667 games. 
</P>

 Patrick Roy made 25 saves and Vincent Damphousse scored the winning goal as 
the Montreal Canadiens beat the Washington Capitals, 3-1, on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Desjardins scored in the first period, Damphousse in the second and 
Gilbert Dionne in the third for Montreal, which had lost two in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canadiens limited Washington to only 12 shots through the first two

period. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 5, Hartford 3 -- Cam Neely scored a tie-breaking goal late in the third 
period as the Bruins maintained their Boston Garden dominance over the Whalers.

12, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose 3, Calgary 2 -- Todd Elik's second goal of the game broke a 
third-period tie and lifted the Sharks over the Flames at San Jose, earning the 
Sharks their franchise-record 40th point of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 6, Tampa Bay 3 -- Ray Sheppard scored twice and assisted on goals by 
Steve Yzerman and Paul Coffey when the Red Wings took advantage of Tampa Bay 
special-teams breakdowns to beat the Lightning at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 2, N.Y. Islanders 1 -- Mark Fitzpatrick, a former Islander, made a

TENNIS / AUSTRALIAN OPEN; COURIER ADDS DRAMA WITH COMEBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just when tennis was being dismissed by critics and some of its own players as 
a bore, Jim Courier and Bryan Shelton provided a taste of how compelling the 
sport can be. 
</P>
<P>
 The two Americans offered an intriguing display of power tennis, with Shelton 
providing the perfect counterpunch to Courier's strong serve and forehand. 
</P>
<P>
 Courier, seeking a third consecutive Australian Open title, rallied to avoid a 
first-round ouster Monday. He took five of the final six games to win, 4-6, 
6-1, 6-7 (7-4), 6-2, 6-4, in a 4-hour 42-minute match. 
</P>
<P>
 Courier's victory wasn't pretty, but it was exciting. And it was an answer to 
those who complain men's tennis has turned into a boring battle of big servers. 
In recent days, Ivan Lendl and Thomas Muster have said they would not pay to 
see today's brand of tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd gasped as Courier and Shelton traded shots, then gestured to 
themselves with their rackets, sort of shadowboxing in the midday sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Early today, No. 8-seeded Petr Korda of the Czech Republic was upset by Thomas 
Enqvist of Sweden, 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 (7-2). 
</P>
<P>
 In other matches played early today, No. 4 Stefan Edberg, No. 9 Todd Martin, 
No. 10 Magnus Gustafsson, No. 12 Alexander Volkov and No. 13 Wayne Ferreira of 
South Africa all won. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, top-seeded Pete Sampras won easily, blasting 23 aces in a 6-4, 6-0, 
7-6 (7-5) victory over Australian Joshua Eagle. 
</P>
<P>
 Also winning first-round matches Monday were No. 5 Goran Ivanisevic, who 
delighted several hundred flag-waving Croatian fans with a straight-set victory 
over Alex O'Brien, and No. 11 Marc Rosset of Switzerland, No. 14 Karel Novacek 
of the Czech Republic and No. 15 Lendl. 
</P>
<P>
 In the women's draw, No. 1 Steffi Graf needed only 23 minutes Monday to win, 
6-1, 2-0, over Kimberly Po, who retired with a strained stomach muscle.

CAPRIATI PUTTING CAREER ON HOLD; TENNIS: TEEN-AGER, RANKED 12TH IN WORLD, NOT 
EXPECTED TO RETURN TO TOUR UNTIL AFTER FRENCH OPEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL DWYRE, TIMES SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jennifer Capriati, teen-age tennis star, has decided to become Jennifer 
Capriati, teen-ager. And the two people most happy with that decision are her 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Capriati, who will turn 18 March 29 and who will graduate from Pascual County 
High in Saddlebrook, Fla., on June 9, announced over the weekend that she has 
put her highly lucrative career on hold for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 She is ranked 12th in the world and would have been among the seeded players 
at the first Grand Slam event of the year, the Australian Open, which opened 
Monday in Melbourne. Although she wasn't specific about a date of return, she 
is expected to sit out the French Open in May and probably will not return to 
the tour until sometime before Wimbledon, which starts in late June. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really hard to say," said her mother, Denise, from Wesley Chapel, Fla. 
"She could turn on TV, watch a little bit of the Australian and want to get 
back out and play. But I don't think so." 
</P>
<P>
 Capriati's announcement was brief and noncommittal. "I need a break from it," 
she told the New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
 In a little more than four years on the tour, Capriati has amassed 
considerably more than $1 million in winnings. 
</P>
<P>
 When she was 13, she reached the final in her first pro tournament. When she 
was 14, she made it to the French Open semifinals, and also became the youngest 
ever to win a match at Wimbledon. When she was 15, she made the semifinals at 
both Wimbledon and the U.S. Open, and her advance at Wimbledon that year, 1991, 
featured a victorious two-day, rain-delayed quarterfinal drama over Martina 
Navratilova on Centre Court. 
</P>
<P>
 And when she was 16, she won the Olympic gold medal, beating Germany's Steffi 
Graf in the final on the red clay at Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
 But the combination of media attention, an arm injury that has bothered her 
since March and has only recently been diagnosed as a fracture, and an alleged 
shoplifting situation in a Tampa mall in December finally pushed her to a 
decision to get out for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all kind of talked about it, her father and Jennifer and me," Denise 
Capriati said. "Originally, she was planning to return sooner. But then, with 
what happened at the mall, it was just tough to come back now, to face the 
media again and all the questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's very strong, but she's just not ready to talk. I think she made a good 
decision. Stefano (Jennifer's father) and I couldn't agree more with what she 
has decided. She's only a senior in high school once, and this lets her go to 
school, not have to travel all over the world with school books, and come back 
when she wants to with a clear head." 
</P>
<P>
 Stefano Capriati called the decision "a good one step back," and said he was 
very happy that his daughter had the nerve to do this. 
</P>
<P>
 Both parents said that the mall incident probably was the final straw for 
their daughter. Capriati was cited by Tampa police for allegedly shoplifting 
after trying on an inexpensive ring and walking out of a store with it still on 
her finger. The Capriatis have said it was all a mistake, that she simply 
forgot she had the ring on. She will have a private hearing before juvenile 
officials this month.  
</P>
<P>
 "We were furious over how some of the local media here overplayed that story," 
Denise Capriati said. "And we still are." 
</P>
<P>
 According to her mother, Capriati should be injury-free when she does come 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just were told recently that what we had been told was bone chips on her 
elbow really wasn't that," Denise Capriati said. "It turned out that what the 
X-rays were showing was really a small fracture, and that has almost completely 
healed now. No surgery will be needed." 
</P>
<P>
 Capriati lives in an apartment nearby and stops at her parents' home after 
school each day, her mother said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't know if she's playing tennis at all now, even just with some 
of her friends," Denise said. "But I do know one thing, she's growing up a 
lot."

<P>
 When the office lights finally came on Monday morning, an invitation to attend 
a baseball banquet next month caught my eye. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Quakes," it said in big letters. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Rancho Cucamonga Quakes of the California League are going to have their 
second annual "Winter Warm Up" Feb. 6 at the Ontario Red Lion Inn. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Quakes set all kinds of attendance records last season and I'm sure the 
affair, emceed by Steve Garvey, will be delightful, but I really wish they 
would change their nickname. . . The same goes for the Miami Hurricanes, Tulsa 
Golden Hurricane, Iowa State Cyclones, and Tampa Bay Lightning. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Most innovative touchdown celebration of the year was that of Kansas City 
Chief tight end Keith Cash, who threw the ball smack in the face of a Buddy 
Ryan banner at the Astrodome. . . . The Raiders reached the AFC championship 
game five times in a row during the 1973-77 seasons, but the Buffalo Bills 
would set a record with a fourth consecutive victory. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Mike Ditka said that the Houston Oilers had an effective rushing attack for 
the first time in the history of the organization. What about the Earl Campbell 
days? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 If the San Francisco 49ers' first 15 plays are scripted, why do they bother to 
huddle? . . . The postponement caused by the earthquake Monday cost Forum fans 
a chance to see former Laker and UCLA Bruin Trevor Wilson, who scored 25 points 
in 38 minutes in the Sacramento Kings' loss to the Phoenix Suns Saturday night. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 Walt Hazzard, former UCLA coach and All-American guard, will be honored during 
the alumni spotlight ceremony Thursday at Pauley Pavilion before the 
Bruin-Arizona game. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Hazzard is executive director of the Los Angeles Sports Academy, a program 
designed to improve academic performances of inner-city students and uses 
basketball as a teaching tool. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 You know it's a crazy college basketball season when Duke and Arizona lose at 
home on the same night, as they did last Thursday. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA presidents did pass one piece of intelligent legislation, that 
allowing undergraduates who make themselves eligible for the NBA draft to keep 
their remaining college eligibility if they announce plans to remain in school 
within 30 days after the draft. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Isiah Thomas' addition to Dream Team II means that he should finally be able 
to represent his country in international competition after being named to the 
1980 U.S. Olympic team that boycotted the Games at Moscow. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Portland point guard Rod Strickland appears to be reaching his potential. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, which was delighted about running back Napoleon Kaufman's decision 
to return for his senior year, is recruiting better than expected after having 
been put on probation. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Krone, the greatest women's jockey, hopes to return to racing in 
June.She suffered a broken ankle and other injuries in a spill Aug. 30 at 
Saratoga. . . . Sam Balter, 83, will be inducted into the Southern California 
Broadcasters Hall of Fame Feb. 9 at Lakeside Country Club. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Balter played basketball at UCLA before competing for the U.S. in the 1932 
Olympic Games and was best known as the voice of the Bruins and for the "One 
for the Book" feature on his nightly 15-minute radio broadcasts. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Those who believed expansion would make for more wide-open games are surprised 
that NHL scoring is at its lowest pace since the 1977-78 season. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Alexander Kharlamov -- son of the late Soviet Union star Valeri Kharlamov -- 
is ranked second among European NHL prospects. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Pro wrestling, featuring Latin performers, is on the Grand Olympic Auditorium 
schedule. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Richards, 68, the only two-time Olympic pole vault champion, says he 
recently cleared 12-6. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Son Brandon Richards, a terrific high school vaulter before he was plagued by 
injuries, will try a comeback in the Sunkist Invitational on Feb. 19 at the 
Sports Arena. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 There are fewer quality fighters than ever, but the World Boxing Council 
rankings go 30 deep in each division. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 A sleeper in the Dodgers' Eric Davis deal with Detroit could be young pitcher 
John Da Silva. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Lasorda and Fred Claire are adamant that Mike Piazza will remain a catcher 
and not be switched to third base, where some baseball people believe he would 
have a longer career. . . . "Joe Ferguson told me last year that I should give 
Mike a rest," Lasorda said. "I said, 'He doesn't have a bat long enough to hit 
a home run with from the dugout.' "

FRED SNOWDEN DIES AT 57; EX-COACH, ENTREPRENEUR; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: AT 
ARIZONA, HE BECAME THE FIRST BLACK TO HEAD A DIVISION I PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fred Snowden, the first black basketball coach at a NCAA Division I school, 
died Monday of a heart attack in Washington, D.C. He was 57. 
</P>
<P>
 Snowden, who was executive director of the Food 4 Less Foundation in Los 
Angeles, collapsed in a convenience store.He had traveled to Washington to 
attend the unveiling of President Clinton's empowerment zones legislation, 
which includes South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still a shock for us," said Darius Anderson, vice president of media 
relations for Food 4 Less. "Fred was in tremendous shape. He was 57 with the 
body of a 40-year-old." 
</P>
<P>
 Snowden, who coached at Arizona from 1972 to 1982, started his coaching career 
after graduating from Wayne State University in Detroit, where he played 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 Snowden coached at his alma mater, Detroit Northwestern High, where his team 
won the Public School League championship in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fred was well liked and a very good coach. His teams were always well 
organized and they were very well coached," said Elbert Richmond, who coached 
at Detroit Mackenzie High. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1960s, Snowden was an assistant at Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 At Arizona, his teams compiled a 167-108 record during the Wildcats' last 
seasons in the Western Athletic Conference and its first four seasons in the 
Pacific 10 Conference. 
</P>
<P>

GAME IS LAST THING ON MINDS OF NORTHRIDGE PLAYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Cal State Northridge basketball team lost to Colorado on Monday night, 
100-85, but the thoughts of the players were back home. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17 players, coaches and managers learned earlier that their community was 
the epicenter of Monday's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The game) almost becomes secondary -- almost, hell, it is secondary," Coach 
Pete Cassidy said. 
</P>
<P>
 His 24-year-old daughter, Erin, called him around 5:40 a.m. Monday at his 
hotel in Boulder to tell him she, her mother and brother were trapped in their 
third-floor Northridge apartment but were fine. 
</P>
<P>
 As the team began watching the devastating televised reports of familiar 
sights, friends and families began calling. Said center Peter Micelli: "You 
watch TV and you say, 'Oh my god, I know where that is,' and you see our 
science building burning down and, you know, you walk there every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Micelli's mother called to tell him her home was badly damaged, but she was 
safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Micelli had not heard from his roommates or friends living in the collapsed 
Northridge Meadows apartment building. Two of his teammates also lived in the 
demolished building. 
</P>
<P>
 "The scariest thing I went through was, I was talking to my sister on the 
phone and there was an aftershock and she started screaming," Micelli said. 
"And my heart just went through my throat." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Cassidy: "I don't think anybody wants to be here right now, as beautiful 
as Boulder is, as Colorado is. There's a tremendous concern on the part of all 
of us -- we want to go home and help." 
</P>
<P>
 All things considered, the team played well against Colorado. The Matadors 
(3-12) led 52-47 early in the second half before Colorado (7-6) went on a 10-0 
run. 
</P>
<P>
 Micelli had an off night, missing all eight of his shots and scoring only two 
points, but Andre Chevalier made seven of 11 shots and scored 19 points, and 
Brooklyn McLinn had 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado's Donnie Boyce, a 6-5 point guard, scored 22.

UCLA RISES TO NO. 2 IN THE AP POLL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 UCLA, one of only two remaining unbeaten NCAA Division I teams, moved to 
second in the Associated Press poll that was released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins (11-0) are tied for first with Kansas in the USA Today/CNN poll, 
which was released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Kansas, No. 1 in the AP poll, suffered a 68-64 loss to Kansas State 
on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jayhawks (16-2) received 29 first-place votes and 1,552 points from the 
national media panel to edge UCLA, which was first on 26 ballots and had 1,514 
points. Kansas is the fourth team to sit atop the rankings this season, joining 
North Carolina, Kentucky and Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 The only other unbeaten Division I team, St. Louis (14-0), broke into the AP 
top 25 for the first time since the 1964-65 season, when the Billikens got as 
high as fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis is No. 23.

KING SCORES 20 AS FULLERTON RALLIES TO WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Josh King scored a career-high 20 points, 18 of them in the second half, to 
rally Cal State Fullerton to a 74-70 victory over Nevada in a Big West 
Conference game Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing 49-39 with 12 minutes remaining, Fullerton outscored the Wolf Pack, 
13-2, with King scoring eight points and Darren Little contributing five to put 
the Titans up 52-51. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada, 6-8 overall and 2-4 in the Big West, closed to 70-69 when Eathan 
O'Bryan, who scored 16 points, sank a three-pointer with 30 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Vernon scored on a breakaway and two free throws in the final 28 seconds 
to preserve the victory for Fullerton (3-10, 1-4). 
</P>
<P>
 The victory broke a four-game losing streak, and it was the first win of the 
year for the Titans over a Division 1 team. 
</P>
<P>
 Winston Peterson added 18 points for Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy Moore and Walter Outlaw had 14 each for Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada jumped to an early 19-11 lead in the first half, led by Moore with six 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris St. Clair made a three-pointer and a field goal during an 11-point run 
to put the Titans in front 22-19 at the 8:25 mark. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fullerton could sink only one field goal in the final eight minutes and 
Nevada led at the intermission, 31-26. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada's Jerry Hogan made a three-pointer in the first half that gave him a 
school-record 138 for his career. The mark of 137 was set by Kevin Franklin, 
who played for the Wolf Pack from 1988 through '90.

LONG BEACH LOSES, 92-69; GREENBERG EJECTED 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is tough to beat Pacific at home, and Long Beach State tried to do it 
Monday night without Coach Seth Greenberg on the bench in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers lost, 92-69. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg picked up his second technical foul and was ejected with 21 seconds 
left to intermission for yelling at the officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg's absence may not have mattered anyway, since Pacific led 54-32 at 
halftime following a 21-8 run. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory for Pacific, 9-7 overall and 3-2 in the Big West Conference, was 
its 10th in a row at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach (8-4, 3-2) cut the margin to 56-39 with 17:22 to play but could get 
no closer. 
</P>
<P>
 Terrance O'Kelley scored a career-high 25 points for Long Beach and Eric Brown 
had 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Jackson scored 24 points to lead Pacific.

<P>
 Anthony Beane made a one-handed shot from the lane with 12 seconds to play 
Monday night at Lawrence, Kan., lifting Kansas State past No. 1 Kansas, 68-64, 
barely 12 hours after the Jayhawks ascended to the top ranking. 
</P>
<P>
 Beane broke a 64-64 tie with the basket, penetrating the defense and pulling 
up for the shot. He then made two free throws with 1.9 seconds to play to send 
Kansas State past its rival and end a 12-game winning streak for the Jayhawks, 
who are 16-2 overall and 2-1 in the Big Eight Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Beane finished with 18 points and Askia Jones scored 26 for Kansas State 
(12-3, 1-2). Sean Pearson led Kansas with 15 points.

The Jayhawks then failed to get off a final shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas, outrebounding opponents by more than seven a game, was outrebounded, 
44-32. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas trailed, 55-42, with 11 minutes to play after Brian Gavin made a 
three-point shot. The Jayhawks rallied to tie the score on two free throws by 
Steve Woodberry. But Jones then made a three-point shot for a 60-57 lead with 
4:46 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas State led, 64-59, with 1:41 left following a Kansas turnover and two 
free throws by Beane, but Woodberry's basket with with 1:26 pulled Kansas to 
within 64-61. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats, who had lost their first two Big Eight games, went on a 13-0 run 
at the end of the first half and into the second.  
</P>
<P>
 Jones made consecutive three-point shots to give Kansas State a 44-32 lead 
with 17:29 to play before Richard Scott converted a three-point play to end the 
Wildcat streak. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 10 Connecticut 88, Hartford 62 -- Ray Allen scored a career-high 28 points 
to help Connecticut overcome a difficult first half at Hartford. 
</P>
<P>

Huskies (15-1), who trailed Hartford (7-5) by five points before taking a 47-37 
lead at halftime. Allen responded with 18 points in the second half. OTHER

 Othella Harrington had a season-high 21 points and Georgetown (10-3, 4-2) was 
able to hold off a rally despite not scoring a field goal in the final 5:58 in 
a 57-53 Big East Conference victory over Seton Hall (9-5, 2-4) at East 
Rutherford, N.J. . . . Bryan Passink scored 21 points -- including four

USC'S POWELL VOTED TO COLLEGE HALL OF FAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marvin Powell, a former USC offensive tackle, and Tony Dorsett, the Heisman 
Trophy winner from Pittsburgh whose 6,082 career rushing yards is the most in 
NCAA Division I-A, were among 12 players voted Monday to the College Football 
Hall of Fame. Induction is scheduled for next Dec. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Vince Dooley, whose Georgia team won the national title in 1980, was one of 
two coaches chosen. The other was the late John Merritt of Jackson State and 
Tennessee State. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Jets drafted Powell in the first round in 1977. He was the fourth 
player selected overall. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell spent nine seasons with the Jets and two with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Others players chosen by the National Football Foundation were Bob Babich of 
Miami of Ohio, Steve Eisenhauer of Navy, Larry Elkins of Baylor, Pete Elliott 
of Michigan, Tucker Frederickson of Auburn, Jerry Groom of Notre Dame, John 
Hadl of Kansas, Gifford Nielsen of Brigham Young, Ozzie Newsome of Alabama and 
Randy White of Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1973, Dorsett became the first freshman in 29 years to be named to the 
All-America team. He is the only major college runner with three 1,500-yard 
seasons. He holds 18 NCAA records. 
</P>
<P>
 Dooley coached Georgia from 1964-88, and at the time of his retirement ranked 
third nationally in victories. He was 201-77-10, leading his team to six 
Southeastern Conference titles and 20 bowl appearances in 25 seasons, including 
his last nine.

MUMFORD COMES THROUGH FOR ANTEATERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He may look odd as he skitters around the court with goggles to protect the 
stitches in his left eyelid, but give Lloyd Mumford this: Tear his eyelid, he 
plays; twist his ankle, he plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Put the game on the line with the clock running out, and Mumford usually does 
something . And as the second-half clock was ticking and UC Irvine was 
threatening to watch another lead evaporate, Mumford scored seven consecutive 
points that helped propel the Anteaters to a 78-71 victory over Utah State 
before 6,196 spectators Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Mumford led the Anteaters (5-7, 2-2) with 18 points and added six assists, and 
the question people were dying to ask afterward was: Lloyd, don't those threads 
hanging over your left eyeball affect your shot? 
</P>
<P>
 "Um, yeah," Mumford said. "But I'm not a complainer. I just have a sprained 
foot and 12 stitches over my eye, but all I want to do is win games." 
</P>
<P>
 Uh, thought that was eight stitches there, Lloyd. 
</P>
<P>
 "It goes up every day," he said, grinning. 
</P>
<P>
 When you break a three-game losing streak and finally get back on track, even 
for one night, who cares about details? 
</P>
<P>
 Utah State (6-8, 3-3), playing without 7-foot Nathan Wickizer (who sprained 
his ankle Saturday against Cal State Fullerton), turned the ball over only five 
times. Irvine, which led for 37:30 of the first 38 minutes, watched the Aggies 
go on a 7-0 run to take a 69-68 lead with 2:15 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 But then something happened. The Anteaters started getting the ball inside, 
and DeForrest Boyer, who finished with 17 points on five-of-eight shooting, 
completed a three-point play, hit an inside shot and sank a free throw. Mumford 
made four more free throws. And Irvine scored 10 of the game's last 12 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "At halftime, Coach told us we were going to dump the ball inside and go to 
the hoop," Boyer said. "That's what we're going to have to do to be effective." 
</P>
<P>
 And what helped the Anteaters, recovering from a 98-85 loss at Nevada on 
Saturday, was Boyer's inside work, which opened up the outside. Irvine made six 
of 11 three-pointers.  
</P>
<P>
 And Mumford scored seven points in a row around the eight-minute mark to keep 
Irvine on top, 63-58. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nevada was able to extend its defense to our shooters," Irvine Coach Rod 
Baker said. "Tonight, Mark Odsather (nine points) got a wide-open shot, Lloyd 
Mumford got wide-open shots, Todd Whitehead (nine points) got wide-open shots 
and Chris Brown (nine points) got wide-open shots -- and that never happens. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, we answered the call tonight because we got open shots." 
</P>
<P>
 And on the flip side, even though Irvine's press and man-to-man defense caused 
only five turnovers, Baker still was pleased with the way it worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just want the game to be played at a certain rate and we got that 
tonight," Baker said. "If we get a turnover, fine, but that's not the issue. 
The issue is getting the game to be played a certain way." 
</P>
<P>
 Mumford is a large part of that game plan, whether he scores or passes or 
presses. His penetration Monday helped open some things. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's my job sometimes, not scoring but getting certain people in certain 
positions," Mumford said. "Tonight, what they needed me to be was 
offensive-minded. I hadn't been going to the hoop, and Coach confronted me on 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 It was all enough to impress Utah State Coach Larry Eustachy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Irvine didn't crack," he said. "You've got to give them credit. They had a 
chance to crack but didn't. This is the best team they've had in the last few 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Eustachy would have minded a couple of extra days to prepare. 
</P>
<P>
 "We play better when we have time to prepare for someone," Eustachy said. "We 
had a week to prepare for Fullerton (which Utah State defeated Saturday, 
59-50). For Irvine, we had one hour on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why we play four games in eight days, I don't know. But we have these 
million-dollar TV contracts . . ."

TITANS BACK IN HOLLAND'S FAVOR AFTER VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brad Holland's love-hate relationship with this city tipped in favor of the 
love aspect Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Last February, the Cal State Fullerton coach brought a team on the rise here. 
The Titans were 12-5, 7-3 in the Big West, but they lost to Nevada and Holland 
suspended three starters for missing curfew after the game. The Titans fell 
into a tailspin and won only three more games. 
</P>
<P>
 Holland openly campaigned for the Nevada job during the off-season, however. 
He lost out to former Houston Coach Pat Foster and then lost recruit Eathan 
O'Bryant -- who had orally committed to Fullerton -- to Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 But Monday night's 74-70 victory against the Wolf Pack in front of 5,117 in 
the Lawlor Events Center -- the Titans' first victory in the Big West and first 
against an NCAA team -- made up for that. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was an outstanding, badly needed win," Holland said, smiling. "I'm just 
so proud of these guys. We've been in the position to win some games but 
weren't able to put 40 minutes together until tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans (3-10, 1-4 in conference) had their lapses, though, and ended up 
having to sweat out a victory it appeared they had sealed when they went ahead, 
66-59, with 2:26 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Bryant's three-pointer with 36 seconds left cut Fullerton's lead to only one 
(70-69), however, and it seemed as if Nevada (6-8, 2-4) might conjure up some 
of the magic that helped it win six of eight previous home games. But Greg 
Vernon slipped behind the Wolf Pack press for a layup and then made two free 
throws. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made some foul shots tonight," Holland said, "and I can think of three or 
four games that we lost because we didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton made nine of 10 first-half free throws and 18 of 25 in the second 
half, including two clutch ones by freshman Josh King with 59 seconds remaining 
to put the Titans ahead, 70-66. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are free shots and you ought to make them," King said. "I blocked out 
all that screaming. You know, Coach Holland had me in there at the end and you 
have to perform if he puts that kind of confidence in you. 
</P>
<P>
 "This feels so great." 
</P>
<P>
 King, who scored a career-high 20 points to lead all scorers, had 14 points in 
the final 12 minutes as the Titans turned a 47-36 deficit into their biggest 
victory of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Josh had an outstanding game," Holland said. "He played more like a junior 
than a freshman. He was so clutch with those little high-post jumpers. But it 
was a total team effort.

earthquake damage to his Hidden Hills home, Southern Truce ended a nine-race 
losing streak Monday by winning the $160,600 Santa Monica Handicap by a 
half-length. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Stein, the trainer's brother, saddled Southern Truce for her 17th victory 
in 39 starts, including six in nine tries at Santa Anita. The 6-year-old mare, 
claimed by Roger Stein three years ago for $16,000, earned $93,100 Monday, 
increasing her purses to almost $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Truce, ridden by Gary Stevens, won for the first time since March. 
She was sixth after a half-mile, six lengths behind Mamselle Bebette, who set a 
rapid 44 1/5 pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Truce was still sixth at the top of the stretch, but Mamselle Bebette 
tired and Stevens' horse was clear of traffic and outfinished Arches Of Gold 
from the outside. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was five minutes from the track when they ran the race," Stein said by 
phone. "There's not one thing in my house that wasn't bounced around by the 
earthquake, so this finishes just one of those unbelievable days. I really 
didn't think my mare was going to win this race, but she's just such a terrific 
tryer." 
</P>
<P>
 Stein estimated that about $700,000 of Southern Truce's earnings have come 
since he claimed her for Peggy Johnson. Southern Truce was close to being sold 
by Johnson on two occasions, most recently an apparent $250,000 offer that 
didn't materialize last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Truce paid $25, running seven furlongs in 1:21 2/5. Golden Arches 
finished two lengths ahead of Mamselle Bebette, who went off co-favored with 
Desert Stormer. 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Anita officials made the decision to race about 9:30 a.m. Monday after 
an inspection showed that track didn't sustain any structural damage. . . . 
There were several aftershocks during the card. . . . The on-track holiday 
crowd of 19,001 was about 11,000 less than what the track expected before the 
earthquake. . . . At Hollywood Park, morning workouts were canceled because the 
earthquake blew glass out of the press box on to the track. . . . Because of 
the earthquake, Santa Anita-based Paul Atkinson couldn't get a flight to San 
Francisco to ride Lindzell, who won the $100,000 Bay Meadows Oaks at 7-1 with 
substitute jockey Gary Boulanger.

 Two neo-Nazis were convicted and sentenced to jail Monday for leading a 
beating attack on a U.S. luge racer after insulting his black teammate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oct. 29 attack on Duncan Kennedy in the nearby winter resort of Oberhof 
embarrassed Germany and outraged Americans. It was the first against an 
American in a wave of neo-Nazi violence that has swept Germany since 
unification in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Tino Voelkel, 16, and Silvio Eschrich, 21, were found guilty of causing 
grievous bodily harm after a one-day trial at Suhl, Germany. Eschrich also was 
convicted of beating an Oberhof man an hour after the attack on Kennedy.

 Foster, a defender last season and during summer league, was expected to 
continue in that role this season.But when Sunny Hills' coaches decided the 
Lancers needed help on offense, Foster was happy to step up. Last week, she had 
two goals and an assist in each of two Freeway League victories. Foster, who 
has six goals and three assists this season, accounted for all of the Lancers' 
goals in a 3-1 victory over La Habra, considered the most serious challenger to 
Sunny Hills' three-season hold on the league title. The Lancers also beat 
Sonora, 7-1. Other notables:

UC IRVINE NOTEBOOK / JOHN WEYLER; BAKER'S PRACTICES TURN ANTEATERS INTO EARLY 
BIRDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 'Twas the morning before practice and all across campus, not a creature was 
stirring . . . except a small group of yawning Anteaters. 
</P>
<P>
 At 5 a.m., the Bren Center is an unrecognizable lump in the darkness. On 
closer inspection, however, a thin line of light spills out from under a back 
door and the faint squeak of sneakers drifts on a light breeze. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh man, when that alarm goes off at 4:30, it's really tough to get up," said 
forward Elzie Love, whose alarm didn't go off on this morning. He was 17 
minutes late, which meant the whole team did 17 nonstop minutes of full-court 
layup drills after a 2 1/2-hour practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Due to a number of conflicts with classes, Coach Rod Baker has had difficulty 
scheduling afternoon practices that all team members can attend. So he's 
holding practices in the morning, sometimes beginning at 5, sometimes starting 
at 6 or 6:30. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some mornings are better than others, but I thought we got after it pretty 
good today," Baker said after a wee-hour workout last week. "The guys complain 
a little bit, but then I remind them that at Temple, they do this every 
morning. And it's pretty cold to come crawling out at 5 in the morning in 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Heck, it's downright balmy here." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the players agree it's the buzz of the alarm that's most obnoxious.  
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I'm concerned, anything before 8 o'clock is the same," senior Khari 
Johnson said, "but it is really hard when it's still pitch black outside. Once 
you get into it, though, it's fine." 
</P>
<P>
 At least one player, Mark Odsather, a junior forward from Bellevue, Wash., 
doesn't mind the early-morning practices. When his alarm goes off, it brings 
back fond memories. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love it," Odsather said. "Really, I don't mind it all. I'm a fisherman, so 
getting up early is like second nature to me." 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the Anteaters may not be as bright-eyed or bushy-tailed as 
Odsather, but they had better get used to it. Baker says the majority of the 
team's practices the remainder of this season will start before the sun rises. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hurry Zuri: Point guard Zuri Williams, who started seven games this year but 
was relegated to back-up status when Lloyd Mumford was moved back to point 
guard, will have to pick up his offensive output if he wants to continue 
getting significant playing time. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams has played more minutes than anyone except Mumford and Jermaine Avie, 
but he has taken only 44 shots this year and is averaging only 3.7 points.  
</P>
<P>
 Baker says he has told Williams it's time to start thinking about his offense. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not something he's used to," Baker said. "It's almost like a last-ditch 
thought for him. He's got a great assists-to-turnover ratio (2 to 1), but 
sometimes it's a situation where it's almost like we're playing four against 
five when he's in there. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just needs to take charge. When Lloyd's not in the game, it's his team and 
he's got to realize that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Itchy scratchy: Mumford, who suffered a lacerated left eyelid against Nevada 
Las Vegas, was back in action -- wearing protective goggles -- Saturday night 
against Nevada and Monday night at Utah State. But the injury is clearly 
bothering him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hurts every time I blink," Mumford said after the game at Nevada, "and I 
can't really see out of it very well. They put stitches on the inside of the 
eyelid and every time I blink, it scratches my eyeball." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Revolving door: Baker says his team's strength is its depth and 11 Anteaters 
average 9.5 or more minutes. But Baker runs them in and out of the action so 
often that continuity seems to be one of the Anteaters' myriad problems this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Players are reluctant to criticize Baker's substitution method, but one 
recently admitted that "it is kind of tough to get into the flow sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The last word? Assistant coach Greg Vetrone, scolding forward Love for not 
getting back on defense during practice: "That's the same thing that happened 
last game. You were (fooling) around underneath the basket when you should have 
been getting back." 
</P>
<P>
 Love: "I didn't play in the last game." 
</P>
<P>

BOWLING; WILLIAMS HAS BECOME A RINGER ON PRO TOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNYDER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Unique in sports is Walter Ray Williams Jr., master of the underhanded 
delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 His dominance in horseshoe pitching earned him world titles, first as a junior 
at 11 and later as an adult, when he won five championships.  
</P>
<P>
 Now the 34-year-old from Stockton is making his move in his other sport, 
bowling. Much as Don Carter, Dick Weber, Earl Anthony and Mark Roth had their 
eras of supremacy on the lanes, Walter Ray Williams' era might be here. 
</P>
<P>
 Heading into the $220,000 AC-Delco PBA tournament starting Wednesday at Cal 
Bowl in Lakewood, Williams is fresh from a year of history-making dominance in 
pro bowling. 
</P>
<P>
 He set four pro records: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Highest earnings in a single year, $296,370. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Highest single-year scoring average, 222.98 (for 1,300 games in 33 events). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Most 300 games in a tournament, four, in the Greater Harrisburg (Pa.) Open. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Most consecutive 200 games, 61.  
</P>
<P>
 His seven titles fell one short of tying another single-year mark. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Williams, a sizable performer among the pros at 6 feet 2 and 180 
pounds, was the overwhelming choice of the Bowling Writers Assn. of America as 
bowler of the year, and of fellow professionals as pro player of the year, 
honors he had previously won with less impressive credentials in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams will use an arsenal of reactive resin bowling balls on the synthetic 
lanes at the "new look" Lakewood center, lately refurbished. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a relatively new kind of urethane ball," he said. "It slides a little 
more on oil (lane dressing) and hooks a little more on a dry spot (where the 
oil dissipates during play). Properly controlled, the ball can do wonders." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams is known for his accuracy, whether rolling a 16-pound ball at bowling 
pins 60 feet down a lane or hurling the two-pound horseshoe 40 feet around a 
14-inch-high metal stake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suppose my way since school days has been to focus with intensity on 
whatever I am doing." Williams said. "Even in practice, I find myself deeply 
engrossed in testing shots, assessing reasons why shots are successful or 
fail." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams was an achiever all through his growing years, according to his 
mother, Esther. "He concentrated so intently on a subject, his grammar school 
teachers had to startle him into moving on to the next lesson," she said. "I 
feel his power of concentration as a student carries over today to explain his 
success in competition." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, a bachelor whose interest apart from sports is computer programming, 
was an honor graduate at Placer Union High in Auburn, Calif., before he earned 
a degree in physics at Cal Poly Pomona.

 His focus at the moment is the $40,000 first prize in the tournament at hand. 
The money will be on the line in a nationally televised final at noon Saturday.

 Williams took up bowling seriously at 17. He has 13 titles and numerous 
runner-up finishes for his 10 years on the pro trail. He has yet to win, 
however, in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult to predict a win in pro bowling with so many great players 
today," Williams said.  
</P>
<P>
 "At the moment, I feel I've reached a new and higher level of performance. I'm 
looking forward to doing as well this year as last."

THE PREPS / ERIC SHEPARD: EVENTS ON HOLD AS DAMAGE IS ASSESSED 
</P>

 Monday's earthquake left high school athletic administrators scrambling, 
wondering when and if practices and games will be able to return to a normal 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Monday was a holiday and school was not in session, nothing was 
immediately affected. But administrators were certain many schools would have 
to cancel scheduled events until all facilities are deemed safe. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49 high schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District will be closed 
again today, meaning practices for boys' and girls' basketball, boys' and 
girls' soccer and wrestling will be canceled. Wednesday's games are uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll just have to evaluate things on a day-to-day basis," said Barbara 
Fiege, district athletic commissioner. "With a district this big, you try to go 
on as close to normal as possible, but at this point it's probable some of our 
schools will have damage that will prohibit athletics." 
</P>
<P>
 Fiege said that many gymnasiums were being used as emergency shelters, so some 
activities would probably have to be moved or canceled. Several schools in the 
San Fernando Valley are known to have been damaged, including Granada Hills 
Kennedy High. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't seen the gym yet," said Yutaka Shimizu, Kennedy's boys' basketball 
coach. "But I don't see how we can play basketball right now. Many of my 
players are bused from far away, so they may have trouble just getting to the 
school." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Halpern, boys' basketball coach at Reseda, said he spoke with several 
players whose homes were heavily damaged. He said he had not driven past the 
school, but assumed that it would be several days before the team could play. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're having a good season, but something like this really puts wins and 
losses in perspective," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Crowley, Southern Section athletic commissioner, said his office will be 
open today, helping schools cancel or reschedule events as necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll rely on our principals to decide what is possible and what isn't," 
Crowley said. "I'm certain several of our schools in the San Fernando Valley 
will not be safe enough for games. But we're not going to have any forfeits. 
Teams that can't play will be given the chance to reschedule or have a no 
contest." 
</P>

 With the national signing day for football two weeks away, several of the 
Southland's top players are making unwritten commitments. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the area's most highly regarded recruits, quarterback Scott Covington 
of Dana Hills in Dana Point, committed to Miami on Monday. Covington, 6 feet 4 
and 180 pounds, had been heavily recruited by USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Covington completed 58% of his passes for 1,700 yards last season, even though 
the Dolphins finished 1-9. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (Miami) have a situation where they need a quarterback and they need one 
quick," Covington said. "I'm very excited." 
</P>
<P>
 Another of the area' top recruits, Glenn Thompkins of Rialto Eisenhower, said 
reports that he had committed to UCLA were not true. Although he is high on the 
Bruins, he said, he is also considering Oklahoma, Colorado and Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompkins, 5-9 and 165, played quarterback and defensive back for the Eagles, 
who finished the season 14-0 and won the Southern Section Division I title. He 
was selected player of the year in the Southland by The Times. He is being 
recruited as a wide receiver and defensive back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care what I play, as long as I'm on the field," Thompkins said. 
"Being able to play right away is a major factor in my decision. UCLA has 
heavily recruited me since last August, and they're my favorite right now." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins have already received a commitment from another top local recruit, 
quarterback Steve Buck of Alta Loma. Buck, 6-4, 195, completed 56% of his 
passes for 1,700 yards last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Leon Blunt of San Fernando, who committed to Notre Dame last 
month, said he still plans to sign with the Fighting Irish despite rumors that 
have him now leaning toward USC. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The girls' basketball team at Playa del Rey St. Bernard has been criticized by 
many of its rivals for not moving up a division this season. The Vikings won 
the State Division IV title last year and are among the top teams in the area.  
</P>
<P>
 St. Bernard competes in the Southern Section Division IV-AA. Division I-AA is 
for the largest schools and V-A for the smallest. Schools have the option of 
moving up one or more divisions, but they had to declare a change by Dec. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because everyone on the outside thought we should move up, our administration 
met to discuss the matter," Coach Lori Pawinski said. "But we opted to try and 
defend our title. We certainly feel we're capable of competing with the 
Division I schools, but I am against moving up and down divisions every season. 
Some years you might be loaded and others years you won't be. I feel its best 
to play schools that are similar in size." 
</P>
<P>
 Pawinski is probably feeling better about her decision after last week. The 
Vikings lost to Mission Hills Alemany and Torrance Bishop Montgomery, dropping 
to 16-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Prep Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Paez, boys' basketball coach at Wilmington Banning, was ejected from last 
week's game against Crenshaw after getting three technical fouls. Since none of 
his assistant coaches are paid, City Section rules required that the game be 
called. It ended with 3 minutes 5 seconds left in the first half and Crenshaw 
leading, 54-14. "(Paez) complained about the hard play because Crenshaw was 
doing a lot of hand-checking, but that's going to happen," said referee Eugene 
Conner. . . . The Roosevelt girls' basketball team may have to forfeit nine 
victories for using an ineligible player, junior Jennifer Brambila. Brambila, a 
transfer from Wilson, will appeal. Times' Top 20 Basketball Polls

L.A. UNIVERSITY BEAT / WENDY WITHERSPOON; BRUIN GYMNAST ROSAS OWES DEBT TO 
PETER PAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY WITHERSPOON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Misty Rosas was wearing a Donald Duck costume and Peter Pan was telling her 
that she ought to consider going to college. 
</P>
<P>
 Wacky as that sounds, it is lucky for the UCLA women's gymnastics team that 
Rosas decided to heed that advice.  
</P>
<P>
 Rosas, a 20-year-old Bruin freshman, is a former elite gymnast who quit the 
sport four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last 1 1/2 years, she has played characters in the show "Fantasmic" at 
Disneyland. That's where she met Randy Lane, who was playing Peter Pan. 
</P>
<P>
 Lane, in his second year as a UCLA assistant coach, knew about Rosas' 
gymnastics background and persuaded her to go to UCLA and try out for the 
gymnastics team. 
</P>
<P>
 Once she proved she hadn't lost her skills, co-coaches Valorie Kondos and 
Scott Bull gave her a scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 And Rosas is one of the reasons the Bruins are expected to contend for the 
national championship this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like we've been given a very precious gift," Kondos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting back into gymnastics has not been easy for Rosas, who once had dreams 
of competing in the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 At 12, Rosas moved out of her home near San Juan Capistrano to live and train 
with the Southern California Acro Team under Coach Don Peters in Huntington 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years later, she broke her back while doing a release move on the uneven 
bars. Then she returned to the sport too quickly and her back took a long time 
to heal properly. 
</P>
<P>
 After another year of competing, mostly in pain, Rosas was burned out. She was 
16. 
</P>
<P>
 She left the gym, finished high school at San Clemente High and worked at a 
car dealership before auditioning for a part in "Fantasmic." But she never 
completely got away from the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "I missed it a lot," Rosas said. "I would fool around with friends that were 
either stunt people or gymnasts and we would condition and work out." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosas has the work ethic of an elite gymnast, which is what kept her in good 
enough shape to return to the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is one of these people that when you say, 'OK, do one more,' she does 
five more," Kondos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosas maintained her flexibility through dance and increased her strength in 
her legs through aerobic dancing and running. She has regained her skill in 
tumbling. 
</P>
<P>
 But that doesn't mean that getting up on a narrow balance beam and doing flips 
-- flips she used to do so easily -- does not scare her. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she often thinks, "I'm back up here again doing this? I was scared 
before and I'm scared now." 
</P>
<P>
 But the most difficult hurdle facing Rosas at UCLA is not in the gym, but in 
the classroom. She did not go through a traditional high school education 
because she studied with tutors at SCATS and completed most of her work at San 
Clemente through independent studies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely going to be a struggle," Rosas said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rosas, who is 4-feet-8, thrives on challenges and the element of danger. 
She once jumped off a two-story house and landed on a foam mat, just for fun. 
Thrill-seeking is partly what led her to return to gymnastics. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's how it is going to be my whole life, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since Kondos and Bull became co-head coaches at UCLA four years ago, they have 
steadily improved the women's program. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins did not qualify for the NCAA championships in the 1990-91 season, 
but finished second at the NCAA West Regional and ninth at the national 
championships in their first season under Kondos and Bull. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, the Bruins won the West Regional championship and finished fourth 
at the NCAA meet. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA defeated Stanford, 188.2-187.275, Friday at Palo Alto in its season 
opener.

NBA ROUNDUP; BULLETS LOSE CHAPMAN BECAUSE OF ANKLE INJURY

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Washington Bullets' leading scorer, guard Rex Chapman, will be sidelined 
for up to 10 weeks after he dislocated his right ankle in Monday's 100-87 loss 
to the San Antonio Spurs at Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman, who is averaging 18.4 points a game, suffered the injury when he 
landed on the foot of the Spurs' Lloyd Daniels while driving toward the basket 
in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 San Antonio's Dale Ellis scored 16 of his 20 points before halftime as the 
Spurs took control late in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 San Antonio center David Robinson sat out the game because of a sore right 
knee, though the injury is not believed serious. 
</P>
<P>
 He had started in 119 consecutive games dating to the start of last season. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 106, Minnesota 94 -- Patrick Ewing scored 34 points at New York, 
becoming the first Knick player with 15,000 for his career, and the Knicks 
extended their winning streak to five games. 
</P>
<P>
 Ewing had 13 points in the fourth quarter, stifling the Timberwolves' rally 
from a 20-point halftime deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden State 104, Phoenix 99 -- Latrell Sprewell made two free throws with 11 
seconds to play and Dan Majerle shot an air ball from three-point range five 
seconds later as the Warriors won at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden State won its fourth in a row overall and its first in its last seven 
games against the Suns. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah 109, Detroit 94 -- Karl Malone had 25 points and 11 assists and was one 
rebound short of a triple-double to lift the Jazz at Auburn Hills, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss was Detroit's 13th in a row, one short of the franchise's 
single-season record. It was the Pistons' eighth consecutive home loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 102, Milwaukee 98 -- Dominique Wilkins matched his season high with 38 
points, including 16 in the third period, as the Hawks improved their home 
record to an NBA-best 17-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 114, Orlando 107 -- Gerald Wilkins scored all of his 26 points in 
the second half and Mark Price made a tie-breaking three-point shot with a 
minute to play at Richfield, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 121, Philadelphia 91 -- Scottie Pippen and B.J. Armstrong sparked a 
third-quarter spurt with 11 points each as Chicago won its 14th consecutive 
home game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulls, with 16 victories in their last 19 games, led by 12 points at the 
half and broke away in the third quarter, outscoring the 76ers, 33-19, to open 
a 92-66 lead.

USC'S POWELL NAMED TO COLLEGE HALL OF FAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marvin Powell, a former USC offensive tackle, and Tony Dorsett, the Heisman 
Trophy winner from Pittsburgh whose 6,082 career rushing yards is the most in 
NCAA Division I-A, were among 12 players named Monday to the College Football 
Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Induction is scheduled for next Dec. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Vince Dooley, whose Georgia team won the national title in 1980, was one of 
two coaches chosen. The other was the late John Merritt of Jackson State and 
Tennessee State. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell was another in a long line of great linemen at USC. The New York Jets 
drafted him in the first round 1977. He was the fourth player selected overall. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell spent nine seasons with the Jets and two with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Others players chosen by the National Football Foundation were Bob Babich of 
Miami of Ohio, Steve Eisenhauer of Navy, Larry Elkins of Baylor, Pete Elliott 
of Michigan, Tucker Frederickson of Auburn, Jerry Groom of Notre Dame, John 
Hadl of Kansas, Gifford Nielsen of Brigham Young, Ozzie Newsome of Alabama and 
Randy White of Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1973, Dorsett became the first freshman in 29 years to be named to the 
All-America team. He is the only major college runner with three 1,500-yard 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsett, who also is on the ballot this year for the pro football Hall of 
Fame, holds 18 NCAA records. He was an unanimous All-American as a senior in 
1976, when Pitt went 12-0 and won the national title. 
</P>
<P>
 Dooley coached Georgia from 1964 to 1988, and at the time of his retirement 
ranked third nationally in victories. He was 201-77-10, leading his team to six 
Southeastern Conference titles and 20 bowl appearances in 25 seasons, including 
his last nine. 
</P>
<P>
 Dooley, now the athletic director at Georgia, was SEC coach of the year seven 
times and national coach of the year in 1980.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Scott Covington, a quarterback from Dana Hills High, has made an oral 
commitment to attend Miami, former Dana Hills Coach Jack Murry said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Covington, a first-team All-South Coast League selection, completed 58% of his 
passes for more than 1,700 yards last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, it's a great opportunity," Covington said. "I'll get to play for a 
team that can contend for the national championship every year." 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-4, 180-pound senior was a preseason Superprep magazine Far-West 
All-American and chose the Hurricanes over Alabama, Wisconsin, USC and 
Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami Coach Dennis Erickson came to the Covington residence Dec. 1, the first 
day coaches could visit recruits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess that shows I was important to them," Covington said. "They have a 
situation where they need a quarterback and they need one quick. I'm very 
excited." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 David Schuetz, a 6-4, 225-pound outside linebacker from Dana Hills, made an 
oral commitment to Oregon, Murry said. Schuetz was a first-team All-South Coast 
selection in 1992, but played in only one game last season after breaking his 
leg. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Williams of El Dorado, a 6-6, 260-pound offensive lineman who was 
first-team Times All-Orange County, will attend UCLA, he said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, chose UCLA over USC, Colorado, California and Arizona State. Former 
Esperanza standout Travis Kirschke, the 1992 Times Orange County lineman of the 
year, hosted Williams' visit to UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played against Travis and I grew up loving the Bruins," Williams said. 
Steve Williams, Terry's brother, played for UCLA from 1980-84. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Darryl Jones, a first-team All-Division X offensive lineman from Brethren 
Christian, made an oral commitment to Washington State, Brethren Christian 
Coach Ken Sharrar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, 6-3, 295, earned All-Olympic honors the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mitch McCrimmon, a first-team all-county offensive lineman from Capistrano 
Valley, made an oral commitment to Villanova, Capistrano Valley Coach Eric 
Patton said. 
</P>
<P>
 McCrimmon, who is 6-6, 270 pounds, earned first-team Division I and first-team 
All-South Coast League honors. He chose the Wildcats, who play in Division 
I-AA, over New Mexico and San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
 Teammate Levi Roquemore, a 6-1, 225-pound linebacker who earned second-team 
all-county honors, made an oral commitment to New Mexico, Patton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roquemore, an All-South Coast selection the past two seasons, chose New Mexico 
over Fresno State and Villanova. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brad and Brian Finneran of Santa Margarita, both first-team all-county 
selections, made oral commitments to Villanova, their brother Baron confirmed 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad, an all-county defensive back, had a county-leading seven interceptions. 
Brian, an all-county wide receiver, finished his career with an all-time Orange 
County-record 178 receptions. Only John McKay, of USC and La Puente Bishop 
Amat, caught more passes (207) in section history. MICHAEL ITAGAKI

PERSONAL HEALTH; ON SELF-IMAGE, PREGNANCY WEIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If a woman feels unattractive before her pregnancy, she is less likely to gain 
enough weight to ensure a healthy baby, a University of Michigan dietitian and 
researcher has found. 
</P>
<P>
 Viktoria L. Shayna surveyed 172 pregnant women, ages 14-35, during their third 
trimester, most of them pregnant for the first time.They answered questions 
about body image before and during pregnancy, and supplied information on 
eating and exercise habits, their heights and weights. 
</P>
<P>
 Women who were very slender before pregnancy also tended to gain too little, 
Shayna found. Women sensitive to others' comments about their changing profiles 
also tended not to gain the 20 to 35 pounds generally recommended for 
normal-weight women during pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 The older the woman, the less likely these comments were to bother her, said 
Shayna, who presented her research at an American Dietetic Assn. meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Inadequate weight gain increases the risk of having a low-birth-weight baby, 
who in turn is at higher risk for health problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women need to be reassured that pregnancy weight does not have to be 
considered unattractive and can be lost after pregnancy," Shayna said. Her 
advice: "Eat when you feel hungry and in a (healthful) way." 
</P>
<P>
 What's also needed, she said, is more research -- including an examination of 
what effect a husband's attitudes might have on weight gain: "His role might be 
quite important, but we don't know that for a fact." KATHLEEN DOHENY

A WARNING ABOUT CHILDREN AND ACETAMINOPHEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARI ROAN, TIMES HEALTH WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The baby was teething. Fussing and crying, the 8-month-old was awake all hours 
of the night. Not even doses of the Tylenol for babies seemed to help. 
</P>
<P>
 So the child's worried father did what he thought was best: He gave his son a 
stronger dose -- crushing adult Tylenol tablets and putting them in with the 
baby's bottle. 
</P>
<P>
 "The baby was crying much more than normal," said the Arleta man, who asked 
not to be identified. "The baby Tylenol had no effect." 
</P>
<P>
 Three days later, the child was comatose and near death from an accidental 
overdose that experts say happens several dozen times each year in the United 
States: Parents give their ill children too much of the pain-reliever 
acetaminophen. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past year, Dr. Sue McDiarmid, director of the Pediatric Liver 
Transplant Program at UCLA Medical Center, has performed two emergency liver 
transplants on local children because they were given too much acetaminophen 
for mild illness or fever. Last month, she also treated the 8-month-old baby, 
who recovered without the need for a liver transplant. 
</P>
<P>
 Although this type of overdose is rare, McDiarmid wants to get the message out 
loud and clear during this harsh flu season: Too much acetaminophen can result 
in liver failure and even death. 
</P>
<P>
 "This type of accident is totally preventable," she says. "Parents are giving 
too much, too often, over several days. It's a chronic poisoning." 
</P>
<P>
 These accidents have also led to suggestions that labels on acetaminophen -- 
sold under the brand name Tylenol as well as many generic brands -- should be 
changed to be more specific about the potential dangers. 
</P>
<P>
 But a spokesman for the manufacturer of Tylenol, McNeil Consumer Products Co., 
says: "These cases of acetaminophen toxicity are extremely rare, and 
invariably, are associated with misuse of the product. We feel our labeling is 
unequivocally clear. We do not see any need to change this label." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Acetaminophen is considered a safe drug when taken according to directions. It 
is commonly prescribed for fever, minor aches and pain, and irritation, and it 
is highly effective. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps because it so commonly prescribed, overdoses have become more common, 
says Dr. Ronald W. Busuttil, chief of liver transplant services at UCLA. But 
few people recognize the dangers of taking too much acetaminophen. 
</P>
<P>
 "The number of overdoses has probably gotten worse because so many medicines 
have acetaminophen in them nowadays," he says. "There needs to be an 
understanding that, although acetaminophen is a good drug, we have to be 
cautious. If we abuse it, the consequences are tragic." 
</P>
<P>
 Equally important, McDiarmid says, is that parents should buy the right 
product for the right age group and "follow the directions to the letter." 
</P>
<P>
 Medicines vary in strength according to the ages for which it is intended. 
Most products for adults do not give dosage levels for children under 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too many parents think, 'If we don't have the pediatric acetaminophen, we'll 
just give the adult acetaminophen, but we'll give less.' " 
</P>
<P>
 It is difficult to determine just how many children become seriously ill from 
this particular type of acetaminophen overdose, McDiarmid says. The National 
Poison Control Center reported 40,000 cases of acetaminophen overdoses in 1992, 
most of which were not serious. For example, in many cases the child was given 
-- or took -- one extra dose, which is not usually harmful. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least several dozen probably involved chronic poisoning. A doubling of 
the correct dose given every four hours for two days can cause toxic levels and 
destroy the liver, McDiarmid says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Children's bodies have an enormous capacity to handle an overdose of 
acetaminophen without serious consequence -- even more so than adult bodies, in 
part because children's livers are healthier. But what is so tragic about these 
rare cases, McDiarmid says, is that by the time the overdose is discovered, the 
child is often near death and needs a liver transplant to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 What usually happens is that the child recovers from a mild illness, such as 
influenza, and the parent stops giving the drug. But 24 to 72 hours later, the 
child gets sleepy and may even act bizarre or aggressive. Seizures and vomiting 
may occur. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because the child had seemed fine before, people have a false sense of 
security that it didn't involve the acetaminophen," McDiarmid says. "Parents 
and doctors can really get fooled." 
</P>
<P>
 This delay between the time the acetaminophen is stopped and the overdose 
symptoms appear is due to the long time required for the body to metabolize the 
drug, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 If the overdose is discovered before the symptoms set in, a medication can be 
given to prevent liver damage. But, she says, "this antidote has to be given 
within 16 hours of the overdose. So it's unlikely to be of much help. The horse 
is already out of the barn and down the road." 
</P>
<P>
 Once the poisoning is recognized, a liver transplant is usually required to 
save the child, she says. That means taking whatever liver is available, 
including one that might not be the best match. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA doctors say Nathan Card, 6, was lucky to have received a donor liver on 
Oct. 28, 1993, when he was near death from acetaminophen poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother, Carrie Ackley of Yucaipa, had given the child Tylenol frequently 
for a fever and ear infection. 
</P>
<P>
 But three days later, Nathan started vomiting. By the next day, he was in a 
coma. He recovered after a liver transplant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't figure it out," Ackley says. "I can't understand how, in 24 hours, he 
could have gotten so much (better) and could have gotten so ill. I had no idea 
that (acetaminophen) could do such a thing. I would have thought that there 
would have been a huge warning label that you can have liver failure and die." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The UCLA doctors say parents need to learn that acetaminophen can be toxic 
when given in overdose levels and to be careful when providing the drug. But 
they also say they would prefer a more specific label warning. 
</P>
<P>
 The labels on Tylenol products state: "Keep this and all medications out of 
the reach of children. In case of accidental overdose, contact a physician or 
poison control center immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the label needs to be changed to say, 'If the recommended dose is 
exceeded, liver failure or death can occur,' " McDiarmid says. This kind of 
warning, she says, would be more in line with the specific warnings on aspirin 
products, which state that aspirin can cause Reye's Syndrome, a potentially 
fatal illness, in young children. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has also taken notice of the problem. In 
January, 1992, FDA commissioner David Kessler warned parents that many 
over-the-counter medications, such as multi-symptom cold and flu products, 
contain acetaminophen. A child might get an overdose if given regular 
acetaminophen plus one of these products. 
</P>
<P>
 The manufacturers of acetaminophen point out that they produce many different 
preparations for different age groups to ensure that overdose doesn't occur. 
</P>
<P>
 That is what happened to the Orr family of Simi Valley. A year ago, Crystal 
Orr, then 5, received a liver transplant at UCLA after her parents gave her an 
accidental overdose of adult Tylenol. Crystal, ill with a fever of 102 degrees 
for several days, had been given Extra-Strength Tylenol Caplets. Two tablets 
contain 1,000 milligrams of acetaminophen. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Orrs' attorney, Bob Scott, Troy and Sandy Orr gave her half 
the adult dose, 500 milligram, about every four hours for a period of about two 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 But, a 5-year-old child should receive a dose of about 240 milligram. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orrs are suing the manufacturer of Tylenol, charging that specific 
warnings should be on all acetaminophen products so that parents are warned to 
avoid using the drug liberally or guessing about dosages. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the middle of the night and the child was in great discomfort (from 
strep throat)," Scott says. "They were trying to figure out what to give her to 
get her to the morning. The bottle they looked at had no dosage levels for 
children under 12. But because they were familiar with Tylenol and comfortable 
with it, they saw no reason to believe there was a great risk in it. They gave 
her half the adult dose." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Leebaw, a spokesman for the manufacturer of Tylenol, said the company 
will not comment on pending litigation. But, he said: "As for Extra-Strength 
Tylenol, the labeling states the product is for adults and children 12 years 
and older." 
</P>
<P>
 Crystal is doing well with her new liver but, like all transplant recipients, 
she will spend her life on special medications and must avoid germs that can 
threaten her immune system. And, 10% of all liver transplant recipients require 
a second transplant due to rejection or failure. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 McDiarmid says the anguish that parents endure after realizing that they've 
given their child an overdose is almost as horrible as what the child 
experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 The father of the 8-month-old child suspected that he had misused the 
acetaminophen after his child fell into a coma. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was hard for me to even say, 'Yeah, I gave him adult Tylenol,' " the 
father says. "But I told myself, 'My baby is sick. I have to tell the doctors.' 
I had no idea (acetaminophen) could be so harmful. I thought, the more, the 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 "The torment that these parents go through is awful," McDiarmid says. "They 
are so devastated because they thought they were doing the right thing." 
Acetaminophen and Children 
</P>
<P>
 * Consider whether the medication is even needed, such as in the case of a 
mild fever. If you are not sure, ask your doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 * Remember that acetaminophen is a drug and that too much of it can be toxic. 
</P>
<P>
 * Never exceed the dosage listed on the bottle. 
</P>
<P>
 * Always buy the age-appropriate preparation. Never give the adult product to 
children under 12. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you are afraid you have given a wrong dose, don't panic. Call a doctor or 
call a poison control center. Southern Californians can phone the Los Angeles 
Regional Drug and Poison Information Center at (800) 777-6476.

DON MARTIN; STRIKES BACK; ONCE MAD'S MADDEST ARTIST, THE CARTOONIST WHO 
INFLUENCED A GENERATION OF DARK HUMORISTS IS UP TO HIS OLD TRICKS IN A NEW 
MAGAZINE. BUT WILL HIS WORK SEEM RELEVANT IN TODAY'S SMASH-AND GRAB VIDEO 
CULTURE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don Martin presents the sights and sounds of the big city: 
</P>
<P>
 Fagrooon. Fooma-doom. Splooga-poom.  
</P>
<P>
 Whattaya, weird? Those are buildings col lapsing in the distance. 
</P>
<P>
 Poit! Thwap!  
</P>
<P>
 An eyeball pops out and hits the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Spwapo!  
</P>
<P>
 One kid's fist meets another's nose. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, I just try to imagine what these things sound like, and then I draw 
them," Martin says. "If they're funny, that's all that matters to me. I've been 
thinking up these visual gags for years." 
</P>
<P>
 It's lunchtime in a noisy Manhattan bistro, and the slack-jawed waiters 
waddling by Martin's table fit right into the cartoons he made famous in MAD 
magazine. You can almost imagine him dreaming up comic characters as cups and 
saucers clatter around him and the mid-day pig-out begins: 
</P>
<P>
 Glink! A steak knife bounces off the metal plate in a customer's head. 
</P>
<P>
 Dikka-dakka. Dikka-dakka: The credit-card computer spits out a bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaglomp! A man chews and spews cole slaw. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, I could use all this stuff," says Martin, marveling at the bedlam. "I 
get creative material everywhere . Always have." 
</P>
<P>
 For more than 35 years, Don Martin has been an avatar of sick humor in a 
culture that cries out for swift kicks in the pants. Long before Beavis and 
Butt-head, he drew unsettling and warped cartoons that amused some (mostly 
adolescents) and alarmed others (mostly parents). A quiet and reclusive man, 
he's created an irreverent world where Franz Kafka and Looney Tunes collide, 
leaving good taste -- and civility -- in the lurch. 
</P>
<P>
 In the strip "One Fine Day in Florence," for example, Martin draws the Mona 
Lisa with expressions ranging from enigma to euphoria and relief. In the last 
panel, she rises from a toilet, flashes an unambiguous smile and flushes. 
</P>
<P>
 Twisted? Martin grins. Proud of his demented humor, he modestly acknowledges 
its offshoots in the work of Gary Larson ("The Far Side"), Matt Groening ("The 
Simpsons") and others. 
</P>
<P>
 "All these people were influenced by Don Martin because he was one of the 
first to do truly black humor," says Sergio Aragones, a cartoonist with MAD 
magazine for 30 years and a co-founder of the Cartoon Artists Professional 
Society in Southern California. "I always used to look for his contributions 
first in MAD, since he took such a different approach. It was wacky and very 
grotesque." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To his fans, Martin's characters are instantly recognizable: Fat-footed boobs 
prancing down the street with heads under their arms; clowns tap-dancing into 
catastrophe; wisecracking insects in boxer shorts. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a darkness in his work, some of it autobiographical. Since the early 
1950s, Martin has struggled with cornea problems that have greatly impaired his 
vision. He often uses a magnifying glass to finish off fine details in cartoon 
drawings, but this hasn't greatly affected his creative output. He continues to 
churn out wickedly inventive work. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always been physical suffering in comedy," Martin says, as a waiter 
almost spills soup in a grandmother's lap at the next table. "Even ancient 
clowns kicked each other in the seat of the pants or hit each other over the 
head. It's the same thing in our time, just a little stronger." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the 62-year-old cartoonist published the first edition of Don 
Martin, a cartoon magazine featuring a full range of his cartoons and 
characters. It's a big step forward for a man who feuded bitterly with MAD over 
the copyright to work he did from 1957-1987. Although Martin demanded greater 
financial control of his work, MAD insisted that it legally owned his cartoons 
and all proceeds, including such spinoff products as T-shirts and posters. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute tempered somewhat in 1992 with the death of William Gaines, the 
magazine's founder, who had clashed bitterly with his upstart cartoonist. By 
then, Martin had moved on to Cracked magazine, where he negotiated a better 
professional deal. Meanwhile, he retained the copyright to some 11 cartoon 
books written earlier and became more financially secure. 
</P>
<P>
 Not bad for a cartoonist once known as MAD's Maddest Artist. But now he faces 
troubling new questions: Are his slapstick comic books relevant in today's 
smash-and-grab video culture? Will teen-agers buy them? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," Martin says with a shrug. "I wonder myself. It wouldn't 
surprise me to hear somebody ask that. . . . Things change." 
</P>
<P>
 The artist looks perplexed, then his wife charges in. Norma Berger has been 
fidgeting while her husband muses about creativity, and she's ready to burst. 
How dare people ask such questions? Don't they know this man is a genius? 
</P>
<P>
 "People do get older," Martin continues. "Young people come up in the culture 
and other people are replaced. It just happens." 
</P>
<P>
 "Mozart is never replaced!" Berger interrupts, shocking the table into 
silence. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin looks puzzled, but his wife swells with pride. She straightens in her 
seat and savors every syllable: "I said, Mozart is never replaced!"  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They didn't call him Wolfgang in Patterson, N.J., where Martin was born. But 
he showed early talent for drawing and, like many aspiring comedians, young Don 
had a mouth. Teachers were always telling him to be quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, however, was too busy laughing at the world around him. Like the 
teen-agers who crack up over MAD's parodies and spoofs, he was constantly 
making fun of adult pomposity and he adored slapstick humor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to get thrown out of class a lot for cutting up," he says. "And I've 
continued to laugh at the same things I used to laugh at when I was a kid. You 
know, bumps on the head. The Three Stooges and Laurel and Hardy." 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up in the '40s, Martin was influenced by the cartoons of Vergil 
Partch, who worked for Look magazine, and by the drawings of Norman Rockwell. 
He attended the Newark School of Fine and Industrial Art and the Pennsylvania 
Academy of Fine Arts, and began looking for work as an artist. 
</P>
<P>
 His early cartoons went through several stages; at one point, Martin painted 
brooding pictures that suggested Expressionism more than satire. Yet all that 
changed when he approached MAD in 1957 with free-lance submissions. Martin 
liked the publication's zany humor and hoped to become a contributor. 
</P>
<P>
 Editors rejected his initial work, however, saying it was too tightly wound. 
They urged him to loosen up and try something different, and he responded with 
weird-looking cartoon characters -- precursors of his later style. His second 
submission was part of a satire in which Alfred E. Neuman, MAD's patron saint, 
answered spiritual questions like those fielded by Norman Vincent Peale in his 
national newspaper columns. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaines bought the drawings and Martin found a long-term home. Until he parted 
company with the magazine in 1987, he was one of "the Usual Gang of Idiots" 
gracing the masthead. He enjoyed nationwide celebrity, but after 25 years he 
also chafed under his financial situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other cartoonists, Martin worked on a strictly free-lance basis for the 
magazine. Editors treated his contributions as "work for hire," meaning MAD 
owned the material in perpetuity. Martin thought he was being shafted, but he 
was a private man and rarely mentioned the issue to friends and colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Berger, his wife since 1980, who finally insisted that Martin terminate 
his relationship with the magazine. The two had heated arguments, but Martin 
eventually listened to her. Since then, she has played an increasingly active 
role in his career. 
</P>
<P>
 As Berger sees it, her husband had to take control of his creative life. Bill 
Gaines, she says, "was certainly a very charismatic man. But he was driven by 
creative furies, and his fury was to control and own." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at MAD view it differently. Martin was treated no differently than 
anyone else, they say, and there were no secrets about the magazine's financial 
rights. If artists didn't like the terms, they could leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Don left the magazine, he sent Bill Gaines a letter saying he was 
unhappy and that he was jumping ship," Co-Editor John Ficarra says. "That was 
Don's right. Whether it was a good move or not for him is something he and his 
accountant would have to decide. . . . He had always been willing to go along 
with this (work for hire), and when he left, he left." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since the breakup in 1987, Martin has published six books and made a name for 
himself in Europe. His work has been well-received in Germany, and he was 
commissioned to do animated campaign spots for Sweden's Social Democratic 
Party. His cartoon compilations have been translated into six languages. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a career to be proud of, but the question nags: Is Don Martin over the 
hill? The gags in his new comic book offer some answers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Presenting Doctor Dork" is vintage material, with two screwballs cavorting in 
a laboratory and blowing themselves to bits. "The Fabulous McWebbs" tells of a 
conniving vaudeville performer and his faithful cousin, Ickey, a dancing 
spider. Other jokes rekindle the spirit that Martin pioneered in MAD, featuring 
Poit! Thwap! and other standbys. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's kids, however, thrill to animated cartoons where teen-age lowlifes set 
fire to cats and tell barf jokes. There's an increasingly hard, mean edge to 
such humor that makes Martin's jokes look tame, even sedate. 
</P>
<P>
 He's heard it all before. 
</P>
<P>
 "When underground cartoons first came out in the 1960s, people who knew my 
work started doing those cartoons," Martin recalls. "And they said, 'Why don't 
you come along? Why are you staying behind? This is where it's at.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Martin refused to bite, and the underground craze eventually flamed out. 
</P>
<P>
 It's impossible to predict what's genuinely funny or lasting, he says, and 
there's no telling how long "Beavis and Butt-head," "The Simpsons," and any 
other mass media cartoons will remain popular. Or humorous. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it funny? That's the only test I know when it comes to cartooning," Martin 
says. "Not whether it's sick, or whether it's going to ruin people's values or 
morals. You only have to ask a simple question: Is it funny?"

HEALTH WATCH; WOMEN NEED IRON TO WARD OFF ANEMIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Menstrual cycles, pregnancy and birth control can all contribute to anemia -- 
which many American women teeter on the brink of every month. 
</P>
<P>
 Because their iron intake is borderline or worse and their body stores of iron 
are low, the blood lost during each period can be enough to make women anemic. 
</P>
<P>
 A typical 120-pound woman has 3 to 3.5 grams of iron in her body, 70% of it in 
oxygen-carrying hemoglobin molecules in red blood cells. The remaining 0.8 to 1 
gram (800 to 1,000 milligrams) is stored in various body tissues. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommended daily allowance of iron for women is 18 milligrams. Most women 
get just barely that amount in their diets, offset by some normal daily losses 
of iron. 
</P>
<P>
 Under normal circumstances, a woman loses about half a milligram of iron a day 
during a three- to five-day menstrual period. 
</P>
<P>
 Pregnancy may also lead to anemia. About 1 gram of iron is transferred to the 
fetus and the placenta during pregnancy, and this loss to the mother must be 
made up. A multivitamin supplement that includes iron may be recommended during 
pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 The symptoms of anemia include fatigue, listlessness, mood changes, loss of 
the ability to concentrate and pallor of the skin. The number of red blood 
cells is reduced and their appearance is abnormal. 
</P>
<P>
 Some methods of birth control can influence iron levels. Contraceptive pills 
reduce blood loss during menstruation, while intrauterine devices can cause 
minor bleeding that increases blood loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Check It Out: How can you check out the background of your physician? Here are 
some suggestions from consumer and medical groups: 
</P>
<P>
 * Consult the American Medical Directory, published by the American Medical 
Assn., and the Directory of Medical Specialists. Both are available in public 
libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 * The AMA maintains a Physician Master File that tracks doctors in medical 
school and independently verifies their credentials. The file also contains 
state disciplinary action reports. Data can be obtained by mail only. For 
information, write to AMA, 515 N. State St., Chicago, Ill. 60610. 
</P>
<P>
 * To find out if a doctor is board-certified, call the American Board of 
Medical Specialties at (800) 776-2378. (The AMA master file will also tell you 
this.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Call the state medical board. In some states, be prepared to make many 
calls. Most boards are understaffed and it can take many attempts just to get 
through.  
</P>
<P>
 * Check the courts. This may yield information on malpractice suits, but it is 
time-consuming and may provide an incomplete picture. If a hospital has been 
sued along with a doctor, the lawsuit may be filed under the institution's 
name, not the doctor's. In some cases, particularly those in which doctors 
and/or hospitals have made large payments, files have been sealed by court 
order.

BOOK REVIEW: SCIENCE; ONE MAN'S QUEST FOR PROOF OF THE BIG BANG; WRINKLES IN 
TIME, BY GEORGE SMOOT AND KEAY DAVIDSON , WILLIAM MORROW AND COMPANY INC. $25,

<TEXT>
<P>
 Once upon a time not very long ago, cosmology -- the study of the nature and 
origins of the universe -- was a scientific specialty somewhere between 
theology and history. Great minds pondered the stars and applied mathematics to 
extrapolations from their observations about the size of the universe, its 
future and its past.  
</P>
<P>
 By the middle of this century, these great minds (and some lesser ones) had 
divided into two camps. Those in the first argued that there had been a 
creation, a "big bang" that brought forth space-time from a "singularity," and 
that this space-time, our universe, has been expanding ever since. Such an 
enormous event, a pair of astronomers suggested in 1948, would have left an 
afterglow of background radiation. 
</P>
<P>
 Those in the second camp maintained that the universe has always been and will 
continue to exist in a steady state, operating under the same rules. To assume 
that the universe had a beginning, they argued, implies an end or a cooling 
down, and this they took as unacceptable. Besides, there was no evidence of any 
primal event.  
</P>
<P>
 Then in 1964, two researchers at Bell Labs, who had been investigating 
something entirely different, detected faint microwave radiation coming from 
all directions in the sky -- the predicted afterglow of creation, and a boost 
to big-bang believers. 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery of background radiation occurred just as the sciences of 
particle physics and astronomy were merging into the new discipline of 
astrophysics. Giant accelerators here on Earth were producing some of the same 
particles that astronomers detected in space. Suddenly, cosmology had become an 
experimental science.  
</P>
<P>
 Enter George Smoot. "Wrinkles in Time" is Smoot's memoir of his quest for 
evidence of the big bang, from the time he entered graduate school at MIT in 
1970 through the success of COBE, the Cosmic Background Explorer in 1992. 
Written in collaboration with science writer Keay Davidson, the voice we hear 
is Smoot's, but the fast pace, lucid explanations of astrophysics and sensuous 
detail of high adventure in the Brazilian rain forest are probably Davidson's. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoot recounts the on-going rivalry between cosmologists, crediting the 
contributions of such scientists as Vera Rubin, who was ignored when, as a 
young woman in 1950, she suggested that the universe might not be as homogenous 
as expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wrinkles in Time" skillfully combines descriptions of Smoot's day-to-day life 
as a hands-on scientist with explanations of the ways astronomers like Rubin 
have accounted for the movement of the stars, missing or dark matter, black 
holes and the Great Attractor. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for a reference to time spent in Alaska as a child, Smoot doesn't tell 
us much about his life before 1970. We join him as he decides to build delicate 
instruments to detect rare particles and finds places for the instruments on a 
Cold-War retired U-2 spy plane, in the gondola of a Brazilian balloon, on a 
frozen lake in Antarctica and, finally, aboard the NASA-sponsored COBE. 
</P>
<P>
 Always aware of the errors of predecessors and colleagues, Smoot is mindful of 
the importance of negative evidence, such as his failure to find cosmic 
antimatter (just as Michelson and Morley failed to find any "ether" when they 
tried to measure it in 1887).  
</P>
<P>
 Smoot remains wary of the possibility of confounding background noise for the 
signals he seeks, or of omitting some simple test. Consequently, he pushes his 
team to go the extra mile, checking and rechecking their data.  
</P>
<P>
 All the while, we learn, Smoot's team is competing with other cosmologists. 
Fearful of a leak, they use only vague generalities when exchanging information 
over the open lines of E-mail and give no hint of their progress in processing 
the data that slowly come in from COBE. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, we know from the beginning of this story that COBE succeeded 
spectacularly, producing images of what Smoot calls "the primordial seeds of 
modern-day structures such as galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and so on . . . 
huge ripples in the fabric of space-time." 
</P>
<P>
 These slight irregularities show that from the start, there was an uneven 
distribution of energy and matter in the universe that congealed into the 
galaxies, solar systems and life-bearing planet we know as home. 
</P>
<P>
 Although never diffident and obviously pleased with COBE's success, Smoot is 
nevertheless humble before "the ultimate simplicity and power of the creativity 
of physical nature." 
</P>
<P>
 Excellent diagrams and color illustrations put "Wrinkles in Time" over the top 
as a splendid history of the universe as we see it near the end of the 20th 
Century.

'TOMBSTONE' FULL OF BOX-OFFICE LIFE; MOVIES: THE SURPRISE HIT ABOUT THE 
BUSTLING WESTERN FRONTIER TOWN SOON WILL REACH $40 MILLION IN DOMESTIC GROSSES, 
DESPITE A TROUBLED START. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For Christmas, the movie industry gave the public films about AIDS, 
concentration camps, escaped convicts and men sentenced to life imprisonment. 
The public -- or a sizable portion of it, anyway -- decided it wanted a 
Western, and "Tombstone," the surprise hit of the winter, was launched. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of its Christmas Day release, the chances for "Tombstone," the 
latest version of the escapades of Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday, seemed about as 
good as the Clantons at the O.K. Corral. The production was a troubled one, and 
at one point shut down for several days when original director Kevin Jarre was 
fired. Disney gave it only minimal support on its release, and many critics 
either dismissed it or ignored it. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the odds, "Tombstone" is headed for the $40-million mark in domestic 
grosses and seems to be picking up a devoted cult. A New York theater manager 
where "Tombstone" is playing says, "The audience really responds to it. You 
hear people laughing, cheering. They come out of the theater repeating Doc 
Holliday's (played by Val Kilmer) lines. When people react like that to a 
movie, they tell their friends about it." 
</P>
<P>
 A source in marketing at Disney said, "Look, the film was done through Cinergi 
Productions, and, by the time it came to us, there were all the stories about 
the director being fired and bad feeling between him and the producers. It took 
a while for us to know what kind of film we had, but we're behind it now and 
pushing as hard as we can." 
</P>
<P>
 What nerve is "Tombstone" hitting? "It's different from any Western I've ever 
seen," says Kurt Russell, whose performance as Earp anchors the film. "I love 
some of the old Wyatt Earp movies, but, in some of them, when you saw what a 
bleak, depressing place Tombstone is, you say, 'Why would Wyatt Earp or anyone 
else ever want to come here?' What we wanted to do was to show people why so 
many wanted to come to Tombstone during the silver rush. It was a sprawling, 
bustling frontier town, spilling over with energy. We didn't design this town 
to look like the Old West -- we designed it the way people saw it in 1879, as 
the New West. 
</P>
<P>
 "And Kevin Jarre's screenplay was really the first time anyone has tried to 
present Wyatt Earp in his entirety," he continues. "I mean, all of him: his 
relationship with his brothers, with his first wife, how he took up with 
Josephine Marcus, the traveling actress that he ended up spending nearly half a 
century with. You could see the dark side of the man." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wyatt Earp-Doc Holliday legend has always fascinated American filmmakers; 
dozens of versions of the story have made it to the silver screen, including 
"My Darling Clementine" and "Gunfight at the OK Corral." The popular TV series 
with Hugh O'Brien as Earp also kept the legend alive. And this summer will see 
the release of Lawrence Kasdan's "Wyatt Earp" with Kevin Costner as Earp and 
Dennis Quaid as Doc Holliday. All in all, the Earp brothers have made the walk 
to the fatal pen more times than the Dodgers' '93 pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Jarre's attention to detail in "Tombstone" may have paid off in atmospheric 
richness, but it may also have led to his removal as director only six weeks 
into shooting. "Kevin just didn't have the experience, and he was moving much 
too slowly," says a cast member who asked not to be identified. "At the rate he 
was going, we'd have needed a six-hour miniseries to do the film." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, producer Andy Vajna pulled the plug on Jarre and hired George 
Cosmatos, director of "Rambo: First Blood Part II." 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't hire George because we wanted an action movie," says Vajna. "We're 
certainly not saying it hurt, because George made the action scenes crackle, 
but he also helped supply a visual element that we felt was badly needed. A lot 
of recent Westerns have deliberately gone for a drab, colorless look. I think 
people were ready for a truly gorgeous-looking Western." 
</P>
<P>
 One thing that everyone agrees on is that Russell is a major part of the 
film's success. "In the movie, Wyatt's brother (Bill Paxton) keeps saying to 
Wyatt, 'You're the one,' " says Kilmer, whose own laconic performance as 
Holliday steals several scenes. "Well, Kurt was the one. 'Tombstone' is a 
tribute to his determination."  
</P>
<P>
 "Our attitude was, 'Hell, yes, let's do this movie,' " says Powers Boothe, who 
plays the colorful and slightly deranged gunfighter Curly Bill Brocius. "We had 
really juicy roles and you could see everyone just chomping at the bit to get 
at them. All of the distractions just brought us closer together."  
</P>
<P>
 One of the "distractions," it was rumored, was the hostility of Costner and 
his agent, Michael Ovitz, whom Jarre publicly accused of "trying to crush my 
picture." While some felt Jarre's paranoia was showing, it is true that 
Costner's group rented all the Western costumes available in Hollywood.  
</P>
<P>
 "That didn't hurt," says Russell. "It forced us to go to Europe, which in fact 
is where the nouveau riche of Tombstone bought their clothes in the first 
place." 
</P>
<P>
 What ultimately may be the secret behind the success of "Tombstone," in the 
opinion of producer Vajna, is that "people are getting tremendous enjoyment 
from seeing these actors in these roles."

AN ACTOR SHARES SECRETS TO HIS SUCCESS; TONY PLANA CO-CREATES THE LATINO 
CLASSICAL REPERTORY AT CAL STATE L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Like most good character actors, Tony Plana has a face that looks familiar 
even if you can't remember his name. 
</P>
<P>
 That could be attributed to the wide range of roles he has played: a ruthless 
drug dealer in one movie and a comical caricature of a Mexican bandit in 
another; on one television dramatic series he was a slick lawyer, and he was 
recently seen as a sensitive cop in the Fox comedy series "Bakersfield P.D." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Plana says he is able to play each diverse character with 
conviction because of his classical training at the Royal Academy of Dramatic 
Art in London, England. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is one of the reasons why I have been successful competing in this 
business," said the Cuban-born actor who was reared in Culver City. "To get 
through a monologue of Shakespeare, you better know what you are doing to 
interpret it effectively." 
</P>
<P>
 And now, Plana, 40, wants to share the secret of his success with other Latino 
actors and actresses, as well as expose the Latino community to the classics, 
both American and British. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with fellow actor and longtime theater professor Ruben Sierra, Plana has 
created the Latino Classical Repertory at Cal State University, Los Angeles. 
Sierra said the City Terrace campus is ideal for the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is where I need to be in terms of what we are talking about," said 
Sierra, who has also taught at CalArts and USC. "It's the only school where I 
can walk into class and the majority of students are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are certain things in the classics that we can relate to. It helps us 
understand our own society and the society we are in." 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which is still being developed, put on Eugene O'Neill's "A Touch 
of the Poet" last summer. In the spring, there are plans to produce Arthur 
Miller's "The Price," followed by Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream" in 
the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to create the opportunity for Latinos to interpret the classics 
because they never get the chance to interpret them in mainstream theater," 
Plana said. "Television work is like lifting a chair, but the classics are like 
lifting weights." 
</P>
<P>
 Plana is making the classics pertinent to Latinos by adapting them with Latino 
characters and situations. For example, "A Touch of the Poet," the story of an 
Irish patriarch, was changed to an 1872 Mexican family, 10 years after the 
battle of Puebla, for which Cinco de Mayo is celebrated. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a wonderful opportunity for Latino professionals to be challenged by the 
classics and to educate our community," Plana said. "The fusion of our 
ethnicity and cultural heritage with classical pieces is going to create some 
wonderful explosions of creativity." 
</P>
<P>
 Plana hopes to create some fireworks of his own with comedian Paul Rodriguez, 
with whom he has formed a production company. Plana co-produced Rodriguez's 
directorial debut feature film, "A Million to Juan," which is a Latino 
adaptation of Mark Twain's classic tale "The Million Pound Bank Note." 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to take control of our destinies," said Plana, who is married to 
actress Ada Maris, currently starring in the TV series "Nurses." "We want to do 
projects that are Latino-produced, Latino-directed, and Latino-acted." 
</P>
<P>
 Plana said that an example of the type of project they hope to produce is the 
movie "Born in East L.A.," which was directed by Cheech Marin and starred both 
Plana and Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez, who is gradually making the move from performing to producing and 
directing, said that Plana is an ideal partner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tony brings in what I don't have: the education, the structure, the 
experience," Rodriguez said. "He is probably the most underrated serious actor 
we have. And he's not one of these guys who has studied Shakespeare and lets it 
get to his head and looks down at batos like me." 
</P>
<P>
 Plana did not always want to be an actor. His family moved from Cuba to Miami 
when he was 6, where they lived for two years before relocating to Culver City 
in 1964. Plana eventually enrolled at Loyola Marymount University with the idea 
of becoming an attorney. But a part in a high school production of "Guys and 
Dolls" led to a role as Snoopy in a college production of "You're a Good Man, 
Charlie Brown," and the rest, as they say, is history. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just got hooked," Plana said. "Acting all of a sudden became a focus of 
everything I love. I love literature. I love history. I love psychology. I love 
music. All the humanities come together for me in the theater." 
</P>
<P>
 He said growing up in Southern California as opposed to Miami also made it 
easier for his parents to accept his career decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though we had a Cuban community here, it was not so pervasive and all 
encompassing as it is in Miami," Plana said. "I have cousins who had artistic 
aspirations who were basically pressured by their parents to become CPAs." 
</P>
<P>
 Plana has had more than 20 featured roles in such films as "JFK," "The Three 
Amigos," "One Good Cop" and "An Officer and a Gentleman." On television, he has 
appeared on "L.A. Law," "Miami Vice" and "Hill Street Blues," as well as 
"Golden Girls," "Seinfeld" and "Blossom." 
</P>
<P>
 On stage, he has performed in "Richard III," "Hamlet," "Equinox," "A Midsummer 
Night's Dream" and "Zoot Suit," for which he won a Dramalogue Award. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tony is a really, really interesting actor," said Risa Bramon Garcia, who 
runs her own production and casting company called Alomar Pictures. "He plays 
such great bad guys, and yet he is such a sweet guy. He has an incredible 
amount of integrity as a person and an actor." 
</P>
<P>
 But, while he has had a successful 15-year career, Plana is not totally 
fulfilled with the roles he has played. "It's a double-edged sword," he said. 
"There is a certain frustration, but it's hard to bite the hand that feeds me. 
The fact that I am Latino put me in a small pool of talent, and I was able to 
be successful within that smaller pool. I may not have been able to be as 
successful in a larger pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the same time, the nature of the work is frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Fox recently took "Bakersfield P.D." off the air (it should return 
later in the season), Plana hopes his role as a sensitive cop opened doors as 
to how the industry portrays Latinos on screen. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy basically demystified the macho stereotype of the Latino," said 
Plana, his eyes widening as he speaks fondly of his character. "This is a 
Latino guy with nothing but feelings and can't control them. It humanizes the 
way people see Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Latinos are making inroads. We're starting to climb the hill and 
staying up there."

RICK DU BROW: STILL BRASH AFTER ALL THESE YEARS; TELEVISION: TOM SNYDER'S CNBC 
SHOW IS A CROSS BETWEEN THE TALK SHOW THAT MADE HIM A STAR AND TODAY'S PHONE-IN 
FORMAT. HE'S AS BREEZY AS EVER, WITH HIS TRADEMARK LAUGH PUNCTUATING THE ACTION 
THROUGHOUT. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 During a commercial break on CNBC's "Tom Snyder" show last week, the star 
hustled over to the makeup room next door with a couple of quips. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back at Fort Lee," he said, referring to the New Jersey headquarters of the 
NBC-owned cable network, "they sit back and think we're crazy. They say, 'What 
are they doing?' Well, it's called television." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it's a cross between the simple, free-swinging talk show that made 
Snyder network TV's first late-late star on the "Tomorrow" series from 
1973-1982 and the phone-in format that now is all the rage. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Snyder, who followed Johnny Carson with "Tomorrow" before NBC gave the 
time slot to David Letterman, is keeping up with the times, he hasn't changed 
all that much -- he's as brash and breezy as ever, with his trademark laugh 
punctuating the action throughout. 
</P>
<P>
 On the information superhighway, the "Tom Snyder" show is a diner, just off 
the shoulder, as you're whizzing through the electronic age. 
</P>
<P>
 It airs live coast-to-coast from NBC's Burbank studios at 7-8 p.m. 
Monday-Thursday Pacific time and is repeated at 10 p.m. But, he notes, "I'm on 
television seven nights a week. Cable is rerun. That's how they make their 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 "(CNBC) got mad at me because they put up a thing that said if you want a 
videocassette of Tom's show, send $14.95. I said, 'Why would you send $14.95? 
It's on again in three hours. Set your tape machine.' They called me and I 
said, 'Do you think people are stupid?' So now we don't sell the reruns 
anymore. Of course not. Why should you ding people $14.95?" 
</P>
<P>
 This attitude of blunt talk and irascibility has etched his image in nearly 
four decades in broadcasting, from local news to network TV to national radio. 
For many viewers, the image is accompanied by Dan Aykroyd's classic takeoff on 
Snyder on "Saturday Night Live" when the talk host was on a roll as a 
celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 57, Snyder remains energetic and looks good, with silvery-white hair and 
black glasses that he occasionally slips on. Surrounded by a young staff -- his 
supervising producer, Michael Horowitz, says, "A bunch of us came from lousy 
jobs and we're just having a great time over here" -- Snyder seems to be 
reveling in the party atmosphere as the old pro who encourages and participates 
in on-air high jinks. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his acknowledged ease as a down-home, engaging, plain-spoken 
personality, he has been criticized by some in the past for being abrasive. But 
now he seems comfortable enough to needle himself and that image. 
</P>
<P>
 On this particular night last week, his guests included Top 40 guru Casey 
Kasem and and New York advertising guru Jerry Della Famina, whom he introduced 
as "the man who almost destroyed my career." 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder was referring to his flop on the local news at WABC-TV in New York. 
Exchanging good-natured barbs and banter with Della Famina, Snyder showed the 
infamous poster/billboard that tried to sell him to the public at WABC. It 
said: "He's charming. He's exciting. He's caustic. He's outrageous. He's 
informed. He's controversial. He's involved. He's emotional. He's New York." 
</P>
<P>
 Cracked Snyder: "Not only have we told New York that he's caustic, he's 
outrageous, he's controversial, that this guy's a real jerk, we've said he's 
New York and therefore all of you who live in New York are just as big a jerk 
as he is. That was the research." 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder works out of a matchbox-sized studio, a few feet from his staff and 
visitors. The makeup room next door, where guests wait to go on, is also tiny 
but well-appointed. The intimacy seems to work for him. There is a loose, 
comfortable tone. He converses. He mugs. He gets back to business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's making a bundle . . . and I'm sitting here for a quarter a week," 
he says at one point on the show. He clowns, on air, with the folks in the 
control room, and they respond by singing a Christmas carol. 
</P>
<P>
 But Della Famina, before he leaves the guest room for his appearance, 
observes: "You know what's really interesting about this show? The camerawork 
is really good. They come in, they don't screw around." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, except for the little visuals, the camera does come in and stay right 
in for extreme close-ups. In an interview in his office after the program, 
Snyder notes: 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a very soft look, with the Los Angeles background with the lights 
flickering. Most shows on cable have bright lights and the sets have a lot of 
boxiness and desks, and I don't want a desk between me and the audience. That's 
no good for me. It's like a wall." 
</P>
<P>
 With late-night talk competition commanding attention, does Snyder wish he was 
again part of the network fray? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very happy with what I do here. This is perfect for me. I like being live 
in all time zones. I like the phones, which you can't do on a TV network. And 
network television has become so big and so important, with so many millions of 
dollars involved -- and I don't do big television. This is a nice little 
television program. I'm not good at big television." 
</P>
<P>
 After "Tomorrow" was dropped, says Snyder, "It was tough because I thought it 
would go on forever. It was very difficult to find something to do. All I could 
find to do was the (WABC) news in New York, and that was not a pleasant 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came back to Los Angeles, and I had a tough time finding work here. I 
thought about going back on the news at Channel 4 (KNBC) -- they talked to me 
about it. But I just didn't think I could go back to that well. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I went over to Channel 7 (KABC) for six months at 3 o'clock in the 
afternoon. But when Oprah Winfrey came on at that time (in 1986), they wanted 
me to do 'A.M. Los Angeles.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He turned that down. KABC kept him under contract, but "I had a call from 
Mutual Broadcasting, and they said, 'Larry King had a heart attack. Would you 
substitute for him on the radio for a week?' I said sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I went there and people called up -- 'Hey, Tom, how ya been? Geez, we 
used to watch ya all the time.' And I thought, 'Geez, they like me. It's OK.' 
And I loved radio. So ABC had me under contract and they had a radio network, 
and they said, 'If you'd like to do a nighttime radio show, we'll put you on.' 
It ran for five years, and then ABC left the network radio talk business. So 
there I was again. My dream was to do radio till the day I died." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he accepted CNBC's offer to join cable TV: "I said, 'You know, it 
really is the same as what I've been doing except the cameras are turned on.' 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no pressure. In cable, it's not important whether I beat Larry King, 
as long as I keep the CNBC audience at a level where they can make a good 
profit. If I get 250,000 or 300,000 homes, I'm a big hit." 
</P>
<P>
 And as for the guy who replaced "Tomorrow," David Letterman, Snyder says: 
"He's taken 11:30 to a whole new level on CBS. It's awesome."

CONDUCTING HERSELF WELL; MUSIC: LARA WEBBER, 25 AND STILL A USC GRADUATE 
STUDENT, IS THE FIRST WOMAN TO LEAD THE YOUNG MUSICIANS FOUNDATION DEBUT 
ORCHESTRA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's taken some time, but Lara Webber, 25, says she finally has her priorities 
straight. Although a serious graduate student in the conducting program at USC, 
Webber has decided to forget about getting good grades and instead focus her 
energies on her new position as conductor of the Young Musicians Foundation 
Debut Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 Webber, selected by national audition last June from among 35 applicants, is 
the first woman to lead the orchestra in its 39-year history. She is one of a 
growing number of women to serve as music directors in Southern California, 
following the lead of JoAnn Falletta (who has led the Long Beach Symphony since 
1989), Lucinda Carver (now in her second season with the Los Angeles Mozart 
Orchestra), Laura Hemenway (Antelope Valley Symphony), Lois Johnson (San 
Fernando Valley Symphony) and Yvette Devereaux (former head of the Southeast 
Symphony, who is now putting together the Los Angeles-based Progressive 
Symphony). 
</P>
<P>
 The 65-member Debut Orchestra, formed under the auspices of the Beverly 
Hills-based Young Musicians Foundation, is composed of instrumentalists under 
the age of 26 selected by audition. Conducting alumni of the Debut Orchestra 
include Andre Previn, Michael Tilson Thomas, Lawrence Foster and Webber's 
predecessor, Daniel Hege, who has gone on to lead the Chicago Youth Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 Webber has been hired for a three-year term to conduct a four-concert season 
-- as well as a number of invitational concerts -- at various venues in Los 
Angeles. For her services, she receives an annual $5,000 conducting study grant 
from the Lionel Newman Memorial Trust, administered by the BMI Foundation Inc., 
and a matching $5,000 grant from YMF. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hardly imaginable still that I get paid to do this," said Webber, who 
will conduct her second concert of the season Sunday at 4 p.m. at the Japan 
America Theatre. The program will feature Ives' "The Unanswered Question," 
Shostakovich's First Cello Concerto, with Cameron Stone as soloist, and of 
significance to Webber, Beethoven's Sixth Symphony. Although she previously has 
rehearsed parts of the "Pastorale," this will be the first time Webber conducts 
the work in its entirety. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm told by other conductors that it doesn't matter how far you are in a 
career, there is always the first time with a piece," Webber said. "The Sixth 
takes enormous study, but I feel I am ready to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Lewis, who chairs USC's conducting studies program -- he is on a 
sabbatical but continues to coach Webber privately -- said he has cautioned his 
protege about the difficulties of the work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have told her that it's not a great audience piece unless magical things 
happen," said Lewis, who is also music director of the USC Symphony. "But Lara 
is very dedicated and is extremely musical. She learns quickly and communicates 
immediately with the orchestra. She's a natural." 
</P>
<P>
 Webber first took conducting classes as a student at Oberlin Conservatory in 
Ohio, where she majored in vocal performance and music education. Initially, 
she entertained ideas of becoming a choral conductor, but she was encouraged by 
one of her teachers to envision herself rather as an orchestral leader who 
could move more easily into the choral arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, Webber cites the musical influences surrounding her as a child in 
Seattle as the source of her creativity. She would often go to the Seattle 
Opera House with her mother, soprano Carol Webber, who appeared in a variety of 
roles with the Seattle Opera during a six-year period. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never had baby-sitters -- I was always in the pit of the opera house," 
recalled the younger Webber, who as a child studied cello and piano. "I was 
constantly at rehearsals from age 8. I used to imitate conductors with my 
friends, but I had no desire to be one." 
</P>
<P>
 Striving to leave her mark, Webber said she is "flooding" herself with 
repertory and is zealously undertaking many of the organizational duties at 
YMF. Despite her schedule, she remains committed to having a personal life and 
is engaged to marry geologist and composer Julio Freidmann. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to have a family," she said, "and I don't know how much that 
influences the way I envision my career. I am the kind of a person who requires 
a home and cherishes my own space. I will cherish my own family, and I want to 
be able to always return to the same home. I know some musicians whose careers 
are so overwhelming they actually are 'homeless.' I want to be a working 
conductor with the best players, but I don't want it to overwhelm my life." 
</P>
<P>
 * Webber will conduct the YMF Debut Orchestra on Feb. 20 at Pepperdine 
University, Malibu , and on April 25 at Ambassador Auditorium in Pasadena.

SUIT AIMED AT RHYTHM CAFE LEASE; CONCERTS: OWNER OF THE BUILDING THAT HOUSES 
THE SANTA ANA CLUB SEEKS TO PERMANENTLY OUST THE STRUGGLING ROCK PROMOTERS OVER 
MOUNTING DEBTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As the debt-ridden Rhythm Cafe scrambles for a new lease on life, its landlord 
is trying to revoke the club's lease by month's end and put it out of business 
for good. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert-and-dinner club closed last March when its key financier, 
developer Curt Olson of Newport Beach, backed away in the face of mounting 
losses. Michael Feder, the partner who was in charge of day-to-day operations, 
opened the Cafe's doors again last month for two well-attended hard-rock 
concerts. Outside promoters rented the venue and ran the shows. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Feder said he was putting together new financial backing to 
reopen the spacious, lavishly appointed Cafe on an ongoing basis. 
</P>
<P>
 The alternative-rock promoter Goldenvoice is selling tickets for a Jan. 27 
concert at the Cafe by the Mighty Mighty Bosstones and Suburban Rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
 But Santa Ana Harbor Real Estate, the Los Angeles company that owns the Cafe 
building at 3503 S. Harbor Blvd., is seeking to oust the Cafe's parent 
corporation, Musicsphere Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 In papers filed in November in Orange County Superior Court, the landlord 
claimed that Musicsphere owed $43,750 in back rent, with additional rent debts 
mounting at the rate of $279 per day. The court papers also allege that 
Musicsphere violated its lease when the Cafe left bills unpaid, prompting 
creditors to file liens on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are evicting Musicsphere. We do not want them as a tenant," Barrett W. 
McInerney, the landlord's attorney, said last week. "As far as we know at this 
point, Musicsphere doesn't have two nickels to rub together, so we would just 
like to make them homeless. My clients want to make sure they have a viable 
tenant in there." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 McInerney said he expects the bid to oust Musicsphere to go to trial within 
two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Feder, however, says he has lined up investors interested in backing a revived 
Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the differences between the landlord and I will be resolved. He'll 
get his money, and we'll reopen," Feder said Friday. "The landlord and I are in 
direct communication. If we work out concessions I asked for, they'll get the 
money and I'll be there." 
</P>
<P>
 That, McInerney said in an exasperated tone, "is the same thing we've been 
told for six months. We've heard he's coming up with investors, but no one has 
seen a penny. Even more so than the rent, there's an issue of trust. They can't 
tell you one thing and have it keep evaporating." 
</P>
<P>
 McInerney said he has received calls from prospective new investors in the 
club, but when he outlines the extent of the Rhythm Cafe's legal and financial 
problems, "You can listen to the interest level on the other end of the phone 
deflating, and that's the last you hear from anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not accurate," Feder countered. "Any investors I've been speaking with 
have not spoken to Barrett McInerney. I've disclosed exactly the position I'm 
in to the investors, and they're aware of it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Though hopeful, Feder said he has not yet raised enough money to put a revived 
Cafe on secure footing. He said that would take about $450,000, and that he now 
has investor backing totaling about $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides its lease problems, Musicsphere is being sued by Calva Construction 
Co. of Ontario for $74,700. Calva, which since has filed for Chapter 7 
bankruptcy according to court records, says that the money is owed on a 
$227,000 remodeling project it carried out before the Cafe's opening in 
October, 1992. Calva has in turn been sued by creditors who sold it supplies 
for the Rhythm Cafe project. Also, National Commercial Recovery Inc., a 
collection agency, has sued Musicsphere for $32,000 to collect on a debt owed 
to The Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
 When it opened, the Rhythm Cafe appeared to pose a serious, well-financed 
challenge to the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano, which for the past eight 
years has been Orange County's only full-time club for touring pop attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While it succeeded in booking such major acts as Los Lobos, B.B. King, the 
Neville Brothers and Social Distortion, the Cafe folded after less than five 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rhythm Cafe was Feder's brainchild, part of an ambitious plan to establish 
a string of concert-and-dinner clubs across the United States. A sister club, 
also called the Rhythm Cafe, opened in San Diego the same night as the flagship 
Santa Ana club debuted, but its run was even shorter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't build the place to see it fall apart," Feder said in an interview 
about six weeks ago as he spoke of his attempts to revive the Rhythm Cafe with 
new investors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pray to God I can get it back open. If the place can be saved, then great. 
If it can't, I wasted another six months."

ECLECTIC GUITARIST SPLITS THE DIFFERENCE; MUSIC: MURIEL ANDERSON, A PROTEGE OF 
CHET ATKINS, DIVIDES HER PLAYING TIME BETWEEN CLASSICAL, INGENIOUSLY ARRANGED 
POPS AND ETHNIC TUNES, AND ORIGINAL COMPOSITIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 If Muriel Anderson had achieved her high level of artistry and expression in 
pop music, she might be a household name by now. As it is, the 33-year-old Chet 
Atkins protege plays classical and finger-style steel-stringed guitar, choices 
that make for an inconstant fame. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm at a unique point in my career, where one day I'll play a little concert 
in front of 35 people in a coffeehouse and the next day I'll do a TV show in 
front of millions of viewers, and both are satisfying," she says.  
</P>
<P>
 Though it won't reach the numbers of listeners that her appearances on TNN's 
"Nashville Now" or "Crook and Chase" do, Anderson will be playing for quite a 
demanding audience of fellow musicians, music retailers and educators at the 
National Assn. of Music Merchants confab in Anaheim beginning Saturday. At the 
four-day trade show, which will be attended by some 50,000 people, Anderson 
will be demonstrating Gibson guitars. 
</P>
<P>
 She'll also get a chance to play for that audience of 35, since that's just 
about the number held by Montana & Lace Vintage Musical Instruments, where she 
performs tonight and Wednesday with San Diego ragtime picker Richard Glick.  
</P>
<P>
 It's the first show to be held at the newly opened Huntington Beach shop, and 
there will be many more, according to managing co-owner Eddie Montana. A 
musician and longtime veteran of the Orange County bar band scene, Montana 
said: "After those gigs, you really start wishing for a place where an audience 
comes to listen. I used to go to McCabe's (the respected Santa Monica music 
store/concert hall) about once a week, and I'd like this to be like that, a 
listening room instead of one where people go to drink and talk." 
</P>
<P>
 Though he has no further shows booked at the moment, Montana hopes to start 
bringing in performers on a monthly or even weekly basis. The 50-seat Shade 
Tree Stringed Instruments in Laguna Niguel has held a similarly small but 
lively series of acoustic concerts for the past five years.  
</P>
<P>
 For the past two years, Montana organized the talent and staging at 
Huntington's Pierfest. He admits it may be difficult booking performers into 
such a small room, but he thinks some might be attracted by the prospect of an 
attentive audience. "Whatever else this place will be, it'll be intimate," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He's off to a good start with Anderson, inasmuch as she's a fairly 
breathtaking guitarist. Her three independently released albums reveal a player 
with a thorough command of her instrument, who, like her mentor Atkins, is able 
to approach a broad variety of material -- including classical, ingeniously 
arranged pops and ethnic tunes, and original compositions -- with passion and 
invention. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to have almost a split personality to play such dissimilar styles of 
music," Anderson said, speaking by phone from her home in Elmhurst, Ill. "Going 
from one number to the next, you put yourself immediately into an entirely 
different place. 
</P>
<P>
 "For years I tried to decide what style of music I was going to play, and 
finally came to the determination that I had to play the music that I loved, 
and that was in many different styles. I played for six years with a bluegrass 
band, then five years with a jazz band, then got into classical guitar, then 
back to the finger-style I started with. Along the way, I've started to develop 
a little bit of personality in the music I play." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson's first musical influence was the recently retired flat-picking great 
Doc Watson. Her parents gave her the "Doc Watson in Nashville" album when she 
was a youth, and when she got a castoff guitar at age 10, "I learned every song 
on side one, and then went to side two. He just plays with with so much 
feeling," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She eventually got to perform with Watson a few times. Though that had been 
her dream since she was 10, she said it turned out to be anything but a 
daunting experience: "It was exhilarating and at the same time comforting, like 
playing with someone you'd known for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's also been a life's goal of mine to be able to play music with anyone, to 
sit down and have a great time with any player. That's started to happen. I've 
been able to sit with Doc Watson, Jimmy Page and Chet and other really great 
players, and to make music with them. That's really a special time for me." 
</P>
<P>
 She met Atkins through his brother-in-law, mandolinist Jethro Burns, who was 
giving her lessons.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'd played (Burns) this tune of mine called 'Nola,' and he said I had to play 
that for Chet. So I did get to meet him and played him a couple of things, and 
he said he'd send me a tape of a couple of things I might do for a gig I had 
playing at a hotel. I didn't think much of it, but then a couple of weeks later 
I got this tape in the mail of wonderful things he had recorded in his 
basement. Chet has taught me a lot about playing music, and he's been a great 
influence on my life." 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Bojangles" and "Vincent" on Anderson's "Heartstrings" album were among 
the arrangements he sent her. The two communicated via tape for a while, before 
she began commuting to Nashville to work with him. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She has also studied with classical guitar great Christopher Parkening in a 
series of master classes. Her mid-'80s meeting with Led Zeppelin founder Page 
was on a less formal plane. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was playing at a hotel in Chicago where he and his band, the Firm, were 
staying. He came down late in the night when I was playing classical guitar, 
and he listened for about half an hour, then asked if I would like to play 
anything with him. We sat down and he taught me this tune he wrote called 
'Stairway to Heaven.' It was a tune I'd always hesitated from learning until 
then," she recounted with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson does a fair amount of teaching herself, along with actively 
participating in school programs promoting music.  
</P>
<P>
 She said: "I think it's really important to spread the joy I have in playing 
music, especially to kids. I do a lot of programs in the (Chicago) inner city 
where there is not a lot of chance for these kids in a society where education 
is not supported. The arts is a way out for them, to make something of 
themselves and rise above.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think music and the arts is something that keeps kids in school. If they 
have something they love, they're going to stay there. It's an expression of 
themselves."  
</P>
<P>
 * Muriel Anderson and Richard Glick perform at Montana & Lace Vintage Musical 
Instruments, 5182 Bolsa Chica St., Unit C, tonight at 7 and Wednesday at 8 p.m. 
Admission is $10. (714) 898-2453.

U.S. FILMS NOT SO POPULAR AT PALM SPRINGS FESTIVAL; MOVIES: FOREIGN, 
INDEPENDENT ENTRIES GRAB VIEWERS, POSSIBLY BECAUSE AMERICAN FILMS CAN BE SEEN 
ELSEWHERE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 There was a surprisingly sparse crowd gathered for "Blink," the Michael Apted 
thriller starring Madeleine Stowe at the Palm Springs International Film 
Festival. After all, the film generated good word of mouth and as the "major 
studio release" chosen to kick off Saturday's closing night festivities, one 
might expect the Coachella Valley to come out in force. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, none of the majors packed them in at the festival. It was at foreign 
films such as "La Scorta" and "Fiorile" (Italy), "Harmony Cats" and "La 
Florida" (Canada), "Justiz" (Germany) and "Belle Epoque' (Spain) -- and 
American independent films such as "Lookin' Italian," "The Last Seduction" and 
"My Life's in Turnaround" -- that seats were scarce, unless one arrived half an 
hour early. Of the half-dozen films scheduled for third screenings due to 
popularity, none was a big-budget American film. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Palm Springs Mall gala after "Blink's" screening, local festival 
devotee Kate Foster expressed the opinion that "people here are more interested 
in experimenting. They know there's a good chance of seeing most of the 
American films down the road, but this is probably the only chance they'll get 
to see some of the foreign or small American films . . . most of which'll 
probably never even make it to video." 
</P>
<P>
 Arranging the lineup for this year's festival was artistic director Mark 
Diamond. Hired late and given only three months to slate 100 films (including 
shorts), the onetime director of the Boston International Film Festival not 
only managed a popular slate of foreign offerings, but also put together a 
tribute to Sophia Loren, organized the first major retrospective of Federico 
Fellini's work since the director's death last year, and, by creating the 
American Independent Showcase, became a hero to a number of young American 
filmmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of these independents have a very, very small chance of ever finding 
distribution on their own," said Diamond. "At least by showcasing some of the 
better ones, there's a good chance of generating some interest. I also think 
it's very important for some of these younger filmmakers to have the experience 
of coming to a festival. This was the first one for the 'Rhinoskin' kids." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dina Marie Chapman co-wrote, produced and directed "Rhinoskin: The Making of a 
Movie Star," a documentary-style comedy about making it in Hollywood, with its 
star, Tod De Pre. Chapman, a 23-year-old USC graduate, said the festival has 
been an eye opener. "I thought it was going to be cutthroat, but everyone's 
been really helpful. They're like, 'I love your film, give me a tape and I'll 
get it to my distributor.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Director Jamie Bruce, who co-produced the gritty chase thriller, "Dirty Money" 
with the film's star and screenwriter Federick Deane, had three solid offers 
for foreign distribution but by midweek was still hoping for a solid domestic 
offer. "It's harder to get domestic distribution because there just aren't that 
many venues for independents. Whereas, there are a lot more possibilities 
abroad, especially if the film deals in some way with American culture." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, for all the practical and altruistic reasons for showcasing American 
independents, one of the best is just to experience the refreshing enthusiasm 
of artists who like to tell their stories on films. At screenings of movies 
like the hilarious and sophisticated "My Life's in Turnaround," James 
Merendino's darkly funny and disturbing "The Upstairs," Guy Magar's popular 
"Lookin' Italian" or Bruce and Deane's homage a noir, one heard tales about 
labors of love, maxing out credit cards and directors putting themselves in 
cameos to save 50 bucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Final attendance figures could not be determined at press time, but executive 
director Craig Prater admitted to a local paper that attendance and grosses 
were going to fall below last year's marks. Considering the number of overflow 
audiences at some films, it was hard to see how. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, not all aspects of the festival were wildly popular with everyone. 
A Canadian director who asked not to be identified, said he found the behavior 
of the audiences to be the most ill-mannered of recent experience. "I think a 
lot of these people think they're home watching a video. When the lights go 
down, out comes the picnic and the crinkling of paper continues for a half 
hour. Then, between scenes, they discuss what just happened, what will happen 
and what might be nice to pick up for dinner." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Palm Springs is the rube among international film festivals, it has a 
number of unique attractions. Although the festival trades upon its now 
somewhat tattered reputation as pastureland for former stars, there is a 
charming Anyburb, U.S.A., feel about the place. At the closing night gala, the 
party was more akin to a rousing Kiwanis affair than anything connected to 
Celluloid City. 
</P>
<P>
 And while some may think the gala's locale was slightly tacky, its lack of 
pretension was its most endearing quality. "Why not a mall?" asked Kate Foster. 
"It's perfect; 85% of American life takes place inside them."

THE WEEK AHEAD: KIEV; NEXT NUCLEAR TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ukraine's Parliament is scheduled to meet today for the first time since 
President Leonid M. Kravchuk announced an historic agreement with the United 
States and Russia to eliminate all nuclear weapons on Ukrainian soil. 
</P>
<P>
 The Parliament, or Rada, is expected to be deeply divided and could even 
reject the disarmament deal that was the highlight of President Clinton's trip 
to the former Soviet Union last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Kravchuk argues that because the trilateral agreement signed Friday in Moscow 
was a "statement," and not a treaty, it does not require parliamentary 
approval. Key lawmakers disagree, and could demand the treaty be submitted for 
ratification or rejection.

THE WEEK AHEAD: BRASILIA; PAYING THE PIPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An investigative panel probing corruption in the Brazilian legislature is 
scheduled to release its final report Saturday, and at least two dozen 
lawmakers are facing near certain expulsion from congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The report concludes a nearly four-month investigation into a huge kickback 
and influence-peddling scheme in which ranking members of the congressional 
budget committee allegedly pocketed millions of dollars of taxpayers' money in 
exchange for writing budget items favoring pet projects for select politicians 
and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel is expected to recommend censure or expulsion of up to 30 
legislators, who may later face criminal charges. A separate investigation into 
alleged misdeeds by construction companies is also scheduled to get underway in 
the next few months.

THE WEEK AHEAD: MUNICH; A KEY ENDORSEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The largest two political parties in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's ruling coalition 
meet here next Monday to formally name the Federal Constitutional Court 
president, Roman Herzog, as their joint candidate to succeed Richard von 
Weizsaecker as Germany's chief of state next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The endorsement of Herzog, 59, comes almost exactly two months after Kohl's 
hand-picked candidate for the German presidency, the little-known eastern 
German politician Steffen Heitmann, succumbed to public criticism following a 
series of gaffs and withdrew from the race. 
</P>
<P>
 The endorsement of both Kohl's Christian Democrats and the Bavaria-based 
Christian Socialist Union will give Herzog, a respected jurist, the inside 
track to win the indirect presidential election next May 23.

THE WEEK AHEAD: WASHINGTON; REVITALIZED TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Revitalized by President Clinton's weekend meeting with Syrian President Hafez 
Assad, the Middle East peace talks resume next Monday in Washington with 
negotiations between Israel and Syria the focus of efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Israel and Syria are expected -- with strong U.S. prompting -- to bring 
major proposals to Washington, aware that a breakthrough in their negotiations 
could turn 1994 into the "year of peace" for the region. Talks with Jordan and 
Lebanon will also resume. 
</P>
<P>
 The key issues between Israel and Syria remain whether Israel can trust 
Syria's promises of peace, how far Israel will retreat on the Golan Heights and 
what guarantees of security each country will require.

DOCUMENTARY; GIVING EURO DISNEYLAND A WHIRL; * AN AMERICAN GIRL FINDS PLENTY OF 
JOIE DE VIVRE AT THE TROUBLED PARK NEAR PARIS. PRICES ARE ANOTHER MATTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My daughter Katie gripped the controls in gloved hands and, with a cold rain 
spitting in our face, we soared above the gray wintry tableau of Euro 
Disneyland on -- what else? -- Dumbo the Flying Elephant. 
</P>
<P>
 Down below, families in matching yellow Disney rain ponchos ($4.50 at shops 
everywhere) gamely strolled through the puddles. Cheerful Christmas music, and 
the scent of popping corn and baking cookies, wafted up from Main Street U.S.A. 
</P>
<P>
 And, through the mist, we could see Le Chateau de la Belle au Bois Dormant, or 
Sleeping Beauty's castle. And wasn't that the Evil Queen from Blanche-Neige et 
les Sept Nains, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, watching us from one of the 
balconies? 
</P>
<P>
 Hearing my 5-year-old's delighted giggles, as Dumbo leaped up and down at her 
touch, I had to admit we were having fun. Dressed in corduroy pants, woolen 
hats, heavy coats and rain gear, to be sure. But having a good time, just the 
same. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, climbing onto a docked pirate ship, and probably speeding from 
infusions of chocolate and sugar, Katie said: "People like Disney, don't they, 
Dad?" 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, they do. Of course, I didn't have the heart to tell her that Michael 
D. Eisner, chairman of the Walt Disney Co., had only a few days earlier said 
Euro Disneyland might close unless European banks agreed to restructure its 
$3.7 billion in loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney has agreed to keep its European subsidiary, which owns 49% of the 
shares, afloat for three months. And Eisner is playing the kind of economic 
hardball that a youngster probably wouldn't appreciate. 
</P>
<P>
 But the paradox of Euro Disney is that the park itself, from Thunder Mountain 
to Star Tours, and the Mad Hatter's Tea Cups to the Pirates of the Caribbean, 
has been a success, by almost anyone's measure. More than 18 million visitors 
have spun through the turnstiles since the opening in April, 1992, making it 
the single largest tourist attraction in France, far surpassing even the Eiffel 
Tower and the Louvre. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in Europe said it wouldn't work. They said this wasn't Florida. They 
said it was too cold. But, in fact, it works," said Jean-Marie Gerbeaux, Euro 
Disney's vice president of communications. "That was the first big challenge -- 
to demonstrate that we could draw people. And that's been very important to 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Le Monde, the influential daily newspaper, admitted recently that "we 
(French) had rather taunted this improbable transplant" of American popular 
culture, calling it a "cultural Chernobyl" and a "conservatory of nothingness." 
</P>
<P>
 "Euro Disney provoked from the beginning a reflex of rejection among the 
intellectuals," the paper noted. "And then, with time, even the most hostile 
have accepted it." 
</P>
<P>
 Accepted it, in large part, because it boosted the region's beleaguered 
economy. Euro Disney has generated tax revenue and paychecks in abundance -- 
8,500 new permanent jobs and 46,000 other jobs linked to Disney's existence. In 
fact, Euro Disney is responsible for half the new jobs created in France since 
its opening. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's the problem? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the economic recession in Europe has brought France 12% unemployment and 
hurt tourism everywhere. The 5,500 rooms in Disney's six hotels had an average 
occupancy rate of 55% last year, well below the company's expectations. Then a 
weak real estate market thwarted Disney's plans to begin selling off some of 
its hotels last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Euro Disney suffered an operating loss of $300 million last year and took an 
additional $600 million one-time loss for staff cuts and pre-opening expenses. 
It is in debt up to Mickey's ears and can't make its loan payments. Now 60 
creditor banks are trying to decide what to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Katie and I had waited and waited for a sunny day to make the first of what 
would be two visits to Euro Disney. When the sun appeared on New Year's Day, we 
bundled up against the 42-degree temperatures and boarded the train, which 
takes 40 minutes from downtown Paris to the park in the eastern suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
 We paid the high-season rates that apply over the Christmas holidays -- about 
$45 for adults and $30 for children -- and joined more than 30,000 other 
"guests," as Disney calls us. 
</P>
<P>
 We wandered through the park, which is laid out along the same lines as its 
older sibling in Anaheim, with wedges of the circular pie devoted to 
Discoveryland, Fantasyland, Adventureland, Frontierland and Main Street U.S.A.. 
</P>
<P>
 Our first stop was for chocolate chip cookies at the Main Street deli, a 
personal favorite of Katie's homesick Mom and Dad. Then we headed for Katie's 
favorite attractions, remembered from her last visit to California's 
Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a Small World," sponsored here by the French state telephone company, 
was Katie's first choice, followed closely by Alice's tea cups and flying 
Dumbo. The lines were fairly long, with waits ranging from half an hour to 90 
minutes at the Big Thunder Mountain roller coaster. 
</P>
<P>
 The dozens of shops selling Disney goods were clogged with browsers, but there 
were no lines at the cash registers. Sticker shock is probably the biggest 
complaint about Euro Disney, which has been troubled by lower-than-expected 
spending inside the park. 
</P>
<P>
 We found the prices were steep, due in large part to a strong French franc, 
with stuffed animals beginning at about $30. We dropped $60 for two 
skull-and-crossbones pirate hats, a plastic dagger and a pirate pistol for 
Katie and her younger brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Then we went in search of lunch. Several of the restaurants were closed so we 
chose a Tex-Mex joint, Fuente del Oro Restaurante. I was disappointed to see 
the restaurant's fajita bar closed and no evidence of the advertised "live 
mariachi music." 
</P>
<P>
 "This chili is really good!" Katie said. It had better be, I responded, at 
$6.50 for a tiny bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 We ended our first day in the park by watching "C'est Magique , " a live 
musical program, with young dancers and all the Disney characters switching 
easily from English to French and back again. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, we were back, this time in a driving, cold rain. Only a few 
thousand hardy souls joined us. Gone were the long lines. Gone, too, was much 
of the sparkle. This was a weekday in January, the start of the low season, and 
the winter rates were reduced to $30 per adult and $22 per child. (Seasonal 
fares, a first for Disney, were introduced last fall to cope with what Disney 
officials call "high seasonality," a euphemism for cruddy winter weather.) 
</P>
<P>
 Katie took in the Aladdin parade down Main Street, with Aladdin and Jasmine 
waving from beneath an umbrella. An assortment of characters, from Mickey and 
Minnie to Tweedledum and Tweedledee, prowled the park's covered areas in what 
seemed to me to be a desperate search for children to amuse. In the empty lobby 
of the Disneyland Hotel, Minnie Mouse used me as a shield to play hide and seek 
with Katie for nearly 10 minutes, until I finally escaped. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerbeaux met us there to talk about the park's successes and failures, the 
latter of which have become daily fare for the French press. (Philippe 
Bourguignon, the Frenchman who took over as chairman of Euro Disney last April, 
isn't doing interviews during the financial talks.) 
</P>
<P>
 Euro Disney has shelved the original grand plans for a second-stage expansion, 
and it cut 950 mostly administrative jobs last month. But construction is still 
under way in the park, and several new attractions will be added this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is hoping for an increase in visitors when a new Euro Disney 
station for France's high-speed train line is opened in May, cutting travel 
times to the park from all over continental Europe. The opening of the Channel 
Tunnel later this year will cut the trip from London to the park to just three 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Disney "imagineers" have been tinkering with the park, 
conducting thousands of exit interviews. "Euro Disney has to adapt," Gerbeaux 
explained. Among the changes made last year was reducing the size of the four 
sit-down restaurants, increasing the seating at the fast-food places and adding 
wine -- a first for Disney -- to some menus. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought, because we were in Paris and Europe, we needed more seated 
restaurants," Gerbeaux said. "But, in fact, when French people come to the park 
they don't spend hours at lunch." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the wine, "everybody thought we added wine because of the French," who 
account for 45% of the visitors, Gerbeaux said. "In fact, it was much more the 
non-French Europeans. The French come for the American experience. They want to 
drink a Coke and eat a hamburger." 
</P>
<P>
 Some prices also have come down. The lowest-price meals have been cut to about 
$8, from $12, and even a cup of coffee costs less, $1 instead of $2. One of the 
park's six hotels now offers $52-a-night double rooms for a family of four 
during the winter. However, the premier facility, the Disneyland Hotel, still 
runs $250 a night for a family of four in the low season. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, Gerbeaux said, the chairman wants to change the Disneyland 
concept, to make it, well, less American. "Euro Disney should become, not 
French or European, but it must have its own personality," he said. "Of course, 
we must stay very, very Disney. But we want people to feel at ease." 
</P>
<P>
 In the lobby of the Disneyland Hotel, Katie and I found Christopher Jordan, 
his wife, Lulu, and their three children hiding from the rain. They had come 
from England for a three-day visit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The weather? Oh that. It's fine," Christopher Jordan said. But he complained 
about the costs. "We came with money to spend, but we didn't spend as much as 
we would have because it felt like daylight robbery," he said. "Don't get me 
wrong. The place is beautiful, and we've enjoyed ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, those price tags don't mean much to children. And kids aren't 
dissuaded either by the inclement weather. For them, the Disney magic still 
exists in Marne-la-Vallee. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6 p.m., as the park closed, Katie and I left the Disneyland Hotel, 
rain-soaked but smiling. "This was great," Katie said. "You know, Dad, if we 
lived in this hotel, everytime we went outside we'd be in Disneyland."

WORLD VIEW; LEARNING TO GIVE AS MUCH AS WE TAKE FROM EARTH; * 'SUSTAINABILITY' 
OFFERS HOPE FOR ACTIVISTS WHO SAY THE HUMAN SPECIES IS MULTIPLYING FASTER THAN 
RENEWABLE RESOURCES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN WRIGHT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a tiny overcrowded office at the Brookings Institution, a prominent 
Washington think tank, a new computer program code-named "Sugarscape" has 
simulated the patterns of life -- and created new visions of the Earth's 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 Some 7,500 miles away in Arabuko Sokoke, the largest remaining coastal forest 
in East Africa, Kenya's Museum Society has launched a new program with the 
Giriama tribe to harvest butterflies for export -- and to help alleviate local 
poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 And in El Paraiso, Honduras, World Neighbors, an Oklahoma-based humanitarian 
aid group, is teaching women to make basic medicines out of back-yard plants -- 
cough syrup out of bougainvillea flowers, for example -- both to improve their 
health and their self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 The link between Brookings, butterflies and El Paraiso is one of the broad new 
principles -- and buzzwords -- now giving direction and shape to the post-Cold 
War world: sustainability. 
</P>
<P>
 Promoted by the U.N. World Commission on Environment and Development in 1987, 
sustainability was originally defined as efforts that "meet the needs of the 
present generation without compromising the needs of future generations." In 
other words, encouraging economic growth while also preserving the environment 
-- goals once considered incompatible. 
</P>
<P>
 But seven years later, the term is also associated with a quiet revolution 
redefining the national security agenda, overhauling concepts of foreign aid 
and providing a great new impetus to political change worldwide. It's 
effectively become a new barometer of human progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sustainable development is the sine qua non of the new world order," said Gus 
Speth, U.N. Development Program chief. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sustainability is now essential to achieve all of the major international 
goals of the United States or any other country -- peace, democratization, 
disease control, migration control, environmental protection and population 
stabilization." 
</P>
<P>
 The revolution comes none too soon. The Worldwatch Institute's "State of the 
World 1994," published this week, offers several dire new warnings, including 
one on food scarcity. 
</P>
<P>
 After 40 years of record food production gains, output per person has reversed 
with "unanticipated abruptness." Human demands are now "approaching the limits 
of oceanic fisheries to supply fish, of rangelands to support livestock, and, 
in many countries, of the hydrological cycle to produce fresh water," it 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1993, the fish catch per person had declined 7% from a historic high in 
1989. Grain production per person in 1993 was 11% less than in the peak year of 
1984.  
</P>
<P>
 "The world's farmers can no longer be counted on to feed the projected 
additions to our numbers. . . . As the nineties unfold, the world is facing a 
day of reckoning," Worldwatch warns. 
</P>
<P>
 The report is only the latest red flag. In 1992, 1,600 scientists, including 
102 Nobel laureates, issued a "warning to humanity." 
</P>
<P>
 "No more than one or a few decades remain before the chance to avert the 
threats we now confront will be lost and the prospects for humanity 
immeasurably diminished. . . . A new ethic is required (which) must motivate a 
great movement, convincing reluctant leaders and reluctant governments and 
reluctant peoples themselves to effect the needed changes," it said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sustainability appears to be the most effective response, according to U.N., 
U.S. and World Bank development specialists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Development thinking has progressed from a focus on per capita income in the 
1960s to social indicators in the 1970s to political dimensions in the 1980s to 
environmental sustainability concerns in the 1990s," Speth said. 
</P>
<P>
 Over 70 countries have established councils on sustainable development, while 
the five-year U.N. development program has been revised to focus on sustainable 
projects. Even the World Bank, often criticized for shortchanging ecology 
issues, now helps borrowers with "environmental action plans." And last year, 
the United States adopted sustainability as a policy goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet a key problem of sustainability is that neither ecologists nor economists 
have fully determined Earth's limits -- or how sustainability can soon be 
achieved, according to John D. Steinbruner, director of foreign policy studies 
at Brookings. 
</P>
<P>
 All past projections were flawed. In the 18th Century, English economist 
Thomas Malthus' theory on the geometric spiral of population growth and its 
environmental impact turned out to be simplistic. In the 1970s, the Club of 
Rome's predictions about the future were widely believed to be excessively 
alarmist. 
</P>
<P>
 And despite studies of the Worldwatch Institute and other groups, many 
mainstream economists contend market forces are sufficiently flexible to 
alleviate future ecological threats. Creating a Model  
</P>
<P>
 To help finally settle that debate, Brookings, the World Resources Institute 
and the Santa Fe Institute have launched Project 2050, a collaborative project 
to address critical questions. What constitutes a sustainable society? What is 
the critical time period? And what strategies promote sustainability? 
</P>
<P>
 At think tanks and universities around the world, Project 2050 participants 
are now engaged in high-tech studies of obvious issues like climate and 
population as well as far-flung variables such as cultural differences and new 
political actors. 
</P>
<P>
 The mission of Brookings' "Sugarscape," developed by Joshua Epstein and Robert 
Axtell, is to identify the basic rules of collective behavior through 
simulations.  
</P>
<P>
 It's called Sugarscape because one program tracks the behavior of dozens of 
"agents" -- red and blue dots representing life forms -- unleashed randomly on 
a screen with two sugar mountains, which represent resources. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most basic simulation, all agents flock to one of the two mountains, 
around which they create two distinct cultures. As each society prospers, their 
growing populations tax resources, leading agents to forage between mountains 
-- and to either trade or combat between the two societies to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 The lesson? Confirmation of the basic principle of "carrying capacity" -- or 
the largest number of any species a habitat can support indefinitely -- and the 
dangers of exceeding it. 
</P>
<P>
 Most ecologists long believed that when a population exceeds carrying capacity 
resources decline -- then so does the species. 
</P>
<P>
 And that point may be nearing -- or here. "As a result of our population size, 
consumption patterns and technology choices, we have surpassed the planet's 
carrying capacity," Worldwatch warns.  
</P>
<P>
 The implications may be sweeping. "The ideological conflict that dominated the 
four decades from 1950 to 1990 is being replaced by conflict between steadily 
growing demand for food and the Earth's physical capacity to satisfy those 
demands," it claims. 
</P>
<P>
 "The deteriorating balance between food and people . . . will increasingly 
preoccupy national political leaders, reorder national priorities and dominate 
international affairs." 
</P>
<P>
 Sugarscape represents the theoretical search for sustainability and long-term 
guidelines. But the term has multiple definitions and applications.  
</P>
<P>
 Other more tangible, short-term projects deal with everything from poverty and 
women's rights to AIDS. Butterflies in Kenya  
</P>
<P>
 One new model is the Kenya Museum Society's butterfly program, which reflects 
the shift away from big-buck, high-tech mega-projects based on foreign 
expertise that were a hallmark of foreign aid during the Cold War. The new 
emphasis is on low-cost micro-projects sustainable by local people. 
</P>
<P>
 It also exemplifies the new approach to the problem of deforestation. Since 
the mid-1970s, 10% of Kenyan forests have been cut down for crop lands or wood 
products, and polls show most tribes near Arabuko Sokoke -- the Giriama, Digo, 
Duruma, Choyi, Rabai, Ribe, Jibana, Kambe -- want to clear what remains to 
farm. 
</P>
<P>
 Worldwide, forests cover 24% less land than in 1700. Just between 1980 and 
1990, forests decreased by an area twice the size of Pakistan or Texas, 
according to Worldwatch. And most tropical forest land cleared now can sustain 
crops for only a few years, while species eliminated in the process are gone 
forever. 
</P>
<P>
 So the Kenya Museum Society set out to alter the balance of power between 
humankind and nature by changing attitudes and interaction -- beginning with 
Arabuko Sokoke's butterflies. The goal is "sustainable use of a forest resource 
that can economically benefit the local community."  
</P>
<P>
 Launched last June, the project teaches farming families how to raise 50 
butterfly pupae (the stage between larva and adult) per month for export, at 
one dollar per pupa, that amounts to an income supplement ($600 a year) greater 
than the country's $385 per capita annual income. 
</P>
<P>
 And it is cost-efficient. The museum will receive a one-time grant of $50,000 
from the new joint small-grants program of the United Nations and the World 
Bank. After that, the venture will last as long as it can sustain itself 
through butterfly sales -- a growth market because of foreign interest in 
entomology. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ten years ago, development was synonymous with growth, size and quantity. Big 
dams, resorts or cities were the name of the game," explained Alicia Barcena, 
executive director of the Earth Council. (The Costa Rica-based body was created 
by the 1992, U.N.-sponsored Earth Summit environmental conference in Rio de 
Janeiro to enact its recommendations.) 
</P>
<P>
 "But that model didn't work as we thought it would. Poverty, unemployment and 
other problems are worse than ever. All this happened as we liquidated our 
natural capital, the environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, a study of 25 World Bank-financed projects in Asia, Africa and Latin 
America during the Cold War found over half had no lasting developmental impact 
six to 10 years later. Most also could not be sustained without outside funding 
or expertise. And they didn't produce anticipated benefits, said Michael M. 
Cernea, the bank's senior adviser for social policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Failure is also reflected in the widening gap between rich and poor, despite 
billions spent worldwide for development. Farming in Honduras  
</P>
<P>
 In 1960, the wealthiest 20% of the world's people accounted for 70% of global 
income. By 1989 their share increased to 83%. The poorest 20%, meanwhile, 
accounted for only 1.4% of global income, according to Worldwatch. 
</P>
<P>
 The El Paraiso project in Honduras reflects another new model to deal with 
inadequate arable land -- a crisis at the heart of food scarcity.  
</P>
<P>
 During the Cold War, China's lost arable land alone exceeded an area equal to 
crop lands in France, Germany, Denmark and Holland combined -- enough to 
support 450 million people, or a third of its population, at 1990 grain yields, 
Worldwatch says. 
</P>
<P>
 Globally, crop lands damaged between 1950 and 1990 by moderate to extreme soil 
erosion total an area equal to China and India combined. Yet to feed the 
world's projected population, output must triple in the next 50 years, 
according to the U.N. Development Program. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of helping Honduran farmers increase crop yields -- a 
one-dimensional and standard form of aid -- World Neighbors in 1990 adopted an 
integrated approach that in the spirit of sustainability addresses the links 
between poverty, population and environmental deterioration.  
</P>
<P>
 In hands-on workshops in fields or in centers of sun-bleached adobe, El 
Paraiso trainers cover issues from breast feeding and child nutrition to 
reading, women's rights and velvet bean crops. Velvet beans, which can be made 
into cocoa and brownies, are 40% protein, a good animal feed and a 
soil-replenishing crop. 
</P>
<P>
 New "social scaffolding," grass-roots co-management, and the use of local 
traditions to introduce innovations help development last, according to U.N. 
and World Bank officials. The only foreigner is the American administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 "We take a decentralized approach. And we try to work with the people as 
equals, not as experts," explained Gregg Biggs, a World Neighbors senior 
associate. The project is already showing significant results. Migration by 
poor rural farming families to shanties around the capital began to slow after 
the project began in 1990, and some are even starting to return to the 
countryside.  
</P>
<P>
 El Paraiso also underscores the extraordinary role of non-government 
organizations (NGOs) in development -- a field once largely the domain of 
governments in the industrialized West.  
</P>
<P>
 "The rise of NGOs is enormously important to sustainable development, and it's 
symbolic of a broader shift," said Jonathan Lash, president of the World 
Resources Institute and co-chair of the President's Council on Sustainable 
Development. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, sustainable development still has a long way to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're facing a series of extraordinary challenges of greater magnitude in 
scope and scale than human beings have ever had to deal with," said S. Jacob 
Scheer of the Natural Resources Defense Council and author of "One Year after 
Rio." 
</P>
<P>
 "The movement will have to accelerate many times to really deal with the 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Only two of the 178 countries in Rio -- the United States and Uganda -- met 
the November deadline to report on compliance with the U.N.'s environmental 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite growing international consensus and new concrete solutions, U.N. 
officials, economists and ecologists all complain of an "implementation gap." 
Limited resources, lack of political will and inadequate technology transfers 
are among the leading problems, according to Nitin Desai, U.N. undersecretary 
for Policy Coordination and Sustainable Development. "We have to move beyond 
the point of defining the problems to more action," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And the hundreds of sustainability projects launched since 1990 constitute a 
small fraction of development worldwide, while limited numbers benefit from 
their efforts. The Kenyan project aids only 50 families, while El Paraiso 
serves 2,000 Hondurans. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, the United States alone spent $11.4 trillion (in constant 1992 
dollars) on preventing a strategic attack from the East Bloc between 1950 and 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "And if there'd been an attack, it would have been serious," Steinbruner said. 
"But in all probability, the consequences of that would still have been nowhere 
near as great as triggering an irreversible environmental effect." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet among both economists and environmentalists, there is a sense that 
sustainability is the cutting edge of the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "Occasionally in human history, you get a shift of perspective that has large 
cascading implications," said Steinbruner. "We feel that way about sustainable 
development." Availability of Renewable Resources 
</P>
<P>

catch up with population growth. 06,31,07,07,07,10,08 % change Per Circa 1990-

NATIONAL AGENDA; RUSSIAN FIREBRAND'S FIRST WEEK IN PARLIAMENT DELIGHTS RIVALS; 
* VLADIMIR ZHIRINOVSKY BLOODIED HIS FACE AND HIS REPUTATION WITH HIS 
SHENANIGANS. SOME LUKEWARM SUPPORTERS ARE BACKING AWAY.

<P>
 He has bloodied his face in a lunchroom scuffle, threatened to throw fellow 
lawmakers in prison when he comes to power and pounded his fist on the podium, 
barking at the august assembly: "Shut up!" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, ultranationalist firebrand Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovsky has had 
quite a first week in the new Russian Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been, in fact, exactly the kind of week that his opponents would have 
wished on him: full of senseless scandals that helped chip away at the 
credibility that allowed nearly one-quarter of Russian voters to support his 
party in last month's parliamentary elections. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who hope he will self-destruct, it has been a very good week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very delighted with Zhirinovsky's latest steps," reformist lawmaker Gleb 
P. Yakunin said. "All his speeches and actions in the Parliament prove he is 
totally out of his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "His clown-like image is already beginning to irritate people. I think that if 
television and the newspapers cover all he does for the next two months, public 
opinion will sway away from him," Yakunin continued. "In a couple of months he 
will no longer be a real threat to the democratic forces." 
</P>
<P>
 Zhirinovsky, a 47-year-old lawyer who has called for a one-party dictatorship 
and a Russian march toward the Indian Ocean, has declared that he plans to use 
his coming two years in Parliament to lay the groundwork for a run for 
president in 1996, when incumbent Boris N. Yeltsin's term ends. 
</P>
<P>
 His opponents, none of whose parties came close to Zhirinovsky's in Dec. 12 
elections, center their hopes on the likelihood that the erratic, motor-mouthed 
extremist will simply do himself in with his antics. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian media, guilty of failing to predict Zhirinovsky's election success 
and doing little to head it off, now appear to be making maximal efforts to 
help him destroy himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The daily Kuranty printed verbatim Zhirinovsky's remarks from the podium of 
the Duma, the lower house of Parliament in which his misleadingly named Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia has 63 members out of 444.  
</P>
<P>
 "Don't bother me! Shut up!" he shouted to quiet noise in the hall. Then: "I'm 
speaking, and you're going to stay seated!" When some reformist deputies 
immediately began to get up and leave in protest, he shouted at them, "Get out 
of the hall! Get out of the hall! All of you get out of the hall! The 
Communists didn't keep enough of you in prison!" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly B. Chubais pointed at his watch to 
show him that time was up, Zhirinovsky snapped, "Mr. Chubais, you'll be looking 
at your watch in your cell in Lefortovo (Prison) so that they'll serve you 
lunch." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rossiyskaya Gazeta said the speech "crossed the line into hysteria." 
</P>
<P>
 When Zhirinovsky exchanged blows in the Duma buffet with St. Petersburg 
businessman Mark Goryachev, it made front pages of most major newspapers. The 
Rossiyskaya Gazeta headlined the account "Register for Lefortovo with Vladimir 
Volfovich," because Zhirinovsky threatened Goryachev, too, with imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
 The lunchroom scuffle also did Zhirinovsky's image no good: Newspapers said it 
developed because Zhirinovsky refused to wait his turn to be served -- a 
despised approach in a country where people used to spend hours each day in 
lines. Zhirinovsky also reportedly struck the first blow, but it was his face 
that ended up with a bloody scratch. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Novaya Gazeta, or New Newspaper, commented that Zhirinovsky appears to 
follow the slogan, "Not a day without a scandal." 
</P>
<P>
 And the weekly Itogi television program showed some of his more outrageous 
moments on Sunday night, including a few that made him look truly insane. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhirinovsky appeared to totally enter the world of fantasy by claiming that he 
was a good buddy of Yeltsin's who played checkers and went to the sauna with 
him once a month at his dacha. Also, he claimed, Yeltsin "reads my book every 
day," referring to "The Last Dash to the South," a cross between an 
autobiography and a call to arms. 
</P>
<P>
 He snapped at an Italian reporter that Italians were good only at making 
"pizza and spaghetti, pizza and spaghetti." And he was filmed telling a Western 
journalist where to meet him for an interview, "And grab a check for -- how 
much can you pay? $40,000? Can you pay that? How much? How much? Twenty 
thousand. That's it. In cash." 
</P>
<P>
 Some newspapers are even going beyond the call of duty. The daily 
Komsomolskaya Pravda reprinted a graphic account from Bild -- a sensationalist 
German tabloid-flavor newspaper -- allegedly describing a stripper's 
frightening night with the would-be Russian president during his recent visit 
to Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the biggest perversion I've ever experienced in my life," she told 
Bild. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhirinovsky's atrocious behavior in Parliament has already cost him dearly. 
Parties that had reserved judgment on him, saying they would wait to see how he 
acted as a lawmaker before deciding whether they could work with him, are 
already throwing up their hands in despair. 
</P>
<P>
 At the first meeting of the Duma's factions, reformists and moderates walked 
out because Zhirinovsky insisted so rudely on chairing the next Duma session. 
The factions returned only after the head of a centrist party assured them that 
if Zhirinovsky's behavior did not improve, all the other parties would isolate 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhirinovsky had originally appeared intent on taking one more serious shot at 
legitimacy by assuming the chairmanship of the Duma's Foreign Relations 
Committee. But in voting on Monday, deputies approved Vladimir P. Lukin, the 
outgoing ambassador to the United States, as the committee's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhirinovsky's "tenure as head of the committee would lead to nothing but 
scandals with other countries," Yakunin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhirinovsky himself may not have minded much. He has already begun to deride 
the Duma as a waste of time and has said he sets his sights higher: on becoming 
foreign minister.

PROFILE; GUATEMALA'S OTHER INDIAN ACTIVIST; * TUYUC HASN'T WON A NOBEL. BUT SHE 
WINS RESPECT AT HOME FOR HER HUMAN-RIGHTS WORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rosalina Tuyuc was a young mother of two when her husband left for work one 
day and never returned. 
</P>
<P>
 The family had fled their rural homeland and moved to the capital in search of 
safety. But in Guatemala in the 1980s, there wasn't much safety for Mayan 
Indians, regarded by the army as pro-communist guerrilla sympathizers and 
decimated in military scorched-earth campaigns that wiped out entire villages. 
</P>
<P>
 For Tuyuc, the destruction around her became a call to action. She founded, 
and still heads, an increasingly high-profile organization of indigenous women 
whose husbands were among the tens of thousands of peasants killed or who 
disappeared during the brutal civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 While exiled Nobel peace laureate Rigoberta Menchu receives more international 
attention, Tuyuc slugs it out in the trenches in Guatemala, promoting the cause 
of indigenous rights and challenging the military at great personal risk. 
Within Guatemala, she has emerged as the country's most visible Mayan Indian 
activist.  
</P>
<P>
 Today Tuyuc and her organization, known as the Guatemalan National Widows 
Coordinator are taking up issues, such as forced military service, that place 
them squarely at odds with the army and the government of President Ramiro de 
Leon Carpio. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be no change in Guatemala as long as the hand of the military is 
always behind things," Tuyuc said in a recent interview, sounding a theme that 
recurs through her many speeches and public demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
 The solemn-faced 36-year-old, who wears her dark hair in braids or wrapped in 
a long ponytail down her back, sat behind a desk at the widows committee 
office, housed in a drafty, nondescript building that is purposely not marked 
with a sign or other identification. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last October, a list circulated with 21 names of people who were threatened 
with death if they did not abandon the country within 72 hours. Tuyuc headed 
the list. But the threat -- not the first she's received -- barely got a rise 
out of Tuyuc. 
</P>
<P>
 "The threats are innumerable," she said casually. Then she added: "It is a 
despicable way to try to make us feel terrorized. They are trying to get us to 
stop making complaints and to stop our work. They will not succeed." 
</P>
<P>
 The "they" is not articulated. But the Guatemalan army makes no secret about 
its opinions of Tuyuc and her followers. As far as the military and the right 
are concerned, Tuyuc is a leftist front for the guerrillas who have been 
fighting a civil war with Guatemalan governments for more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is the way they try to destroy us," Tuyuc said when asked about the 
labels she is given by her enemies. "First we are communists, then we are 
terrorists." 
</P>
<P>
 She denies ties to the guerrillas, although she and they clearly share some of 
the same positions, especially with regard to indigenous rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to 60% of Guatemala's nearly 10 million people are descendants of the 
ancient Mayas, yet deeply entrenched racism has denied Indians very much 
political power.  
</P>
<P>
 The war has claimed 100,000 lives, with some 40,000 people missing. Most of 
the dead and vanished are Indians.  
</P>
<P>
 A native speaker of Kakchiquel, one of the more than 20 Mayan dialects used in 
Guatemala, Tuyuc last year focused on two principal issues: forced military 
recruitment and the so-called Civilian Self-Defense Patrols, paramilitary 
organizations formed by the army to control villages and implicated over the 
years in serious human rights abuses. 
</P>
<P>
 The Guatemalan army has routinely pressed young Indian men into military 
service, often snatching them from their villages or rounding them up after 
church, at school or during festivals. White and Ladino (non-Indian) youth are 
rarely touched. Consequently, Tuyuc argues, military service is ultimately used 
to dilute the Indian culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sons of the farm owners, the sons of the middle-class, they are not 
forcibly pressed into service," Tuyuc said. "Only our sons are obligated . . . 
It is an affront to the very culture of our people. It plants terror from one's 
early youth, it prepares them for violence. They lose their cultural identity." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than call for military service to be eliminated, Tuyuc and her 
organization have proposed an alternative plan. Service would be voluntary, 
young men would be allowed to serve nearer to their homes and villages, and 
those who are conscientious objectors would be allowed to perform community 
service instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuyuc led a march on Congress last August, and Enrique Guillen Funes -- one of 
only six indigenous Congress members -- agreed to sponsor a bill incorporating 
the reforms Tuyuc proposed. But since then, the bill has languished. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The army denies its recruitment policies are racist. Most of the officers 
corps is white or Ladino , while the vast majority of the troops are 
indigenous.  
</P>
<P>
 Tuyuc is also challenging the continued use of the self-defense patrols, whose 
abysmal human rights records have led to calls they be disbanded. When he was 
human rights ombudsman, a position he held until last June, De Leon agreed that 
the patrols should be eliminated; now, as president and dependent on the 
military, De Leon has backed away from that belief. 
</P>
<P>
 Given his work in human rights, the De Leon presidency raised expectations 
among many Guatemalans. But it "has been a fairly large disappointment," Tuyuc 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As with the military recruitment, Tuyuc said she is looking for a compromise 
on the self-defense patrols issue. Rather than eliminate the patrols 
immediately, she is asking that some of the more notorious ones simply be 
disarmed. 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, Tuyuc is grappling with the same questions of direction and 
strategy that face the indigenous movement as a whole. Some organizations are 
beginning to believe they must move into the mainstream, join established 
political parties and adopt less radical tactics to achieve their goals. Others 
believe militant tactics are still necessary to be heard. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuyuc came under much criticism, even from supporters, when she led a takeover 
of the headquarters of the Organization of American States late last year. Her 
goal was to force the issue of the self-defense patrols, but her decision to 
invade a diplomatic post was controversial. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are the conscience of the people . . . but some of their measures are 
now seen as unnecessary," said political analyst Gabriel Aguilera. "It is true 
that you have to be aggressive to be heard . . . but it has its limit. What 
good is it if you don't achieve things?" 
</P>
<P>
 Tuyuc does not consider the OAS takeover a mistake, although she concedes that 
it did not accomplish anything very concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe we did not get a meeting with the government, but at least we got the 
subject (of the patrols) to be discussed," she said. "It has been a subject 
that has been silenced, but now it is gaining force in the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Will the widows committee enter formal politics, form a party and run 
candidates in future elections? Tuyuc said no, for now, and denies widespread 
speculation that she would run for legislative office in elections that may 
take place later this year. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 A native of the highlands town of Chimaltenango, Tuyuc formed the widows 
organization in 1988, starting, she said, with about 1,000 women. Today the 
group counts 13,000 members.  
</P>
<P>
 Like many Indian children, Tuyuc began working in the homes of Ladinos when 
she was about six. She cared for the babies of the Ladino women, but unlike 
many Indian children she was able to study, learn Spanish and eventually go to 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 First Tuyuc lost her father, who was kidnaped by the army in 1982. She and her 
husband moved to Guatemala City in 1985 to escape the military campaigns 
through the countryside. In May of that year, her husband disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never knew anything more of him," she said. "One day some men arrived and 
told me he was alive at a military base, and what I had to do was accompany 
them and I would see him. But because of the lies we were told all the time, I 
knew not to go with them. It would be the end of me. And that's the only time I 
ever heard anything about him." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuyuc, who had two children with her first husband, recently remarried and has 
a 6-month-old baby with her current husband. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tuyuc admires and closely follows Menchu, whose worldwide campaign for 
indigenous rights won her the 1992 Nobel Peace Prize. Pictures of Menchu are 
plastered all over Tuyuc's office. It was the widows organization that 
championed the candidacy of Menchu for the Nobel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rigoberta has been a symbol for all of us who fight in the resistance," Tuyuc 
said in admiration. "She is the voice of the oppressed. The work she has done 
opens doors at levels we could not have achieved." 
</P>
<P>
 But Menchu, who lost much of her family to the Guatemalan military, spent most 
of the past decade in exile. Thus it has been up to Tuyuc and activists like 
her to fight the battles at home.  
</P>
<P>
 "Rosalina is my Nobel laureate," said Fernando Lopez, head of the human rights 
office of the Roman Catholic archdiocese. "The presence, the fighting spirit, 
the charisma that she has within Guatemala is much greater than Rigoberta's. 
Rigoberta comes here for visits, Rosalina shows her face." Biography Name: 
Rosalina Tuyuc 
</P>
<P>
 Title: Founder and head, Guatemalan National Widows Coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 36 
</P>
<P>
 Personal: Mayan Indian activist. Hometown, Chimaltenango, Guatemala. Began 
working in homes of non-Indians at about age 6, caring for babies. Father 
kidnaped by army in 1982; husband disappeared in 1985. Formed widows 
organization in 1988. Recently remarried, to Pedro Pu Gomez. Has 6-month-old 
plus two children from previous marriage. Receives frequent death threats. 
</P>
<P>
 Quote: "There will be no change in Guatemala as long as the hand of the 
military is always behind things."

WHITE HOUSE SHIFTS GEARS ON AID AGENDA

<TEXT>
<P>
 While the Bush Administration was the bete noire of the 1992 U.N. 
environmental summit in Rio de Janeiro, the Clinton Administration shifted 
gears in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "We now see the sustainable development initiative as the cutting edge of 
preventive diplomacy," said Brian Atwood, the new administrator of the Agency 
for International Development (AID). 
</P>
<P>
 AID still has $8 billion worth of traditional projects in the pipeline, but 
the centerpiece of a revamped and smaller new agenda are 50 missions focusing 
on sustainability. 
</P>
<P>
 The new AID programs include microenterprises in Asia, integrated 
tree-planting and women's empowerment programs in Africa and an unusual project 
this year in Jamaica. After AID-funded training on family planning and AIDS, 
drivers from a local brewery there will sell condoms and educate owners, 
clients and prostitutes in bars where they deliver beer. ROBIN WRIGHT

CHANGING LIFESTYLES; FOR SYRIA'S JEWS, A MODERN FLIGHT FROM DAMASCUS; * 
PRESIDENT HAFEZ ASSAD HAS OPENED THE DOOR FOR THE LAST 1,250 OF THE TINY 
MINORITY TO LEAVE THEIR CENTURIES-OLD QUARTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 DAMASCUS, Syria -- For years, Faraj Mousa Mamroud has been a fixture at the 
Ibn Maimoun School in the heart of the Jewish quarter of old Damascus. He is 
like the chairs he repairs, the doors he re-hinges and the floors he sweeps 
each day. At 46, Mamroud the janitor is part of the very fabric of the only 
Jewish school left in Syria -- indeed, of the dwindling community it serves. 
</P>
<P>
 But last week, Mamroud's life changed forever. So too did the fate of the last 
members of his, the most politically sensitive and symbolic Jewish community in 
the Arab world. And come this Sabbath, Mamroud and his family will be gone, 
ending 3,000 years of unbroken generations of Jews in his family to be born, 
live and die in their gritty, ancient quarter of an equally ancient Arab land. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Mamroud will hang up his broom, lock the door of the house passed 
down by his ancestors, board a plane for New York and embark on a future that 
is as uncertain as the Middle East peace process his exodus is meant to aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Mamroud's fate, along with those of the hundreds of other Syrian Jews still in 
Damascus despite years of appeals to leave, was sealed in a preamble to 
Sunday's summit between President Clinton and Syrian President Hafez Assad, who 
ended years of diplomatic wrangling over the future of Syria's tiny Jewish 
minority by agreeing last month to issue immediate exit visas for the last 
1,250 Syrian Jews there. 
</P>
<P>
 It was among several important recent concessions to the United States and to 
the Israeli government by the durable Syrian strongman, who holds the key to 
any lasting peace in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Assad's decision to speed the departure of Syria's Jewish community, 
announced after he met with Secretary of State Warren Christopher here last 
month, helped pave the way for Sunday's presidential summit in Geneva. It came 
after years of pressure from the United States, the destination of all but a 
few of the 2,500 Syrian Jews who have left Damascus in the two years since 
Assad first relaxed longstanding travel restrictions on them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The atmosphere now is very encouraging, and the people are full of hope," 
said Syria's chief rabbi, Avraham Hamra, the leader of Syria's Jewish community 
for the last two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting beneath a portrait of Assad that is the centerpiece of his office in 
the Ibn Maimoun School last week, Hamra said he expects most of his 
congregation to settle in Brooklyn. There, they will join a 30,000-member 
Syrian Jewish community that dates to early this century, when Jews fled 
persecution by Syria's Turkish occupiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about "the bureaucratic problems" that had delayed the exit visas for 
his congregation before Assad's promise to Christopher last month, Rabbi Hamra 
demurred. "This region is seeing changes and events that are accelerating every 
day," he said. "So let's not speak in the past. Let's speak in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The rabbi spoke of the collective joy of his congregation's newfound freedom. 
Their exit permits have come after decades during which Syria permitted only 
individual family members to leave the country. For decades before that, the 
Jews were confined to a 3-mile radius around their ancient quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 But there will be challenges and sadness too, Rabbi Hamra knows.  
</P>
<P>
 Many in his congregation, he said, will face new economic and social hardships 
in America, where unemployment and culture shock have led several dozen members 
of the community to return to Syria, at least temporarily. And those who have 
committed themselves and their descendants to a new life in America will lose 
more than their ancestral roots in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 All the emigrants, the rabbi said, are leaving their houses and most of their 
possessions behind, less as a hedge against the future than a matter of the 
law. There are few Arab buyers for the ramshackle homes in a neighborhood where 
state law prohibits development or improvements. Even if they could sell, few 
families would: It is illegal for any citizen to leave the republic with more 
than $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the rabbi insisted that some in his congregation are more content than 
others to keep their property in Damascus -- as long as the peace talks 
continue between Israel and its Arab neighbors. A peace treaty between Syria 
and Israel, he said, would translate into prosperity for anyone who owns land 
in a city where real estate prices already are soaring. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, though, most of the Syrian Jews clearly are far more content to 
leave, even if it means leaving behind their homes, their roots and a 
once-lively Jewish quarter that is now little more than a shuttered and 
padlocked maze of lanes increasingly resembling a ghost town. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, I am very happy," said Mamroud, the janitor, as he contemplated 
his upcoming journey. Unlike most of the emigrants, Mamroud said he has some 
idea of what lies ahead. He spent 45 days in America seven years ago, when he 
was not permitted to bring his wife or children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles," he said, when asked what impressed him most about a trip that 
took him to visit relatives in New York and California -- the state where he 
said he hopes to live. "It was so developed. There are high buildings 
everywhere. The roads. Everywhere, there are big, modern roads. And the 
climate. The weather in Los Angeles is more like Damascus." 
</P>
<P>
 First, though, Mamroud said he must settle in Brooklyn, where he and his wife 
and four children will join his eldest son, who emigrated there 14 months ago 
and now is working as a tailor in the borough's 90-year-old Syrian Jewish 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 What will the gaunt and frail janitor do for a living in New York? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know yet. It depends what I will find there." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, though, he smiled broadly, his red eyes creased with joy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will do what I have done my whole life," Mamroud said. "I will depend upon 
God, and everything will be fine."

MEDIA; POPULAR TURKISH ACTOR USES LAUGHTER TO HEAL SOCIETY'S WOUNDS; * LEVENT 
KIRCA MAKES COMEDY SKETCHES OUT OF BRUTALITY AND TORTURE.'THE POOR NEED JOKES 
AS WEAPONS AGAINST OPPRESSION,' HE SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The uninitiated might think it takes a sick sense of humor to make comedy 
sketches about police torture, slaughterhouse-like hospitals and death lurking 
around every corner. But for Levent Kirca, increasingly hailed as Turkey's best 
comic actor, it is his country that is sick. His job, he says, is to treat its 
deep social wounds with laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 And what laughter. Turks find giggles bubbling up at the mere sight of his 
protruding eyes, bushy mustache and mobile face. Even a foreign interviewer is 
liable to weep with laughter as the 44-year-old Kirca relates the tragicomic 
absurdities that beset Turkish life. 
</P>
<P>
 Turkey certainly offers a rich mother lode of inspiration. Culturally, Turks 
are shaped by seemingly conflicting forces -- their Muslim identity, their 
intellectual identification with the Christian West and their geographical 
position on the fault line between Asia and the Mediterranean, Western Europe 
and the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a different kind of humor. People here want more than Mel Brook's 
slapstick. They want something inside. The poor need jokes as weapons against 
oppression," Kirca said. It is not just the poor who need to laugh away the 
frustrations that accompany the many pleasures of life in Turkey: from all 
classes and regions, more than half the population of 60 million tune in every 
Thursday night to his show -- "That'll Do Nicely Television." 
</P>
<P>
 "Since turning the ratings upside down in 1986, 'That'll Do Nicely' has ruled 
the airwaves. Levent Kirca is television's most permanent and indispensable 
star," said a profile in Turkey's Panorama newsmagazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirca does not want success to cut him and his 35-person support staff off 
from reality. He rents a five-story building for their studios amid the mud, 
workshops and potholed streets of one of the crowded industrial suburbs of 
Istanbul. "We only have to walk out the door and we are on set," said Kirca, 
the son of a painter and a teacher who started his career in the theater after 
he left school at the age of 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirca's first love is still the stage. Despite a grueling television schedule, 
he keeps his company busy with musicals and tours of the provinces and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirca is the company's lead actor, director and producer, but his studio is 
like a collective of the country's best acting talent. Lines are quickly 
rehearsed and learned on the laughter-filled set. There are no demarcation 
lines. Cameramen and prop makers are pressed into service with walk-on roles or 
even dressed up as sheep.  
</P>
<P>
 The sketches pull no punches, despite the well-judged buffoonery. In one, 
Kirca's camera follows a character who innocently sets out to buy a loaf of 
bread one morning in his pajamas, falls by accident into the hands of the 
political police and ends up spending long years in a series of jails. In 
another, it finds that the only place where the discredited Turkish Parliament 
can muster a quorum is in a vulgar nightclub full of drunken old pols, ethnic 
Kurdish singers out on parole and pistol-toting feudal bosses. 
</P>
<P>
 Anger against the passive acceptance of brutality in rural Turkey gives plenty 
of scope for the cutting wit of Oya Basar, the group's lead actress and also 
Kirca's wife. She parodies a glossy after-shave commercial about knowing men by 
their scent. Dressing herself up in the costume of a peasant wife in a head 
scarf, Basar sports a massive black eye, simpering that she knows her man "by 
his jealousy . . . by his blows."  
</P>
<P>
 The show cuts even closer to the bone. "We believe women should not be beaten. 
But as we discussed it for a script, we realized it's not just women," Kirca 
said. "Everyone is getting beaten in Turkey -- soldiers, pupils, children by 
other children. In Parliament, deputies are not just beating each other, but 
shooting each other dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Kirca bravely lampoons the Turkish armed forces, which, despite the 
liberalization of the country since the last period of military rule in 
1980-83, still felt free last month to throw two respected television 
journalists in jail just for airing interviews with people who regretted doing 
their military service. 
</P>
<P>
 The police are an even more frequent target. Kirca's Police Festival, set in 
the torture cells, provided a bitterly satirical version of folk celebrations 
up and down the country. Instead of dancing in traditional rows, however, the 
inmates were set into coordinated motion by bursts of electric current. Somehow 
the absurdity is hilarious. Kirca says he is trying to expose, teach and 
improve. 
</P>
<P>
 He tries not to directly address two of the most divisive subjects on Turkey's 
political agenda: the ethnic Kurdish question and Islamic fundamentalism. His 
group privately thinks a religious upsurge is the biggest threat facing Turkey 
today. However, Kirca said: "The wounds are too fresh. We want to collect 
everybody under one roof."

CULTURE; MUMMIES; * THE PRIZED REMAINS OF EGYPTIAN PHARAOHS WILL RETURN TO 
PUBLIC DISPLAY IN CAIRO, AIDED BY THE GETTY INSTITUTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For years they have slumbered in silent twilight, stretched out in splendid 
repose in a storeroom of the Egyptian Museum. Here in this cluttered mausoleum, 
the same sun that once gave life to Egypt's pharaohs peeks each morning through 
small, dusty windows near the ceiling and creeps noiselessly across their 
grinning teeth and shrunken eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Egypt has always welcomed outsiders to the painted tombs of its pharaohs and 
the magnificent temples erected to ancient gods. But for years the royal 
mummies have been hidden from public view -- shielded by the conviction, dating 
from the heyday of the Islamic revolution in Iran, that it would be unseemly to 
display bodies of dead kings. 
</P>
<P>
 But political realities change, and so, it seems, does the fate of these 
3,500-year-old relics. It started in 1980, when former Egyptian President Anwar 
Sadat criticized Iran for displaying on television the bodies of American 
servicemen killed during an abortive hostage-rescue mission near Tehran. 
Iranian Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini responded angrily: What was Egypt doing 
displaying the bodies of its pharaohs to tourists? Sadat swiftly banished the 
mummies to the basement. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, both Sadat and Khomeini are dead. And the royal mummies are once again 
going on public display -- thanks not only to new politics, but to new 
technology that will allow their ancient corpses to be protected from the 
modern-day hazards that lay outside their quiet tombs. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can see all the objects in the pictures, you can go to any square in the 
world and see the monuments created by these people -- the obelisks in New 
York, or Paris, or Istanbul or Rome. But this does not compare with looking 
face to face with the men that did these works -- that man who made all this 
empire!" said Nasry Iskander, who for 20 years has studied Egypt's mummies and 
who is now heading the project to reopen the mummy room at the Egyptian Museum 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 11 royal mummies will go on display during the first phase, 
including Seti I, Ramesses II, Ramesses V, Tuthmosis IV and Queen Henttawi, the 
lovely, full-bosomed queen, only about 22 when she died, who was the wife of 
Pinejem I and the only mummy to be successfully restored. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the rulers who presided over the greatest years of Egyptian 
civilization and who created the cult of priests whose mysterious ceremonies, 
documented in hieroglyphic inscriptions and ancient papyri, preserved the 
bodies of the pharaohs and nobles in the belief that a new and eternal life was 
to come after the pharaoh's death barge sailed through the stars of the night. 
</P>
<P>
 For the new exhibit, the Egyptian Museum is gathering together all the 
materials which accompanied this ancient rite of death: The fox-like hood worn 
by the priest during his prayers over the dead king, the ankhs (small crosses 
with an arched oval joining the two arms) held aloft to symbolize eternal life 
and the wedge used to help breathe the spirit of life into the pharaoh's mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum even has the tools used in the mummification process, which wasn't 
fully understood and duplicated until the 1940s. On display will be the sloped 
embalming table, with a basin at one end used to collect bodily fluids; tiny 
pricks and knives, used to remove the viscera from a small hole in the lower 
abdomen and suck the brain out through the nose. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the body was then packed in natural salts to extract the remaining 
fluids from the tissues, and it was then wrapped in resin-coated linen and 
draped in a garland of lotus flowers, some of which survive today. 
</P>
<P>
 During the fabled expeditions of the 19th Century when most of Egypt's burial 
treasures were uncovered, the pharaohs themselves eluded a generation of 
French, Italian and British adventurers and were presumed to have been long ago 
plundered. Then, in 1881, Sir Gaston Maspero, a professor at the College de 
France, arrived in Egypt and opened an expedition to find out for sure. 
</P>
<P>
 Maspero had returned briefly to Paris when his assistant, Emile Brugsch, 
prevailed upon local villagers to lead him along a long and winding path 
through the Deir al Bahari line of cliffs near the ancient city of Thebes (now 
Luxor). They descended into a deep shaft, from which they entered a chamber 
filled with coffins. On their lids they read names that could only have been 
dreamed of before: Amosis, founder of the New Kingdom; Tuthmosis I,II and III; 
Ahmose Nefertari, patron of necropolis workers; Ramesses I and II; Seti I. All 
the major pharaohs dating from as far back as the 17th Dynasty, about 1580 B.C. 
 
</P>
<P>
 In all, there were 39 mummies, 19 of them royals. (A second cache discovered 
in 1898 boosted the total of unearthed royals to 27.) 
</P>
<P>
 Brugsch was left with two fears: The first, that the remainder of the 
unbelievable treasure might be plundered if it were left to the villagers; the 
second, in those politically unstable times, that the locals might be enraged 
at the sight of foreign archeologists hauling out such a precious Egyptian 
treasure. He decided in favor of preservation, and loaded the mummies onto a 
boat to sail up the Nile to the protection of the museum in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
 Brugsch recalled the scene in a magazine article of the day unearthed by John 
Romer in his book, "The Valley of the Kings:" 
</P>
<P>
 "When we made our departure from Luxor, our late helpers squatted in groups 
upon the Theban side and silently watched us. The news had been sent down in 
advance of us. So, when we passed the towns, the people gathered at the quays 
and made most frantic demonstrations . . . the women were screaming and tearing 
their hair." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The royal mummies went on display in 1953 in room 52 of the Egyptian Museum -- 
which quickly became its most famous room -- and remained there until Sadat 
ordered them secreted. "I can't accept exposing the remains of Egypt's pharaohs 
in exhibitions for people to view. This is against the commandments of the 
three religions -- Islam, Christianity and Judaism," the late Egyptian leader 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Iskander sees the mummies as examples of history and a lost civilization. 
"These are magnificent leaders, and you feel you want to see them face to 
face," he said. "On the other hand, these are not any more human beings. They 
are now objects. And everybody must now look at them as objects, not as bodies 
of human beings." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 130 years after the discovery of the first cache -- 3,000 years 
after it was last sealed -- technology now is playing an important role not 
only in preserving the mummies but in learning the secrets of their ancient 
identities. 
</P>
<P>
 The display cases, developed by the Los Angeles-based Getty Conservation 
Institute, provide a nearly oxygen-free environment that is as near the still 
air of the tomb as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, very little research has been done on the conservation of 
organic materials," the Getty Institute said in an announcement of the showcase 
project. "Through this project, part of our environmental research program, we 
are developing preventive conservation methods that can be used by museums 
throughout the world to protect their collections." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to protecting the mummies, technology is for the first time 
allowing scientists to extract ancient DNA samples -- a human version of 
"Jurassic Park" -- to establish royal genealogy trees and confirm the 
identities of mummies who often were reburied in the wrong casket. 
</P>
<P>
 A study by the Australian Center for Egyptology in cooperation with Utah's 
Brigham Young University, completed last year, extracted the genetic 
building-block material from mummified bones, membranes and teeth and 
established a clear genetic relationship spanning three generations from 
4,200-year-old mummies uncovered near Fayoum, Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can identify grandfather and grandmother and son and daughter, and by 
marriage, granddaughter and grandson," said Iskander, who participated in the 
study. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that scientists have been able to extract DNA from mummies and 
perform restoration work that has shown tissues to be virtually intact "means 
that the process was perfect," Iskander said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we want to present with this is that it was not just an act, it was a 
process, physical and spiritual. Each piece of it that remains means something. 
It shows it was a real civilization, a unique civilization."

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; A NEEDED CLEAN SWEEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The scandal-ridden Santa Margarita Water District is better off without its 
chairman, Don B. Schone, who resigned Sunday. Schone correctly noted that 
continued bad news from the district was harming its effectiveness. But it was 
Schone himself who was at the center of the latest round of disclosures. 
</P>
<P>
 The chairman resigned hours after The Times reported that in 1990 and 1991 he 
stayed in Cabo San Lucas in Mexico as the guest of Robert Bein, William Frost & 
Associates, an Irvine engineering firm that does business with the water 
district. Schone did not file the state-required conflict-of-interest forms, 
nor did he abstain from voting on matters involving the engineering company, as 
required by state law. 
</P>
<P>
 Schone claimed that he did not report the trips because he did not understand 
fully the reporting requirement. But conspicuously absent was any explanation 
of why he failed to file amended reports last year, after extensive reports in 
The Times on lavish spending by the district's top two executives, who have 
since resigned. The two, former district General Manager Walter W. (Bill) Knitz 
and his assistant, Michael P. Lord, are subjects of a joint federal and state 
investigation of possible conflict-of-interest violations. 
</P>
<P>
 It is now apparent that having skeletons in the closet affected Schone's 
ability to chastise Knitz and Lord fully. He merely said he probably should 
have paid closer attention to their expense accounts. In what amounted to 
mutual back-scratching, Schone approved Knitz's expense accounts and the 
general manager approved Schone's. Thus Schone OKd Knitz's $245 limousine ride 
around New York's Central Park and Knitz signed off on Schone's $275 bill to 
take part in an Orange County horseback ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Schone was a director of the district for 17 years. He and his fellow 
directors were far too gentle with Knitz and Lord when their extravagant 
spending first came to light. One director did resign soon after the initial 
reports; three others were later defeated at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 Schone's resignation provides the necessary clean sweep of directors who were 
in office while the dollars were being so freely spent. 
</P>
<P>
 The report of Schone's excesses demonstrates that the district's problems were 
systemic. And there is a larger lesson there for public officials at every 
level of government. Executives cannot hold their subordinates to a stricter 
standard than they follow themselves. In public service, the best leadership is 
by example. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, the Santa Margarita Water District has taken necessary 
actions to try to prevent a recurrence of its problems. It rightly instituted 
one of the toughest codes of ethics of any public agency in California. But the 
district directors must make sure the code is followed. Lack of oversight in 
many obscure government agencies like the water district long has been a 
problem, especially when directors hold office for term after term and become 
lax in scrutinizing the actions of staff members. When directors join in 
treating the job as a ride on the gravy train, it's worse. 
</P>
<P>
 There are several studies under way on possible consolidations of special 
districts in Orange County, and some districts are considering toughening their 
own ethics codes. Those are hopeful signs that some of the lessons of the Santa 
Margarita Water District scandal may be sinking in.

 College students casting about for careers might want to consider turf science 
-- not the art of handicapping horses but the care and maintenance of golf 
courses. 
</P>
<P>
 Turf science majors at Purdue University have all found jobs upon graduation 
over the past eight years, according to Purdue agronomy professor Clark 
Throssell. 
</P>
<P>
 And there's room for advancement, the university suggests in a newsletter 
listing job possibilities -- but only for grads whose grass is always greener.

<P>
 Market Overview  
</P>
<P>
 * The Dow industrials inched up to a new high, though the broad market was 
mixed. Wall Street trading was slowed by the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday and 
by the Southern California earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 * The bond market was closed for the holiday. Elsewhere, crunching cold in the 
East and earthquake-related supply fears drove oil prices sharply higher. 
Stocks  
</P>
<P>
 The Dow, still riding Friday's 25-point rally, added 3.09 points to close at a 
new high of 3,870.29. 
</P>
<P>
 But trading was subdued because of the holiday. Just 234 million shares 
changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange, where losing issues narrowly 
outnumbered winners. 
</P>
<P>
 Volume also was slowed by the absence of some of Los Angeles' major 
institutional investors, including Capital Group and Dimensional Fund Advisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some analysts were cheered because the carry-over of last week's rally 
included smaller stocks: The Russell 2,000 index of smaller issues joined the 
Dow at a new high, rising 0.62 point to 261.89. 
</P>
<P>
 Other indexes were mixed, however, and some disappointing fourth-quarter 
earnings reports weighed on the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Some of 1993's high-flying growth stocks were slammed as quarterly earnings 
reports failed to exceed expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 The losers included software firm Parametric Technology, which plunged 5 to 33 
1/4 after its earnings of 25 cents a share just met expectations, and wireless 
telecom technology developer Qualcomm, down 3 1/8 to 51 after reporting 
earnings of 18 cents a share, versus a loss a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Universal Electronics, a maker of remote controls for audio-video 
equipment, plummeted 10 to 9 3/4 after reporting a quarterly earnings shortfall 
that it attributed to slow sales. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the plus side, industrial issues tied to the strengthening national 
economy continued to surge. Caterpillar jumped 2 to 92 1/2; Alcoa added 1 1/4 
to 74 1/4; Deere leaped 3 1/8 to 79 5/8; Union Carbide gained 1 1/8 to 24 1/4; 
Phelps Dodge rose 1 to 53 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some building-related stocks surged, helped by expectations of 
reconstruction in quake-ravaged Los Angeles and fallout elsewhere. Kasler 
jumped 1 7/8 to 10; Fluor added 1 1/4 to 42 1/2; gypsum board maker USG gained 
7/8 to 34 7/8; Republic Gypsum leaped 7/8 to 13 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among Southern California utilities, SCEcorp lost 1/4 to 19 1/2; Pacific 
Enterprises (parent of Southern California Gas) inched up 1/8 to 23 1/8, and 
Pacific Telesis slipped 3/8 to 55 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * First Interstate fell 1 1/8 to 68 3/4. Paine Webber downgraded the stock, 
citing its recent price surge. 
</P>
<P>
 * Diet center operator Jenny Craig dove 1 5/8 to 8 3/4 after reporting it 
earned 4 cents a share in the fourth quarter, down from 25 cents a year 
earlier. It blamed a drop in new enrollments. 
</P>
<P>
 In overseas markets, London's FTSE-100 index rose 7.2 points to 3,407.8, while 
Frankfurt's DAX index eased 4.44 points to 2,137.38. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, the Nikkei index lost 248.33 points to 18,725.37. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa gained 19.65 points to 2,506.33. Other Markets  
</P>
<P>
 A weather forecast of continued below-normal temperatures in the Northeast, 
the main heating oil-consuming region, pushed home heating fuel prices up 1.41 
cents, to 53.67 cents a gallon on the New York Merc. 
</P>
<P>
 The rise in heating oil helped boost crude oil prices. February crude futures 
on the Merc gained 32 cents to $15.10 a barrel. The price continued to recover 
from a five-year low of $13.75 a barrel, reached in mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles earthquake prompted additional buying, analysts said. Power 
outages caused by the quake were believed to have shut down some of the 
refineries south of Los Angeles, although no major damage to refineries was 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, gold for current delivery rose $2.10 an ounce to $391.60 on the New 
York Comex. Silver surged 9.9 cents, to $5.31 an ounce.

SMALL BUSINESS: A NIMBLE COMPETITOR SUCCEEDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Biggs, president of Enforcer Products Inc. was sure the hotel staff had 
set up way too many chairs for the company's annual sales meeting in December. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe how many chairs were in that room," said Biggs. "I 
remember when we met in a Cartersville motel room with seven chairs." In fact, 
there were about 130 sales representatives and staffers at the December 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past three years, Enforcer has almost doubled its sales to about $100 
million and has quadrupled its work force to about 200 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Enforcer is based in Cartersville, Ga., a small town outside Atlanta. The 
company, which sells about 100 insecticides and household cleaning and 
maintenance products, has stuck by the offbeat management structure it set up 
from the beginning. By not emphasizing titles and rotating the presidency, it 
takes an ego-free approach to managing the business. Founder Wayne Biasetti and 
marketing whiz Jim Biggs take turns serving as president every few years. Chief 
financial officer and partner Ed Brush keeps an eye on the money and computer 
operations, but he also plays a major role in the marketing decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are having a bad day, chances are your partners are not, so the 
company can still enjoy having an owner that's positive and productive," said 
Biasetti, who founded the company in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Biasetti has an MBA, he realized that in order to be successful he 
needed to find partners with strengths to balance his weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Typically, a marketing man is not that great with money, and a money man is 
not that great with marketing -- and a manufacturing man is a whole other 
animal," said Biasetti, who is primarily responsible for manufacturing 
operations and currently holds the title of chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Biasetti said he and his entrepreneurial partners still enjoy working together 
despite the challenges posed by skyrocketing sales. To cope with the growth, 
they divided employees into eight teams that focus on different product areas. 
They also freed their six regional sales managers from daily selling 
responsibilities to better manage the 100-plus sales representatives around the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Enforcer often beats its much larger corporate competition by being able to 
bring products to market fast. It also encourages sales people, vendors, raw 
material suppliers and customers to come up with the new product ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, a new household ant barrier designed to be sprinkled around the 
perimeter of the home was the brainchild of a new salesman who had been trying 
to sell the idea to his former company for years. His new bosses at Enforcer 
liked the idea so much that the company only took about 45 days to develop and 
put the product on the market. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't believe the passion he (the salesman) has for this product," said 
Jim Biggs, president and marketing chief. "Just about every product we have 
comes from the sales people." 
</P>
<P>
 When sales representatives told Biggs that potpourri scent was gaining 
popularity among consumers, Enforcer raced to create a line of flower-scented 
products. The company also packaged them in lavender-colored boxes rather than 
its traditional bright red packages. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can probably bring out a retail product faster than anyone else around," 
said Brush. "We have no ego problems. Once we get behind something, we can move 
forward very quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 The company also looks to its vendors and chemical suppliers for product 
ideas. The company's new hair-dissolving bathroom drain opener uses the same 
chemicals that are in cream hair removers popular among women. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gambled that women would recognize the smell of the chemical and realize 
how it works," said Biasetti. 
</P>
<P>
 Enforcer segments the market and boosts sales by producing different products 
for different jobs. For instance, it sells a drain opener specifically for 
kitchen sinks and an enzyme product designed to help septic tanks function 
better. A recent hit, at least among the company's owners, is a flea trap that 
traps fleas on a sticky surface mounted behind a plug-in night light. 
</P>
<P>
 They attribute their growth in part to the fact that their products are mostly 
nontoxic and are not dangerous to people, animals or the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our all-time winner caught 1,700 fleas in one night and sent them back to 
us," said Biasetti. "It was disgustingly successful." 
</P>
<P>
 When they are not counting fleas, the partners are figuring out ways to make 
the company grow. Brush said Enforcer changed banks two years ago because their 
banker was too conservative and unwilling to fund the growth. Today, Brush said 
his banker at Trust Co. in Atlanta is eager to help the company grow and expand 
with new buildings and new people. Enforcer, which occupies a quarter-mile-long 
building on 12 acres, is adding new warehouse space every year. 
</P>
<P>
 Biggs, the marketing chief, predicts that the privately held company will 
double in size and sales again in four to five years. "We constantly find more 
good sales people and more good products," he said. "We'd also like to buy 
existing product lines." 
</P>
<P>
 Has Enforcer's enormous success changed the partners? 
</P>
<P>
 "We are all basically the same," said Biggs. "We've added a few thing to our 
homes but we still drive trucks, not fancy cars."

DRAWING LINE ON BOSS DIGGING INTO PRIVATE LIFE; SECURITY: CORPORATE SPYING TO 
CURB DRUG USE OR IN-HOUSE THEFT IS WIDESPREAD IN BUSINESS. SOME CONTEND THAT A 
RIGHT TO PRIVACY IS VIOLATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lewis Hubble thought he had found a friend but says he was deceived -- the guy 
was a spy. 
</P>
<P>
 So Hubble and 42 other Kmart Corp. warehouse workers have challenged the big 
retailer with a privacy lawsuit that argues the right to snoop on employees 
ends at the employer's gate. 
</P>
<P>
 The case has aroused debate among security experts, libertarians and business 
ethicists. It poses a question as old as labor history: How deeply into your 
life can your boss dig in the interest of protecting the store? 
</P>
<P>
 "You're damned if you do and damned if you don't," said William Cunningham, 
president of Hallcrest Systems Inc., a security consulting firm in McLean, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you provide overzealous security, you're going to get sued. If you provide 
inadequate security, you're going to get sued by your customers and patrons. 
It's like walking on eggshells." 
</P>
<P>
 Hubble said he wandered innocently into the issue when he accepted an offer of 
an after-work beer from Albert Posego, a fellow employee at Kmart's warehouse 
in Manteno, 45 miles south of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Posego visited Hubble's apartment and even offered to help move his family 
into a new house, said Hubble, who was transferred from Fort Wayne, Ind., in 
October, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you asked me if I had made one friend since coming to Illinois, I would 
have said Al," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Posego was an undercover investigator hired by Kmart Corp. to spy on its 
employees, according to the lawsuit in Cook County Circuit Court filed by 
Hubble and 42 others in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Kmart has said it used the investigators to break up a theft ring at the 
warehouse. It has sought to dismiss the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit contends Posego and at least one other spy worked in the warehouse 
from sometime in 1992 to April, 1993, when their activity was exposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Manteno became Kmart's first unionized site in July after an organizing drive 
by the Teamsters. Kmart said the investigation ended months before the union 
election process began. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit contends Kmart and Confidential Investigative Consultants Inc., 
the Chicago firm that supplied the spies, violated Illinois' privacy law by 
gathering information on employees' opinions about unions as well as such 
seemingly unrelated details as where a worker shopped, an employee's off-duty 
fishing plans, and a female worker's living arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 "This lawsuit goes to the issue of what was being investigated and how it was 
done," said Phillip Snelling, a Chicago lawyer retained by the Teamsters to 
represent the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Kmart spokeswoman Mary Lorencz said the company periodically uses undercover 
investigators "if we believe there's something going on that we need to look 
into." 
</P>
<P>
 The use of such spies is widespread in American business and especially common 
among retailers, whose razor-thin profit margins can be destroyed by theft 
rings, said Pete Sawyers, a spokesman for Pinkerton Security Services in Van 
Nuys, the country's largest security company. 
</P>
<P>
 Employee theft accounted for an estimated $11 billion of the $27 billion in 
shortages reported by U.S. retailers in 1992, says the National Retail 
Federation, a trade group. 
</P>
<P>
 Drug abuse is the other major reason for covert investigations, security 
consultants said. A six-month undercover operation led to the November arrest 
of nearly two dozen General Motors Corp. employees on drug trafficking charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it's done correctly it's a tremendous tool, but it also has its 
potential for abuse," said Charles Carroll, president of ASET Corp., a Dayton, 
Ohio, vendor of drug investigation and education services. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oftentimes a corporation will call us and there's a hidden agenda: They want 
to look at union efforts or troublemakers," he said. Carroll said he refuses 
those jobs. Investigating union activities is forbidden by federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 Carroll said he would report employees' off-duty drug use because it could 
affect their work, even though the employer could not use the information to 
discipline the worker. 
</P>
<P>
 A good investigator is almost certain to learn things of interest to the 
employer that fall outside the intended scope of the investigation, said Wally 
McPheters, president of Workplace Solutions in Boise, Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
 At Boise Cascade Corp., where McPheters was security director until October, 
"we typically would tell our vendor, who then told the operative, we don't want 
non-job-related issues they observe in the personal lives of employees. We 
don't want to know what is happening behind the scenes of a union's affairs and 
its members," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 McPheters said Boise Cascade did "less than a half-dozen" undercover 
investigations during his 3 1/2 years in security there. He said he considered 
the covert probe one tool in a kit that also includes background checks of 
prospective employees, training programs, surveillance cameras and interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 David Hempen, chairman of the investigations committee of the American Society 
for Industrial Security, said he would use undercover agents reluctantly, as a 
last resort. Teaching employees about the importance of teamwork and offering 
assistance for those with drug or emotional problems can go far in preventing 
theft and substance abuse, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the cost. ASET clients pay about $6,000 per month per operative 
and must sign on for at least 90 days. An investigation by Winfield Security 
Corp. of New York costs at least $1,000 per week per operative, said President 
Eugene R. Fink. 
</P>
<P>
 Hempen said it usually takes three to four months for an investigation to 
yield results, and clients sometimes must pay the operative's moving and living 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Spying on workers also carries an unmeasurable cost, said Lew Maltby, director 
of the American Civil Liberties Union's project on employee privacy issues: 
loss of trust in the employer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The spy isn't just watching the guilty employee, the spy is spying on 
everybody and it's a massive deceit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every company has problems, that's why God invented managers," Maltby said. 
"But any manager who can't find out what's going on in the company without 
hiring spies ought to be fired." 
</P>
<P>
 David Messick, a professor of business ethics at Northwestern University's 
Kellogg Graduate School of Management, said reporting on employees' personal 
habits and private lives "is going far beyond what is legitimate in protecting 
the interests of the company." 
</P>
<P>
 He said employers could cover themselves ethically by announcing to employees 
that undercover agents will be coming in to investigate theft or drug problems. 
"Just informing them . . . may be sufficient to solve the problem," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kmart's Lorencz said Messick's idea wouldn't work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously we're not going to tip off potential shoplifters or potential 
employees for theft what our methods are," she said. "That wouldn't make 
sense."

ROCKETDYNE'S SUNNY SKIES MAY GET CROWDED; AEROSPACE: ROCKWELL UNIT MAY FACE 
COMPETITION AS AEROJET AGREES TO MARKET HIGH-PERFORMANCE RUSSIAN ROCKET ENGINES 
FOR SATELLITE LAUNCHES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 At a time when Rocketdyne is stinging from cutbacks in NASA's budget, a rival 
aerospace firm has set up a joint venture with a Russian company that could 
threaten Rocketdyne's lucrative business making rocket engines for commercial 
and military satellite launches. 
</P>
<P>
 The potential challenge comes from Aerojet of Sacramento, which last month 
said it had signed a pact with Samara State Scientific and Production 
Enterprise to refurbish and market 102 rocket engines that were produced by the 
former Soviet government. 
</P>
<P>
 Those engines, called NK-33, were initially designed in the late 1950s for the 
Soviet N1 Moon rocket project. Most of them are fully built and are now stored 
in a warehouse in Russia. Aerojet hopes to market them as a lower-cost military 
and commercial satellite launch vehicle for the U.S. Atlas and Delta rockets, 
which have long been powered largely by Rocketdyne's first-stage engines. 
Rocketdyne's Atlas and Delta motors, sometimes called booster engines, are what 
initially propel the satellite rockets into space. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Rocketdyne's engines, the NK-33 is propelled by liquid oxygen and 
kerosene. But the Russian engine runs at higher pressures and temperatures, 
making it more efficient and powerful than comparable U.S. engines, including 
Rocketdyne's. But the NK-33 has yet to be test fired in the United States, and 
Aerojet still needs to line up funding from NASA or other sources to help it 
get the NK-33 ready to meet U.S. standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Lee, director of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., 
got a good look at the NK-33 at a recent display of the engine. Based on what 
he saw, Lee said the NK-33 could be a cheaper alternative because the engines 
have already been built and need only to be modified, presumably at a fraction 
of the cost of building an engine from scratch. "I would say there probably 
would be some concern at Rocketdyne," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Price is a big factor, experts say, because NASA and others have been studying 
ways to lower the cost of commercial and military satellite launches, which are 
more expensive in the United States than Europe or Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake are contracts worth tens of millions of dollars a year. Rocketdyne, 
the Canoga Park unit of Seal Beach-based Rockwell International, currently gets 
$5 million for each Delta engine it builds, and almost $10 million for an Atlas 
engine. Last year there were seven Delta and five Atlas launches. Rocketdyne's 
work on the Delta and Atlas engines probably accounts for 10% of its overall 
business, which approaches $1 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
 At present Rocketdyne faces no competition for those types of engines. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Sprow, Aerojet's program manager for the NK-33, said the Russian engines 
are technically superior to Rocketdyne's because the NK-33 uses a so-called 
closed cycle that pumps all the fuel into the main engine chamber, rather than 
jettisoning some to prevent overheating, as Rocketdyne's engines do. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprow hopes to get the NK-33 engines to market by late 1995. Aerojet, a 
subsidiary of Ohio-based GenCorp, currently makes the first- and second-stage 
rocket engines that power the Titan satellite rockets, which are launched by 
Martin Marietta. Aerojet also builds the second-stage engine for the Delta 
rocket. 
</P>
<P>
 But Peter McCourt, Rocketdyne's vice president of business development, 
questioned whether the NK-33 could make it to the U.S. market. "So far as we 
know, the NK-33 has never flown successfully," he said. "They had four launches 
of the N1 Moon rocket, and all four were failures. There's absolutely zero 
flight-reliability data." 
</P>
<P>
 Aerojet confirmed that the four NK-1 rocket launches did fail. But Aerojet 
said that was not due to a flaw in the first-stage NK-33 engine, which Aerojet 
claimed performed successfully, but was due to a flaw in another engine. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, McCourt said, Rocketdyne-powered Atlas and Delta rockets have 
flown for 20 years with near-flawless performance. But last March a Rocketdyne 
Atlas rocket malfunctioned due to a loose screw inside the engine, resulting in 
a $137-million satellite failing to reach its correct orbit. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprow conceded that the NK-33 was far from ready for delivery. Besides 
test-firings, he said changes must be made in Russian instrumentation as well 
as mechanical and electrical connections. Sprow added that the joint venture 
hoped to get a commitment from a potential buyer before investing heavily in 
the NK-33. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonnell Douglas Aerospace in Huntington Beach, which launches the Delta 
rockets, said it has been briefed on the NK-33. But spokeswoman Anne McCauley 
said only, "We are following Aerojet's activities with the Russians." 
</P>
<P>
 General Dynamics Space Systems Division in San Diego, which last month 
announced it was being sold to Martin Marietta for $208.5 million, is the 
general contractor of the Atlas launch vehicle. Officials at General Dynamics 
would not comment on the Russian engine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rocketdyne's current contract with General Dynamics calls for delivery of 62 
Atlas engines for a total of $600 million. In February, Rocketdyne signed a 
six-year $200-million deal with McDonnell Douglas to build 40 Delta engines. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocketdyne cannot afford to lose those two contracts, because two-thirds of 
its revenue comes from NASA for work on the space shuttle's main engine and the 
electrical power system for the proposed space station -- both of which are 
facing budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall Congress sharply curtailed the space station budget, and future 
funding for U.S. contractors is uncertain because that program is expected to 
be undertaken jointly with the Russians. And NASA has said it wants to lower 
its cost for space shuttle launches. To prepare for leaner times, Rocketdyne 
said in November that it would trim up to 990 workers, or 15% of its 6,600 
employees. Currently, between 500 and 700 Rocketdyne employees work on the 
Atlas and Delta engines. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Rocketdyne, Aerojet has had its share of troubles because of NASA's 
belt-tightening. Aerojet now produces the orbital propulsion system on the 
space shuttle, and it had been working for three years on developing an 
advanced solid rocket motor for the space shuttle. But NASA scrapped that 
program last fall, resulting in layoffs of about 500 Aerojet workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some of the NK-33's specifications are unmatched by comparable U.S. 
engines, said Walter Williams, a retired NASA chief engineer and now an 
aerospace consultant in Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
 The NK-33, for example, has greater thrust, or the force by which a rocket is 
driven, than Rocketdyne's engines. And as a result, experts say, the NK-33 can 
carry heavier payloads. 
</P>
<P>
 But Williams said performance was just one issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "What will it cost to get the NK-33 ready for use for U.S. launch vehicles?" 
he asked. "What is its safety record? What will the Russians want for the 
engines?"

25 DIE, MANY HURT IN 6.6 QUAKE; FREEWAYS BUCKLE AND BUILDINGS COLLAPSE; 
DISASTER: EPICENTER IS IN NORTHRIDGE, WHERE THREE-STORY APARTMENT COMPLEX 
PANCAKES. RUPTURED GAS LINES ERUPT IN FIRE IN MODERN L.A.'S STRONGEST TEMBLOR.

<P>
 A deadly magnitude 6.6 earthquake -- the strongest in modern Los Angeles 
history -- ripped through the pre-dawn darkness Monday, awakening Southern 
California with a violent convulsion that flattened freeways, sandwiched 
buildings, ruptured pipelines and left emergency crews searching desperately 
for bodies trapped under the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-second temblor, which was not the long-dreaded Big One but erupted so 
fiercely that it initially seemed every bit as intense, was blamed for at least 
25 deaths -- more than half of which occurred when a three-floor apartment 
complex near the epicenter in Northridge collapsed into two stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Triggered by a fault that squeezed the northern San Fernando Valley between 
two mountain ranges like a vice, the 4:31 a.m. earthquake swamped hospitals 
with hundreds of injured people and left thousands more homeless as fires, 
floods and landslides dotted a landscape that has been visited by destruction 
with disturbing regularity in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The major developments: 
</P>
<P>
 * The death toll continued to grow throughout the day. Fourteen bodies were 
discovered in the rubble of what had been the Northridge Meadow apartments. 
Among other quake victims was a Los Angeles police officer who drove his 
motorcycle off a sheared freeway, a Skid Row resident who hurled himself out 
the sixth-floor window of a Downtown hotel and a Rancho Cucamonga mother who 
slipped on a toy as she raced to check on her baby, striking her head on the 
crib. 
</P>
<P>
 * In a painstaking rescue, firefighters worked more than seven hours to save a 
critically injured maintenance worker who was trapped under 20 tons of concrete 
that crumbled at the Northridge Fashion Center's parking structure. 
</P>
<P>
 * Highways across Los Angeles County buckled and crumpled, wiping out major 
commuter thoroughfares and ensuring that life in this car-dependent region will 
be disrupted for months. Hardest hit was the Santa Monica Freeway, the nation's 
busiest, which caved in at the overcrossing of La Cienega Boulevard, and the 
Golden State Freeway, which collapsed at its junction with the Antelope Valley 
Freeway in the Newhall pass. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ruptured gas lines and propane tanks sent fiery balls bursting through 
asphalt roads, burning up to 100 mobile homes at three San Fernando Valley 
trailer parks. Meanwhile, a broken water main on Balboa Boulevard shattered 100 
square feet of pavement, converting the street into a geyser. 
</P>
<P>
 * The temblor, felt as far as Oregon and the Mexican border, left tens of 
thousands of residents without power, gas or phone service. In the historic 
Ventura County community of Fillmore, where brick facades had undergone 
extensive earthquake renovation in recent years, virtually every downtown 
business was damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 * Late in the day, Mayor Richard Riordan initiated a citywide curfew, making 
it illegal for people to remain on the streets from dusk to dawn. President 
Clinton pledged immediate federal assistance while the National Guard was 
mobilized to prevent looting in blacked-out neighborhoods. Gov. Pete Wison, 
touring the area in a helicopter, said: "You begin to wonder how much Angelenos 
are expected to take." 
</P>
<P>
 * Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi, touring areas hit hardest by the 
earthquake, predicted that local authorities will proclaim many older 
apartments uninhabitable. He said thousands or tens of thousands of Los Angeles 
residents may be made homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Had all the shaking not struck on a holiday, or if it had begun a few hours 
later, seismologists fear, the damage would have been far more devastating. 
Even so, Southern California seemed to shudder to a terrifying halt Monday, a 
day of frantic waiting, dramatic rescues, empty highways and fraying nerves. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a 6.5 on the 'Richter scale,' but a 10 on my fear scale," said Nick 
Stevens, 40, an Australian tourist staying at the Hollywood Downtowner Motel. 
"We had been planning to go to Universal Studios, where they have the 
earthquake ride. Now we won't have to bother." 'Come Down and Pray' 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Los Angeles, there were tales of courage -- of strangers helping 
strangers because, as one man said, "it seemed like the right thing to do." 
Salvador Pena owes his life to that spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 Caught during his early morning shift driving a street sweeper along the 
bottom floor of a three-tier parking garage at the Northridge Fashion Center, 
Pena talked with rescue workers for more than seven hours as they blasted 
through slabs of concrete to extricate him. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters had little trouble locating him because of his loud cries for 
help, which they could hear even through the mountain of rubble. To reach Pena, 
rescue workers used jackhammers to drill through two layers of concrete. Then 
they inserted air bags and wooden blocks to lift a concrete beam off his limbs, 
feeding him oxygen as they worked. Once they cut him out of his vehicle, they 
carried him on a backboard through eight feet of debris. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the ordeal, paramedics remained at Pena's side beneath the parking 
deck. "He was in a lot of pain and he kept saying, 'Come down and pray with me, 
come down and pray," said Rey Lavalle, a Los Angeles city firefighter who spoke 
with Pena in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 When a helicopter finally airlifted Pena from the busy mall's rubble-strewn 
parking lot and headed to UCLA Medical Center, onlookers cheered and applauded. 
Late Monday, he was in serious condition with crushed legs and a partially 
dislocated spine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I almost cried -- I was elated, we all were," said Capt. Jim Vandell of the 
Los Angeles City Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, at the three-story Northridge Meadow apartments, firefighters and 
urban search and rescue squads crews hunted frantically for anyone who might 
have survived the collapse of the bottom floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you hear any voices? Have you gone around and yelled?" a firefighter asked 
residents, some of whom stood in the street in bathrobes. 
</P>
<P>
 The search continued until nightfall, with rescue workers using sonar 
equipment sensitive enough to detect even the shallowest breath amid the 
rubble. Those who had died were left inside the building so rescuers could 
concentrate on extricating survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 For four hours, Hyan Sook Lee stood vigil by an oak tree, peering in the 
apartment that had been her upstairs neighbor's. Her own apartment was now 
below ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, a registered nurse, said she was able to crawl out of her apartment with 
her 12-year-old son, Jason, who broke his leg. But her husband, Pil Soom Lee, 
47, who had been dressing for his job as a mechanic, and her son Howard, a 
14-year old visiting for the weekend from boarding school, were trapped inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a big shaking," she said. "Everything fell down." 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news came at 8:30 a.m. as chain saws still were still whining. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ma'am, listen to me. Your son, how old is your son?" paramedic Dave Thompson 
asked. "This son is dead, ma'am. He is dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee dissolved in tears, her shoulders racked by sobs. An hour later, Thompson 
told her that her husband was presumed dead too. 
</P>
<P>
 Onlookers and journalists applauded when Alan Hemsath, 37, was freed -- 
conscious and in stable condition -- after diamond-bladed saws chewed through 
concrete and wood for 90 minutes to reach into the collapsed first floor that 
had become a tomb. Firefighters heard the man cry out as they tramped through 
the demolished building, pounding on floors and calling out to any survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was just face-down -- pinned by the whole building," rescue worker Doug 
Rogers said. Lights Still Flashing 
</P>
<P>
 The quake wrapped its powerful hands around roadways and shook and shook, 
giving some motorists the most terrifying ride of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Reynoso, 24, and his family drove their car off a sheer, four-foot drop 
where the Santa Monica Freeway buckled and partially collapsed near Fairfax 
Avenue. The Eastside couple and their 2-year-old son were up early and heading 
across town to get a good spot in line for a radio station promotion for Power 
Ranger toys. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple's small sedan was approaching Fairfax, traveling about 60 m.p.h. in 
the fast lane when it began swerving erratically. "It was like all four tires 
had blown," said Reynoso, a county health department worker off for the 
government holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he was playing around," said his wife, Patricia Reynoso. "I said: 
'Stop it. Drive right.' "' 
</P>
<P>
 As Reynoso began to slow down, freeway lights flickered and everything went 
black. "It was blue lights exploding all over," apparently electrical 
transformers arcing and flashing, he said. Crossing Fairfax, the road was still 
swaying and the significance of the sudden dip did not immediately register. 
But they were atop a block-long section of the freeway that had collapsed, 
flattening and crushing its three-foot-thick, concrete and steel supports like 
ice cream cones. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just stop!" Patricia began calling out. But her husband, focused on the 
safety of the freeway shoulder, continued on, working his way over -- unable to 
make out the rift in the roadway ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 The car nose-dived over the edge, jamming Mike and Patricia Reynoso into the 
dash and windshield. The momentum pulled the car forward as the metal 
undercarriage scraped over the ledge and the rear end crashed down. With its 
gears jammed, the car wouldn't move. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't hit us until it was too late," Mike Reynoso said, back home by 
midday, achy but safe after a detour at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The only freeway death came more than an hour after the temblor when a Los 
Angeles Police Department motorcycle officer, Clarence Wayne Dean, 46, plunged 
off the end of a destroyed Antelope Valley Freeway bridge as horrified 
motorists watched from the pavement 30 feet below. 
</P>
<P>
 "His lights were still flashing and he just came tumbling down," said Andy 
Jimenez, 33, of Santa Clarita. "It was unreal." 'A Tidal Wave' of Injuries 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of injured crowded hospital emergency rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen heart attacks, dislocated bones, lacerations. A lot of blood," 
said Toni Regalado, an emergency room admissions officer at Holy Cross Medical 
Center in Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center was receiving "a tidal wave of 
walking wounded," spokesman Ron Wise said. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 44 homes in suburban Sylmar were destroyed by fires unleashed by the 
quake. The neighborhood was reduced to rubble, resembling those destroyed by 
the Southern California wildfires only two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar was the epicenter of a devastating earthquake in 1971 that killed 58 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 Fires fed by ruptured gas and oil mains destroyed other homes in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Al McNeil, whose home in Granada Hills was destroyed by fire, said his "whole 
street was on fire. Even the tall palm trees were burning. It was a very 
frightening experience. We lost everything. We have nothing, but nobody was 
hurt." Dying for Coffee 
</P>
<P>
 Farther from the epicenter, reaction to the disaster was a mix of cool and 
concern. 
</P>
<P>
 At the dimly lit Hughes supermarket in Malibu, people were stocking up on 
bottled water and Pellegrino, Rice Krispies, cookies, London broil and 
hamburger meat. Although most people had merely lost their electricity, the 
fact that the quake came just two months after devastating fires made some 
wonder aloud if someone was trying to send them a message. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom said when she first tried to call me there was a recording on saying 
'Due to an earthquake, the circuits are busy,' " said Janet Mullens, 32, who 
lives near Trancas Canyon. "We were joking that they should just keep part of 
that recording blank and insert whatever they need. Pestilence is probably 
next." 
</P>
<P>
 John Lalanne, 32, a bartender at Alice's in Malibu, was calling his apartment 
on Las Flores Canyon Road simply "the disaster capital of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 "My whole apartment building was doing the hula," he said, demonstrating with 
his hand the undulating motion he saw and felt. He shrugged it off. "I was born 
and raised here. I've been through them all." But he moaned: "I'm dying for a 
cup of coffee, man, and there's none to be had." 
</P>
<P>
 At a 7-Eleven on Ventura Boulevard in Studio City, the cravings were a little 
less refined. By 6:30 a.m., about a dozen people were waiting outside, placing 
orders to clerks who retrieved the items and charged the patrons at the door. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fritos," hollered a blond woman in a black sweat shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 A clerk held up a bag of Lay's rippled chips. 
</P>
<P>
 "No. Fritos," the woman insisted. 
</P>
<P>
 As the clerk searched for the Fritos, the woman called out: "And a six-pack of 
Miller Lite." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, three former residents of the Northridge Townhome Estates sat on the 
curb, watching the smoldering wood, pipes and other debris that used to be 
their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Marian Bogrow said she and her husband, Milt, were saddened to see their home 
of 16 years destroyed, apparently after a gas line burst and engulfed 17 units 
within an hour. But she was heartened by the kindness of her neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I ate all the food I was offered," she said, "I'd gain 20 pounds." 
</P>
<P>
 Appetites also remained hearty at the Original Pantry Cafe in Downtown Los 
Angeles, which lived up to its motto: "We Never Close. Never Without a 
Customer." 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant, owned by Mayor Riordan, hardly missed pouring a single cup of 
coffee. As soon as the one-story structure stopped shaking and the lights went 
out, employees lit candles and continued serving hearty breakfasts to the usual 
mix of early risers headed to nearby offices and industrial plants. "No matter 
what, we never close," Pantry cashier Laura Parra said. "Even during the riots, 
we stayed open." Glad to Be Alive 
</P>
<P>
 From the Westside to Ventura County, the quake toppled chimneys, littered 
streets with glass and destroyed some multimillion-dollar cliff-top homes that 
overlooked Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 On Corona del Mar Avenue in the Palisades, the fronts of two neighboring 
houses toppled down a 100-foot sheer drop onto PCH. Both homes, which were 
deemed uninhabitable, were shambles. 
</P>
<P>
 An 81-year-old woman who owned one of the homes was awakened when 15 feet of 
the sun porch of her 65,000-square-foot home collapsed down the hill. If 
another five feet of the house had fallen off, it might have taken down the 
second floor, where the woman was sleeping, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The house, which was built in the 1940s, looked like it had been looted, with 
furniture, dishes and glass toppled and strewn all over the floors. One- to 
two-inch cracks marked up various parts of the house, which shifted off its 
foundation during the quake, as well as the pavement near the house. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, who would not give her name, is familiar with major losses. She 
lost a home in the 1961 Bel-Air fire, she said. The elderly woman was visibly 
shaken as she recalled the early morning earthquake. She managed to grab her 
cat and escape any injury from the earthquake with the help of neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's just glad to be alive and to have her cat," said the woman's 
granddaughter-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, the cities of Simi Valley and Fillmore suffered the most 
serious damage. Virtually every business in downtown Fillmore was damaged as 
brick facades crashed onto sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 At one variety store, mannequins were thrown through a plate-glass window and 
landed in a gruesome pile on the sidewalk. At the Central Market, owner Harnek 
Sing Behniwal stared at the broken windows, fallen beams and strewn contents of 
his business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't know what to do," he said. "This store was a diamond." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials were particularly upset because the area had recently undergone 
extensive renovation. "Just when we've rebuilt it, we've had to declare it a 
disaster area," Fillmore City Manager Roy Payne said. Tough People 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan was at his Brentwood home when the quake struck and said 
he only had time to check on his pet Yorskhire terriers before driving himself 
to the Emergency Operations Center beneath City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Stopping at a police station on Venice Boulevard to check quickly on the 
condition of the city, Riordan arrived subterranean command post by 5:15 a.m., 
wearing jeans and a Los Angeles Lakers sweat shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 He declared a state of local emergency at 5:50 a.m. and conferred immediately 
with Gov. Pete Wilson and President Clinton, who pledged immediate support and 
dispatched the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 He also announced cancellation of the Martin Luther King Day parade to allow 
police, who were on tactical alert, to concentrate on the emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 "My No. 1 concern and our No. 1 priority is the safety of the city and 
throughout the region," Riordan said. "the people of Los Angeles are resilient 
and know how to handle themselves in an emergency." 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan also provided sustenance for his forces in the packed emergency center 
-- ordering up 500 breakfasts from his restaurant, the Original Pantry. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan said his "heart went out to people and the individual suffering." 
</P>
<P>
 But he added: "We've had worse problems than this in the last 100 years and 
we've managed to rebound because we are a great city," Riordan said. "We're 
tough people and we have incredible leadership and people will be amazed how 
quickly we solve these problems." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department declared a tactical alert before 5 a.m., 
even before the department's chief, Willie L. Williams, could dig himself out 
from the damage in his own Woodland Hills home; a heavy armoire fell in 
Williams' bedroom, missing the chief "by an inch," he said later. A National 
Treasure 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after 10 a.m., Catharine Byl rushed to the front desk at Thousand 
Oaks' East Valley Sheriff's Station and, slightly breathless, yelled through 
the intercom to the watch commander: 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a national treasure that I need to put in the safe." 
</P>
<P>
 As a certified aerospace educator, Byl has a collection of moon rocks on loan 
from NASA. She's planning to show them to schoolchildren in Calabasas next 
week. But as soon as the earthquake hit, she wasted no time depositing them in 
a sheriff's vault. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not supposed to leave them unattended at all," Byl said. "I've been 
carrying them around in my purse. But today, I'm extra anxious to get them 
stored safely in here." 
</P>
<P>
 A few treasures also were gone at the Sherman Oaks Antique Mall. Sixty display 
cases, housing the wares of 81 dealers, crashed to the floor. Rick Johnson of 
Granada Hills, who owns the mall, joked that one item that had survived was an 
autographed copy of Howard Stern's best-selling book. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll just clean it up, put new glass up and start up again," said Johnson, 
who has owned the antique business for six years. "We'll certainly have a big 
sale." 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment though, his main concern was getting someone to board up the 
building, so it would be secure. Although there had been only a few reports of 
looting in the area, he said that one of his assistants, who arrived at 5:30 
a.m., saw "a couple of little old ladies making off with a a silver 
tea-service." 
</P>
<P>
 Looters stole groceries at a convenience store in Arleta. They grabbed coffee 
mugs and T-shirts at the Wax Museum on Hollywood Boulevard. Down the street, 
they stole a 10-inch wooded spear at Bates Brothers Outdoor Sports and 
Taxidermy. A Tarzana dry-cleaner owner said he scared off a group of looters by 
waving a gun at them as they tried to steal dolls and stuffed animals from a 
nearby gift shop. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, police made about a dozen arrests.

 Up to 30 inches of snow piled up on a layer of ice and brought parts of the 
Ohio Valley sliding to a halt Monday, with National Guardsmen mobilized and 
major highways shut down. Schools were closed from Missouri to Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody's moving," said Willie Duley, co-owner of a service station in 
Morgantown, W.Va. "It's pretty bad." 
</P>
<P>
 A new blast of North Pole air was rushing in behind the snowstorm, and Devils 
Lake, N.D., had a midmorning windchill of 92 below zero. Without factoring in 
the wind, Garrison, Minn., was the coldest spot in the Lower 48 states at 32 
below zero, the National Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 18 deaths were blamed on snow, ice and cold during the holiday 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools not already closed for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday were shut in 
parts of Missouri, South Dakota, Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, 
Kentucky, West Virginia, Virginia, northern Georgia and Pennsylvania because of 
snow- and ice-covered roads. Many businesses and some shopping malls also 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
 State government offices were ordered closed in 15 South Carolina counties and 
western Maryland because of ice-covered highways. The West Virginia Legislature 
cut back its Monday session and the Pennsylvania House canceled sessions for 
the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio Gov. George V. Voinovich, West Virginia Gov. Gaston Caperton and Kentucky 
Gov. Brereton C. Jones declared emergencies to mobilize National Guard troops 
and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Louisville, Ky., Mayor Jerry Abramson also declared a state of emergency after 
16 inches of snow fell by late morning, the most in the city's history. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic was at a standstill throughout most of the Louisville area and even 
some snowplows were stuck. National Guard troops used four-wheel-drive vehicles 
to rescue stranded motorists. 
</P>
<P>
 About 16,000 Louisville Gas & Electric Co. customers were without power, 
utility officials said. Schools and armories were opened for people needing 
emergency shelter. An estimated 6,000 to 10,000 homes lost electricity in 
Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
 Flights were delayed or canceled at airports serving Louisville, Cincinnati, 
Columbus, and most airports in West Virginia.

TEARS AND LAUGHTER FOR CLOWN WHO DIED IN TRAIN DERAILMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Laughter, applause and clown costumes mixed with tears Monday as hundreds of 
mourners remembered a circus clown killed in a train derailment. 
</P>
<P>
 Ceslee Conkling, 28, posthumously received a standing ovation at the request 
of the pastor at the Eagle Mountain Baptist Church. 
</P>
<P>
 The funeral was a "celebration of her life," said Kenneth Jones, a family 
friend and a member of the Cowtown Clowns, to which Conkling also belonged. 
</P>
<P>
 There was laughter among the 450 mourners as they watched a videotape of 
Conkling's clown antics, Jones said, and a young girl sang "Jesus Loves the 
Little Children" as a tribute to the youngsters touched by her performances. 
</P>
<P>
 Conkling was on a Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus train that 
derailed Thursday at a crossing in Florida. She and elephant trainer Ted 
Svertesky were killed. Fourteen others were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Svertesky, 39, was remembered Sunday at a private service, said a spokeswoman 
for Baldwin Fairchild Funeral Home of Orlando, Fla.

TREMORS THROUGH THE ECONOMY; NEWS ANALYSIS; PROMPT RESPONSE CAN LIMIT SETBACK 
TO AREA 
</P>

<P>
 The 6.6-magnitude earthquake that struck Monday dealt a major blow to the 
economy of Los Angeles and Southern California, which was just showing signs of 
recovering from a deep slump and a succession of earlier setbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists said, however, that other, less tangible factors could prevent the 
quake from becoming an economic disaster. A key question will be how the 
region, its people and its leaders are perceived in the national and 
international media in the days ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the loss of life and widespread destruction, some economists were 
sticking to their forecasts that the region's economy will recover early next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The economic negatives from the quake were plain to see Monday for local 
economists and business people. A stall in recovering house prices and home 
sales, a setback for tourism and higher costs for shipping goods and moving 
people will hurt Los Angeles and Southern California over the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Offsetting some of that economic devastation, however, will be an inflow of 
federal and state funds to pay for reconstructing highways and buildings, 
particularly the Golden State and Santa Monica freeways, as well as private 
spending to repair damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, there were initial signs of resiliency and even optimism in the 
area's business community. Several business people noted the courteous behavior 
of drivers in a city without traffic lights, and the appearances of Mayor 
Richard Riordan -- in a Los Angeles Lakers sweat shirt -- as setting the proper 
tone for a city and an area working to cope with adversity. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ability of Riordan and the City Council to demonstrate commitment to 
substantive development, not just public relations, will be critical to 
businesses contemplating investment and to convention and visitors' groups," 
said Goetz Wolff, a visiting economist at UCLA's School of Urban Planning. 
</P>
<P>
 Money and jobs are riding on image. Most of the area's major hotel and tourist 
destinations apparently escaped serious damage, but many officials were 
apprehensive about the quake's long-term impact on the tourism industry, which 
employs 400,000 people in Los Angeles alone and generates about $20 billion a 
year from direct and indirect visitor spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Collins, senior vice president of the Los Angeles Convention & Visitors 
Bureau, worried that television viewers around the world might think that all 
of Los Angeles was destroyed, from the pictures of collapsed freeways and 
blazing buildings. "It's just one more reason for people not to come this way," 
said Cheryl L. Phelps, regional manager for Hyatt Hotels in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 But other analysts were reassured by the example of San Francisco's tourist 
business, which has come back strong after being hurt by the 1989 Loma Prieta 
earthquake, nationwide recession and the 1991 Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, it has been Southern California's turn to suffer serial setbacks, 
from the lengthy recession to the 1992 Los Angeles riots to last fall's raging 
brush fires -- and now, the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 It all makes 1994 a critical year for the area, said Lynn Reaser, chief 
economist of First Interstate Bancorp. "If we were to have another serious 
earthquake this year, that would affect business investment plans and people's 
decisions to live here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 As it is, the quake's main effect will be to push back the budding economic 
recovery, Reaser said. The quake came just a few weeks after the San Fernando 
Valley Assn. of Realtors reported strong sales gains, and brokers across 
Southern California declared that the housing market was finally on an upswing. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, that recovery will be delayed further, though probably not for very long. 
If the 1971 Sylmar quake and 1989 Loma Prieta quake can serve as a guide, 
analysts said, home sales and prices in the hardest hit areas should return to 
normal within three to six months, as buyers regain confidence. "An earthquake 
like this doesn't permanently effect an area's housing market, because the 
damage can be repaired. It's not nearly as devastating as the closing of an 
aerospace plant," said John Karevoll, of the real estate research firm 
Dataquick Information Systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The economy will pay a price, in delays and higher shipping costs, for the 
devastation of major highways. With Interstate 5, California's most important 
north-south artery, out of action, trucks and cars will be rerouted to U.S. 101 
or through the desert to the Tehachapi Mountains, said economist Jack Kyser of 
Los Angeles' Economic Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses in the San Fernando Valley will bear a greater burden. And in 
greater Los Angeles, business contacts will be disrupted as some sections of 
major freeways will be closed for 12 to 18 months. Detours will be massive and 
public transit will become imperative -- maybe even attractive.  
</P>
<P>
 But there's also no doubt that urgent rebuilding of those important roads will 
generate hundreds of millions of dollars in new business. The cost of repairing 
parts of just two freeways -- the intersection of I-5 and the Antelope Valley 
Freeway in northern Los Angeles County, and a stretch of the Santa Monica 
Freeway at the eastern end of Culver City -- could run to $100 million, said 
Tony Grosso of Associated General Contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't be surprised if rebuilding all those shopping centers, apartments 
and freeways doesn't wind up costing half a billion dollars," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 One caution was how quickly work will begin. Due to local political bickering, 
repairs to a big stretch of Oakland's Nimitz Freeway have not begun more than 
four years after the Loma Prieta quake. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's just the point. If local authorities in Los Angeles apply 
themselves to the task, Caltrans, the state agency in charge of road-building, 
could begin work in a matter of days, or as soon as rubble is cleared and money 
flows from Washington and Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Timing is important. The effect of work beginning promptly would be to provide 
a psychological as well as an economic boost to the region.

QUAKE SPURS BOOMING RETAIL SALES OF VITAL ITEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For a segment of the Southern California business community, Monday's 
earthquake was a time to deal. It was commerce in the raw -- from the mundane 
to the exotic. 
</P>
<P>
 The stores that traffic in necessities, such as food, lumber and hardware, and 
were creative enough -- or lucky enough -- to open their doors, did a land 
office business across the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Lines formed before daybreak outside supermarkets, restaurants and hardware 
stores. As the scope of the destruction became increasingly clear, lines of 
cars backed up at gasoline stations as far away as Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 At Koontz Hardware in West Hollywood, the line of customers extended down 
Santa Monica Boulevard and a batteries-only counter was set up on the sidewalk. 
Inside, clerks with flashlights showed customers around. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Ralph's supermarket in hard-hit Northridge, a dozen people lined up to 
buy 2.5-gallon containers of Arrowhead water for $2. At another Ralph's in 
nearby Granada Hills, the same 2.5-gallon containers fetched $5. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they rounded up a bit to make it easier," said a tolerant man in a 
red hat. 
</P>
<P>
 At a 7-11 in Studio City, a dozen people stood in line by 6:30 a.m. Customers 
were not allowed to enter but gave the clerks orders at the door. "Fritos," 
hollered a blonde woman in a black sweat shirt. As the clerk searched for the 
Fritos, the woman called out: "And a six-pack of Miller Lite." 
</P>
<P>
 And at Bernini on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, a customer tried -- 
unsuccessfully -- to talk down the price of a $2,845 Gianni Versace vest that 
was slightly damaged when a mannequin was knocked through the exploding display 
window and into the street. Another customer ambled in to exchange a pair of 
$210 Versace jeans for a different size. "Versace is a very hot designer, but I 
find it interesting that people find time to do this on a day like this," said 
Jeanella Vandenberg, the store manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Tourists, meanwhile, were frustrated by stores being closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to spend money, but I can't!" said Rita Luber of Haverford, Pa., 
strolling along Rodeo Drive with her husband, Mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Scott, the 'R' in D&R Glass of Ontario, Calif., was crisscrossing Los 
Angeles' Westside with his measuring tape. Encountered in the empty, 
water-stained parking ramp at the closed-down Beverly Center, he said, "This 
place is really torn up." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott called four workers back from layoff early Monday. He is getting plywood 
from the Ontario area, assuming it would be hard to come by in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 And indeed it is. Tom Mullin, president of Terry Lumber Co., a chain of retail 
lumber yards, didn't have phones at his store on Santa Monica Boulevard Monday 
morning, so he was scrambling to satisfy walk-in customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just trying to take care of the people who need to board up," he said, 
as two distraught-looking men arrived at the lumberyard's entrance to buy 
plywood. "It's going to be wacko tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 California Glass & Window piled up two or three extra days of work on Monday 
morning, said owner Steve Conkle. The Stanton company's customers include banks 
and other financial institutions, he said, and crews were headed for the San 
Fernando Valley, Woodland Hills and Pasadena within an hour of reporting to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the company is boarding up buildings with plywood. Conkle said the 
crews could not find lumber supplies in Los Angeles and had to bring in wood 
from Orange County. They also had to rent generators in order to run their 
power tools. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Vons supermarkets temporarily ran out of bottled water, said spokeswoman 
Julie Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are seeing a high demand for water, water and more water," said Reynolds, 
who noted that the company was distributing additional supplies to those Vons 
locations Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Tucker, project manager with Arrowhead Mountain Spring Water Co. in 
Monterey Park, said employees were bottling additional water and bringing in 
extra supplies to stores throughout the county. At Calistoga Mineral Water Co. 
in Northern California, officials said the company was having problems just 
transporting water into Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the highways are blocked and we can't get through. We are trying to 
get a truckload of Calistoga to the Red Cross, but we can't," said Bob Pusey, a 
spokesman with Calistoga. 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquake Preparedness Products, a Santa Ana earthquake kit maker and retail 
store, also reported a brisk business Monday in its kits, priced from $9.95 to 
nearly $300. 
</P>
<P>
 At Homebase in Culver City, manager Frank Gomez said he was sold out of 
earthquake kits by mid-morning Monday, having sold about 200 kits. Also selling 
fast were generators, water heaters, flashlights and batteries, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many people who come in are scared. They still don't have their lights," 
Gomez said in a phone interview just after 3:30 p.m. as another aftershock hit 
his store. "We're really rocking now," he said.

TREMORS THROUGH THE ECONOMY; LOSSES COULD EXCEED LOMA PRIETA QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Insured losses from Monday's earthquake in the San Fernando Valley could 
exceed the $960 million paid out after the 1989 quake in the San Francisco Bay 
Area, according to preliminary estimates by insurance groups. 
</P>
<P>
 However, those early estimates were accompanied by repeated cautioning that it 
will be days--if not weeks or months--before the full costs of Monday's quake 
can be tallied.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, officials at two insurance industry groups said initial reviews of 
damage to freeways and other public facilities throughout the affected region 
indicate that homeowner and business losses--both insured and uninsured--could 
be more extensive than those suffered in the Loma Prieta quake more than four 
years ago. That earthquake was the fifth most costly disaster for insurance 
companies in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "The damage in Los Angeles to freeways and other parts of the public 
infrastructure appears more widespread than what occurred in the Bay Area," 
said James Snyder, president of Personal Insurance Federation of California, an 
industry association in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder's assessment was echoed by officials at the Insurance Information 
Institute in New York, who predicted that insured losses would hit the 
$1-billion mark. 
</P>
<P>
 But insured losses are expected to be only a small part of the earthquake's 
impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatively few homeowners and merchants carry earthquake insurance, and 
deductibles on the special policies generally range up to 10% of a policy's 
coverage. In the 1989 Loma Prieta quake, for example, the $960 million in 
insured losses represented only about 14% of the estimated $7 billion of total 
property damage caused by the disaster, according to the Insurance Information 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite more extensive damage locally, Snyder said homeowners in Southern 
California may be better off than those in the Bay Area because many more 
residents of this region have opted to buy special earthquake insurance. About 
40% of residential policyholders in Los Angeles and Orange counties have the 
additional coverage, he said, compared to an average of 25% statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance companies said they are prepared for significant, but still unknown, 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
 State Farm Insurance, the state's largest residential insurer with 1.4 million 
homeowner policies, said about 300,000 of its policyholders in Southern 
California have earthquake coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 A State Farm spokesman said it paid out a total of $141 million in insurance 
claims to 31,000 homeowners after the Loma Prieta quake. He said claims were 
filed by about 18% of policyholders. If that same percentage of policyholders 
were to file claims as a result of Monday's San Fernando quake, there would be 
54,000 claims. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a different story for businesses suffering quake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Insurance Research Council, just 15% to 25% of California 
business owners are covered by earthquake insurance. Industry officials 
estimated that big businesses and large property owners were more likely to 
have the insurance than small merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, industry experts said many small merchants forced to close their doors 
for quake repairs may be covered by business interruption insurance, if not for 
the actual quake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Still other homeowners and merchants may be covered by the fire and flooding 
portions of their policies if the quake sparked a fire or caused water damage 
to their properties. And, fortunately for car-dependent Southern Californians, 
earthquake damage to vehicles is covered under virtually all standard auto 
insurance policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Residents should review their insurance policies immediately and then contact 
their insurance company," advised Richard Donnigan of Allstate Insurance, the 
state's second-largest residential insurer. 
</P>
<P>
 Within hours of the quake Monday, most major insurance companies began 
dispatching claims adjusters to the region to handle an expected deluge of 
inquiries from homeowners and merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 While several companies said their newly arriving adjusters have experience 
handling earthquake claims, other companies said they would rely on special 
catastrophe adjusters already in the region since November for the Malibu and 
Laguna Beach fires. 
</P>
<P>
 Because many branch offices in the San Fernando Valley were badly damaged by 
the quake, several insurance companies hauled in trailers, outfitted as mobile 
offices, for the adjusters to use. Most major insurance companies also 
established toll-free information hot lines for area residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Even insured property owners may face staggering repair bills since 
deductibles typically are 10% of a policy's coverage. And the insurance doesn't 
come cheap.  
</P>
<P>
 In California, the cost of an average earthquake policy costs $2 for every 
$1,000 of coverage, meaning coverage on a $200,000 home would cost $400 
annually, according to the Insurance Information Institute. The agency said the 
average homeowner premium, without earthquake insurance, runs $554 in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Touring damaged areas Monday evening, State Insurance Commissioner John 
Garamendi said some residents are certain to question the Legislature's 
decision to repeal the statewide earthquake insurance law, a position he 
completely supported. 
</P>
<P>
 The law had established a program that covered losses equal to the amount of 
homeowners' deductibles. After it took effect in 1992, legislators quickly 
repealed it, fearing the fund would not build up fast enough to ensure adequate 
coverage if a quake would hit within the first year. The state then refunded a 
large percentage of premiums paid by homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi said repeal remained the proper course because the state fund would 
not have paid each homeowner enough to make any substantial repair. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had said we ought not to fool people" with promises that could not be 
fulfilled, he said.

CHINA SIGNS TEXTILE PACT; NARROWLY AVERTS U.S. PENALTIES; TRADE: LAST-MINUTE 
AGREEMENT ALLOWS AMERICAN INSPECTORS INTO PLANTS TO INVESTIGATE MISLABELING AND 
OTHER EXPORT VIOLATIONS. 
</P>

<P>
 China averted a looming, multibillion-dollar battle over illegal textile 
imports on Monday, agreeing to allow U.S. inspectors into textile plants to 
investigate mislabeling and other export violations as part of a last-minute 
agreement signed by senior Chinese and American trade officials in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 The negotiators concluded the compromise on the very day that stiff, 
U.S.-imposed penalties were to take effect against Chinese textile 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 American customs officials claim that last year China illegally exported more 
than $2 billion worth of textile products to the United States, mostly by 
mislabeling goods or "trans-shipping" them through other countries to hide 
their Chinese origin. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the many examples cited by U.S. investigators, one Chinese company 
labeled its products "Made in the United Arab Emirates" to avoid having its 
clothing items counted in the U.S. import quota. 
</P>
<P>
 In retaliation for such violations, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor 
threatened on Jan. 6 to slash China's textile quotas by 25% to 35%. The move 
was applauded by the American textile industry and would have cost the Chinese 
more than $1 billion in lost trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Textiles are China's most important export; the United States is, by far, 
China's biggest market. China accounts for 20% to 25% of all clothing purchased 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Washington news briefing, Kantor called the pact "a very important new 
bilateral agreement" that was reached "after three days of intensive 
negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
 A senior American trade official in Beijing said Monday's agreement -- a 
three-year renewal of a U.S.-China textile pact that expired on Dec. 31 -- will 
substantially reduce the growth rate of Chinese textile exports to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 "China will continue to have good access to the market," the official said. 
But following a pattern established in other countries, notably South Korea, 
China will get two warnings on illegal imports before a punitive reduction in 
China's textile quotas will be enforced. The penalty under the agreement would 
by a reduction equal to three times the amount of goods illegally imported to 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the U.S. official said, American customs officials discovered more 
than $581 million worth of illegal imports, about a quarter of the amount 
officials contend illegally entered the country. 
</P>
<P>
 China exported $7.2 billion worth of textiles to the United States in 1993, 
including an increasing array of silk goods not covered in the expired textile 
pact between the two countries. For the first time ever, the new agreement will 
also cover silk imports. American officials characterized this as a 
breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
 Kantor said that "this silk apparel has been used because it's become so cheap 
a substitute for cotton and other apparel. . . . The growth in that from $900 
million to $2.6 billion in just 24 months has had a serious effect upon the 
U.S. textile and apparel industry." 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese were able to claim a victory in the negotiations because they 
avoided cuts in their textile quotas. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest concession gained by the Americans was a pledge by the Chinese to 
allow China-based U.S. customs officials to examine textile manufacturing 
plants in surprise inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, said the senior U.S. trade official, American customs 
officers will be required to notify the Chinese government that they intended 
to inspect textile plants and indicate the city or region where the scrutiny 
would occur; they would not be required to divulge the name of a targeted 
company or its specific location.

 Medical Care America to Sell Unit: The Dallas-based company said it has agreed 
to sell Critical Care America, the home infusion services unit it acquired only 
1 1/2 years ago, to Northbrook, Ill.-based Caremark International Inc. for 
about $175 million in cash. The company plans to use proceeds from the sale, 
along with up to $50 million of its own cash, to buy back up to 7 million of 
its 36.6 million outstanding shares in a tender offer priced at $26 to $29 per 
share, Senior Vice President Jonathan Bond said. Medical Care is the nation's 
largest outpatient surgical center company.

INVESTORS PLAY IT LIKE A TWO-SIDED COIN; BUILDING STOCKS RISE WHILE MUNI BOND 
RATINGS FALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Wall Street wasted no time attempting to cash in on Monday's earthquake, 
driving stocks of construction-related companies sharply higher while slamming 
insurers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the municipal bond market, bond-rating agencies cast a wary eye on 
California issues, on concerns that this latest blow to the state's economy 
could cause new financial strife for government. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Southland investors who were trying to transact business Monday 
often found themselves stymied, as many local trading desks failed to open and 
as phone lines in general stayed jammed for much of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 For investors intent on buying or selling securities with local brokers 
Monday, the effort was often an exercise in futility, as local phone calls were 
impossible for much of the day -- if there was anyone on the other end to 
answer anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Bache, principal at investment firm Hamilton & Bache in Glendale, said 
he resorted to trading through out-of-state brokers, where "you might get 
through once for every three efforts" on the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 The largely electronic Pacific Stock Exchange in downtown Los Angeles opened 
on time -- with an emergency power generator -- and traded normally all day, 
said Mike Barth, director of trading floor operations. He estimated that 75% of 
the staff showed up for work. 
</P>
<P>
 But discount broker Charles Schwab said seven of its 13 Los Angeles-area 
offices were closed Monday. Schwab said local phone calls to closed offices 
were routed to out-of-state trading sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than local glass and plywood sellers, the only people to profit 
substantially from the quake on Monday were owners of such construction-related 
stocks as Southland highway builder Kasler Holding, which soared 23% on the New 
York Stock Exchange, and rival Granite Construction, which surged 11% in Nasdaq 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors were betting that the road builders will reap a bonanza if the state 
is forced to pay top dollar to rush highway reconstruction, said Richard Rossi, 
analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rossi added that, if the aftermath of other major quakes is a guide, "The 
market has overdone what this is likely to be worth in business to these 
companies. Large project work ends up being done a longtime later" than 
initially thought, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kasler stock leaped $1.875 per share to $10, while Granite Construction shot 
up $2.50 to $24.75. 
</P>
<P>
 Other big gainers included gravel and asphalt producer CalMat Co., up $2.375 
to $24.125; concrete and steel pipe maker Ameron, up $2 to $41.875, and another 
construction contractor, Guy Atkinson, which jumped $1.125 to $9.25 on Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
 On the flip side, many property and casualty insurance stocks were losers: 
Allstate dropped $1 to $28.625, CNA Financial slid $1.75 to $76.25 and Chubb 
slipped 37.5 cents to $77.375. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Frank, insurance analyst at Smith Barney Shearson in New York, said the 
quake damage was likely to be "big enough to screw up some of the companies' 
earnings, but not big enough to turn the (pricing) cycle in the industry." 
</P>
<P>
 The property/casualty insurance business has suffered for years from cutthroat 
pricing, and with every major natural disaster, Wall Street has held is breath 
hoping that the ultimate outcome would be higher insurance premiums. But Frank 
doubted that the Southland quake damage would be big enough to push rates up 
much. 
</P>
<P>
 In the short run, some investors also worry about prospects for retailers who 
are closely tied to the Southland economy. But retailers also should benefit 
longer term as people replace lost goods and rebuild, analysts noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter Hawley Hale, parent of Broadway stores, fell 50 cents to $10.375 on the 
NYSE. Other losers included Nordstrom, down 50 cents to $34.75, and May 
Department Stores, down $1 to $39.625. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, Walt Disney shares dropped $1 to $46.625, partly on fears of a 
possible blow to tourism in the Southland, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the municipal bond market, trading desks were mostly not staffed on Monday 
because of the national holiday honoring Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. As they 
return today, muni bond analysts said they will be focusing on the health of 
so-called project-specific California bonds issued to finance individual 
municipal buildings or other projects that might have been damaged by the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 A broader worry is the potential long-term cost to state and local government 
from the quake -- at a time when state and local budgets are already stretched 
to the limit. After the 1989 Loma Prieta quake in Northern California, the 
state sales tax was raised, but that damage-financing option may be a tough 
sell in recession-wracked California today. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Zimmermann, analyst at Standard & Poor's Corp. in San Francisco, said 
it's too early to speculate on possible bond down-gradings. But he noted that 
"we were a long way from an established (state) budget for next year even 
before this happened."

BLUE-CHIPS HIT 2ND RECORD HIGH; OIL PRICES SHARPLY UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Market Overview  
</P>
<P>
 * Blue-chip stocks managed to eke out a second straight record high Monday, 
despite the earthquake in California and the bout of profit taking that pushed 
many other major market indicators lower. 
</P>
<P>
 * Crunching cold in the East and earthquake-related supply fears drove oil 
prices sharply higher. Gold also rose sharply. Stocks  
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones average, which was led by stocks of cyclical companies that 
benefit most in an expanding economy, rose 3.09 to 3,870.29, eclipsing its 
previous mark of 3,867.20 set on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 However, declining issues narrowly outnumbered advances on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market was quiet. There was just not a lot happening," said James 
Melcher, founder and president of Balestra Capital. The Martin Luther King Jr. 
holiday kept many market players away, analysts said. Also holding down stock 
market activity was an East Coast storm and a closed U.S. bond market. Big 
Board volume fell to 233.98 million shares, down from Friday's 304.91 million 
and the lowest one-day tally so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors mostly sold stocks that ran up in value during last week's 
record-setting sessions, said Al Goldman, director of technical market 
analysis, with A.G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights:  
</P>
<P>
 * Parametric Technology was the most-active Nasdaq issue, falling 5 to 33 1/4 
after the software company said fiscal fourth-quarter earnings were 25 cents a 
share vs 14 cents in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Universal Electronics also plunged on earnings news, dropping 10 to 9 3/4. The 
company said earnings for the fourth quarter were 24 cents a share versus 69 
cents in the same quarter of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 And Qualcomm fell 3 1/8 to 51. The telecommunications company announced fiscal 
first-quarter earnings of 18 cents a share versus a loss of 8 cents in the same 
period of last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the plus side, industrial issues that continued to rise included 
Caterpillar, up 2 to 92 1/2; Alcoa, up 1 1/4 to 74 1/4; and Deere, up 3 1/8 to 
79 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 But IBM was down 1 1/8 to 57 1/2. Kemper Securities lowered a rating on the 
stock, citing price. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the health-care sector, Medical Care America lost 7/8 at 23 1/8 on the 
NYSE after saying it would sell its struggling home-infusion unit to Caremark 
International for $175 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * First Interstate Bancorp fell 1 1/8 to 68 3/4 after a Paine Webber analyst 
downgraded the stock, citing price. The stock on Friday reached a 53-week high 
of 70. 
</P>
<P>
 In overseas markets, London's FTSE-100 index added 7.2 points to 3,407.8. In 
Frankfurt, the DAX index eased 4.44 points to 2,137.38. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 
index lost 248.33 points to 18,725.37. Mexico City's Bolsa was up 19.65 points 
at 2,506.33, a gain of 0.79%. Other Markets  
</P>
<P>
 A weather forecast calling for below-normal temperatures in the Northeast, the 
main heating-oil consuming region, pushed home heating oil prices up 1.41 cents 
to 53.67 cents a gallon on the New York Merc. The rising price of heating oil 
helped boost crude oil prices hit a five-year low of $13.75 in mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
 February delivery of light sweet crude rose 32 cents per barrel to $15.10 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles earthquake prompted additional buying, analysts said. Power 
outages caused by the quake were believed to have shut down some oil refining 
operations south of Los Angeles, although no major damage to refineries was 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, gold for current delivery rose to $391.60 an ounce, up $2.10 on the 
New York Comex. Silver settled at $5.309 an ounce, 9.9 cents from $5.210 on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the dollar settled mixed in light, uneventful trading. In New York, 
the dollar closed at 111.10 Japanese yen, up from 111.05 yen on Friday. It also 
ended at 1.755 German marks, up from 1.751.

 Upjohn Sues BBC Over Halcion Report: The High Court in London began hearing 
accusations of libel brought against the British Broadcasting Corp. by the U.S. 
maker of the popular sleeping pill.At issue is the 1991 program "The Halcion 
Nightmare," which accused Upjohn of keeping quiet about negative side effects, 
such as episodes of violent behavior. Upjohn maintains that the drug is safe to 
use as prescribed and is seeking unspecified damages for defamation. Halcion 
has not been approved for use in Britain. Several lawsuits filed against Upjohn 
in the United States contain allegations similar to those aimed at the BBC.

 Owens-Corning to Appeal Personal Injury Award: Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. 
said it will appeal a $10.7-million award against the company in an asbestos 
personal-injury lawsuit.A New York jury said Toledo, Ohio-based Owens-Corning 
was liable in the death of John Scanlon, a former ship rigger. Scanlon fitted 
ships with pipes from 1952 to 1959 at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. He died in 1993, 
two years after he was diagnosed with mesothelioma, a cancer of the lining of 
the lung. Owens-Corning once manufactured asbestos pipe insulation. The jury 
awarded $12.6 million to Scanlon. Owens-Corning was responsible for $10.7 
million, with other parties responsible for the additional $1.9 million.

STORES DRIVING SHOPPERS TO BUY AT HOME; RETAIL: A SURVEY SUGGESTS POOR SERVICE 
IS SPURRING ELECTRONIC ALTERNATIVES. SPIEGEL, TIME WARNER ANNOUNCE JOINT 
CHANNEL VENTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 High levels of frustration over service and concerns about safety at stores 
are laying the groundwork for increased consumer interest in electronic home 
shopping, according to a survey issued Monday by the National Retail 
Federation. 
</P>
<P>
 The report by the Washington-based trade group comes at a time when several 
major retailers are on the verge of launching home shopping ventures, and 
others -- previously ambivalent about the idea -- are beginning to consider 
electronic projects. It was released at the federation's annual conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Monday, Spiegel Inc. and Time Warner Entertainment formally announced 
a joint home shopping channel, called Catalog 1, aimed at upscale shoppers. The 
channel will begin broadcasting in March in four markets that Spiegel Chairman 
John Shea said will be named later. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 502 respondents in the national survey -- the first to explore this 
topic -- 62% said they decided to buy a product in a store in the past six 
months but left without buying anything because sales clerks were not available 
when needed. Also, only 25% said they believe shopping malls provide a safe and 
secure shopping environment. 
</P>
<P>
 These complaints were particularly prevalent among television and computer 
shoppers and may have led to alternative shopping methods, said Watts Wacker, 
spokesman for Yankelovich Partners, which conducted the survey sponsored by 
Mastercard International. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stores are driving away customers," Wacker said. "Currently, about 10% of 
households engage in electronic shopping. We predict that by 1996, 40% of 
households will engage in electronic shopping. . . . Americans are losing their 
technophobia. More and more of them view technology as a tool to make life 
easier." 
</P>
<P>
 Home shopping channels such as QVC and Home Shopping Network, infomercial 
producers and computer shopping operators racked up more than $3 billion in 
sales in 1993, and the category is experiencing a 20% annual sales increase. 
However, electronic home shopping accounts for less than 1% of total retail 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Projections about the future of electronic shopping vary widely. Some say home 
shopping will grow to $30 billion within the next 10 years, while others say 
there will be annual sales of $250 billion within that period. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those projections are inflated, some retail industry analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Television retailing has a long way to go before it becomes a formidable 
challenger to store-based retailers," said Kurt Barnard, a New York-based 
retail economist. "Billions of dollars are being spent on electronic projects, 
and there will be some major disappointments." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter Hawley Hale President David Dworkin, in an interview at the convention, 
said the company -- which owns the Broadway stores -- is exploring the 
possibility of an interactive project. 
</P>
<P>
 Dworkin had expressed little interest in electronic shopping in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nordstrom has plans to develop an interactive channel, and R. H. Macy -- 
operator of Bullock's department stores -- has a joint venture project with "60 
Minutes" producer Don Hewitt to launch a shopping channel. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, May Department Stores -- operator of the Robinsons-May chain -- 
is considering home shopping ventures.  
</P>
<P>
 Home Shopping Network has announced it will launch a second channel this 
summer, called Television Shopping Mall, targeting upscale shoppers. QVC 
Network also is starting the upscale channel Q2 in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Sears merchandising chief Arthur Martinez told the convention Monday that 
Sears would soon launch infomercial programs in a joint venture with TV game 
show developer King World. Sears will also explore possible small-scale 
electronic projects, he said, but the giant retailer remains somewhat guarded. 
</P>
<P>
 "There may be small bets by Sears in electronic shopping, but we won't bet the 
farm," Martinez said.

MARKETING: TRENDY PRINT ADVERTISERS ARE GOING TO SCHOOL WITH DORM-DECORATING 
COLLEGIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jennifer Ozaki has something in common with most college students: a tiny 
budget for decorating her digs. That's why her off-campus apartment at USC is 
mostly decked with inexpensive black-and-white photos. 
</P>
<P>
 But earlier this month, when Ozaki and her roommate decided to spiff up the 
place, they didn't just buy another cheap photograph -- or even an old movie 
poster. 
</P>
<P>
 They bought an ad. 
</P>
<P>
 It is actually a poster of a print ad for high-fashion clothing designer Donna 
Karan. The two young women ordered it from a catalogue that was mailed to their 
home. "It doesn't look like an advertisement," explained Ozaki of the ad that 
shows a woman luxuriating in her bathtub. "I think of it more as a fine 
photograph." 
</P>
<P>
 The often-eclectic art of decorating college student dorm rooms is taking a 
decidedly commercial twist. And marketers are behind it. Beside Donna Karan, 
marketers including Levi's, Timberland and Coca-Cola are coaxing college 
students into buying copies of their print ads in poster form. Many posters are 
being sold in a new mail-order catalogue, Beyond the Wall. Its motto: "If you 
like the ad, you'll love the poster." And pay about $10 for it, to boot. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the Wall began distributing the catalogue for its posters this month on 
80 college campuses, including such Southern California campuses such as USC, 
Pepperdine and UC Riverside. The catalogues -- which have 23 posters for sale 
from 18 different advertisers -- are usually inserted into college newspapers 
and sometimes mailed directly to students. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're repositioning advertising as something artistic," said Dennis Roche, 
co-founder of Beyond the Wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Marketers are still discovering the massive size and buying power of the 
nation's college students -- who number 7.5 million and possess an estimated 
$30 billion in annual buying power. Advertisers are keenly aware that one of 
the best times to attract future customers is when they are just leaving their 
homes and making their own buying decisions. That's why credit card companies 
like Visa and American Express market so heavily on college campuses and why 
many magazines are willing to sell subscriptions at a loss simply to get 
college students to start buying them. 
</P>
<P>
 "College students are still forming product preferences," explained Dave 
Stewart, marketing professor at USC. "Advertisers know that once preferences 
are formed, it's very hard to get them to switch." 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, college students are notoriously hard to reach because they 
typically have limited spare time to read magazines and watch television. But 
with the poster ads, marketers have found a way to not only advertise to them 
-- but to get the students to actually pay for the ads. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as the kids are concerned, these are modern works of art," said Irma 
Zandl, president of the New York youth-marketing firm, Xtreme. "Keep in mind, 
advertisers like Absolut and Calvin Klein use the very best photographers in 
the country." 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, the college students who order the ad posters -- and hang them in 
their rooms -- are making a strong statement about themselves, said Julie 
Edell, professor of marketing at Duke University. "It says, 'Hey, this ad is 
neat enough that I want to be associated with it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The concept of selling ad posters to college students was devised when one of 
the co-founders of Westport, Conn.-based Beyond the Wall was still a college 
student. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, when Brian Gordon was a political science major at the 
University of Pennsylvania, he was always searching for things to hang on his 
fraternity's walls. After one university basketball game, he ran off with a 
banner in the school gym that advertised ESPN network. "I remember thinking, 'I 
wish I could buy one of these things.' But since there was no place to buy it, 
I just took it." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, he's selling ad posters -- via his company's catalogue -- for profit. 
"Most advertisers have never even thought of their ads as posters," Gordon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps they should. Gordon, who met partner Dennis Roche while working in the 
marketing department at Procter & Gamble, recently surveyed 450 college 
students about their attitudes toward advertising. More than 70% of those 
responding said they often ripped ads out of magazines and hung them on their 
walls. 
</P>
<P>
 A surprising number of top marketers have bought in to the first Beyond the 
Wall catalogue. Pepsi, for example, is selling three different posters in the 
book -- including one featuring its top "spokesjock," basketball star Shaquille 
O'Neal. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at the psychology of college students, the only way to reach them 
is on their own terms," said Amy Sherwood, a Pepsi spokeswoman. "Students view 
popular advertising as a creative expression." 
</P>
<P>
 But there is a limit to this corporate commercialism. College students may be 
willing to purchase ad posters -- but they generally want the ad messages to be 
very subtle. What's more, just because students buy the ads, doesn't mean 
they'll buy the product. "I like the Donna Karan poster, but I'll never buy her 
clothes," said Hillary Jenks, who is Ozaki's roommate at USC. "I can't come 
close to affording them." Briefly . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Coast Guard has contacted a number of West Coast agencies about 
handling its $3.5-million national ad account. . . . Veteran Los Angeles adman 
Paul Keye has opened Paul Keye & Partners with start-up client Century Council, 
a group run by alcoholic beverage manufacturers to promote responsible 
drinking. . . . Los Angeles agency Stein Robaire Helm has parted with client 
Clarion Car Audio of Gardena. . . . Creative Artists Agency has been asked to 
produce more Coca-Cola commercials. . . . The Western States Advertising 
Agencies Assn. has named Steve Hayden, chairman of BBDO/Los Angeles, as "1993 
Leader of the Year.". . . The National Assn. of Hispanic Publications will hold 
its national conference Jan. 27-30 at the Hanalei Hotel in San Diego. . . . 
Levi Strauss Co.'s "Levi's for Women" campaign has been named the top ad 
campaign of 1993 by the trade publication Frohlinger's Marketing Report. 
College Marketing Maze 
</P>
<P>
 Marketers are eager to reach college students, but they have historically had 
a tough time figuring out how. While college students are desirable targets, 
advertisers find it's hard to get their attention: 
</P>
<P>
 Why College Students Are Desirable Targets . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * More than 7.5 million 4-year-college undergraduates. 
</P>
<P>
 * More than $30 billion in buying power. 
</P>
<P>
 * More than $11 billion in discretionary income. 
</P>
<P>
 * Most college students are making purchasing decisions for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 * Most college students are just starting to establish brand loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
 . . . But Tough to Reach 
</P>
<P>
 * They watch less TV than non-college students. 
</P>
<P>
 * They read fewer magazines than non-college students. 
</P>
<P>
 * They listen to less radio than non-college students. 
</P>
<P>
 * There are fewer ad vehicles available to reach them.

BLOCKBUSTER BUYS STAKE IN VIRGIN INTERACTIVE ENTERTAINMENT; TRANSACTION: 
IRVINE-BASED VIDEO GAME PUBLISHER WILL USE EXPECTED $30 MILLION FROM THE DEAL 
PLUS INFUSION BY HASBRO TO DEVELOP NEW IDEAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Under a deal announced Monday, Orange County's largest video game publisher 
could become a major national player in the development of the next generation 
of interactive video games. 
</P>
<P>
 Blockbuster Entertainment Corp., the nation's largest chain of video stores, 
said it has bought a 19.9% stake in Virgin Interactive Entertainment in Irvine, 
a transaction valued at $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Video game publishers are hot properties now because they are expected to 
produce the content, or "killer applications," that will create demand for 
much-heralded services such as 500-channel interactive TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, toy-maker giant Hasbro Inc. bought a 16.2% stake in Virgin 
Interactive (formerly known as Virgin Games) for $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Virgin Interactive will use the money from both deals to develop new games, 
which are becoming complicated and costly as programmers incorporate video, 
animation, compact disc sound and stories in so-called multimedia games. 
</P>
<P>
 Virgin Interactive has a foothold in the emerging multimedia personal computer 
market, and the market for Nintendo and Sega video games. The price paid by 
Blockbuster suggests that Virgin Interactive is worth $151 million. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Blockbuster, the company "wants to expand into as many areas of 
entertainment as possible," said Wally Knief, spokesman for Blockbuster at its 
Fort Lauderdale, Fla., headquarters. "We want to have some content to put on 
the information superhighway." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say that as technology advances, Blockbuster could find its video 
rental business radically changed if, as promised, cable TV operators offer 
video on demand -- an application in which someone at home can use a remote 
control to choose a movie or play a video game from a TV menu. 
</P>
<P>
 Blockbuster also has stakes in two film companies that together own more than 
20,000 hours of movies, some of which could be used in games. 
</P>
<P>
 Virgin Interactive's 90 titles include "The 7th Guest," a haunted mansion 
mystery that is the hottest-selling game in the computer compact disc market, 
and "Monopoly Deluxe," "RoboCop vs. Terminator" and "Cool Spot." Many of the 
titles are offered for rental in Blockbuster's 3,593 video outlets nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the company's stock is owned by Virgin Group in London, which operates 
an airline and the Virgin Megastore retail chain of music stores. Blockbuster, 
in turn, is a part owner of Virgin's 20-store music and video super-store 
chain. 
</P>
<P>
 A Blockbuster executive prematurely announced the Virgin 
Interactive-Blockbuster deal at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last 
week. But Virgin Interactive President Martin Alper said at the time that the 
agreement was not yet final and that Blockbuster's board was preoccupied with 
its pending offer to merge with Viacom Inc., the producer of MTV and 
Nickelodeon. 
</P>
<P>
 An industry source said Monday that Virgin Interactive, which employs more 
than 250 people in Orange County, is expected to sell some of its remaining 
shares to the public in the near future. A majority of the company's stock is 
held by Richard Branson, owner of Virgin Atlantic Airways and founder of Virgin 
Interactive, and his family trust. Those shares would be sold if there were a 
public offering, the source said.

ROCKWELL TO INVEST $150 MILLION IN MODEM PLANT; MANUFACTURING: IT PLANS TO 
RE-CONFIGURE THE NEWPORT BEACH FACTORY TO MEET DEMAND FOR CHIPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN TAKAHASHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rockwell International Corp. said Monday it will invest $150 million in its 
semiconductor factory here to accommodate demand for its computer modem chips. 
</P>
<P>
 The investment, which the company announced in its quarterly earnings report, 
is aimed at re-configuring the aging Newport Beach modem plant with new 
manufacturing muscle over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant has 1,300 employees. The company said it expects to add jobs, but 
officials would not say Monday how many people the division expects to hire. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant makes chips for standard and high-speed modems, which translate 
digital pulses from a computer to analog signals that can be sent over phone 
lines. Modems enable people to communicate long distance by computer; growth of 
modem sales is a key driver for the explosion of on-line communications 
networks such as Prodigy Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell's Newport Beach plant is part of its Telecommunications Sector, which 
reported Monday that it had record operating earnings for the latest fiscal 
quarter because of sales of high-speed modem chips. 
</P>
<P>
 The telecommunications sector helped boost overall earnings. The aerospace and 
technology giant reported that its profit rose 17% to $149.5 million, or 68 
cents per share, for the period ended Dec. 31. That compared to earnings of 
$127.8 million, or 58 cents a share, for the same period a year earlier. Sales 
for the company's first quarter were $2.6 billion, up 4.5% from nearly $2.5 
billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 In Monday's trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Rockwell's stock gained 
$1.50 a share to close at a record $39.125. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell, based in Seal Beach, had announced plans last year to buy a chip 
factory in Irvine owned by Western Digital Corp. But the two companies scrubbed 
that deal in October after they failed to reach a final agreement. Western 
Digital, which needed cash to pay off its bank debt, ultimately sold the 
factory to Motorola Inc. for $111 million plus the costs of assuming equipment 
leases. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell said that the fabrication facility will make eight-inch disks known 
as semiconductor wafers. The wafers are cut into individual chips, packaged in 
plastic and installed in electronic circuit cards that can be installed on 
personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides modem chips, the Newport Beach plant also makes chips for fax machines 
and cellular telephones. Rockwell's Earnings Take Off Rockwell International 
Corp. posted a profit of $149.5 million, or 68 cents a share, on sales of $2.6

BRIEFCASE: SMALL BUSINESS; DRUG ABUSE IS A COSTLY HABIT

 Employee drug abuse costs companies billions of dollars a year in decreased 
productivity, workplace accidents and absenteeism, according to the U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
 That issue -- the effect of drug abuse on a company's profit margin -- will be 
addressed Feb. 2 at a seminar sponsored by Drug Use is Life Abuse, a nonprofit 
organization based in Santa Ana.More than 400 business owners and executives 
are expected to attend the forum, set for 7:30 to 9:30 a.m. at the Red Lion Inn 
in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Speakers will include Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates, who founded the 
organization six years ago; Joseph A. Pursch, director of the Addiction 
Institute in Costa Mesa, and Dave Quisling, founder of Drug Prevention 
Strategies in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main focus of the event will be getting a return on the investment you 
have in your employees," said Ted Grumkoski, who manages workplace programs for 
Drug Use is Life Abuse. "We will discuss everything from pre-employment drug 
testing to helping an employee who abuses drugs get help." 
</P>
<P>
 Cost of the program is $25, which includes breakfast. For more information, 
call (714) 567-3900.

QUAKE WILL HELP BUILDERS IN SOUTHLAND; ECONOMY: FREEWAY REPAIRS, OTHER 
REBUILDING PROJECTS SHOULD BOOST RECESSION-BATTERED CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FLAGG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Monday's 6.6-magnitude earthquake should mean a significant amount of new 
business for the industry, construction company executives say. 
</P>
<P>
 While earthquake damage won't turn around the state's battered construction 
industry by itself, it will at least help some firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeway repairs alone will total tens of millions of dollars, said Tony Grosso 
of Associated General Contractors' Los Angeles regional office. AGC is a trade 
association for big builders. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of repairing the intersection of the Golden State and Antelope Valley 
freeways in northern Los Angeles County and a stretch of the Santa Monica 
Freeway that runs through the Fairfax District could run to $100 million, 
Grosso estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate that this is what it takes to get work," Grosso said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Still, I wouldn't be surprised if rebuilding all those shopping centers, 
apartments and freeways doesn't wind up costing half a billion dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 Investors certainly think so. At Kasler Corp., a San Bernardino County road 
builder, buyers bid up the company's stock by $1.875 in heavy trading on the 
New York Stock Exchange Monday. The stock hit $10 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 "This usually happens right after an earthquake," said Richard Guiss, a 
company spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Kasler isn't alone: Granite Construction Inc., another road builder with 
offices around the state, closed at $24.75, up $2.50 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 The investors may be right -- if a little premature. "The potential for a lot 
of work is certainly there," said Guiss. "But as for how soon it happens, 
that's up to Caltrans." 
</P>
<P>
 Take, for instance, the quake that rocked the San Francisco Bay Area in 1989: 
The California Department of Transportation, the state agency in charge of 
road-building, won't be ready to put a big stretch of the Nimitz Freeway in 
Oakland out for bid until later this year -- nearly five years after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 But since the freeways damaged in Monday's earthquake don't initially seem to 
have suffered as much damage, Caltrans shouldn't have to redesign and rebuild 
them from the ground up as it did with the Nimitz. 
</P>
<P>
 That means the work could begin in a matter of days, said experts -- as soon 
as the rubble is cleared from the roadways. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Southern California's construction firms could use a boost. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry has been in a slump since at least 1990, the victim of the 
recession and overbuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 With only governments building much these days, a lot of firms have piled into 
that market, vying to build roads, hospitals, libraries and other public works. 
</P>
<P>
 So many companies are bidding on freeway jobs, for instance, that Kasler Corp. 
said it went more than a year without getting a significant contract. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why David P. Prizio, chief executive of Prizio & Prizio in Fountain 
Valley, usually sticks to building factories for food makers -- a business 
that's still growing -- and avoids public works. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been public works jobs where there were 40 bidders," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets to be a contest to see who can make the biggest mistake in the 
bidding."

L.A. WORKERS FIND POST-QUAKE HAVEN IN O.C.; COMMERCE: FLEEING MECHANICAL AND

 Electrical and phone problems prompted some Los Angeles office workers set up 
shop in Orange County on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 One was Rob Hoertz, a manager in the Los Angeles office of KPMG Peat Marwick. 
He ended up working at the firm's Costa Mesa office Monday because of 
earthquake damage to the Downtown building. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoertz checked in at the accounting firm's Los Angeles high-rise first and 
discovered that the elevator was not working. So he climbed 29 flights of 
stairs to reach his desk, only to find that electronic office equipment, too, 
had been knocked out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did go to the L.A. office to work . . . but then I came here," he said from 
Costa Mesa. "There was no power in the building" in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 At another big accounting firm, Coopers & Lybrand, some Southern California 
employees typically split their time between Newport Beach and Los Angeles. 
Those people opted to work a the former on Monday, spokeswoman Terry Goldfarb 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe our Los Angeles office was closed," said Goldfarb, who is based in 
Newport Beach. "We couldn't get through." 
</P>
<P>
 Any Coopers & Lybrand employees who did show up to work Downtown had a 
whopping 50 floors to climb, Goldfarb said. 
</P>
<P>
 A bright spot for those who drove to Orange County for the day was a lack of 
congestion on the freeways, partly because of the holiday celebrating the 
birthday of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the lightest day of traffic I've experienced in years," Hoertz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some companies, especially law firms and insurance offices, had already 
planned to close for the holiday. Other regional firms simply chose not to open 
offices that were near the center of the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 World Title Co., an insurer, closed its Burbank office for the day, and Ernst 
& Young closed its Downtown Los Angeles office. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes Aircraft Co. workers in the areas of El Segundo and Los Angeles 
International Airport were sent home as a precautionary measure, spokesman Dan 
Reeder said. A Hughes office in Canoga Park was closed, too, due to broken 
water pipes. 
</P>
<P>
 Coincidentally, the company also closed some of its East Coast offices, Reeder 
said, because of snowstorms in the Washington area.

PLATINUM SOFTWARE'S STOCK PLUNGES 24% AFTER NEWS OF SHORTFALL IN EARNINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Wall Street beat up on Platinum Software Corp. on Monday, knocking the 
company's stock price down 24% after the software developer said its projected 
quarterly earnings turned into a loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine company's news, which also included cancellation of a contract and 
difficulties in closing other deals, led to heavy trading on the Nasdaq market 
that dropped the stock price to $12.50 a share, down $3.875 from Friday's 
close. 
</P>
<P>
 Platinum, which makes financial and management information software, 
acknowledged that both its quarterly earnings and revenue fell short of 
expectations, even though revenue more than doubled. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said one-time acquisition costs of $8.2 million caused it to post 
a loss of $7.1 million, or 57 cents a share, for its second fiscal quarter, 
which ended Dec. 31. The company had earned $674,000, or 7 cents a share, for 
the same period a year earlier. Three-month revenue more than doubled to $17.2 
million from $7.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The costs of acquiring Lotzof & Associates, a privately held systems 
integration and software development firm in Chicago, also contributed to 
Platinum's loss of $5.6 million, or 45 cents a share, for its fiscal first 
half. For the same period a year earlier, the company had a profit of $937,000, 
or 10 cents a share. Six-month revenue was $32.8 million, up from $13.5 
million.

 ALWAYS READY: When San Francisco suffered an earthquake in 1989, Orange County 
Fire Department battalion chief Chuck Nicola was among the first called to the 
scene. Last year's Hurricane Emily off the Carolina Coast: Nicola was there. So 
no surprise that Nicola, head of the county's 56-member urban search and rescue 
task force, took his whole crew to Northridge after Monday's quake. . . . "He 
wrote the book," says a Fire Department spokeswoman, "so you know where he's 
going to be any time there's an emergency."

EARTHQUAKE: DIASTER BEFORE DAWN; ANAHEIM BABY MAKES SHAKY DEBUT; COINCIDENCE: 
NEWBORN WEIGHING 6 POUNDS, 6 OUNCES IS DELIVERED BY FLASHLIGHT MOMENTS AFTER 
6.6 QUAKE.

<P>
 "Push, push!" the nurses urged Monica Scheerer as the mop of brown hair atop 
her baby's tiny pink head began to emerge. She was almost there. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the Big One -- or at least what Scheerer, already miserable after 
six hours of labor, could have sworn was the Big One. 
</P>
<P>
 The medical staff scattered for cover under surrounding door frames. 
Scheerer's fiance sprawled his frame across her. Scheerer herself prayed that 
the ceiling staring down at her hadn't seen its best days. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercifully, the shaking stopped. But where were the lights, the backup power? 
How was her baby? Damn the dark; this is an omen, a bad one, the 28-year-old 
Anaheim woman thought to herself ruefully. 
</P>
<P>
 She felt so helpless. Minutes passed in panic. Then finally, nurses rummaged 
up a few flashlights, and Scheerer's doctor -- just arrived on the scene -- was 
able to deliver a healthy girl at 4:45 a.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The topper to an already remarkable birth: The baby, born just after a 6.6 
earthquake, weighed in at six pounds, six ounces. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unbelievable. I still can't believe it," said the father, 27-year-old Jim 
Nelsen, a cigar in his hand. 
</P>
<P>
 The delivery was the talk of Anaheim General Hospital all day. "Earthie," one 
nurse called the newborn. "Quake baby," suggested another. 
</P>
<P>
 The parents themselves shunned any thought of linking the baby's name forever 
to her birth. (Rickie -- short for Richter? Roxanne?) They stuck with the one 
they'd already picked: Nikki. At least it rhymed with Rickie. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheerer, who grew up in Orange County, said she has always been afraid of 
earthquakes. Monday's temblor, she said, was terrifying. 
</P>
<P>
 Laying in the dark as the delivery room shook, "I just kept thinking -- 'This 
is it. It's going to be the Big One.' But it wasn't like I could go anywhere, 
because her head was halfway out," she recounted. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Sang C. Kim said he had just arrived at the hospital parking lot to 
deliver the Scheerer baby when the quake hit. At first he thought something was 
wrong with his car. Then he realized the whole earth was shaking. 
</P>
<P>
 With the main power out at the hospital, Kim stumbled through the dark to the 
delivery room to find the frantic birth already in progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was exciting," Kim said in an interview in his Anaheim office, even as 
another aftershock hit. "This was my first like this. . . . I could hardly see 
what I was doing, but with the help of the flashlights, we made it." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Szekrenyi, chief executive officer at Anaheim General, said the 
emergency generator failed to kick in for 17 minutes and had to be activated 
manually. The failure was reported to the state as required, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dark wasn't the only problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheerer said she was bothered that the three nurses on hand at the time of 
the quake left her and Nelsen alone in the dark for the 30 seconds or so that 
it lasted, leaving the delivery table to take cover.  
</P>
<P>
 The nurses could not be reached for comment, but Szekrenyi said this appeared 
to be standard hospital protocol. 
</P>
<P>
 While he was not familiar with the details of the delivery, the administrator 
said that in general medical staffs are trained to ensure their own safety 
first during an emergency.  
</P>
<P>
 "They have to be safe in order to save the patients," he said, likening the 
situation to that of flight attendants taking air first for themselves from 
oxygen masks during an emergency before offering aid to passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 As frightening as the birth had been, Scheerer and Nelsen joked about the 
ordeal hours later as they talked with some friends and neighbors who had come 
to see Nikki. Occasionally, they spoke of the quake as a sort of blessing, and 
Scheerer said she suspects it may have even sped up the birth. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like some kind of sign that we were having a baby," said Nelsen, a 
foreman for an industrial painting crew. "God made something special today."

EARTHQUAKE: DIASTER BEFORE DAWN; LOCAL FIREFIGHTERS SEARCHED FOR VICTIMS AMID 
RUINS

<P>
 In the tomb that had been the Northridge Meadows Apartments, San Clemente Fire 
Department Engineer Gary Labrien went searching for life but found only 
evidence of death. 
</P>
<P>
 Using concrete saws and pickaxes, Labrien and a team of Orange County 
firefighters hacked into the floors of the complex's second level for views 
into the bedrooms, kitchens and living rooms of the crushed units below. 
</P>
<P>
 So powerful had been Monday's quake that the structure's top two floors simply 
collapsed on the ground units, leaving no other entry but from above. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would break open the floor and dig into small areas so that we could see," 
Labrien said minutes after emerging from the dust. "It looked like a dump down 
there. We could see people's belongings and family pictures. You just hope 
everybody in the pictures got out OK. . . . There were a few bodies down there, 
but we couldn't find anybody alive." 
</P>
<P>
 In all, about 250 Orange County firefighters -- some from Laguna Beach, 
Orange, San Clemente, Aliso Viejo and Los Alamitos -- were dispatched to the 
disaster's most severe trouble spots. Twelve local strike teams, each with five 
engines, were routed north in response to the quake. Eleven went to Los Angeles 
County and one to Ventura County. But work among members of Strike Team 1402A 
may have been the most discouraging. 
</P>
<P>
 By late Monday afternoon 14 people had perished in the apartment collapse -- 
including a 14-year-old boy. The number killed at that one location accounted 
for about half of Monday's total death toll. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all very sad," Labrien said. "There were a lot of areas that we can't 
even get to. It was a mess." 
</P>
<P>
 The work to find signs of the living was so intense that rescuers who had 
preceded the Orange County team had marked the sites where the dead lay so that 
the search could continue elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the teetering structure, Orange County firefighters were repeatedly 
jolted by powerful aftershocks, sending some diving for cover with each shake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would yell, 'Heads up!' And the guys would pop out of the doors" to the 
apartment units, said Orange County firefighter Craig Casey, seated on a truck 
bumper. "When an aftershock hit, we wanted to make sure that our guys were out 
of any holes. The place was like a honeycomb." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Battalion Chief Buck Henderson said the complex fell on the bottom 
floor, collapsing like a "house of cards." In some upstairs units, Henderson 
said, entire walls had been ripped away. 
</P>
<P>
 "The damage is really bad," the chief said. "We were cutting holes in the 
floors. The guys did a dynamite job." 
</P>
<P>
 If Northridge Meadows brought disappointment for the number of deaths, another 
Orange County team participated in a "victory" only a few blocks away at the 
Northridge Fashion Center. 
</P>
<P>
 There, under the rubble of a three-story parking structure, local Strike Team 
1403A aided Los Angeles units in the rescue of a 23-year-old street sweeper who 
had been wedged in crumpled concrete for more than five hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County units helped local rescuers move tons of concrete, using wooden 
support braces and powerful air bags. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Fire Capt. Thomas Burau said Orange County units aided in the 
delicate rescue of the man who had been sweeping the mall's parking lot when 
the structure collapsed on top of him. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the rescue, Burau said, the victim was yelling in Spanish that "he 
was going to die and he wanted someone to get down there and pray with him." 
</P>
<P>
 "He hung in there until we got to him and that made us feel good," said the 
captain, who believed the man had broken bones in his legs. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Firefighter Dave Gerber said the man's survival lifted the 
spirits of those involved in the rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It as a fantastic feeling," Gerber said, peeling away a sweaty shirt. "It was 
a great feeling of relief that he was still alive. "It's a once-in-a-lifetime 
thing that you get to do something like this. It was amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 During their drive north Monday morning, the convoy of Orange County fire 
engines passed demolished strip centers and crumbled walls. People sat on their 
front lawns and on sidewalk curbs outside the damaged structures. At the 
Northridge apartment complex, a stream of people walked the sidewalks to get a 
view of the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these people actually look unfazed by all of this," firefighter Casey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said 23-year-old Orange County firefighter Pedro Perez: "When I looked at the 
damage (at the Fashion Center), it was like looking at that (earthquake) ride 
at Universal Studios. I was waiting for everything to just fold back to the way 
it was. I can't believe this really happened. I know it sounds childish, but 
you usually see this on television reports about Mexico or someplace in India. 
But here I am. I'm right here in the middle of it."

 The Santa Margarita Water District will solicit a replacement for former board 
Chairman Don B. Schone from among the record number of candidates who ran 
unsuccessfully for office last November and others in the community who have 
not sought the position before. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Miller, the district's acting general manager who turned his job over to a 
new permanent manager Monday, said the board of directors will meet Wednesday 
night to figure out exactly what approach to take in filling the vacancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said several people already have expressed interest in Schone's seat on 
the water board. He resigned effective Monday amid revelations by The Times 
that he took free trips from a contractor but failed to report them, as 
required by state law. 
</P>
<P>
 One candidate who ran in November and won a seat on the board, only to find 
that she lost when the vote tally was miscalculated, said she will ask to be 
considered once again. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the opportunity comes up to apply, I will apply," said Betty K. Olson, a 
UC Irvine professor of environmental science for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the district faces difficult problems created by the unfortunate 
management that preceded" the new board, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson was one of 12 candidates for four seats on the board last year, a record 
number for the Santa Margarita Water District. Few seats on the water board 
have ever been contested. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson, an expert on water quality issues and environmental biotechnology, said 
she can bring a new perspective to the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I've got the expertise," she said. "We need to be cost-effective in 
bringing water to our customers in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 No matter who is selected, all five board members must run for reelection this 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a new state law, the district has been switched to "one man, one vote" 
from the old system in which each vote was based on a landowner's assessed 
property value. A landowner with $1 million worth of assessed property, for 
example, would get 1 million votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Schone, a 17-year board member, resigned after revelations that he accepted -- 
but did not report on economic disclosure forms -- two trips to Cabo San Lucas 
paid by a prominent engineering firm that received lucrative contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Schone acknowledged taking the trips to inspect a water reclamation plant 
being built by the engineering firm of Robert Bein, William Frost & Associates. 
In the past five years, the district has paid the company nearly $14 million in 
contracts. Schone should have reported the trips on state disclosure forms, but 
did not. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter W. (Bill) Knitz and Michael P. Lord, the district's top two managers, 
resigned last May after disclosures that they took an inordinate amount of 
gifts from contractors who did business with the district and treated 
themselves to lavish perks with district funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosectors, who are conducting a criminal investigation of Knitz and Lord as 
part of a state-federal probe of conflict-of-interest violations, say they are 
looking at Schone's records as well. None of the three men has been charged. 
</P>
<P>
 With Schone's departure, all five board members who were in charge when the 
Knitz-Lord scandal erupted are now gone. One retired. Three lost their seats in 
last November's board election and Schone submitted his resignation letter to 
the district on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said that while Schone's departure was regrettable under the 
circumstances, it gives a new board and a new general manager, John J. Schatz, 
a chance to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Don resigning, the old regime is gone," he said. "Now a new board and 
general manager can move on."

EARTHQUAKE: DIASTER BEFORE DAWN; COUNTY GOES TO AID OF DEVASTATED NEIGHBOR; 
AFTERMATH: FIRE CREWS, DOCTORS AND OTHERS HEAD NORTH TO JOIN IN THE RELIEF 
EFFORT AFTER LITTLE DAMAGE IS FOUND LOCALLY. NO MAJOR INJURIES ARE REPORTED IN 
THE AREA.

 After determining that Orange County had escaped almost unscathed, county 
officials mobilized to rush help to disaster-stricken Los Angeles, sending 
firefighters, doctors, nurses and other rescue workers to join the relief 
effort in areas hardest hit by Monday's pre-dawn earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the ground had stopped shaking and the windows had quit rattling, Orange 
County officials took stock of their situation and found that the county 
suffered remarkably little damage and no major injuries as a result of the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The most visible sign of damage caused by the 6.6 magnitude temblor was the 
toppled "Big A" scoreboard atop Anaheim Stadium, a massive 17.5-ton landmark 
that crushed between 800 and 1,000 stadium seats when it collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 With little to clean up here, Orange County went to work elsewhere: 
</P>
<P>
 * Sixty fire engines manned by 192 local firefighters, as well as 56 members 
of the Orange County Urban Search and Rescue squad, were quickly dispatched to 
Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley to assist in firefighting and 
search-and-rescue operations. Among the units mobilized was the county's Heavy 
Rescue Team, the unit that pulled 57-year-old Buck Helm from the collapsed 
Nimitz Freeway following the 1989 San Francisco Bay Area earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 * A team of 10 doctors and nurses from UCI Medical Center boarded vans to help 
staff the emergency room at Granada Hills Community Hospital, near the 
earthquake's epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
 * Helicopters from El Toro Marine Corps Air Station airlifted a handful of 
infants from the heavily damaged Northridge Hospital Medical Center so they 
could be placed in intensive care units at Saddleback Memorial Medical Center 
in Laguna Hills and UCI Medical Center in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 * The National Guard activated its emergency operations center in Los Alamitos 
on Monday morning in preparation for any deployment to Los Angeles and Ventura 
counties. About 60 National Guard troops reported to the base with their gear, 
"just in case we need them to perform a mission," Lt. Col. Pat Antosh said. 
</P>
<P>
 * County building inspectors and public works crews were positioned to help 
Los Angeles County assess and clean up the damage caused by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 In a time of crisis, Orange County had responded quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez boasted of Orange County's efficiency at a 
10 a.m. news conference, he and other officials conceded that they did not know 
how many of the county's fire stations could withstand a major earthquake, or 
whether medical assistance could be provided in hard-to-reach areas of the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1989 study warned that more than one-third of Orange County's 42 fire 
stations could collapse on their fire crews and equipment in a major 
earthquake, unless they were retrofitted or replaced, and county officials were 
unable to say how much of the needed work had been done. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, while more than 100 doctors have received special earthquake training, 
very few have been equipped with the necessary emergency equipment that is 
supposed to be stored in their automobiles at all times, Vasquez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It causes all of us, as individuals and as policy makers . . . to reflect on 
what we have done and what we need to do," Vasquez said. "Clearly, there are 
things we need to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County, many agreed Monday, had been lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 "One guy fell out of bed, and that's about it," reported Joe Samet, 72, the 
earthquake committee coordinator at Leisure World of Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake was felt in Orange County at 4:31 a.m. and seemed to go on and 
on. 
</P>
<P>
 But to the amazement of Orange County residents and law enforcement officials, 
the quake turned out to be more inconvenience -- a rude awakening from quiet 
slumber -- than catastrophe, as felt in northern Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 From the Placentia Police Department's command center, Lt. Chuck Babcock 
marveled that his city had escaped with only a broken water pipe in a 
resident's garage and a broken window on Chapman Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "As much as it shook, we were surprised we didn't have more damage," Babcock 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the northern part of the county, there were scattered reports of broken 
windows in commercial buildings in La Habra and La Palma, but no looting. A 
Lucky's market in Westminster also lost a window, police there said. 
</P>
<P>
 Later Monday morning, the Huntington Beach Fire Department received more than 
90 telephone calls in one hour complaining of a gaslike odor in the area from 
Huntington Harbour to Newport Beach. A spokeswoman for the department said 
refineries in the Long Beach-Wilmington area had released some natural gas that 
was backed up as a result of the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the county's minimal damage, officials said they would not know until 
today whether Orange County would ask to be declared a disaster area, which 
could make county residents and businesses eligible for federal emergency 
relief funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's freeways and bridges appeared to have withstood the stress, 
although a bridge on the Santa Margarita Parkway developed a crack about two 
inches wide and five inches deep. The damage was discovered on a 4-year-old 
bridge where the parkway crosses Trabuco Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 John Sibley, assistant director of the county's Environmental Management 
Agency, said the engineering design of the road accomplished its mission: "To 
absorb the damage and not to fall down. A motorist traveling across it would 
not notice the damage." 
</P>
<P>
 None of the water districts in Orange County issued any of the warnings that 
were given to residents of northern Los Angeles County to boil their tap water 
as a precaution against possible contamination. There were reports that Los 
Angeles County residents were flocking to purchase bottled water in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just trying to keep water on the shelves," said a breathless Dave, who 
had neither time nor inclination to provide his last name but had taken charge 
of the Los Alamitos Vons in the early evening. "It's empty right now. And I 
just filled it a little while ago. All I can say is business picked up. That's 
about it. I've got to run." 
</P>
<P>
 At Pavilion's in Seal Beach, clerks had stopped scurrying back and forth to 
the storeroom by about 6 p.m. Their water stash had run dry, and access to the 
company's warehouse was blocked by broken freeways. All told, some 2,000 
gallons of water left the store, according to clerk Dustin Dessero. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sold out of a week's worth of water today. Our week's worth is kept in the 
back and we've blown through all that," a startled Dessero said. "We've been 
busy all day. A lot of people are here, I'll say that." 
</P>
<P>
 While the county itself escaped major destruction, the 250 Orange County 
firefighters and rescue squad members saw a different picture as they undertook 
the task of searching for survivors amid the rubble in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 As they drove northward Monday morning, the convoy of Orange County fire 
engines passed demolished strip centers and retaining walls pulled away from 
their foundations. People sat on their front lawns and curbs, amazed by the 
damaged structures. 
</P>
<P>
 And outside the Northridge Meadow Apartments, where at least seven people were 
killed, crowds paraded up and down the sidewalks to get a view of the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these people actually look unfazed by all of this," Orange County 
firefighter Craig Casey said. "It's amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, the earthquake sent a few residents to hospitals for treatment of 
cuts and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
 And some of Orange County's hospital beds were needed by five Los Angeles 
County infants who were transferred from Northridge Hospital's intensive care 
unit to UCI Medical Center and Saddleback Memorial Medical Center due to the 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps the most significant emergency at Anaheim General Hospital was not 
earthquake-related, but the birth of a "6.6" baby girl, weighing six pounds, 
six ounces. She was born 14 minutes after the temblor, a hospital spokeswoman 
said, "pretty close to the earthquake. I guess they just shook her out at the 
right time." 
</P>
<P>
 Some took the quake in stride. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Westminster Cafe, most of the early-morning regulars sat glued to the 
5:30 a.m. television reports of the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like 'em," 58-year-old Huntington Beach carpenter Bruce Boesing said of the 
earthquakes that periodically rattle Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, c'mon," retorted one of his regular coffee partners, Forrest McCracken, 
57, of Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm serious," Boesing insisted. "It makes half the people that moved here (to 
California) get out and go home." 
</P>
<P>
 One woman at John Wayne Airport was so anxious to get out of California that 
she booked a flight to Salt Lake City on her way home to Tucson. "I don't want 
to wait around here for the Big One," said Maryann Silver, 45. "Our main goal 
is to get out of here. The whole thing has been such a shock. I've been on pins 
and needles since 4:30 a.m." 
</P>
<P>
 Some county residents were left jittery by the quake and set out to be 
prepared for the next one. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Bender, 71, of Newport Beach walked out of a Fountain Valley store with 
cartons of flashlights and canned food. While he is usually well-prepared for 
an earthquake, Bender said home renovations made him misplace his cache. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a barrel of earthquake stuff and we can't find it," he said. "How do 
you like that?" 
</P>
<P>
 Preparedness did not save a 12-member overnight restocking crew at the Stater 
Bros. store in Costa Mesa from having to clean up a mess of ketchup, barbecue 
sauce and other liquids that splattered on the floor during the temblor. The 
store's policy of setting glass products two inches from the shelf's edge did 
little to prevent countless breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Lira Jr., one of the workers, said practical jokers had rattled a shelf 
he was stocking just last month. When the earthquake began, Lira said he 
thought that it was another joke. "Then I saw jars of jelly smashing on the 
floor and I knew it was the real thing." 
</P>
<P>
 In Laguna Beach, where recent fires and floods damaged the town's 
once-pristine hillsides, the earthquake seemed to have done little damage. 
Straw bales and sand bags -- reminders of past disasters -- still clung to 
hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who can tell the difference anyway?" asked John Calhoun, a surveyor who was 
working in one of the fire-swept areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake's impact was most apparent at Anaheim Stadium, where debris 
from the giant scoreboard and advertising panels was strewn across the seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Scattered power outages were reported in several communities, including Santa 
Ana, where 1,000 day shift employees of the ITT Cannon plant started their work 
day in the parking lot, waiting half an hour for power to resume. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim Police Department was expected to have a work slowdown today -- 
not because of but in spite of the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Police union officials said the quake would probably not impact the "Blue Flu" 
sickout planned by about 175 police officers who were expected to call in sick 
to protest a stalemate in their labor contract negotiations with the city.

EARTHQUAKE: DIASTER BEFORE DAWN; COUNTY'S BEEN SLOW TO RETROFIT FIRE STATIONS; 
SAFETY: BUDGET WOES ARE BLAMED FOR LACK OF REPAIRS TO BUILDINGS FOUND TO BE AT 
'HIGH RISK' OF COLLAPSE IN QUAKE. 
</P>

 More than four years after the county learned a third of its fire stations 
were "very unlikely" to survive a major earthquake, officials acknowledged 
Monday that most of the problems remain uncorrected. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials could only identify one fire station -- currently under 
construction -- that has been retrofitted since the October, 1989, study found 
15 emergency buildings at a "high risk . . . of structural collapse" in an 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Assistant Fire Chief Jim Radley and Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez 
said at a news conference that there may be other corrections that they could 
not recall. But Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder said fire officials told her 
Monday that the only other repairs were "really Band-Aid kind of stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials blamed the slow repairs on the county's severe budget problems. But 
Wieder said she was surprised to learn that more has not been done, and she 
said she will order the County Fire Department to prepare an update on the 
issue today. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes disasters like this to point this out," Wieder said. "It's OK to say 
cost is the problem when the sun is out. But when there's life and property at 
stake, is there a price you put on it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the problems in the system, Vasquez and county fire officials said 
they remained confident in the county's emergency response. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are as ready as we can be with the resources that are available to us and 
the technology that is available to us," Vasquez said. 
</P>
<P>
 What would the county do if this happened here? "We would respond with 
personnel and equipment that have trained to respond to these kinds of 
incidents," Vasquez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Emmy Day, spokeswoman for the County Fire Department, added: "When people do 
reports like that, they are looking for as near as perfect a situation you can 
have. . . . If I thought I couldn't survive an earthquake because the Fire 
Department wasn't prepared, I'd move." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1989 study, released shortly after a deadly earthquake rattled the San 
Francisco area, caused alarm among county officials who promised to resolve the 
problems as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Thomas F. Riley called the situation "very serious." Wieder ordered 
a special meeting of county emergency planners to talk about solutions. County 
Fire Chief Larry J. Holms predicted some of the repairs could be made right 
away, but others would take up to three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, conducted for the county by EQE Engineering in Costa Mesa, said 15 
of the county's 42 fire stations would be damaged so badly in an earthquake 
that they would be "very unlikely" to perform their emergency functions. It 
said another 20 stations were at risk of "substantial damage" that would hamper 
rescue efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The report did not say how big the earthquake would have to be to cause such 
damage.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, the county has 48 fire stations in its system. But only one -- in 
Laguna Hills near Leisure World -- is under construction to correct earthquake 
problems, officials said. Day said that station is the busiest in the county 
and considered to have the most critical problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Day said three of the stations in the high-risk category were staffed only by 
volunteers at times of emergency. She also said several of the buildings are 
owned by cities, even though they are staffed and equipped by county fire 
crews. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the structural problems, the 1989 report found significant 
deficiencies with the county's emergency radio system, its automatic garage 
doors, hazardous compressed gas tanks and other equipment. It described the 
county's overall fire system as "typically at high risk" to fail in the event 
of an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the problems have been addressed since the report. The corrections 
described by Wieder relate mostly to desks and equipment that was not properly 
secured to walls or the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Most notably, the county is also in the process of ordering a new radio system 
for its public safety departments. The $80-million communications contract, one 
of the biggest purchases in county history, is intended to upgrade a radio 
system that one county official recently described as being "like a freeway 
that has slowed to 5 m.p.h." 
</P>
<P>
 After the report four years ago, county officials also launched one of the 
first programs in the country to train emergency room physicians to treat 
earthquake victims in the field. The doctors received the training long ago, 
but the county has been unable to acquire the medical kits it intended to 
supply them. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez said the county had been trying to get pharmaceutical companies to 
donate the medical kits. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wieder said that while the county has major budget problems, she would be 
concerned if public safety were jeopardized because there was not enough money. 
She said she was especially bothered because the supervisors have not been told 
about the status of the county's earthquake preparedness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel I'm in an untenable position," she said. "We should know. The buck 
should stop with us. . . . If money is the problem, and we're given all of the 
data, at least have the information -- which it appears we are lacking."

 KEEPING TRACK: By April, the number of commuter trains heading north and south 
out of Orange County is going to triple.Which is why officials are worried 
about youngsters playing on or near the railroad tracks. The County 
Transportation Authority has begun putting on train-related safety 
demonstrations in county schools, to run through the end of May. . . . "Kids 
are fascinated by trains," says authority board member Irv Pickler. "But they 
have to stay away from railroad tracks."

 POWER OF LONGEVITY: Conservative political pundit Pat Buchanan took his first 
White House job for Richard Nixon and has been a Nixon loyalist since. He'll be 
on hand Thursday when Nixon returns to his presidential library in Yorba Linda 
to announce a new studies center there. . . . Says Buchanan: "It is natural and 
fitting that the new center will dwell on questions of war and peace." As for 
Nixon's enemies, Buchanan adds: "He has the greatest revenge; he has outlived 
them."

 TV TOWN HALL: Old-fashioned Town Hall meetings helped send Bill Clinton to the 
White House.Now he uses satellite "town halls" to stay in touch and sell his 
programs. One of them -- on arts and education -- takes place across the 
country today at 5:15 p.m. . . . To watch locally, you can show up at the 
county Board of Education office in Costa Mesa. Clinton's Education Secretary 
Richard Riley will talk by satellite with local leaders in arts and the schools 
about how the President intends to make the arts a part of his education 
reform.

<P>
 County officials are now accepting applications for seats on the new property 
assessment appeals board. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel was created by the Board of Supervisors to handle the logjam of 
appeals in the county assessor's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Applicants are required to have five years' experience in California as either 
a certified public accountant, public accountant, licensed real estate broker, 
attorney or accredited property appraiser. 
</P>
<P>
 Members are paid $100 for each half-day session, $200 for full days. The 
minimum monthly time commitment is 120 hours. Meetings are conducted at the 
Civic Center in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 The board was added to two existing panels to speed the appeals process, which 
has a backlog of 25,000 cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The boards review the petitions filed by property owners who believe their 
property values were figured inaccurately, leading to an excessive tax bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The addition of the third board is part of a package of reforms that county 
officials hope will streamline an office that has 65,000 appeals awaiting 
review. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor William G. Steiner said the measures will shave weeks or months off 
current delays. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the third board, it would take three years to clear the backlog, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 County Assessor Bradley L. Jacobs has attributed the logjam to the depressed 
real estate market and insufficient resources to handle the increased workload. 
</P>
<P>
 Applicants who seek board seats may also be qualified to serve as hearing 
officers, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The duties are similar, except that the officers meet informally with citizens 
to seek one-on-one resolutions to their appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearing officers are paid $150 per session, which lasts two to four hours, 
with a monthly time commitment of 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Applications must be submitted to the clerk of the Board of Supervisors, 10 
Civic Center Plaza, Santa Ana, Calif. 92702. 
</P>
<P>
 Forms are available by mail, phone or facsimile machine. 
</P>
<P>
 The clerk's phone number is (714) 834-2206, and the fax number is (714) 
834-4439.GEOFF BOUCHER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA / YORBA LINDA; MECHANIC SUES CITIES, DETECTIVES, CAR 
DEALER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 An auto mechanic has filed a lawsuit against the cities of Brea and Yorba 
Linda, alleging that two plainclothes detectives chased him in an unmarked car 
and then improperly told his employer that he was being cited for speeding. 
</P>
<P>
 Also named in the lawsuit are Canyon Acura, which fired mechanic Stephen R. 
Clark as a result of the information police provided, and the two detectives, 
David Jones and David Coovert. 
</P>
<P>
 Last April, Clark, who was the foreman of Canyon Acura's service department, 
was test-driving a 1991 Acura NSX after repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 After pulling out onto La Palma Avenue, Clark said, he noticed a car following 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 When the driver of the car began gesturing at him to pull over, Clark said, he 
thought the passengers were angry with him for cutting them off. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was scared," Clark said. "I thought they were real ticked off and wanted 
to" beat him up. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark said he tried to elude the car by speeding through a commercial park and 
a residential neighborhood off La Palma Avenue. When he noticed the car wasn't 
following him anymore, Clark said, he went back to Canyon Acura, where the 
plainclothes officers and several uniformed officers were waiting for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them I didn't know they were cops," Clark said. "But one of the 
(detectives) asked one of the (uniformed officers) for his ticket book and 
wrote me a ticket." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark said he was cited for speeding and for unsafe lane changes. One of the 
detectives then told his boss about the citation, and Clark was told to go home 
and was fired three days later. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark contends that the California Vehicle Code requires police officers 
involved in traffic enforcement to be in uniform and driving a marked patrol 
car or motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
 Exceptions are made for pursuing stolen vehicles, but the NSX had not been 
reported stolen, Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Arczynski, assistant city attorney for Brea, said that plainclothes 
officers in unmarked cars do not generally get involved in traffic enforcement. 
He would not comment on why Coovert and Jones were trying to get Clark to pull 
over or why they initiated the pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not at liberty to discuss their thoughts," Arczynski said. "It is 
probably fairly unusual to (initiate a pursuit) in an unmarked car." 
</P>
<P>
 Coovert and Jones were not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea police are responsible for patrolling Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
 The citation against Clark was dropped when the two plainclothes officers 
failed to appear at his hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark's lawsuit claims that both the police and his former employer violated 
the Labor Code. 
</P>
<P>
 He argues that the code prohibits police officers from telling an employer 
about an arrest or detention that did not result in a conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Employers are similarly prohibited from using such information to fire an 
employee, according to Clark's lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bruce Myers, Canyon Acura's service manager, said he fired Clark because 
of a confrontation with police that occurred after the car chase. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were cops here for an hour and 15 minutes," Myers said. "We had 
(police) cars all over the place. Our driveway was blocked, and our customers 
were asking us what was going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Myers said he had no choice but to recommend to the general manager that Clark 
be fired. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you have a situation that involves how we look, we have to act on 
that," Myers said. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; NONPROFIT HOSPICE'S OPENING DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY SPENCER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Organizers of the county's first nonprofit hospice say it will probably be 
spring before the facility opens. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hospice of Orange County was scheduled to open in Anaheim Hills this 
month, but Helen Monroe, the group's treasurer, now expects it to open by May. 
</P>
<P>
 Monroe said the delay is due in part to efforts to corral a well-heeled 
benefactor to sponsor the facility. One benefactor, whom she would not name, is 
looking into adopting the project and taking care of its ongoing financial 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is also hoping to receive a government grant from a fund that helps 
people with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "This (hospice) is still going to happen," Monroe said. "We are in the process 
of hiring an executive director so we can get the paperwork underway." 
</P>
<P>
 The organizers have been trying to raise $200,000 to open the six-bed hospice, 
which will be in a home on Paseo Rio Azul. The home was used until recently by 
Catholic Charities of Orange County as a residence for mentally retarded 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospices provide round-the-clock care for terminally ill patients during their 
dying days in a home-like setting. They are staffed by registered nurses. 
</P>
<P>
 It is expected that many of the patients will be the elderly and people with 
AIDS.TERRY SPENCER

<TEXT>
<P>
 P. Kay Griffin has been named interim director of the California Department of 
Transportation district that encompasses Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin, 52, replaces Russell O. Lightcap, who retired as the director of 
District 12 in December after 45 years with Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin, an Oklahoma native, has worked for Caltrans since 1965, when she 
became one of only four women among the ranks of the approximately 5,000 
engineers then with the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, she said, there are about 750 women out of 13,000 engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling her first week on the job "stimulating," Griffin said she hopes the 
temporary assignment will be a "growing experience." 
</P>
<P>
 No permanent successor has been named. A formal interview process will be 
conducted to find a replacement. An Orange County Transportation Authority 
representative will participate in the search. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans District 12 has direct supervision over $400 million in projects in 
Orange County this year and also has indirect oversight for another $1 billion 
in toll road construction and other projects. 
</P>
<P>
 In a previous assignment, Griffin was chief of the Division of Highway 
Operations, giving her responsibility for setting statewide policy and 
standards for the state highway system, toll bridges, ride-sharing facilities 
and truck operations.GEOFF BOUCHER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; SEWAGE SPILL CLOSES PART OF ALISO BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 200-foot section of Aliso Beach was closed Monday morning after an estimated 
1,000 gallons of raw sewage from a treatment plant spilled into Aliso Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 The spill occurred about 11:20 a.m. when a rotating screen broke at the South 
Coast Water District's Coastal Treatment Plant, said Michael Dunbar, the 
district's general manager.The plant is in Aliso Canyon about a mile upstream 
from the beach and Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunbar said the broken screen was quickly discovered by workmen and replaced, 
but not before the raw sewage spilled into the creek. The spill was unrelated 
to Monday's earthquake, Dunbar said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one of those things where a piece of equipment broke. But it was 
fortunate it happened when it did because it was seen right away and we had 
people right there to fix it," Dunbar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunbar said that the beach was closed as a precautionary measure and that 
samples of ocean water were taken for testing. Because of the holiday Monday, 
it will probably be Wednesday before test results are available and the beach 
possibly can be reopened, Dunbar said. 
</P>
<P>
 The treatment plant where the break occurred was built in the 1950s but was 
expanded in 1982, Dunbar said. The plant provides sewage treatment for the 
South Coast Water District, the city of Laguna Beach and the Emerald Bay 
Services District.LEN HALL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; DRIVE IS ON TO NAME STADIUM AFTER COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CORE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Parents and students at Mission Viejo High School are calling on trustees of 
the Saddleback Valley Unified School District to name the campus stadium in 
honor of deceased former football coach and teacher Mike Rush. 
</P>
<P>
 Rush died of a heart attack in November at age 46. Eight months earlier, he 
resigned his coaching position amid controversy over the school's devil mascot 
and reports of conflict between him and Principal Robert Metz. 
</P>
<P>
 In five seasons, Rush's teams compiled a 45-16 record. He had also been an 
assistant football coach at the school for 10 years. After stepping down as 
head coach, Rush continued teaching at Mission Viejo and was hired as an 
assistant football coach at Rancho Santiago College in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mike Rush was a hero in this community; he touched thousands of lives," said 
Sandie Gonzales, one of the parents spearheading the stadium drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mike stood for integrity, honesty, moral values, all the things that are so 
important to young people. What better way to pass Mike's values along to the 
community and keep his values alive than to put his name on that stadium?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rush's departure from the district came amid controversy over the school's 
logo. 
</P>
<P>
 Rush had sided with players and students who rebelled against a ban on the 
school's devil logo, put in place in 1986 as a result of concerns from the 
Christian community. Rush's position caused tensions between him and school 
officials, but no one was ever willing to discuss publicly the reasons for his 
resignation as football coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Rush's death, Gonzales and other parents petitioned the district's 
Board of Education for his reinstatement. They also filed a lawsuit against the 
district last year, claiming it infringed on their children's free-speech 
rights by forbidding them to wear in school the devil icon, representing the 
school's Diablos nickname. Diablo is Spanish for devil.  
</P>
<P>
 The district later rescinded the ban and last September held an election in 
which students voted to adopt a baby-faced devil as the new mascot, replacing a 
bulldog. However, the new logo is in limbo because it may look too much like a 
trademarked comic-book character. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, about 60 people -- including parents, students, Rush's widow and a 
Capistrano Valley High School football coach whose players competed against 
Rush's teams -- attended a trustees meeting to ask that the field on the 
Mission Viejo High campus be named Mike Rush Memorial Stadium. The field does 
not have a name. 
</P>
<P>
 About a third of those in attendance delivered occasionally emotional speeches 
testifying to Rush's charisma, caring, interest in students and motivational 
abilities. They also presented the board with a petition with 1,500 signatures 
from students and community members. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mike was never one to brag about himself or carry on about his 
accomplishments," said Pam Rush, his widow. "It's something I don't think the 
board can deny after the number and variety of people who got up to speak on 
his behalf." 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Dore J. Gilbert said the board is concerned about setting a 
precedent by putting the name of a high school football coach on the stadium. 
It will be seeking reaction from parents and students throughout the district, 
particularly Laguna Hills High, which shares the stadium with Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 The board is scheduled to discuss the issue again on Jan. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Board of Education is not making a decision based on how we as 
individuals may feel about Mike Rush," Gilbert said. "We are making a decision 
based on what is right for the district." RICHARD CORE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; CITY SELECTS NEW FIRE DEPT. CHIEF

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bernard F. Heimos, Garden Grove Fire Department's division chief and fire 
marshal, will become fire chief in Fountain Valley, city officials have 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Heimos, who has served with the Garden Grove Fire Department since August, 
1974, begins his new position Monday, officials said. He will oversee a 
department of 41 employees, including 38 firefighters at two stations, with a 
budget of $4.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Heimos, 46, replaces Richard E. Jorgensen, who retired in December after 12 
years as chief. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Ray Kromer said Heimos was selected from a pool of 14 candidates 
working at fire departments in Orange County, neighboring counties and Northern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Heimos was selected because of his wide range of experience, including 11 
years in management, Kromer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a view of the big picture of the fire service and overall city 
operations," Kromer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Heimos, a Huntington Beach resident, has also held the ranks of battalion 
chief, suppression captain, emergency service coordinator and fire inspector. 
Before moving to Orange County, he served as a firefighter for three years in 
Des Plaines, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Heimos said he has been looking for a position as chief for 
the past several years. "I was looking for a certain type of city and community 
where I felt my administrative and fire service background would fit," he said. 
"Fountain Valley was a perfect fit." 
</P>
<P>
 Heimos said that what impressed him most about the city was the emphasis on 
"customer service" and that in the months ahead he will find ways to emphasize 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always ways to look at the public's needs," he said. "I guess I've 
never really been satisfied with the status quo. I always look for things to 
develop and grow." 
</P>
<P>
 Heimos teaches fire prevention courses at Rancho Santiago College in Santa Ana 
and is a state-certified instructor in fire management and fire prevention. He 
is also a member of several professional firefighting organizations, including 
the Orange County Fire Chiefs Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor John Collins said the new fire chief has exceptional qualifications and 
"a terrific background in all areas of fire service. That's what made him 
attractive to us."DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; SPINAL INJURY SPURS DEDICATION TO OTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ELSTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rogers Severson thought he and Jaime could go far together. 
</P>
<P>
 Both were paralyzed with spinal cord injuries in 1986 and were learning to 
walk again at Casa Colina Center for Rehabilitation in Pomona. Severson, 46 at 
the time, severed his spinal cord in a horse riding accident; Jaime did it in a 
motorcycle mishap. But when therapy sessions began one day, Jaime was not 
there. Severson, a Newport Beach resident, found out later that Jaime's 
insurance coverage had run out before his therapy was complete. He was sent to 
a rest home. 
</P>
<P>
 The next time the two saw each other, Severson could walk with the aid of a 
cane, while Jaime needed help to turn over in bed and had lost 50 pounds and 
any hope of walking. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Severson does not even know Jaime's last name or where he is today, he 
is dedicated to making certain that other spinal-cord injury patients do not go 
Jaime's route. 
</P>
<P>
 "His potential was just like mine," Severson said. "He could have been a 
productive human being." 
</P>
<P>
 Within six months of being discharged from the hospital in Pomona six years 
ago, the co-owner of Saddleback Associates real estate development firm held a 
$500-per-plate luncheon in Newport Beach, raising $160,000 for other spinal 
cord patients. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual SCI Special Fund luncheons at the Four Seasons Hotel, as well as 
year-round fund-raising efforts, have generated about $1 million to pay for 
patient therapy, which costs about $800 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a life-changing situation" for patients, Severson said. "It means not 
being a ward of the state for the rest of your life and sitting in a rest home 
and being miserable." 
</P>
<P>
 Severson's story fits that profile. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours after being thrown, Severson was told by neurologists at Mission 
Community Hospital in Mission Viejo that he had no hope of walking again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was devastated, obviously," Severson said. "But my wife knew that I would 
walk again." 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to prompt and proper therapy, Severson has gained not only mobility -- 
he has gone from a quadriplegic with no use of his arms or legs to having free 
movement of his arms and some movement in his legs -- but the determination to 
become an activist on behalf of others. 
</P>
<P>
 His next big project is to help people who have been rehabilitated and are 
ready to re-enter the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hardest part (of recovery) is getting out after rehab and adjusting to 
the real world," he said. "Many people get out and then never go anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Severson donated $30,000 to Goodwill to start an office that finds 
jobs for such people. So far, the office has helped find work for three people 
and, in one case, purchased a special van so a person could commute to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Severson also recently traveled to Washington to testify before a U.S. Senate 
committee about funding rehabilitation programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "You ask yourself how this can happen," Severson said, referring to Jaime's 
fate. "But it happens a lot, and I didn't know that until I went through it."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; HISTORICAL DISTRICT CONSIDERED FOR CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two historic homes may be moved to a new location on Beach Boulevard across 
from City Hall to be part of a newly created historical district to preserve 
the city's past. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council today will consider the relocation of the homes, the 
establishment of a historical district and the purchase of the property. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's meeting has been changed from Monday because of the Martin 
Luther King Jr. holiday. The meeting begins at 5 p.m. in the council chambers, 
6650 Beach Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 The Whitaker-Jaynes estate and Bacon House, both owned by the city, are on 
Manchester Boulevard near Beach Boulevard next to the Santa Ana Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The Whitaker-Jaynes home was built at the site in 1887. The Bacon House, a 
squatter's shack built sometime in the 1850s, was moved in 1976 from its 
original location on Beach Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the sake of preservation, we're supporting the action to move the 
houses," said Dean Dixon, a board member of the Buena Park Historical Society. 
"I think it's kind of a win-win situation. The city gets property for economic 
development, and we get a historical district that uses these two houses as a 
centerpiece." 
</P>
<P>
 The house relocation is proposed to make room for expansion of the Manchester 
Boulevard auto center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether a dealer opens there or not, the idea of centralizing those two 
historic buildings closer to downtown and the Civic Center helps to unify in 
one place the historical picture" of the city, said City Manager Kevin 
O'Rourke. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been too much destruction of our heritage," he said. "Here's an 
opportunity to preserve Buena Park's heritage." 
</P>
<P>
 Wes Morgan, director of recreation, parks and community services, said the 
city's vision is to create a place where the homes will be permanently 
preserved and other buildings of historical significance are protected. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed site is on the west side of Beach Boulevard, between 9th and 10th 
streets, south of the Santa Ana Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Other landmark structures on the block include the First Congregational Church 
and the former Stage Stop Hotel, which are among buildings planned to be 
included in the historic district. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council, acting as the Redevelopment Agency, will consider spending 
$568,000 for the project. The money will come from the Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 May Hui, assistant director of development services-economic development, said 
the property owner has accepted the city's offer of $225,000 for the 
quarter-acre parcel. An additional $15,000 is planned to be spent on relocation 
costs. An office and a home are currently on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost to move the two historic homes is about $20,000. About $300,000 was 
budgeted for landscaping and construction of restrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will also consider awarding a contract for $8,100 to hire a 
landscape architect to develop a master plan for the historical district 
grounds. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; SCHOOL INHERITS OFFICE EQUIPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An office of the IBM Corp. recently gave $75,000 worth of office and 
electronic equipment to Costa Mesa High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Ed Harcharik said he and other school employees worked for three 
days during the winter holiday to move equipment into the school. 
</P>
<P>
 The surplus equipment was available because the IBM sales office on Anton 
Boulevard is shrinking due to buyouts, said spokeswoman Terri Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said IBM offices are encouraged to help nonprofit organizations in 
their region. "This is a real important thing to us," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harcharik said he received seven $3,000 oscilloscopes, four microfiche 
readers, 20 credenzas, 30 stainless steel chairs, computer tables, 200 binders 
for notebooks, five heavy-duty desks and 20 file cabinets. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all of the equipment is now in science classes, the library and other 
classrooms and conference rooms, he said. "It made a difference to the 
teachers," Harcharik said, "and it saved us a heck of a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
 Harcharik said the donation was possible because of the work of a new 
foundation that is being formed to let business leaders help the school. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation, which must be approved by the school board, would include Ed 
Fawcett, director of the Chamber of Commerce, and other business leaders, 
Harcharik said. 
</P>
<P>
 The business leaders will help get equipment for the school, form 
scholarships, provide speakers, help with Career Day and establish mentor 
programs, Harcharik said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Diane Pritchett, one of the members of the foundation, found that IBM 
had some extra equipment to give. WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; CITY TO CONSIDER ADDING 2 OFFICERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two new police officers may hit the streets within the next two months if the 
City Council approves the plan tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing residents' concerns about crime, City Manager Ray Kromer said his 
goal is to put as many police officers as possible on patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 "We understand that the No. 1 issue in Orange County is crime, and we want our 
citizens to feel safe," Kromer said. "And, at this time, we can afford to add 
the officers -- and we think that's the right thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor John Collins also agreed that crime is a top priority. "We've done a lot 
of measures over the year" to fight crime, he said. "We want to add more 
officers because we want the citizens not only to be safe, we want them to feel 
safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Hiring two officers will cost about $124,000, including salary and benefits, 
officials said. The cost is offset by increased revenue from fines and the 
efficiency in the processing of citations -- a result of changes in the way 
citations are handled, Kromer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the Police Department has 65 officers. It has been several years 
since there has been a new hire on the force, he said. The additional officers 
will help police target problem neighborhoods, Kromer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Council approval would result in a recruitment effort. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting begins at 7 p.m. in City Council chambers, 10200 Slater Ave. DEBRA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; WETLANDS PROJECT TO BE DISCUSSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT BARKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County officials are scheduled to discuss the recently released 
environmental impact report on a plan to build more than 4,000 homes in the 
Bolsa Chica Wetlands with the City Council and Planning Commission today. 
</P>
<P>
 The session is scheduled at 5 p.m. in Room B-8, adjacent to the City Council 
chambers. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from Orange County's Environmental Management Agency have 
announced that they will only answer questions about the process and timetables 
for future public comment sessions and not deal with substantive issues in the 
environmental study, City Councilwoman Grace Winchell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Winchell, chairwoman of the city's Bolsa Chica Strategic Planning Committee, 
said the briefing will be the only session that the county has scheduled in 
Huntington Beach, even though the city surrounds the Bolsa Chica area and could 
suffer what she called "tremendous adverse effects" from the development. 
</P>
<P>
 The Koll Real Estate Group, which owns the land, wants to build 4,286 homes on 
400 acres. Koll would spend about $48 million to restore 1,100 acres of 
wetlands in return for the right to build the homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The environment impact report, released late in December, also includes two 
alternatives. One would reduce the number of homes to slightly more than 3,000, 
and the developer wouldn't have to pay to restore the wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 A second alternative would completely restore the wetlands in the form of a 
"biodiversity park" with no commercial development. There is no funding source 
identified for either alternative.ROBERT BARKER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; COUNCIL PUSHES FOR AIRPORT AT EL TORO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After months on the sidelines, the City Council last week entered the debate 
on what to do with the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station by joining a group 
pushing to convert the base into a commercial airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "If another airport is needed in Orange County, this is the site," Councilman 
Frank Laszlo said of El Toro, which is slated for closure later this decade."It 
really is the most logical place." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials decided to join the Orange County Regional Airport Authority in 
part to express their opposition to the idea of converting the Seal Beach Naval 
Weapons Station into an airport. Though building an airport in Seal Beach is 
highly unlikely, some South County residents have suggested the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Seal Beach will join several other north and central county cities such as 
Anaheim, Los Alamitos and Santa Ana on the regional airport authority. The 
group has expressed support for building an air cargo facility at El Toro 
because it would be a boost to the county's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Several South County cities, including Irvine, oppose converting the base into 
an airport, fearing noise, traffic and pollution problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Laszlo said he plans to regularly attend the regional airport authority 
meetings.SHELBY GRAD

EARTHQUAKE: DIASTER BEFORE DAWN; SLIDE ANNIVERSARY FOOTNOTES QUAKE; DISASTERS: 
ANAHEIM HILLS RESIDENTS ARE EDGY. TWO YEARS IN A ROW, MARTIN LUTHER KING'S 
BIRTHDAY ACCOMPANIES RAVAGES OF NATURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For Anaheim Hills residents, Monday's earthquake brought unsettling memories 
of Martin Luther King Day Jr. last year, when another natural disaster struck.  
</P>
<P>
 "What is it with this day?" asked Anaheim Hills resident Sally Fields. "First 
it was the landslide and now this." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the city's spokesman seemed troubled by the coincidence. "We're not 
looking forward to next year's," said Bret Colson. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Anaheim escaped from the quake relatively unscathed Monday, residents 
in the hills are still reeling from the landslide, which officially marks its 
one-year anniversary today. 
</P>
<P>
 The signs of chaos and destruction from the 25-acre slide are all but gone. 
Streets have been repaved, homes have been patched and, most important, the 
hillside has stopped moving. 
</P>
<P>
 But all is not normal in these scenic neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, life for many of the residents is still as uncertain as the ground 
they live on. They pray for clear skies, fret about watering their lawns too 
much and are acutely aware of every creak and crack in their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if we'll ever feel completely safe," said Gail Turner, who, like 
48 other homeowners, was evacuated after weeks of rain soaked the hills and 
reactivated an ancient landslide. "Every time you hear a creak you wonder, uh 
oh is it moving? . . . It's been a tough year." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the slide, three homes were declared unsafe to enter, six 
sustained major damage and more than two dozen others suffered minor to 
moderate damage. Turner, a mother of two, said she and her husband Jeff have 
tried to "put (the slide) in the back our minds" and remain optimistic. "As 
long as we have a roof over our heads, I feel OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the past 12 months have taken tremendous emotional and economic 
tolls on the Turners and others. Many complain that they are financial 
hostages, living in homes that they can't sell. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a nightmare," said Michael H. Clayton, who had barely moved into 
his $335,000 home on Rimwood Drive last year when catastrophe struck. A recent 
appraisal of his house, he said, put its value at $80,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still wake up in cold sweats in the middle of the night wondering what did 
I do to deserve this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the slide, Clayton planned to live in Anaheim Hills for about five 
years and retire to another area. Now, he said, "it looks like we're going to 
be stuck in this house for quite awhile." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Clayton considers himself luckier than some residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Several million-dollar homes in a cul-de-sac along Avenida de Santiago stand 
empty because the damage was too great or residents refused to risk living 
there. Three homes are still deemed uninhabitable by the city. Some residents 
have let banks foreclose rather than pay mortgages on devalued homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald M. Steiner decided to give his $1.1-million home on Avenida de Santiago 
to charity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really the same as a death in the family," said Steiner, who now lives 
in Mission Viejo. "If you leave the corpse you can get over it. But if it's 
with you all the time, it's a constant reminder of the pain. We just had to get 
out of there." 
</P>
<P>
 Like the residents, the city of Anaheim has felt the economic impact. More 
than $4 million in city money has been spent to study the problem, stabilize 
the hills and repair streets and pipes that were damaged when the ground moved 
as much as 14 inches in some areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Natalie Meeks, the city's civil engineer, said the city hopes to recoup about 
94% of those expenditures from the state and federal governments. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, she said, the city continues to spend money to operate more than 
100 pumps that still remove about 50,000 gallons of ground water from the 
hillsides each day. The water removal is the key to the city's plan for 
long-term stabilization of the hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, city officials announced that they were considering creating an 
assessment district in the hills, collecting fees from residents to help pay 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's right," Clayton said. "They want to make the victims, who 
have already lost so much, pay for more." 
</P>
<P>
 About 250 residents, including Steiner and Clayton, will file lawsuits today 
blaming the slide on city officials who allowed development in what residents 
contend was a known slide area. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney William Stoner, who is representing the majority of the residents, 
also contends that the Metropolitan Water District is partly to blame for the 
slide. He contends that one of the MWD's massive water pipelines leaked into 
the hillside, causing the dormant slide to reactivate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been very difficult for the homeowners to deal with the stress of living 
with a possible slide at any time," Stoner said. 
</P>
<P>
 MWD and city officials dispute the residents' claims. Mayor Tom Daly said he 
sympathizes, but believes the city has responded appropriately. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your heart goes out to them," Daly said. "But there is only so much that 
government can do. I think the city has made a good-faith effort to address the 
problem, especially when you consider how much public money has been directed 
toward fixing the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a problem that the city's civil engineer believes can eventually be 
solved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hopeful that we can develop a long-term mitigation plan that will keep 
it from moving," Meeks said. "But that plan will always have to be maintained 
and monitored. . . . It's a landslide."

EARTHQUAKE: DIASTER BEFORE DAWN; HEALERS RESPOND WITH MISSION OF MERCY; 
MEDICINE: DOCTORS, NURSES AND OTHERS FROM UCI MEDICAL CENTER RUSH TO THE AID OF 
OVERWHELMED GRANADA HILLS HOSPITAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dr. Antoine Kazzi, a professor of emergency room services for the UCI School 
of Medicine, returned last week from war-torn Bosnia, where he helped treat 
hundreds of wounded Moslems, Serbs and Croats. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, he was back on the front lines, tending to the wounds of victims of 
another kind. 
</P>
<P>
 Answering pleas for help from overrun Granada Hills Community Hospital, Kazzi 
led a group of 10 emergency room physicians, nurses and emergency medical 
technicians from UCI Medical Center in Orange on a mission of mercy. 
</P>
<P>
 "One disaster is like another disaster," said Kazzi as the group began its 
two-hour sojourn to the earthquake-ravaged San Fernando Valley. "We don't know 
what we'll expect. But I am sure we will be able to help them." 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, the mobile emergency room team loaded up a van with hand-held 
heartbeat regulators, syringes, sponges, morphine, tetanus boosters, 
sterilization chemicals, linens, ice packs, splints and other emergency room 
paraphernalia. Their goal: to fill in the cracks left by a harried and 
overworked hospital staff inundated by hundreds of injured residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the same kind of procedures when you are dealing with any emergency 
situation," Kazzi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, when the UCI crew got to Granada Hills Community Hospital, they found 
what looked like a war zone. Dozens of bloodied and frightened patients sat in 
hastily erected chairs and beds outside the small hospital. The remnants of a 
destroyed Kaiser Permanente administration building across the parking lot 
provided a vivid reminder of the nightmare many had just encountered. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the hospital, staffers rushed to mop up water, which flowed freely from 
a broken pipe to flood the emergency room corridor. Makeshift emergency rooms 
were set up in the lobby and in other treatment rooms on the first floor. The 
telephones were out, the water was turned off and there was no electrical power 
for most of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lost everything," said Richard Gold, chief executive officer of the small 
community hospital. Unshaven and wearing a T-shirt and sweat pants, Gold raced 
from ward to ward, directing medical assistance where needed. "But right now we 
seem to be doing rather well." 
</P>
<P>
 While others of the UCI team were led into the operating room, Dr. Mike Ritter 
quickly made his way into a darkened exercise room that was littered with 
roll-away beds. One the wall of the room, a clock read 4:31, the time the first 
temblor hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Ritter's first patient was Charles Harper, 67, who had broken his ankle when a 
heavy dresser toppled onto him. Nevertheless, he felt lucky. A fire that 
ravaged more than 50 mobile homes in Sylmar was brought under control just 
yards from his own twisted mobile home. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least I didn't lose my house," Harper said as Ritter, holding a 
flashlight, probed the patient's ankle and asked a series of questions before 
ordering a splint for the man. 
</P>
<P>
 Next to him, Kazzi treated a woman's foot that had been gouged during her 
escape from her ruined home. At another bed, Dr. Steven Cullen sewed up the 
hand of 19-year-old Susanne Dwyer of Granada Hills, who grimaced and panted 
with fear. "I feel it, I feel it," she protested as he inserted the sutures. 
</P>
<P>
 Several minutes later, the dark scene, which was punctuated by the eerie beams 
of flashlights, became all the more grave when a woman was wheeled in, crying 
and screaming in pain. It was then that Ritter met Dr. Robert Olvera, an Orange 
County Search and Rescue Team physician and head of the Costa Mesa branch of 
Irvine-based Bristol Park Medical Group Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Between the two of them, it was determined that the woman, an Ecuadorean named 
Yolanda, was probably suffering from a ruptured kidney. As Ritter and UCI nurse 
Meryle Olivier worked to insert needles into her arm and search for telltale 
signs of the extent of her injuries, Olvera soothed her in Spanish: " 
Tranquilo, senora. Tranquilo ," he said. Calm down. 
</P>
<P>
 Olvera was used to disaster situations: He had most recently spent 48 hours in 
Laguna Beach, treating fire victims during the October conflagration. "You 
really have to give back something to the community," Olvera said hours later  
</P>
<P>
 UCI nurse Kristine Dahlquist agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 She and others on the team had volunteered to receive disaster training 
earlier in the year under the County's Medical Disaster Response program. The 
program teaches medical personnel how to handle disaster situations in a way 
that is counter to hospital procedures.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is what we were trained for," she said. "It's a different concept 
entirely from what we do in a hospital."

EARTHQUAKE: DIASTER BEFORE DAWN; MARINES EVACUATE 5 INFANTS FROM NORTHRIDGE 
WARD; RESCUE: TWO EL TORO BASE HELICOPTERS ARE USED TO FLY THE BABIES FROM 
QUAKE-DAMAGED UNIT TO LOCAL HOSPITALS.

 A pair of combat helicopters from the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station flew to 
the rescue Monday when five infants from Northridge Hospital Medical Center had 
to be evacuated to Orange County because of earthquake damage to a neonatal 
ward. 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency teams from UCI Medical Center in Orange and Saddleback Memorial 
Medical Center in Laguna Hills accompanied the Marines during the hastily 
arranged midafternoon flights. 
</P>
<P>
 The babies were the last of 22 evacuated from the Northridge neonatal 
intensive care unit after Monday morning's 6.6 magnitude earthquake cracked the 
nursery and sent some incubators toppling over, some with newborns inside. Most 
of the other infants, none of whom were injured in the temblor, found room at 
hospitals in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Douglas Cunningham, neonatology director at Saddleback, said that when the 
emergency teams arrived at Northridge, they found the babies being watched over 
protectively by nurses who held them tightly with each aftershock. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found them wrapped in blankets and huddled together under a counter for 
safety in the hospital's emergency room," said Dr. Jack Sills, director of the 
neonatal intensive care unit at UCI Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 UCI officials said they worked all day to arrange the airlift, which departed 
about 2:30 p.m. Soon after the earthquake, all commercial helicopters large 
enough to accommodate portable incubators were already deployed to other 
rescues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone said, 'Why don't we call the Marines?' " Sills recalled. He said he 
was surprised at how quickly the request went up the military chain of command 
and was granted. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a first for us," said Capt. Chris Heid, one of the pilots who flew 
the two UH-1N Huey helicopters. "We haven't rescued babies before." 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the babies were taken to UCI Medical Center and three went to 
Saddleback. 
</P>
<P>
 Power was out at Northridge Hospital and the elevators were not working, Heid 
said, so the helicopters did not land on the hospital roof. Instead they landed 
in the parking lot of a Pic 'N' Save store next to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Before they whisked the babies away for the 30- to 40-minute helicopter 
flights, the medical teams left notes and maps behind for the children's 
parents. By the time the last helicopter landed at Saddleback at 5 p.m., some 
parents were already following in their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctors and nurses on the evacuation teams said the infants seemed to have 
no qualms about taking their first flight. They were peaceful despite the 
deafening noise of the rotor blades and the vibrations seemed to calm them. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of them slept the whole way," Cunningham said. "Others sucked on 
pacifiers. But when we landed and shut down the motors, they all woke up and 
cried vigorously."

EARTHQUAKE: DIASTER BEFORE DAWN; TOURISTS WILL TAKE HOME SOME ADDITIONAL 
MEMORIES 
</P>

 Mel and Sue Woods brought their two children to Disneyland this week for some 
well-deserved rest and relaxation. Earlier this month, brush fires burned 
within half a mile of their home in Sydney, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of finding calm, the family was jolted awake at 4:31 a.m. Monday 
by one of California's most destructive earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was horrible, scary," Sue Woods said. "I just couldn't believe we were 
experiencing an earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 The Woodses' feelings were shared by other tourists who came to Orange County 
for the famous amusement parks and beaches -- but ended up living through a 
natural disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never felt anything like it. I'm still rattled," said Margo Vickers, a 
33-year-old Seattle homemaker visiting her mother in Tustin. "The motion was 
amazing. I know people here are used to them. But to me, I could never get used 
to it. I could never live here." 
</P>
<P>
 For tourist Tania Avram, the quake brought back wretched memories of a 1977 
temblor that severely damaged her hometown of Bucharest, Romania. That 
7.2-magnitude quake killed 1,541 people and injured 11,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like reliving a nightmare," said Avram, who had shepherded her family 
down to the lobby from the Anaheim Hilton and Towers' 12th floor. Ninety 
minutes after the quake, she and husband Vasile were nibbling nervously on a 
muffin, while daughters Alicia, 5, and Ellie, 3, slept soundly on a couch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt trapped," said Tania Avram, whose family now lives in Melbourne, 
Australia. "We were on the 12th floor, 50 meters from the fire escape. There 
was no place to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Vasile Avram -- who left Romania before the 1977 quake -- said he was struck 
by how calm all of the Californians were. 
</P>
<P>
 "One guy came down the hall saying, 'Don't worry about it, it's not going to 
get any worse. Just go back to sleep,' " Vasile Avram said. 
</P>
<P>
 Louis Abros, a 29-year-old Oakland insurance adjuster, was on business in 
Irvine when the quake struck. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd really like to be out of here as soon as possible and be home with my 
family," Abros said. "I lived through the 1989 quake (in San Francisco) and it 
wasn't nice to go through it again. I just want to get home." 
</P>
<P>
 Others tourists, however, took the earthquake in stride. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's part of the L.A. experience," said John Lord, whose flight from John 
Wayne Airport to Tucson via Los Angeles was delayed because of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past week, Utah resident Kelly Morgan had been kidding her daughter's 
dance troupe that all of the jumping they had done during performances at 
Disneyland and Universal Studios was going to cause an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now everybody thinks I'm psychic," Morgan said. "I was just kidding."

EARTHQUAKE: DIASTER BEFORE DAWN; SCOREBOARD CRASHES ONTO SEATS IN ANAHEIM 
STADIUM; COLLAPSE: THE 17.5-TON SONY 'JUMBOTRON' ALSO DESTROYED A SECTION OF 
ROOF AS IT BROKE LOOSE AND FELL TO THE LEFT-FIELD UPPER DECK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A massive scoreboard above Anaheim Stadium's left-field stands collapsed 
during Monday's earthquake, crushing hundreds of seats and strewing metal 
debris over others. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sony "Jumbotron," about 800 square feet in area and weighing 17.5 tons, 
broke from its moorings atop the stadium's roof and landed in a partially 
upright position in the upper deck, taking a portion of the roof with it. Late 
Monday morning, the board was held precariously in place at a 45-degree angle 
by some of its beams. At least 800 seats were damaged or destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were lucky that we didn't have an event going on here," said city 
spokesman Brett Colson. The stadium was dark this past weekend but hosted 
several large events 10 days ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Two security guards were in the stadium at 4:31 a.m., but neither was hurt. No 
other portion of the stadium was damaged. The nearby Anaheim Arena was 
undamaged by the quake, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Damage to the stadium was estimated at $3 million to $4 million by city 
officials, who said the size of the deductible on the city's liability 
insurance may mean the loss will not be covered. 
</P>
<P>
 It also was unclear when repairs could be made, officials said, or if this 
weekend's motorcycle races at the stadium will be postponed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have contacted our engineering firm to have them do a technical evaluation 
of the stadium," said Assistant City Manager David Morgan. "Our goal is to be 
back in business as quickly as possible, but we will not reopen until we have 
done a complete analysis." 
</P>
<P>
 Stadium General Manager Greg Smith said he is "surprised" the scoreboard would 
collapse in an earthquake that caused only minor damage elsewhere in the 
immediate area. 
</P>
<P>
 The scoreboard was installed in 1988, replacing a smaller, older version. It 
provides color replays of game action as well as scores. It is in the section 
of the stadium that was added in 1979 to enlarge the facility for the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 If the structural loss is not covered by insurance, the impact could be 
catastrophic for the financially strapped city, officials said. The city 
already is forecasting an $8-million deficit in the next fiscal year, which 
begins July 1. The city budget this year is $135 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The $125-million stadium's earthquake insurance policy has a 5% deductible, 
which means it doesn't kick in until damage reaches $6.25 million, said City 
Risk Manager Thomas Vance. The city does not have a contingency fund for 
earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Earthquakes are so unpredictable -- another may not occur for one year or 100 
years -- that it would be difficult in these tough economic times to let the 
millions of dollars that would be needed for a contingency fund just sit," 
Vance said. 
</P>
<P>
 The scoreboard is also a prime advertising spot, bringing in a large portion 
of the $2 million in annual revenue paid by billboard advertisers in the 
stadium, officials said. The revenue is split among the city, an advertising 
agency, the Rams, Angels and Sony, which paid for the scoreboard.

PEDESTRIAN HIT BY CAR CRITICALLY INJURED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A pedestrian was critically injured Monday when he was hit by a car turning 
left at Commercial Way and Superior Avenue, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Jefferson Clark, 39, of Fountain Valley, was taken to Western Medical 
Center-Santa Ana after the 12:30 p.m. accident. 
</P>
<P>
 He was crossing the westbound lanes of Commercial Way when he was struck by a 
car driven by a 33-year-old Costa Mesa man who was turning from Superior 
Avenue, according to Lt. John FitzPatrick. Clark was hurled onto the hood of 
the car and then thrown onto the pavement. The driver of the car was not cited. 
Police are continuing to investigate.

3 TEEN-AGERS ARRESTED IN SHOOTING INCIDENT INVOLVING RIVAL GANGS 
</P>

 Three teen-age boys were arrested early Monday after rival gangs from 
Huntington Beach confronted each other and one of the youths opened fire with a 
handgun, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute started about 11:30 p.m. Sunday as the two gangs traveled in four 
cars on Bristol Street in Santa Ana, Newport Beach Police Sgt. Andy Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
 One gang followed the other into Costa Mesa, Gonis said. Somewhere between 
South Coast Plaza and Red Hill Avenue, a 16-year-old pulled a handgun and fired 
half a dozen shots into the two cars carrying rival gang members, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooter and his gang fled when they saw a police car near Jamboree Road, 
Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach police, with the help of Huntington Beach police, arrested a 
17-year-old and a 16-year-old at their homes in Huntington Beach several hours 
later, Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 11 a.m. Monday, Newport Beach and Costa Mesa officers arrested another 
16-year-old, who they believe was the shooter, in Huntington Beach, Gonis said. 
Investigators found a small-caliber handgun at his residence, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The three suspects, who were not identified because of their ages, were being 
held in Juvenile Hall on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon.THUAN LE

33 DIE, MANY HURT IN 6.6 QUAKE; L.A. AREA FREEWAYS BUCKLE, BUILDINGS TOPPLE; 
DISASTER: EPICENTER IS IN NORTHRIDGE, WHERE THREE-STORY APARTMENT COMPLEX 
PANCAKES. RUPTURED GAS LINES ERUPT IN FIRE IN STRONGEST TEMBLOR IN CITY'S 
MODERN HISTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A deadly magnitude 6.6 earthquake -- the strongest in modern Los Angeles 
history -- ripped through the pre-dawn darkness Monday, awakening Southern 
California with a violent convulsion that flattened freeways, sandwiched 
buildings, ruptured pipelines and left emergency crews searching desperately 
for bodies trapped under the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-second temblor, which was not the long-dreaded Big One but erupted so 
fiercely that it initially seemed every bit as intense, was blamed for at least 
33 deaths -- nearly half of which occurred when a three-floor apartment complex 
near the epicenter in Northridge collapsed into two stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Triggered by a fault that squeezed the northern San Fernando Valley between 
two mountain ranges like a vise, the 4:31 a.m. earthquake swamped hospitals 
with hundreds of injured victims and left thousands more homeless as fires, 
floods and landslides dotted a landscape that has been visited by destruction 
with disturbing regularity. 
</P>
<P>
 The major developments: 
</P>
<P>
 * The death toll continued to grow throughout the day. Fifteen bodies were 
discovered under the rubble of what had been the Northridge Meadows apartments. 
Other victims of the quake included a Los Angeles police officer who drove his 
motorcycle off a sheared-off freeway, a Skid Row resident who may have hurled 
himself out the sixth-floor window of a Downtown hotel and a Rancho Cucamonga 
mother who slipped on a toy as she raced to check on her child, striking her 
head on the crib. 
</P>
<P>
 * In a painstaking rescue, firefighters worked more than seven hours to save a 
critically injured maintenance worker who was trapped under 20 tons of concrete 
that crumbled at the Northridge Fashion Center's parking structure. 
</P>
<P>
 * Highways across Los Angeles County buckled and crumpled, wiping out major 
commuter thoroughfares and ensuring that life in this car-dependent region will 
be disrupted for months. Hardest hit was the Santa Monica Freeway, the nation's 
busiest, which caved in at the overcrossing of La Cienega Boulevard, and the 
Antelope Valley Freeway, which collapsed at its junction with the Golden State 
Freeway in the Newhall pass. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ruptured gas lines and propane tanks sent fiery balls bursting through 
asphalt roads, engulfing up to 100 mobile homes at three San Fernando Valley 
trailer parks. Meanwhile, a broken water main on Balboa Boulevard shattered 100 
square feet of pavement, turning the street into a geyser. 
</P>
<P>
 * The temblor, felt as far as Oregon and the Mexican border, left tens of 
thousands of residents without power, gas or phone service. In the historic 
Ventura County community of Fillmore, where brick facades had undergone 
extensive earthquake renovation in recent years, virtually every downtown 
business was damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 * Late in the day, Mayor Richard Riordan initiated a citywide curfew, making 
it illegal for people to remain on the streets between dusk and dawn. President 
Clinton pledged immediate federal assistance while the National Guard was 
mobilized to prevent looting in blacked-out neighborhoods. Gov. Pete Wison, 
touring the area in a helicopter, said: "You begin to wonder how much Angelenos 
are expected to take." 
</P>
<P>
 * Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi, touring areas hit hardest by the 
earthquake, predicted that local authorities will proclaim many older 
apartments uninhabitable. He said thousands or tens of thousands of Los Angeles 
residents may be made homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Had the quake not struck on a holiday, or if it had begun a few hours later, 
seismologists fear, the damage would have been far more devastating. Even so, 
Southern California seemed to shudder to a terrifying halt Monday, a day of 
frantic waiting, dramatic rescues, empty highways and fraying nerves. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a 6.5 on the 'Richter scale,' but a 10 on my fear scale," said Nick 
Stevens, 40, an Australian tourist staying at the Hollywood Downtowner Motel. 
"We had been planning to go to Universal Studios, where they have the 
earthquake ride. Now we won't have to bother." 'It Was Unreal' 
</P>
<P>
 Across the smoky expanses near the quake's epicenter, the scene was nearly 
apocalyptic. Buildings were left in crumpled heaps. Balls of fire tore through 
mobile home parks. Geysers gushed out of asphalt streets. For the first time in 
Los Angeles' history, officials said, all the city's lights went out at once. 
</P>
<P>
 After touring his northwest Valley district, which suffered some of the most 
severe damage, Councilman Hal Bernson said: "If you saw Northridge Fashion 
Center or Balboa Boulevard, you'd think you were in Beirut." 
</P>
<P>
 At least six people fell victim to quake-induced heart attacks. The rest were 
killed by the temblor and the chaos it induced. A 25-year-old Sherman Oaks man 
was electrocuted, a 92-year-old Northridge woman died when her trailer burned, 
a 4-year-old child was crushed by the wreckage of her collapsing home and a 
veteran LAPD traffic officer plummeted from a freeway overpass when his 
motorcycle skidded out of control on a buckled swath of the Antelope Valley 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "His lights were still flashing and he just came tumbling down," said Andy 
Jimenez, 33, of Santa Clarita, who watched as Officer Clarence Wayne Dean, 46, 
plunged off the end of a destroyed bridge to the pavement 30 feet below. "It 
was unreal." 
</P>
<P>
 The quake struck with such sudden force that many residents stumbled around 
dazed in the darkness, groping for shoes, eyeglasses, a flashlight. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Park Regency apartment complex in Canoga Park, a two-story apartment 
building collapsed and crushed a row of 20 cars parked underneath. Rita 
Cuezada, 20, and her 5-month-old daughter fell through their second-floor 
apartment to a vacant unit below. 
</P>
<P>
 "My body weight fell on her three or four times," Cuezada said. "I thought she 
was going to die. I was just praying to God. I thought I was just going to be 
holding her dead body when it was over." 
</P>
<P>
 In some areas, the earthquake set off a series of other destructive disasters, 
bursting water mains, touching off fires and sending rocks and mud sliding. 
</P>
<P>
 Near Chatsworth, a Southern Pacific train derailed and one of 16 cars carrying 
sulfuric acid spilled its load. Los Angeles International Airport was forced to 
temporarily suspend flights. Mobile home parks, with their lightweight 
construction and often-crowded layouts, proved particularly vulnerable to 
fires. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Tahitian Mobile Park in Sylmar, firefighters watched helplessly as 65 
mobile homes went up in flames. Gilbert Neuvenhein was jarred from his sleep by 
the earthquake and watched helplessly as fires crept near his trailer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I woke up. There was a rumbling. The next thing I knew I was trying to reach 
the door," he said. "I was frantically trying to open it, but it was stuck. I 
didn't have my glasses and I was practically blind without them." 
</P>
<P>
 As flames engulfed the trailers, ammunition stored in one of them began to 
explode. "I had never seen such a war zone," said Keith Bedard, a 32-year-old 
communication technician. 
</P>
<P>
 All along Ventura Boulevard, meanwhile, firefighters and Southern California 
Gas Co. workers were hurrying to plug leaky gas mains. About 7 a.m. a fire crew 
saw a major leak at Ventura Boulevard and Laurel Grove and urged bystanders to 
move on: "You'll be toast if this thing goes up," a firefighter said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Pacoima, thousands of gallons of crude oil spilled into Wolfskill Street 
east of Laurel Canyon Boulevard when a 10-inch pipeline burst. Soon after, the 
oil ignited, sending parallel walls of flame racing down the block. The flames 
consumed two houses and at least 10 cars and scorched dozens of trees along the 
street. Residents frantically used garden hoses to spray down cars and shake 
roofs. Several rooftops were burned. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just looked like an inferno," resident Luisa Grimaldo said. "It came just 
shoosh down both sides. It all just exploded." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the worst damage was in the Valley, other communities were also 
struggling to dig out from the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Santa Monica Freeway, seven massive pillars that suspended the freeway 
over Fairfax Avenue collapsed. The concrete cylinders broke into pieces ranging 
in size from boulder-like chunks to grains of sand. Their iron reinforcing bars 
loomed like immense, distended bird cages. 
</P>
<P>
 Several buildings in Santa Monica collapsed, others suffered major damage and 
12 fires and dozens of gas leaks were reported. In all, 75 buildings were 
deemed unsafe for habitation by midafternoon -- including two large hotels, the 
Pacific Shores and Holiday Inn Bayview Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Ignoring the yellow "caution" tape ringing the Sea Castle, a large 70-year-old 
waterfront apartment building, residents scurried back and forth into the 
structure to grab whatever belongings they could carry. By 9 a.m the parking 
lot looked ready for a garage sale as residents tried to cram television sets, 
microwave ovens and mattresses into their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 At Angelo Drive and Mossy Rock Circle on the Westside, the Cooper family sat 
on their front lawn with their children, Harrison, 4, and Jennifer, 1, as they 
made plans to go to a hotel. The vigorous shaking had caused the front of their 
house to collapse. As the quake hit, Michelle Cooper rushed in to pick her 
daughter up from her crib, where she discovered the baby had stopped breathing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'She's dead, she's dead," Cooper said. "My husband revived her with 
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. He said she had something called fright reaction. 
Usually, I'm OK after an earthquake, but I was shaking because I thought she 
was dead." 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, the cities of Simi Valley and Fillmore suffered the most 
serious damage. 
</P>
<P>
 At one Fillmore variety store, mannequins were thrown through a plate-glass 
window and landed in a gruesome pile on the sidewalk. At the Central Market, 
owner Harnek Sing Behniwal stared at the broken windows, fallen beams and 
strewn groceries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't know what to do," he said. "This store was a diamond." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials were particularly upset because the area had recently undergone 
extensive renovation. "Just when we've rebuilt it, we've had to declare it a 
disaster area," Fillmore City Manager Roy Payne said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, across the street from Simi Valley Adventist Hospital, Ted N. 
Chaffee,a dentist, was perturbed by the earthquake's seemingly precise aim. 
Only one of his office windows shattered -- the one above his his most 
expensive piece of equipment, a $50,000 dental imaging system. 'Come Down and 
Pray' 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Los Angeles, there were tales of courage -- of strangers helping 
strangers because, as one man said, "it seemed like the right thing to do." By 
day's end, many people owed their lives to that spirit. And many more had been 
touched by it, as they watched the progress of several daring rescue missions 
live on television. 
</P>
<P>
 Salvador Pena's story was one of the hopeful ones -- a testament to the power 
of hard work, teamwork and spiritual faith. 
</P>
<P>
 Caught during his pre-dawn shift driving a street sweeper along the bottom 
floor of a three-tier parking garage at the Northridge Fashion Center, Pena 
talked with rescue workers for more than seven hours as they blasted through 
slabs of concrete to extricate him. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters had little trouble locating him because of his loud cries for 
help, which they could hear even through the mountain of rubble. To reach Pena, 
rescue workers used jackhammers to drill through two layers of concrete. Then 
they inserted air bags and wooden blocks to lift a concrete beam off his limbs, 
giving him oxygen as they worked. Once they cut him out of his vehicle, they 
carried him on a backboard through eight feet of rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the ordeal, paramedics remained at Pena's side beneath the parking 
deck. "He was in a lot of pain and he kept saying, 'Come down and pray with me, 
come down and pray," said Rey Lavalle, a Los Angeles city firefighter, who 
spoke with Pena in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 When a helicopter finally airlifted Pena from the busy mall's rubble-strewn 
parking lot and headed to UCLA Medical Center, onlookers cheered and applauded. 
Late Monday, he was in serious condition with crushed legs and a partially 
dislocated spine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I almost cried -- I was elated, we all were," Capt. Jim Vandell of the Los 
Angeles City Fire Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, at the Northridge Meadows apartments, firefighters and urban search 
and rescue squads hunted frantically for survivors of the collapse that took 
more lives than any other. The three-story complex had folded in on itself, 
pulverizing many of the first-floor units. All day, rescuers worked tirelessly. 
</P>
<P>
 They were right to hope. At one point, as firefighters tramped through the 
demolished building pounding on floors and calling out to survivors, they heard 
a man cry out. 
</P>
<P>
 Using diamond-bladed saws to chew through concrete and wood, they finally 
reached the collapsed first floor that had become a tomb. Alan Hemsath, 37, 
"was just face down -- pinned by the whole building," rescue worker Doug Rogers 
said. But 90 minutes later, Hemsath -- conscious and in stable condition -- was 
freed, prompting applause from onlookers and journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 The search continued until nightfall, with rescue workers utilizing sonar 
equipment sensitive enough to detect even the shallowest breath amid the 
rubble. Those who had died were left inside the building so rescuers could 
concentrate on extricating survivors. 'A Tidal Wave' of Injuries 
</P>
<P>
 The quake took its toll on the young and old, hundreds of whom flooded 
emergency rooms with maladies ranging from cuts and bruises to heart attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen heart attacks, dislocated bones, lacerations. A lot of blood," 
said Toni Regalado, an emergency room admissions officer at Holy Cross Medical 
Center in Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center was receiving "a tidal wave of 
walking wounded," spokesman Ron Wise said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital officials said most of the injuries were caused by people scrambling 
to protect themselves after the quake struck. Health workers said many cuts, 
bruises and broken bones resulted when people, in their need to find safety, 
fell, cut themselves on broken glass, or ran into something in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
 In some hospitals, doctors and nurses moved past fallen plaster and broken 
windows to practice their trade in near-battlefield conditions. Broken water 
pipes flooded floors, backup generators took over during electrical outages. 
Ham radios covered for dead telephones. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in Valencia treated more than 300 people, 
mostly for cuts and broken bones. The hospital was so jammed that some patients 
had to wait for up to four hours. People were being stitched up on stretchers 
in the hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctors at Henry Mayo were slightly red-eyed. Iodine was on the floor, 
spilled off wounds where it had been liberally applied. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are running on adrenaline," said Henry Mayo Administrator Duffy 
Watson. "We are overwhelmed. We need to get our staff rested." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Granada Hills Community Hospital, doctors, nurses and volunteers 
operated a makeshift emergency room in the shadow of the Kaiser Permanente 
clinic and office building which collapsed next door. 
</P>
<P>
 With heads bandaged and blackened blotted blood dried around their cuts, quake 
victims sat in the sun waiting. Meanwhile, a cadre of workers applied temporary 
bandages and tried to ease their pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Wills, 23, of Canoga Park was among those waiting. He suffered a deep 
cut on his shoulder climbing out his first-floor apartment window. "I jumped 
out and started running down the street. . . . I definitely panicked," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 An unprecedented 600 to 700 patients were evacuated from earthquake-damaged 
hospitals. Metropolitan Transportation Authority buses and helicopters were 
pressed into duty to shuttle patients out of the crippled hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest evacuation occurred at Olive View Medical Center, where all the 
patients in the 377-bed hospital were transferred because of serious water 
damage, gas leaks and power outages. The hospital was built on the same site 
where another county hospital was destroyed in the 1971 Sylmar earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of other hospitals in the area also suffered enough damage to force 
evacuations or to prompt officials to move patients in large numbers from one 
floor to another. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the hospitals forced to close were Holy Cross Hospital Medical Center in 
Sylmar and the Sepulveda Veterans Administration Hospital in North Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was not all tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 A Torrance woman was in the final moments of giving birth early Monday when 
her room at Torrance Memorial Medical Center began shaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Wendy Gonzales, 37, gripped her husband's hand hard as the walls shook, 
medical supplies clattered to the floor and her daughter's head began to emerge 
from the birth canal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all happened at the same time," said her husband, Eddie Gonzales, 35. 
"Everything started shaking, things started falling. . . . I heard a lot of 
rattling going on, and a lot of screaming." 
</P>
<P>
 Courtney Gonzales, 7 pounds, 6 1/2 ounces, was born at Torrance Memorial 
Medical Center at 4:45 a.m. 'Holding My Heart' 
</P>
<P>
 Farther from the epicenter, where the shaking was less severe, emotional 
trauma eclipsed physical danger. The quake left people disoriented, bewildered 
and, in the case of one young man, literally dazed. 
</P>
<P>
 John Bryce, 16, was hit in the head by a 32-inch television as he slept on the 
floor of a friend's Simi Valley home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just fell on my head and knocked me out," Bryce said as he waited for a 
gash above his nose to be stitched. "When I woke up, there was a television in 
my lap." 
</P>
<P>
 But with humor, creativity and a little homespun philosophy, people set about 
trying to cope. Life would go on, they said. And maybe next time they'd be a 
little better prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never liked the bathroom anyway," said a 38-year-old Sherman Oaks banker 
after a neighbor's chimney toppled into his bidet. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Lalanne, a 32-year-old bartender in Malibu, is now calling his apartment 
on Las Flores Canyon Road simply "the disaster capital of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 "My whole apartment building was doing the hula," he said, demonstrating with 
his hand the undulating motion he saw and felt. His biggest complaint, however, 
was gastronomical, not geological. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm dying for a cup of coffee, man, and there's none to be had," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people sought comfort in numbers. In Santa Monica, residents transformed 
the median of San Vicente Boulevard from its usual function -- a jogging path 
-- to a makeshift meeting place and parking lot. From 7th Street to the ocean, 
the grassy strip resembled a pre-dawn block party as apartment dwellers -- some 
still in robes, others wrapped in blankets -- gathered to compare jolt notes. 
Fearful that underground garages would collapse, some people left their cars in 
the median as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Necessity also brought people together. In Malibu, people waited in line to 
buy bottled water, Rice Krispies, London broil -- whatever was available. In 
eastern Ventura County, lines at hardware and general supply stores stretched 
out the door as jittery residents stocked up on flashlights, batteries, and 
repair materials for broken pipes and generators. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone came by my house and said Sears was open, and it's a good thing," 
Dirk White, 36, a Thousand Oaks resident, said as he waited to buy repair 
materials at Sears department store. "My hot water heater busted. Where (else) 
do you get parts for that at a time like this?" 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Tang of Camarillo was standing in a similarly lengthy line to buy a 
better radio than the small transistor model she had at home. The earthquake 
had scared her, she said, and had taught her a lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took me three hours to calm down," Tang said. "I need to be prepared. It 
took an earthquake like this to finally admit it. I was holding onto my heart." 
Sleeping Under the Stars 
</P>
<P>
 Haunted by memories of what the previous night had brought, a nervous city 
greeted Monday's sunset with one eye open. As the ground rolled and rocked with 
aftershocks -- 86 of them in the first 17 hours after the quake -- it was 
difficult to believe the truth: that the worst was most likely over. 
</P>
<P>
 Floods, fires, riots -- Los Angeles had survived them all. But this felt more 
fundamentally unsettling than anything that had come before. So, while curfews 
were put in place to make neighborhoods relatively free from crime, no one was 
taking their safety for granted. 
</P>
<P>
 Long before nightfall, the displaced and the distressed flocked to shelters or 
the streets, planning to sleep on gymnasium floors or back seats of family 
sedans. Many simply camped out in their yards. 
</P>
<P>
 In Koreatown and Pico-Union, where many residents spent the day on porches and 
lawns, there were no plans to return indoors after dark. "We're going to sleep 
outside tonight," said Pilar Canela, 10, who lives with his family in a 
Koreatown apartment. "It's kind of dangerous to do that, but we're more scared 
of another earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Santa Clarita Valley, about 150 people gathered on the green cots at a 
Red Cross evacuation center set up in the gloomy, unlighted gymnasium of Henry 
Newhall Park. Most had been evacuated from the Orchard Arms Senior Complex, a 
residential development that developed a gas leak. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, the scene was almost festive as about 500 Latino families set up camp 
with tents and barbecues. Ricardo Provincia, 23, set up three tents to house 
the 14 members of his extended family through the night. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are cracks all over our apartment, which is on the second story," 
Provincia said. "It's scary in there. We thought we'd be a lot safer here, 
tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 For some, like Poppy Weisberg, sleep would be difficult anywhere. Weisberg, 
79, was among 150 people who sought shelter at Sylmar High School, where the 
Red Cross had set up a shelter. She sat in a flowered nightgown on a borrowed 
cot and recounted how she had come to be there. 
</P>
<P>
 Weisberg had narrowly escaped injury when her mobile home in the Los Olivos 
mobile home park burned. If not for her neighbors, who pulled her through her 
mobile home's front door, she might not have survived, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could hear the gas and I kept yelling, 'Turn off my gas!' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was too late. After her mobile home and others went up in flames, she 
returned to see what was left. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took a lot for me to go back and see what the damage was," she said, 
choking back tears. Quake Coverage

COMMUTERS WILL FACE NIGHTMARE FOR MONTHS; TRANSPORTATION: SEVERAL FREEWAY 
SECTIONS ARE SHUT. GOLDEN STATE, SANTA MONICA ROUTES ARE HEAVILY DAMAGED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The 10-second earthquake that rocked Southern California early Monday will 
create a commuting nightmare for months to come, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Portions of one local highway and six freeways -- including the Golden State 
and the Santa Monica -- were closed after the quake flattened overpasses and 
buckled swaths of asphalt. The two major routes out of the Santa Clarita Valley 
were severely damaged, virtually isolating the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials said they are uncertain how long the roads will remain 
closed. But they estimated that some sections will be shut for 12 to 18 months, 
including a stretch of the Santa Monica Freeway, the nation's busiest highway. 
That closure will force the detour of about 300,000 cars a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got some major problems -- people are going to be using city streets 
for a period of time," said Ken Nelson, a deputy district director of the local 
Caltrans office. "It is certainly not going to be business as usual. . . . 
People are going to have to use alternative modes of transportation for a long 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Do not drive today, officials advised, unless you must. For those with no 
alternative, allow extra time for your commute, take a detailed map and listen 
to the radio because aftershocks may cause more closures. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's earthquake collapsed a bridge on the Golden State Freeway near Sylmar 
and ruptured a part of the Antelope Valley Freeway (California 14) -- the main 
roads between Los Angeles and the Santa Clarita Valley, a suburb of about 
130,000 people. Many, if not most of the residents of this growing area on the 
edge of the desert work in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The major route now linking the two communities is four-lane Sierra Highway. 
The California Highway Patrol began escorting motorists along a five-mile 
stretch of the road Monday afternoon, between the Old Road and San Fernando 
Road. That service will continue until congestion is alleviated, said CHP Sgt. 
Ernie Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
 "This valley, in a disaster, is isolated -- all 130,000 of us," said Gail Fox, 
spokeswoman for the city of Santa Clarita. "And what will happen with 
commuters? I don't even want to think about that. There's all of our commuters, 
plus the others from the 150,000 people living in the Antelope Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan asked City Councilman Richard Alatorre, 
chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, to seek ways to add 
extra bus lines to help move commuters around the closed freeways. But no 
decisions were made about this proposal by Monday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan said the closure of the Golden State Freeway poses special problems 
because there are no reasonable alternate routes. He said one possibility is to 
permit commuters to park their cars on the collapsed freeway and walk to nearby 
buses that could ferry them to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We might need to borrow buses from other jurisdictions," Riordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Across Los Angeles, motorists braced for what they feared could be a 
staggering commute. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be tough," said Jeff Peltola, a Valencia resident and 
mechanical engineer for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. "I'm 
sure if I leave at 5:30 a.m. it will be easier, but it's going to be tough 
coming home too." 
</P>
<P>
 Brent White said his usual commute is 45 minutes each way between Santa 
Clarita and his job as a computer programmer in Woodland Hills. If driving 
during rush hour is too taxing, White said he might take more dramatic steps. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I'll talk to my boss and work a staggered shift, come in at noon, work 
until 8 or 9 in the evening," he said. "That actually is a possibility." 
</P>
<P>
 While White does not consider public transportation an option, it will be for 
many others. 
</P>
<P>
 With only a few exceptions in areas nearest the quake epicenter, MTA bus 
service was not disrupted Monday -- and is expected to run on its full schedule 
today. On the 22-mile Blue Line, between Long Beach to Downtown Los Angeles, 
service was slowed or halted for about six hours. Full service, at 12-minute 
intervals, was restored by midmorning Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Amtrak and Metrolink trains, the above-ground commuter lines that feed 
into Union Station, were canceled Monday. Pending inspection of about 300 miles 
of track, Metrolink and Amtrak trains may resume regular service this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink plans to operate its Santa Clarita line, which runs between Santa 
Clarita and Union Station via Burbank and Glendale, as well as its San Juan 
Capistrano-Los Angeles trains. Spokesman Peter Hildago, however, said officials 
do not plan today to run trains to Chatsworth, Simi Valley and Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink will add cars to the Santa Clarita line, Hidalgo said, and will 
honor transit passes from Antelope Valley and Santa Clarita bus lines, at least 
until Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with the Los Angeles Department of Transportation and the CHP 
devised several recommended detours for beleaguered commuters: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Santa Monica Freeway (I-10) is closed between Centinela Avenue and La 
Brea Avenue because three overpasses crumbled, causing enormous slabs to move. 
Westbound traffic should head north at La Brea to Pico Boulevard, and west to 
Sepulveda Boulevard to reach the San Diego Freeway -- or continue west on Pico 
to Centinela to return to the Santa Monica Freeway. Also, Washington Boulevard 
and Adams Boulevard may be used as alternate detour routes. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastbound traffic will be diverted at Centinela, directed east on Pico to La 
Brea to return to the Santa Monica Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Golden State Freeway (I-5) is closed between Lyons Avenue and Roxford 
Street. Southbound traffic will be diverted at Lyons, directed east to San 
Fernando Road, south to Sierra Highway, under the I-5 and California 14 
interchange, south on San Fernando Road and Sepulveda Boulevard to return to 
Golden State at Roxford Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Northbound traffic will be diverted at Roxford, routed east to San Fernando 
Road, north to Sierra Highway, west to Lyons to return to Golden State Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Simi Valley Freeway (California 118) is closed between Tampa Avenue and 
the Foothill Freeway. Eastbound traffic will be diverted at Tampa Avenue, 
directed south to Devonshire Street, south on Arleta Avenue, east on Van Nuys 
Boulevard to return to the Foothill Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Westbound traffic will use Van Nuys Boulevard, north on Arleta Avenue, west on 
Devonshire Street, continue to Hayvenhurst Avenue, north to the Simi Valley 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a list of other closures: 
</P>
<P>
 * The northbound San Diego Freeway is closed at Devonshire because of freeway 
buckling. Southbound lanes are closed at Rinaldi Street. 
</P>
<P>
 * The southbound Antelope Valley Freeway is closed at San Fernando Road 
(before the I-5 interchange) because of structural damage.

THRUST FAULTS POSE BRUTAL DANGER TO BASIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LEE HOTZ and KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The earthquake that convulsed the San Fernando Valley early Monday 
demonstrated as brutally as possible the danger posed by a complex web of 
deeply buried thrust faults underlying the Los Angeles Basin. 
</P>
<P>
 Seismologists said Monday that dozens of such faults underlay the basin, many 
unmapped and unknown until they abruptly announce their presence with a 
powerful shudder. Although they may lack the capacity to generate the 
devastating force of the Big One, these faults can cause severe injury and 
widespread property damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many (faults) that can produce stress of this magnitude," said 
Hiroo Kanamori, director of the Caltech Seismological Laboratory. "We have to 
be prepared for this sort of thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's 6.6 quake, the strongest in the basin's modern history, was powerful 
enough to raise parts of Northridge, the Northridge hills and the Santa Susana 
Mountains "a foot or two," while areas of the northeast Valley south of the 
city of San Fernando slumped an equal amount, said Lucille M. Jones, a 
seismologist at the Pasadena field office of the U.S. Geological Survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Movement on the fault may have been as much as two yards on each side, several 
seismologists said. 
</P>
<P>
 Any of the other short, thrust faults hidden under the basin could produce the 
same kind of strong, jarring upward motion. A thrust fault, unlike the more 
common horizontal strike-slip fault, moves vertically. 
</P>
<P>
 Within hours of the frightening, early morning jolt, scientists from around 
the state headed for Southern California to study the Northridge earthquake, 
and portable seismographs were installed through the quake area. 
</P>
<P>
 As they carefully evaluated their seismic charts and the results of 
preliminary aerial surveys, scientists started to construct a rational frame of 
facts and measurements around Monday morning's long seconds of tumult. 
</P>
<P>
 By late afternoon, scientists had yet to determine which fault was responsible 
for the damage. They hoped that the pattern of aftershocks would help them 
locate it more precisely and give a clearer insight into the stresses that 
underpin the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's quake lasted no more than 10 seconds at its source, with up to an 
additional 20 seconds of reverberations elsewhere. That was followed by more 
than 86 noticeable aftershocks, including three of at least 5.0 in magnitude by 
Monday night. The strongest was a 5.3 jolt. 
</P>
<P>
 Aftershocks are expected to continue with some decreasing frequency through 
the coming months, scientists said. The chance of an aftershock of more than 
5.5 in magnitude in the weeks ahead is 1-in-4; and for an aftershock of 6.0 or 
more in the coming year is 1-in-10, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fault is still uncertain," said Pat Jorgenson, spokeswoman for the 
Geological Survey office in Menlo Park. "Anybody who's going on a limb and 
identifying a fault is not being cautious." 
</P>
<P>
 The quake occurred on what Jones, Kate Hutton of Caltech and other scientists 
initially said was an unnamed, virtually unknown fault on a plane shallowly 
dipping toward the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 They believe that the fault probably intersects with the Elysian Park Fault 
belt, which extends about 50 miles from Whittier all the way to the ocean near 
Point Dume. That fault generated the powerful Whittier Narrows thrust quake of 
Oct. 1, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 But one of Caltech's most prominent seismologists, Kerry Sieh, said late 
Monday afternoon that there is at least a chance that the quake occurred on the 
Elysian Park Fault itself. The fault intersects with two others near Reseda and 
Roscoe boulevards, about a mile south of Cal State Northridge, which was 
severely damaged Monday. Those two faults, called the Devonshire and the Frew, 
had been mapped years ago by oil company geologists. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake could have begun on any of the three, Sieh said. Not until the 
aftershock pattern is further studied will scientists know which. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones and Hutton noted that almost all of the aftershocks occurred well north 
of the Elysian Park Fault (sometimes also known as the Santa Monica Mountain 
Thrust Fault). The two scientists continued to favor one of the lateral faults, 
probably the Frew. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Mori, director of the Pasadena field office of the USGS, said the quake 
was on "an east-west trending thrust fault with the aftershocks to the north." 
Based on this, he said the Elysian Park Fault was not directly involved. A 
helicopter flight by Sieh and another Caltech seismologist, James Dolan, Monday 
morning showed no indication of a ground rupture from the quake. This was also 
the case with the magnitude 5.9 Whittier Narrows temblor and is the trademark 
of a deeply buried fault. 
</P>
<P>
 After Whittier Narrows, some scientists said the quake danger in the Los 
Angeles Basin had been underestimated. There may have been some past quakes 
that were unknown, they explained, because they did not break the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Seismologists at Caltech and the USGS said they were certain that the 
Northridge quake was not a foreshock of a great quake on the San Andreas Fault, 
at least 25 miles away. The quake was believed to have done nothing to relieve 
pressure on the San Andreas, but did nothing to add to it either, earthquake 
experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Henyey, director of the Southern California Earthquake Center at USC, met 
with USGS scientists in Pasadena to develop a request for federal funds to 
study the temblor, a USC spokesman said. Destruction From Below 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake that snapped Southland homes and highways like plastic toys is 
thought to have been triggered by one of three faults some nine miles beneath 
the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 The Facts 
</P>
<P>
 Time: 4:31 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Magnitude: 6.6, with aftershocks above 4.5 
</P>
<P>
 Duration: approximately 30 seconds 
</P>
<P>
 Epicenter: San Fernando Valley, one mile south of Cal State Northridge 
</P>
<P>
 Moving mountains: Monday's quake pushed the Santa Monica and San Gabriel 
mountain ranges higher and closer together, making the San Fernando Valley 
slightly narrower. Geologists will determine the extent of the movement within 
the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
 Impact on San Andreas: The quake is said to have done nothing to relieve 
pressure or trigger activity along the nearby San Andreas Fault. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranking the Big Ones 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how the Northridge quake compares to other major quakes in California 
and Mexico: 1906 San Francisco: 8.3 1985 Mexico City: 8.1 1992 Landers: 7.6 
1989 Loma Prieta (San Francisco): 7.1 1992 Big Bear: 6.7 1971 Sylmar: 6.4 * 
</P>
<P>
 Quake's Starting Point 
</P>
<P>
 Believed to have occurred along one of three faults that run, like spokes of a 
wheel, from the epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Elysian Park fold and thrust belt is believed to be part of a network of 
deep-seated faults. The Elysian Park system produced the 5.9 Whittier Narrows 
quake in 1987.

 Curled up like a frightened baby, Elsie Thull lay on the floor of an elevator 
in the 21-story New Otani Hotel in Downtown Los Angeles and prayed. Everything 
was black, except for the incessant blinking of the floor numbers, and the 
contraption was rattling in the throes of an earthquake that was about to bring 
the region to its knees. 
</P>
<P>
 She was trapped. 
</P>
<P>
 She fumbled for the emergency telephone. Hotel officials put her husband, Ted, 
on the line. In quiet tones, the retired airline pilot tried to calm his wife, 
hoping to reassure her, failing miserably. "Ted!" she cried. "Get me out of 
here! Get me out of here!" 
</P>
<P>
 Elsie Thull's terror -- 10 seconds of sheer panic shared by millions -- 
stretched to nearly an hour before help arrived. And the 56-year-old Ohio 
woman, who had escaped the freezing cold that gripped much of the nation for a 
weekend trip to Southern California's famed winter warmth, was left with an 
impression unlikely to change. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like Los Angeles," she declared once she was out. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a joke going around the region these days, ever since the wildfires 
of this past fall: Los Angeles has four seasons -- fire, flood, earthquake and 
drought. It is black humor, but on Monday it wasn't so funny anymore. People 
are tired, here in sunny Southern California. Nature has provided a land of 
great beauty but a land that can be cruel as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Nerves are frayed and jangled. Residents are frightened of the roar of an 
Earth that shifts without warning underneath them and of things that crash in 
the night in houses far removed from Ground Zero. People are worried about what 
is coming next. And Monday's 6.6 shaker, which leveled freeways, touched off at 
least 30 fires and claimed more than 30 lives, wasn't even the Big One. For 
many, that is the scariest notion of all. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Tax Assessor Kenneth Hahn told a radio announcer, only half 
in jest, that he is now waiting for "a plague of locusts." Said Gov. Pete 
Wilson, looking down on the devastation from a helicopter: "You begin to wonder 
how much Angelenos are expected to take." 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't know if it's worth it anymore," sighed David Whitener, a 
30-year-old court reporter as he tried, in vain, to buy coffee at a McDonald's 
on La Brea Avenue that had no hot food and no hot water. "I just don't know if 
it's worth it, with the economic situation here and the fires and earthquakes, 
and. . . ," Whitener paused for a moment. "What else bad happens here?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Riots," answered his companion, Jimmy Grape. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, riots," Whitener repeated wearily. "On the news, they've been telling us 
that this will be a test of our preparedness. Is this a precursor to the Big 
One that will come any minute?" 
</P>
<P>
 Radios crackled all day, the sign of a true disaster. There were 
pronouncements from politicians, advisories from the agencies that bring the 
city its water and power and gas, declarations of disaster zones and the like. 
There was talk from seismologists, news conferences laced with all-too-familiar 
earthquake jargon of "transportation arteries" and "crumbling infrastructures" 
and "damage assessment surveys." 
</P>
<P>
 This took care of the immediate need, the physical damage. Caring for the 
psychic damage will be far more complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquakes are different from wildfires and floods. Most people watched those 
catastrophes from a distance, a drama that unfolded on television. But almost 
everyone who lives in Southern California felt Monday's mighty quake. Nobody 
could be a bystander. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one," said psychologist Robert T. Scott, a consultant for the American Red 
Cross, "could walk away from this one saying, 'No, that didn't affect me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquakes, Scott noted, cannot be predicted. They are not a function of the 
weather. Nobody knows they are coming. This "sends a scary message through our 
primordial survival mechanism. We get jolted out of bed and everything goes 
into high alert. Flashing lights, crashing glass. It really charges us up. That 
is why earthquakes carry such emotional power." 
</P>
<P>
 Home -- the last safe place in a city that is scary enough already -- no 
longer feels safe. 
</P>
<P>
 So people seek safety, and comfort, in one another. In the span of 10 seconds 
Monday morning, this city of cars became a pedestrian town. In the dark before 
dawn, people were out in the streets, checking on neighbors, swapping stories, 
simply being together. In a metropolis as diverse as this one, with its recent 
history of racial tensions, some found a blessing in that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it unites us as people," said Linda Toliver, owner of a neon shop in 
Hollywood that suffered little damage. "We're not all these differences 
anymore. All of a sudden, we're all affected. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 In a place where so many people come from someplace else, inevitably there was 
talk of going back home. Sometimes such comments are flippant. Not this time. 
Many of these transplants sounded serious, motivated by real fear and a longing 
to be with the people most important in life: close family and good friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Salina Sordrager is a native of Holland, now living in Hollywood and looking 
for a job in interior design. "Oh, God, I don't want to be here," she whispered 
to her boyfriend as they huddled in the doorway of his rattling North Hollywood 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, after a telephone call to her parents and brother, she said what was 
really going through her mind: "I've got to get back to Europe. I don't want to 
be here when the Big One hits." 
</P>
<P>
 On Melrose Avenue, a man stumbled into the tony Ciao Bella eatery shortly 
after noon, only to be told the place was closed for lack of electricity and 
water. "I'm from New York and I'm going back," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
 Another former New Yorker, Diane Kelly of Van Nuys, is also ready to go. 
"Everything was flying all over," she said. "I felt glass on top of me. I 
grabbed my daughter, Amber, and I said, 'Dear God let us live through this and 
we're going back to New York.' " 
</P>
<P>
 As he waited in line for a Mid-City Vons supermarket to open Monday morning, 
Henry Turnispeed swore this was the last quake he would live through in the 
West. His brand-new television set -- price tag $800 -- had flown off its stand 
and didn't work. For him, that was the last straw. 
</P>
<P>
 "Soon as I money up, I'm gone," he said. "I think I'm going back to Chicago. 
It's much easier for me to deal with below-zero weather than looking up and 
seeing a television dancing on the ceiling." 
</P>
<P>
 People in Southern California often tell friends in other places that they get 
used to earthquakes. It's a white lie. No one ever does. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Huckfelt can testify to that. He owns a furniture store in historic 
uptown Whittier, where a 5.9 temblor cut a massive swath of destruction in 
1987, leveling dozens of buildings. Right after the Earth shifted Monday, 
Huckfelt jumped into his car and drove to his shop. It had been spared. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't imagine the destruction that was here in 1987," he said. "I just 
prayed it wouldn't happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 For Christina Nichols of Granada Hills, earthquake memories are far more 
haunting. Her mother was killed in the 1971 Sylmar quake. Nichols was asleep on 
a sofa when Monday's quake jolted her awake. She watched in horror as the 
ceiling buckled above her and her belongings flew about the house. Her heart 
raced, and all she could think about was her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "It freaks you out, because you think: Am I going to die the way my mother 
did?" she said. "Am I going to leave kids behind too?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge quake -- as it was dubbed Monday -- will take its own place in 
local history, beside Sierra Madre and Whittier and Sylmar. And for the rest of 
their lives, people like Ida Vasquez will be telling stories about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going 40 miles an hour and all of a sudden I couldn't steer my car 
anymore," said Vasquez, who had just dropped her son off at his job in Oxnard. 
"I thought I had a flat, but then I saw the lights from Point Mugu going off 
and on, and the radio started getting staticky. . . . I started to say the 'Our 
Father' because I thought it as the end of the world. I thought it was a 
nuclear bomb." 
</P>
<P>
 By nightfall Monday, that kind of initial panic seemed to give way to a 
feeling of weariness. Aftershocks continued to roll through the region -- a 
phenomenon seismologists say will continue for several weeks, albeit with 
decreasing frequency. Fires continued. Residents began to realize that, with 
several crucial freeways severely damaged, getting around will be difficult for 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California, many said, has suffered more than its fair share. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's never a moment of rest," exclaimed one Altadena homeowner, whose 
neighborhood was burned out in the fires. "Can't I just catch up with my life?"

QUESTIONS ON REINFORCING OF FREEWAYS RAISED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIRGINIA ELLIS and DAVID FERRELL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With sobering force, Monday's earthquake devastated much of Southern 
California's massive roadway system, causing officials to begin reassessing a 
$1.5-billion reinforcement program designed to prevent the state's highways 
from buckling under seismic stress. 
</P>
<P>
 The magnitude 6.6 quake caught state highway engineers in the midst of a 
costly program to reinforce or retrofit key freeway bridges and interchanges 
that were considered vulnerable to large temblors. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that program, portions of six freeways were closed because of 
structural damage. The hardest hit were two of the region's busiest routes: the 
Santa Monica Freeway near La Cienega Boulevard, where an elevated portion of 
roadway buckled onto the street below, and the Golden State Freeway, which was 
closed by the collapse of an Antelope Valley Freeway overpass. The collapses 
caused sections of all three freeways to be shut down. 
</P>
<P>
 Parts of the Santa Monica Freeway are expected to remain out of service for a 
year to 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had what you would call a catastrophic collapse" of those highways, said 
Jim Drago of the California Department of Transportation in Sacramento. "This 
was a surprise. Obviously the structures did not have sufficient strength to 
ride out the forces they were hit with today." 
</P>
<P>
 Drago noted that most portions of the roadway system that were reinforced came 
through intact, underscoring the importance of the retrofitting program 
launched after the 1971 Sylmar quake, which toppled freeway overpasses. But the 
widespread destruction of freeway bridges and overcrossings Monday was a source 
of consternation among state leaders who thought that the most vulnerable 
roadways had already been shored up. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans Director Jim Van Loben Sels said the segments of the Santa Monica 
Freeway that collapsed at La Cienega Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue were to have 
been retrofitted this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had our bridges rated by risk and we had completed our high-risk ones, and 
we were just moving on to medium risk," he said. "In some sense, our program 
performed well, but not well enough. We didn't get them all." 
</P>
<P>
 The failure of vital traffic arteries will spark a renewed effort by Caltrans 
to evaluate highways that may be in need of reinforcement, using data from 
Monday's quake to refine their seismic safety engineering, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson, asked whether a special inquiry into the retrofitting effort 
might be warranted, said: "I don't think it would be appropriate. I think what 
we are more interested in doing now is repairing damage, making people safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if an inquiry is in order . . . let it proceed." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said she hoped the state would look into the 
progress of the retrofitting program on the theory that all freeways should be 
able to withstand a moderate-size quake similar to Monday's. 
</P>
<P>
 A key question facing highway officials was why some of the crippled roadways, 
such as the Santa Monica and Golden State freeways were considered a relatively 
low priority, since they failed under far less force than might have been 
expected if the Big One had struck. 
</P>
<P>
 Recalling the collapse of Oakland's Nimitz Freeway in 1989, Feinstein noted 
that highway officials are still learning about the inexact science of 
determining how roadways will respond to shaking and bending in an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to really upgrade our state-of-the-art preparedness and construction 
in earthquake zones, particularly freeway construction," she said. "That's 
where you have the largest loss of life." 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's quake caused no fatalities on the Santa Monica Freeway, the nation's 
busiest. But three different overpasses on the route partially buckled, causing 
enormous concrete slabs to move and crumble. Observers described its 
undulations as a horrific pre-dawn spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came outside, the freeway was dancing up and down," said Lacy Loeb, 
who lives a block from the freeway. "The whole structure mushroomed one second 
and then dropped the next." 
</P>
<P>
 Overpasses at Fairfax Avenue and at Venice and La Cienega boulevards suffered 
severe damage. At Fairfax, the freeway shifted so that a four-foot wall of 
concrete rose up in the middle of the traffic lanes. At Venice, the support 
structures underneath the freeway were crushed by the falling concrete, 
exposing twisted steel supports. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans workers at the scene estimated that the overpasses would have to be 
torn down and rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1982 assessment by the state Division of Mines and Geology, the ground 
near the point of the collapse was identified as being prone to liquefaction -- 
the breakdown of water-saturated soil when subjected to shaking. 
</P>
<P>
 But that section of the Santa Monica Freeway was given a lower priority for 
retrofitting than other projects because the freeway overpasses already had 
multiple support columns, said Caltech professor Wilfred Iwan, head of the 
California Seismic Safety Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The damaged stretch of the freeway happened to be one of the next in line for 
being shored up, according to Jim Roberts, chief of Caltrans' retrofitting 
program. The $3.7-million job was to have gone to bid next month, and was 
scheduled to take about a year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steel jackets that would have been installed around the concrete supports most 
likely would have prevented the collapse, Roberts said. "From the pictures, it 
looks like the columns just shattered," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation officials said some ramps adjacent to the collapsed roadway 
withstood the quake because they already had been retrofitted. 
</P>
<P>
 Near Santa Clarita, where the Golden State and Antelope Valley freeways merge 
in a towering concrete maze, cars were scattered Monday at two places where the 
road abruptly ended. 
</P>
<P>
 One big-rig truck had jackknifed just before a precipice that was formed when 
the quake split the road in two. The huge highways were scarred with cracks, 
and chunks of concrete from upper levels of the interchange had collapsed and 
crashed to the roads below. 
</P>
<P>
 That freeway junction was also scheduled for retrofitting, but the work had 
not yet been done, Caltrans officials said. "We didn't consider (the 
overpasses) quite this vulnerable," Roberts said. "We thought we had time." 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials acknowledged that they erred in a decision not to retrofit 
bridges along the Simi Valley Freeway (California 118) in the San Fernando 
Valley. Those bridges also collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 An evaluation of the bridges, constructed five years after the 1971 Sylmar 
temblor, convinced engineers that they were strong enough to withstand a severe 
quake, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's quake was apparently centered on an unmapped fault in the San 
Fernando Valley, said Roberts, who said the discovery will add to the work of 
highway engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we'll have to re-evaluate a whole lot of bridges close to this new 
fault," he said. "That means we have to go back and rescreen several hundred 
bridges that are within a certain distance of this new fault line." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to that work, Caltrans engineers will be examining all freeway 
bridges and overpasses within a 50-mile radius of the quake's epicenter for any 
sign of damage, officials said. An investigative team of engineers and seismic 
experts will conduct a detailed analysis to determine what happened to each of 
the damaged bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 Retrofitting has been the state's way of bolstering existing freeways -- 
especially those built before the 1971 Sylmar quake -- to withstand the sharp 
movements of California's fragmented crust. 
</P>
<P>
 The program took on increased urgency after the Whittier Narrows quake in 
October, 1987. That magnitude 5.9 temblor threatened to bring down a major 
interchange connecting the San Gabriel River Freeway and the Santa Ana Freeway 
between Santa Fe Springs and Downey. 
</P>
<P>
 Subsequently, Caltrans began accelerating its efforts to reinforce freeway 
bridges, but the task is daunting. There are about 12,000 freeway bridges in 
the state, and engineers had to evaluate the soundness of those bridges before 
establishing a priority list. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1989 Loma Prieta quake near Santa Cruz gave further impetus to the program 
because of the 43 lives lost in the collapses of the double-decked Nimitz 
Freeway in Oakland and a portion of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. Since 
then, two-thirds of the retrofitting work has been done in the Los Angeles 
Basin. "I always felt that the next one would come in L.A.," Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Monday's quake, most major interchanges in the Los Angeles area had 
been reinforced or were in the process of being retrofitted, Caltrans officials 
said. Often, that bolstering involves wrapping the concrete columns that 
support freeway bridges with steel jackets. Or in some cases, the base of the 
columns and the edge of longer bridge spans are enlarged to provide additional 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts cited the critical interchange of the San Diego and Santa Monica 
freeways as one that may have been spared by retrofitting from serious damage 
or collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 "This earthquake shows that what we've been doing works," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Iwan of Caltech said, "There's always a question (whether) we could do things 
faster. Basically, if we had more money we could progress at a lot faster pace, 
but there are a lot of things that compete for the same dollars. We have social 
problems and a lot of other problems that society wants taken care of." 
</P>
<P>
 George W. Housner, a worldwide authority on earthquake engineering, said he 
suspected that every building, road or bridge that failed Monday either was not 
constructed in accordance with seismic codes or had not been retrofitted after 
the 1989 Loma Prieta quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "My guess is that when all the information comes in, we'll say, 'Yes, they 
should have come down,' " said Housner, who chaired a state panel that 
investigated and made recommendations following the Northern California quake.

SYLMAR JOLTED BY GHOSTS OF HORROR PAST; HISTORY: THE CITY THAT CRUMPLED UNDER A 
6.5 QUAKE IN 1971 REMEMBERS WELL THE TERROR THAT CAME WHEN THE EARTH GAVE WAY. 
ON MONDAY, IT SEEMED LIKE IT WAS CURSED.

 Beate Heuss had nearly conquered her fear when she felt it again. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why it was so terrifying. It was happening again. She and her husband, 
David, were in bed, like the last time. In a mobile home, just like the last 
time. It was, in fact, the same mobile home, at the same trailer park. 
</P>
<P>
 "This one felt much worse," she said afterward, calm but able to remember 
every tremor, then the shaking, then the violence. "It was much harder, a hard 
jolt. The '71 one swayed a little." But this one did not sway. It simply 
slammed David and Beate Heuss and their community. Again. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar does not look cursed. It is just half an hour from the heart of Los 
Angeles, but rural enough for corrals. 
</P>
<P>
 But at 4:31 a.m. Monday, in the quiet darkness, ruin struck with thunder and 
vengeance -- for a second time. It trampled Sylmar and its peace of mind, and 
when the shaking finally stopped, roads had crumbled, structures had collapsed 
and homes had been destroyed -- for a second time. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar, where a 6.5 earthquake killed 58 people in 1971, was suffering once 
more Monday. To some, it seemed like a curse. To others, the curse was like a 
prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody was killed this time, but scores were injured. More than 50 people were 
treated at a makeshift, outdoor emergency room at Olive View Medical Center, 
which was destroyed in 1971 and rebuilt, smaller and better prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in some ways, much of the rest of Sylmar was more prepared too. But in 
other ways, it was simply impossible to get ready. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just getting to the point, personally, where I was getting over being 
afraid of going under overpasses," Beate Heuss said. But she was hardly 
prepared to lose her home. 
</P>
<P>
 This time the mobile home, at the Tahitian Mobile Home Park, where the Heusses 
had lived since the Sylmar earthquake, burned to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 David and Beate Heuss, 54 and 51, lost everything. 
</P>
<P>
 They fled with her purse and the clothes on their backs. "Now everything is 
gone," she said. That included many of the things they had accumulated during 
the years that her husband had worked as a quality assurance inspector at 
Southern California defense plants. 
</P>
<P>
 They will leave. Heuss retired not long ago, and he and his wife were planning 
to move to the Reno area anyway. Beate Heuss was able to smile a bit at the 
irony. They would go for certain now; there wasn't much to keep them here. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, in fact, the quake was worse -- a 6.6. But its epicenter was south 
of Sylmar, in Northridge. Nonetheless, much of the damage in Sylmar was the 
same. Freeways were ravaged. Railroad tracks were twisted. Trains were 
derailed. Fires raged in Sylmar homes. 
</P>
<P>
 First the homes rose, then fell, and their foundations -- little more than 
jacks under some of the house trailers -- punched up through the floors. 
Furniture flew, and broken gas lines hissed. The gas caught fire, destroying up 
to 150 homes, by Fire Department estimate, in three Sylmar trailer parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Stone, 30, a Tahitian Park resident, lived in Glendale in 1971. He 
remembers looking out a window and watching buildings shake. But this time, he 
said, "it was like the Jolly Green Giant sat down on us." 
</P>
<P>
 This time, clouds of dust rose and obscured the chaparral on the foothills. 
And this time, there were more people to feel the quake. Sylmar has grown -- by 
a third in the last decade. A census last year counted 59,996 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of them had come from places where there are no earthquakes -- or at 
least smaller ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Mya Dobson, 23, an insurance claims adjuster from Oakland, was staying at a 
hotel in the San Fernando Valley when the quake hit. Dobson said it felt bigger 
than the Loma Prieta quake that struck her hometown more than four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Oakland," she said, "it was like one big hard bang. . . . Today it was 
long and hard and wouldn't stop." 
</P>
<P>
 Dobson, a friend and several others spent much of the day at Veterans Memorial 
Park in Sylmar. In 1971, it was the site of a Veterans Administration Hospital. 
Two major buildings at the hospital collapsed in that quake, killing 49 
patients and employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital was never rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 In its place is a park placed against the foothills that looks out over the 
Valley. Teresa Mesa, 30, sat in the shade of a tree, figuring it was better to 
picnic than go home where windows might still be shattered by aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Sal Rodas, manager of the Red Cross shelter established at Sylmar High School, 
estimated that more than 300 people had stopped by for first aid, food or other 
assistance. He said 150 people or more might stay the night, although dozens 
chose to sleep on cots under the stars rather than inside the school gymnasium. 
Lasagna was served, courtesy of the L.A. Unified School District Food Services 
Division and Pango-Pango Motion Picture Location Catering, which volunteered a 
truck. 
</P>
<P>
 As night fell, scores of people in Sylmar took to their yards. They barbecued 
dinner. Some gathered belongings about them. Dorothy and Don Miller were in 
their back yard amid stacks of unbroken china and stemware rescued from their 
dining room. 
</P>
<P>
 They were veterans of the 1971 quake. Dorothy Miller, puffing on cigarette on 
the patio, said they had no plans to move. "But you never really get used to 
it," her husband said from his spot on a blanket on the lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy Miller, a senior supervisor at the Sierracin Corp., was at work during 
the 1971 temblor. "We make windshields for airplanes. There was glass flying 
everywhere. In fact, I thought it was an explosion." 
</P>
<P>
 This time, she and her husband were at home. They had set the alarm for 3 
a.m., because Dorothy was headed for work early. It was just as well because 
when they took a look at their bedroom after the quake, two mirrors, a dresser 
and a tall set of shelves had toppled onto the bed. 
</P>
<P>
 At Olive View Medical Center, two buildings collapsed in 1971, and three 
people died, including two patients on life-support systems that failed when 
auxiliary generators did not start. The third was an ambulance driver who was 
crushed by a falling wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Olive View was an 888-bed hospital then. It had only been open a month when 
the quake hit. Because of extensive damage, the hospital was rebuilt, with 
attention to strengthening it against any future quake. But it was much 
smaller. Now it has a capacity of 377 patients. 
</P>
<P>
 There were about 300 in the hospital before dawn Monday, said Mario Sewell, an 
assistant administrator. Half were transferred or discharged, and the hospital 
does not expect to take any new patients for at least 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Sewell said the hospital had water damage, broken tiles and loss of power. A 
few members of the staff suffered minor injuries, he said, but none of its 
patients was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Cherry Uyeda was assistant personnel officer at the hospital in 1971; now she 
is director of public relations. What would she say to someone who thought 
Sylmar was a hard-luck place? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't go along with those who say it's a hard-luck city. It's a beautiful 
city in a beautiful setting. Olive View has always had its facility here, and 
I'd hate to see us move. . . . We've had problems, fires and now two 
earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we've always come through."

AT LEAST 15 DIE IN COLLAPSED APARTMENTS; EPICENTER: RESIDENTS ARE TRAPPED AND 
KILLED AS 40 UNITS ON THE FIRST FLOOR OF A THREE-STORY NORTHRIDGE COMPLEX ARE 
FLATTENED. RESCUERS WITH DOGS COMB RUBBLE FOR SURVIVORS.

<P>
 At the place the huge temblortook its greatest toll, the woman stood vigil by 
an oak tree, peering into the rubble of what had been her home. 
</P>
<P>
 For four hours, Hyun Sook Lee stood by the Northridge Meadows apartments, 
where as many as 40 first-floor apartments collapsed under the weight of the 
two floors above, killing at least 15 people early Monday morning when the 
earthquake hit. What had once been a courtyard with waterfalls and streams was 
now sandwiched into a subterranean void less than a foot high. Cars parked in 
an underground garage were flattened. Stairways and a catwalk collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, a nurse, stood and looked for some sign that her husband and 14-year-old 
son would somehow emerge, that the searchers would find them under that 
mountain of debris. 
</P>
<P>
 She had managed to crawl out of her first-floor apartment. So had her other 
son, Jason, though his leg had been broken as the apartment collapsed. But her 
husband, Phil Soom, 47, and her son Howard -- home on a visit from boarding 
school -- had not made it out in the minutes after the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 At 8:30 a.m., paramedic Dave Thompson approached Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ma'am, listen to me. Your son, how old is your son?" he asked. "This son is 
dead, ma'am. He is dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee dissolved into tears, her shoulders racked by sobs. An hour later, 
Thompson again brought the worst of news. He told her that her husband was also 
dead, that there was no way he could have survived. 
</P>
<P>
 All of those who died in the apartment complex at 9565 Reseda Blvd. lived on 
the first floor, which was destroyed in a matter of seconds. In the hours 
immediately after the earthquake, it became clear that this 160-unit structure 
would become a focal point of the tragedy that stretched throughout Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who survived would tell of the panic, the screams and the small acts 
of heroism in the minutes after the quake. And they would also tell of seeing 
in the debris the bodies of victims who could no longer be helped. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those survivors was Kym Cohen, whose apartment was on the third floor. 
She said the earthquake gave a huge jolt and then everything began to shake 
violently. The temblor was twisting the building, plunging upper story 
apartments downward. Cohen's whole apartment began to plummet, like some 
horrible ride. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could not get out of bed, the apartment was on a slant," she said. "We 
could not get out because the doors were jammed." 
</P>
<P>
 Panic set in as they searched for a way to escape what in seconds had become a 
prison. Cohen said her boyfriend finally freed them by prying open the door 
with a crowbar. But when they got out of their apartment, they heard the 
chilling sounds of agony and desperation and then, worst of all, silence. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we could hear were people yelling, 'Help me, please, help me! I can't get 
out!' " she said. "I heard a lot of screaming and crying when it first 
happened. Then a lot of silence. The silence scared me more than anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Bryan Watson, 30, clad only in pants and a jacket he had grabbed on the way 
out of his third-floor apartment, also pried open his door with a crowbar. "We 
walked uphill to the hallway after it collapsed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt like Godzilla had picked our building up, shook it, couldn't find a 
toy and threw it back down on the ground," said Watson, a computer consultant 
who has lived in the complex for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 In another apartment, Eric Pearson, an emergency medical technician, escaped 
from his apartment and began throwing emergency fire hoses to people who could 
not make their way from the top of the wrecked building. But even those who 
found safety in the courtyard remained panicky as the initial jolt gave way to 
powerful aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Trapped in darkness, some residents became hysterical until passing Los 
Angeles police officers pried open one of he gates. Pearson, meanwhile, kept 
working. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lost one person," Pearson said. "There was a little old lady in the back. 
Two beams fell on her. I told her to hold on, I'd be right back with a ladder. 
By the time I got back, she'd passed away." 
</P>
<P>
 As darkness turned to the first light of dawn Monday, it became clear just 
what had happened in the night. In the temblor, the building had lurched the 
six feet to one side and collapsed the first floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "You make a house of cards, you push it, it tilts. That's what happened here," 
said Bob DeFeo, a battalion chief for the Los Angeles City Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The search for survivors began in earnest as the sun came up. 
</P>
<P>
 Rescue workers ripped apart apartment interiors, chopped through floors with 
axes and tossed out concrete chunks, mattresses, furniture, clothing and 
personal mementos in a desperate search for the living. Letters, canceled 
checks, photographs, a bloodstained mattress, a videotape of "Dumbo" littered 
the sidewalk and lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 As the day went on, firefighters brought in dogs and highly sensitive 
microphones as part of their rescue efforts, hoping to pick up the scent or 
sound of people under the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, the firefighters made eight rescues, using airbags that lifted the 
building so rescuers could crawl in. The airbags, purchased after the 
devastating 1971 Sylmar earthquake, can lift up to 72 tons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see blue sky, it's beautiful," exclaimed one man, who was not immediately 
identified, after two hours of cutting and lifting brought him to daylight. 
</P>
<P>
 Onlookers applauded when Alan Hemsath, 37, was freed -- conscious and in 
stable condition -- after diamond-bladed saws chewed through concrete and wood 
for an hour and a half to reach what had nearly become a tomb. Firefighters 
heard the man cry out as they tramped through the demolished building pounding 
on floors and calling out to any survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd also cheered when rescue crews also finally extracted another man 
from beneath the building's south corner. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those at the scene was Tim McDonald, a Torrance businessman who was 
watching television Monday morning when he recognized the Northridge apartments 
as the place where his mother, Mary, lived. 
</P>
<P>
 He had raced to the apartment, but as the day wore on, no one was able to give 
him any information. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nuts. You'd think they would have some information. I can't believe they 
don't have the names of some of these people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the sun began to set Monday, DeFeo, the battalion captain, said the search 
would continue at least through Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be here through tomorrow, I'm sure," he said. "We're going to use every 
resource we have to make sure nobody is left in the building. That includes 
dogs, as well as listening devices that can hear people breathing."

EARTHQUAKE: DISASTER BEFORE DAWN; CREWS' SWIFT RESPONSE WINS PRAISE; DISASTER: 
SYSTEM WAS FOUND WANTING IN THE 1992 RIOTS AND LAST FALL'S FIRES. THIS TIME, 
REACTION WAS QUICK AND WELL-COORDINATED, OFFICIALS SAY.

<P>
 Los Angeles' emergency response system -- tested and found wanting during the 
1992 riots and challenged again during last fall's fires -- reacted in force to 
Monday's earthquakes, winning accolades even as residents and officials braced 
for the long recovery to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of police officers, firefighters, paramedics and others fanned out 
through the region within hours of the 4:31 a.m quake. From an emergency 
operations center beneath a City Hall annex, three dozen officials spearheaded 
the massive city, county and state response, deploying forces amid damage 
reports that arrived from across the city and region. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is damage everywhere," Police Commission President Gary Greenebaum said 
shortly after arriving at the emergency center early Monday. "My sense is that 
the worst is in the Valley, but everyone was hit." 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency crews ran into snags from the start: Buckled highways made it 
difficult to get workers to some locations; extensive damage and power failures 
forced the closure of hospitals and the evacuations of 600 to 700 sick and 
injured patients; ruptured gas mains sparked scores of blazes; a downed 
communications system hampered health care coordination. 
</P>
<P>
 But this time, according to officials monitoring the work of emergency crews, 
the initial response was swift and well-coordinated. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department declared a tactical alert about 5 a.m., even 
before the department's chief, Willie L. Williams, could dig himself out from 
the damage in his Woodland Hills home; a heavy armoire fell in Williams' 
bedroom, missing the chief "by about an inch," he said later. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department acted about the same time, 
mobilizing all its deputies and ordering them to work 12-hour shifts. 
</P>
<P>
 The moves by the LAPD and Sheriff's Department meant that thousands of 
additional law enforcement officers were working within hours of the quake's 
first jolt. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan declared a local emergency at 5:50 a.m., and Gov. Pete 
Wilson was on hand by noon, bringing with him the authority to dispatch 500 
National Guard troops to posts across the city. By nightfall, 500 National 
Guards were stationed at armories in and around Los Angeles. Between 1,500 and 
1,800 troops are scheduled to be on duty within 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 With dozens of blazes erupting throughout the region, firefighters called on 
neighboring departments for help, especially in the devastated areas of the San 
Fernando Valley. Some firefighters were temporarily delayed early Monday 
because they had to manually open garage doors to get their trucks out. But by 
1 p.m., those firefighters, joined by 20 strike teams from the county, were 
battling blazes, and help was pouring in from across the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven out-of-town urban search and rescue teams of about 50 people each joined 
local firefighters to check rubble for survivors. Three were immediately 
deployed in the Valley, while the other four waited for their assignments at 
the Los Alamitos Armed Forces Reserve Center. 
</P>
<P>
 By late afternoon, officials said they had turned the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a pretty good handle on the fires," said Fire Battalion Chief 
Claude Creasy. "Everything is contained. Our concern now is the aftershocks and 
the continuing collapse of structures that are in jeopardy." 
</P>
<P>
 Early reports of looting were met aggressively by police determined to thwart 
illegal activity before it could overwhelm them, as it did during the 1992 
riots. The LAPD reported half a dozen arrests for looting early Monday, some 
Downtown and others in the Valley. Officers from the LAPD's elite Metro 
Division were dispatched to some of those areas, and commanders requested 
assistance from the Sheriff's Department, which supplied 60 deputies as part of 
an anti-looting force. 
</P>
<P>
 That deployment was accompanied by tough rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will not tolerate looting in any way," LAPD Cmdr. David J. Gascon said at 
midday. "We will have maximum enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
 While the city's police and fire crews rushed to emergencies, the health care 
network was struggling under the load. 
</P>
<P>
 At Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, doctors received "a tidal wave of walking 
wounded," spokesman Ron Wise said. UCLA Medical Center treated more than 100 
patients, most for minor cuts on their hands and feet, but several were 
seriously injured. Other hospitals were similarly deluged. 
</P>
<P>
 The death and injury toll mounted throughout the day, and hospitals were 
forced to grapple with an array of difficulties. Many were operating on 
generators, and emergency rooms were overflowing. Doctors sutured some cuts in 
hospital hallways. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the evacuations from earthquake-damaged hospitals redoubled the 
pressure on those that were receiving patients. So many patients were moved -- 
more than at any other time in the area's history -- that Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority buses and helicopters were pressed into duty. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest evacuation occurred at Olive View Medical Center, where all the 
patients in the 377-bed hospital were transferred because of serious water 
damage, gas leaks and power outages. Some went to private hospitals, but most 
were driven to other county hospitals. The hospital was built on the site where 
another county hospital was destroyed in the 1971 Sylmar earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the Valley, 23 infants from the Northridge Hospital Medical Center's 
neonatal intensive care unit were evacuated by helicopter because of damage to 
the ward. The babies were flown to UCLA Medical Center and to Huntington 
Memorial Hospital in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 All 198 patients were also moved out of the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in 
Sepulveda. They were transferred to the veterans hospital in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 David Langness, a spokesman for the Hospital Council of Southern California, 
said dozens of other hospitals suffered severe enough damage to force partial 
evacuations or the shift of large numbers of patients from one floor to another 
or one ward to another. 
</P>
<P>
 At Psychiatric Hospital, part of the County-USC Medical Center, a broken water 
tank forced officials to close the facility and transfer 65 to 75 patients to 
other hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The water came down the elevator shafts, through the ceiling, into hallways," 
said Harvey Kern, a hospital spokesman. "It was everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the damage, Langness and other hospital officials said they were 
pleased overall with the way the countywide emergency response system worked. 
After the disastrous 1971 Sylmar earthquake, hospitals developed emergency 
networks that were pressed into duty Monday. The two systems, a radio network 
using a hospital-only channel and a microwave network, were slow in getting 
started up because of earthquake-related problems, but both kicked in about 
9:30 a.m. and ran without problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody was scrambling," Langness said. "But basically everything was in 
place, the systems worked, and we didn't lose any patients." 
</P>
<P>
 On the streets, emergency crews were welcomed warmly by residents, some still 
badly shaken by the earthquake and its aftershocks. But even an earthquake 
could not break some habits: Police officers posted near the fallen Santa 
Monica Freeway at Fairfax Avenue tried to steer cars around the severed 
roadway, which lay like a broken bird's wing across the street below. 
</P>
<P>
 Most motorists turned around, but some were defiant. One motorist sped by 
officers trying to detour traffic off the freeway and crashed into a chunk of 
concrete thrust into the air by the earthquake, an officer at the scene said. 
The man was taken to the hospital, his face badly cut. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just can't stop these people," Officer Richard Blankenship said. about an 
hour after the quake struck. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's response was the result of long soul-searching by Los Angeles leaders 
about the city's readiness for a disaster. After the 1992 riots, a commission 
appointed to examine the city's response expressed "grave concern" about the 
city's preparedness and urged officials to step up their planning for a future 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of that report, the LAPD launched a comprehensive emergency 
training program for its officers, and the city retooled its emergency 
operations procedures to improve coordination. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday those new procedures were in evidence at the Emergency Operations 
Center. Representatives of state, county and city agencies worked hand in hand 
from before dawn until long after dark, regularly updating one another on the 
efforts being undertaken by their workers. Riordan, dressed in jeans and a Los 
Angeles Lakers sweat shirt, patrolled the bunker-like, windowless command post 
early Monday morning, asking staffers for updates as they poured in from around 
the city. He treated the staff to a midmorning breakfast, and he commended 
officials from each of the various agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been impressed by everyone," Riordan said later. "The response has been 
overwhelming."

EARTHQUAKE: DISASTER BEFORE DAWN; IMMIGRANTS ARE REMINDED OF DISASTERS IN THEIR 
HOMELANDS

<P>
 Bricks, fear and memories sent many of the residents of Los Angeles' crowded 
immigrant neighborhoods into the streets long before first light Monday. And as 
the sun finally rose on the uncertain day, many of them remained there. 
</P>
<P>
 For thousands of the city's immigrant residents, at least one of the old 
country's terrors had come to join them in the new. For Armenians, Mexicans, 
Guatemalans, Nicaraguans and Filipinos the quake brought back visions of 
friends and relatives buried beneath rubble and of entire villages and 
neighborhoods that simply ceased to exist. 
</P>
<P>
 For Latinos, who comprise the majority of the city's recent immigrants, 
Monday's disaster revived old and painful memories, as well as familiar ways of 
making do. In the parking lot of Langer's Delicatessen in the Pico-Union 
district, Elvira Sec, 40, and her husband, Agustin Alfaro, 33, huddled together 
under a crocheted blanket. A survivor of the magnitude 8.1 quake that killed 
23,000 of their fellow Guatemalans in 1976, Elvira awoke early Monday as their 
fourth-floor apartment at Westlake Avenue and 8th Street swayed beneath her. 
"God, don't let this swallow up my bed," she prayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, MacArthur Park was crowded with Central and Latin Americans who also 
were afraid to return to their apartments. Monday's quake, however, had not 
prevented Hector del Valle, 36, from making the trek from his home at 53rd and 
Hoover streets in South-Central. He was busy hawking perfume from a canvas bag 
to the park's instant refugees. Like Sec and Alfaro, del Valle survived the 
deadly Guatemala City temblor. So many people died in his neighborhood there, 
he said, that the dead were buried with backhoes. An eight-story apartment 
building near his own home there collapsed, and he helped pull bodies from the 
rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pulled out my friends' dead children. That, you never forget," he said. "In 
Latin America the construction is worse than here. There, an earthquake -- 
well, it's fatal." 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen minutes away, in a hillside neighborhood of Silver Lake, Nicaraguan 
immigrants -- many of whom survived the 1972 quake that killed 6,000 people -- 
had moved out of their apartment buildings and thrown blankets, mattresses and 
coats on nearby lawns and sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went through the Managua earthquake and this one was just like that," said 
Minerva Parra, 29, as she clutched her three small children around her. "I 
thought I had seen the last of these big quakes when I moved here in 1989," she 
said. "But Los Angeles has them too." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors shared her sentiments. "Not again," said Alfredo Salas, 38, shaking 
his head as pre-dawn aftershocks went through the area. 
</P>
<P>
 A few blocks away, Jorge Gonzalez Molina, who left Mexico City after the 8.1 
quake that killed 25,000 people in 1985, prepared to leave for his mechanic's 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 "Please don't leave me here," his wife, Magdalena Maria, pleaded. He replied 
that they needed the money. "But that won't make any difference if we have no 
place to live," she said. "Stay with me here." 
</P>
<P>
 He did. 
</P>
<P>
 As the hours wore on, life in some neighborhoods assumed an improvised, though 
eerie, routine. On a chain-link-enclosed dirt lot in the Pico-Union district, 
30 evacuees from a nearby brick tenement camped en masse. Magdalena Rodriguez, 
a 36-year-old housewife, found a metal mattress frame in the lot; the men in 
the group gathered firewood and built a fire under the frame. Rodriguez heated 
pots of milk for the children and water for the adults' coffee. Neighbors 
barbecued a chicken. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so afraid," Rodriguez said, stirring the milk with one hand, and 
clutching her 4-year-old boy with the other. "I'll wait out here all day." 
</P>
<P>
 At Echo Park lake, more than 100 Latinos, most of them new arrivals, had taken 
up temporary residence in the city park. Among them was 23-year-old Margarito 
Acuna, who with his wife Beatriz and young son Margarito Jr., decided not to 
stay in their apartment in a 1920s-building across the street from the park. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's safer here than in the apartment," the Guadalajara-born Acuna said. "My 
wife was telling me before Christmas, we should think of what to do in case of 
an earthquake. But you know how these things are, you put things off. 'Yeah, 
I'll think about it.' But then I don't. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the earthquake hit this morning, first time my wife says, 'I told you to 
think of something. Let's go to the park.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't argue with her." 
</P>
<P>
 A mile or so east, in the east Hollywood neighborhood that is home to many of 
the city's Armenian immigrants, echoes of faraway disasters also could be 
heard. Shushan Abrayan, 27, stood outside her partially destroyed brick 
apartment building, stared at the water heaters protruding from one of the 
floors above, and recalled the 1988 earthquake that took the lives of 25,000 
people in her native Armenia. "That was bad, but I've never felt anything like 
this. It just kept going and going," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At an Armenian produce market in the 4800 block of Santa Monica Boulevard in 
east Hollywood, shoppers there were comparing the morning temblor to the 1988 
quake in their former home. 
</P>
<P>
 "My whole house started shaking and I thought, 'It's another killer 
earthquake! Another killer!' " said Anna Davidian, who spoke through a 
translator. "Everything there was ruined, so I thought the same here. But in 
the sunlight, I could see everything was still standing." 
</P>
<P>
 In the late afternoon, 14-year-old Vahe Zargarian leaned against his family's 
maroon Cadillac sedan and watched his mother and older sister finish moving 
their belongings into the car. The family had decided that it was too risky to 
stay in their apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know we could lose everything if another earthquake comes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zargarians came to Los Angeles three years ago from Yerevan, where they 
survived a quake in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "My cousin's neighbor said he came here and the earthquakes followed him," 
Vahe said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-story apartment building where the family has been living on Kenmore 
Avenue just north of Hollywood Boulevard sits next to a six-story apartment 
building that looked as if it could topple over at any time. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the street, piles of bricks and concrete sat on the sidewalk and street 
in front of Ara's Pastry Shop, where the roof had fallen. 
</P>
<P>
 As a 5.5 aftershock rolled through the neighborhood around 3:30 p.m., 
residents screamed in fear and ran looking for safe places. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Mid-Wilshire district, 66-year-old Jimmy Macias and his wife, 
Hortencia, hurried, arm in arm along an unnaturally quiet Wilshire Boulevard. 
Though they came to the United States from the Philippines 40 years ago, both 
had had relatives badly injured in the magnitude 7.7 quake that struck their 
native island of Luzon in 1990. More than 1,600 people were killed in that 
quake and 3,000 more were hurt. Monday morning, the couple was on their way to 
St. Basil's Roman Catholic Church to light candles and petition the Virgin Mary 
for her protection. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you can't trust the ground under your feet," Jimmy Macias said, "there's 
nothing to do except you put your eyes on heaven and pray." 
</P>
<P>
 A few miles west, in the Fairfax district, others had another sort of comfort 
in mind. At Molly Malone's Pub, a popular gathering spot for the city's Irish 
immigrants, there was no electricity but plenty of customers, when the doors 
opened an hour early. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had 20 or 30 people sitting and drinking Guinness by candlelight since 
9 this morning," said Damien Hanlon, whose family owns the bar. "When there's 
devastation, everybody thinks, 'Time for a quick pint.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Mostly, they just sit here listening to every rumble and ask, 'Was that 
another one?' And even if it wasn't, they order another one."

ON CALIFORNIA: ONCE AGAIN, AN ISLAND ON THE LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One decade ago Los Angeles was braced for disaster. The Olympics were coming, 
and the wisdom of the moment was that the city's freeways would fail under the 
crush of visitors. Most frightful was one particular Friday when major events 
were scheduled to begin at rush hour all across the basin. Black Friday, we 
called it, a term that will seem over the top only to those who do not 
understand the relationship between L.A. and freeways. Los Angeles without 
freeways would be like a clock without hands, or a human body without arteries. 
It wouldn't work. It couldn't live. That simple. 
</P>
<P>
 Now as it happened, Black Friday happily turned out to be a fiction, as did 
any notion of a city paralyzed by sport. The freeways never flowed better than 
they did during the 16-day Olympics. In part this was because the actual number 
of Olympic visitors had been exaggerated. In part it was because we newsies 
unwittingly scared commuters out of their cars, or at least out of their 
regular travel patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 Today will be different. Today will be no drill. Today Los Angeles must begin 
to learn to live without much of its central mechanism. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The reason of course is the earthquake. To those who lost people, or at least 
property, a discussion of the quake's impact on infrastructure might seem 
callous, off-key. This is not the intent. It simply is true, however, that for 
the vast majority of L.A. residents the most tangible loss Monday was that of 
the freeways. And it is no small loss. 
</P>
<P>
 I was not in town when the quake struck. I was in Northern California. Heeding 
initial reports of shutdown airports, I started south by car. Along the way, 
radio stations from Sacramento to Fresno to Bakersfield were filled with 
nothing but earthquake coverage. Most simply turned over their broadcasts to 
Los Angeles affiliates. And so driving through the San Joaquin Valley I could 
hear survivors of the collapsed Northridge apartment complex recounting their 
terror. I could hear one man describe the quake, not as a rolling motion, but 
as a "bomb." I could follow, minute by frantic minute, efforts to dig out a man 
buried in his street sweeper. 
</P>
<P>
 While such communiques flowed freely from ground zero, not much else did. As 
the day progressed, increasingly fidgety government officials assessed damage 
to what they called "the infrastructure." One of two essential aqueducts was 
knocked out. The city was cut off from the far-away hydro projects that provide 
its electricity. And, one by one, freeways were being taken down. First it was 
the Golden State and Santa Monica. Later, reports told of closures on the 101, 
the 405, the 14 all the way out to Mojave, even the Angeles Crest Highway. It 
was then that I began to imagine a Los Angeles with a broken freeway system. It 
was then that I began to contemplate Helen Hunt Jackson's long ago description 
of L.A. as an "island on the land" in a new and bleaker context. 
</P>
<P>
 Traveling to L.A. had taken on the feel of slipping into some besieged city, a 
city cut off by quake from the rest of California, from everything. Yes, the 
airports would reopen. Yes, the telephones would come back to life. But 
essential connections were broken, and in ways that cannot be quickly overcome. 
At truck stops along I-5, telephone banks were full of truckers who had 
concluded they could not make it over the hill to Los Angeles. "What am I 
supposed to do?" I heard one grizzled fellow quizzing his dispatcher near 
Kettleman City. I don't know what he was hauling, but I saw other rigs loaded 
with everything from produce to, I swear, funeral caskets, all stalled north of 
the Tehachapi. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 My travel options were more varied than that of the typical trucker. I simply 
dumped my car in Bakersfield and caught a midafternoon flight to LAX. From 
there I took a cab Downtown. My driver was a newly arrived immigrant from 
Russia named Alexandre Martchenkov. "English, no," he said when I asked how his 
day had gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first," he said, shaking his hand in rocking motion. "Los Angeles 
beautiful," he said, "but too much." And here he trembled his hand again. 
</P>
<P>
 The word earthquake might not come easily to Martchenkov, but after six months 
here he was capable of conversing in the language fundamental to cabdrivers 
and, for that matter, anyone else who needs a car to get around Los Angeles. 
Which is to say everybody. He could talk freeway talk. 
</P>
<P>
 "405," he said gravely. "Closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "10 closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many freeways closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "No good." 
</P>
<P>
 This much he knew. This much everybody knows. This time Los Angeles will have 
no choice. This time the city must live, not for 16 days, but for a long, long 
while, not as a matter of hyperbole, but as a matter of fact, without them. 
Welcome to the island.

EARTHQUAKE: DISASTER BEFORE DAWN; 'MY ONLY THOUGHT WAS TO GET ANDREW OUT OF 
THERE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

 My son had just fallen to sleep and I was dozing when the earthquake hit, 
hurling my cot sideways just as a big wall clock crashed to the floor, spraying 
glass shards in every corner of our room at St. Johns Hospital and Health 
Center in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew, my 10-year-old, had been admitted to St. Johns Sunday night in the 
grip of a severe asthma attack. But the medical emergency paled compared to our 
immediate predicament. 
</P>
<P>
 One wall of the room had splintered under the wallpaper. Outside our 
third-story window, an inch-wide fissure had opened in the exterior stucco. The 
building continued to jiggle ominously after the main quake passed, all of this 
in total darkness and accompanied by the alarms of battery-powered medical 
apparatus sounding through the hospital corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 My only thought was to get Andrew out of there. I flew to his bed, having 
managed to find his sneakers, and began jamming them on his feet. "Don't move, 
sweetie, don't move," I kept repeating, fearful that in his terror he would 
leap out of the bed onto the broken glass. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it dawned on me that he couldn't, nor could I carry him out to safety. 
Andrew was tethered to an intravenous pole that had gotten wedged between his 
bed, the wall and a heavy night table. I frantically searched for a way to 
disconnect him, but the only light came from a flashing digital readout on the 
computer that measured the drugs dripping into Andrew's veins. 
</P>
<P>
 Just then, one of the night-shift nurses charged into our room, picking her 
way through the debris by the fragile beam of a flashlight. "Are you hurt?" she 
cried. "Are you all right?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Get these IVs out of him!" I yelled. We locked gazes for an instant, 
wordlessly acknowledging the craziness of the situation. A mother was ordering 
a nurse to discontinue treatment ordered by a doctor. But the earthquake had 
made business as usual impossible. "You're right," she murmured, and quickly 
unhooked Andrew from the tubes. 
</P>
<P>
 Still with the catheter needle stuck in his arm, Andrew sprinted to the 
doorway and crouched as he had been taught in school. I found a sweat shirt to 
put over his pajamas, and we began to feel our way down the darkened hallway. 
</P>
<P>
 Plaster rubble was everywhere. The nurses station was a shambles, with a big 
thing that looked like a portable X-ray machine toppled on its side, and 
patient files and supplies jumbled all over the floor. We turned the corner and 
ran into a woman clutching her week-old son, John. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you leaving?" asked the woman whose name I later learned was Karen. "What 
should I do?" 
</P>
<P>
 The skeleton crew of night nurses was frantically trying to find and tend to 
patients too sick or feeble to get out on their own. "Mothers!" someone yelled. 
"Do what you have to do!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Come with us," I said to Karen. Auxiliary lights were beginning to come on in 
the hospital, and a security guard appeared to guide us to the nearest 
stairwell. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here, take these," said a nurse, handing us an armload of sheets and towels 
to wrap around Karen's baby. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew was starting to cough. He had been absolutely silent until now, 
hollow-eyed with shock. But the enclosed stairwell we had entered was thick 
with plaster dust, an irritant his fragile lungs could not tolerate. I was 
desperate to get him out into the open air, but the darkness and debris in the 
stairwell forced us to descend almost at a crawl. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally we were outside, though the number of cracks in the hospital's 
exterior and chunks of debris in the courtyard convinced us to move quickly 
onward, away from any building parts that might be dislodged in an aftershock. 
</P>
<P>
 Our final camp was the center of a nearly deserted visitors parking lot, where 
we greeted the dawn like I hope never to greet one again: keeping our sons warm 
in a tent of hospital linen while sirens wailed throughout the darkened city.

EARTHQUAKE: DISASTER BEFORE DAWN; 100 MOBILE HOMES ENGULFED IN FIRES FED BY GAS 
LINES; BLAZES: AT LEAST ONE PERSON IS BADLY BURNED, ALTHOUGH THERE ARE 
APPARENTLY NO FATALITIES AT THREE VALLEY TRAILER PARKS. 'IT JUST LOOKED LIKE AN 
INFERNO,' ONE RESIDENT SAYS.

 Within minutes of Monday's massive earthquake, the orange glow of fires ringed 
the pre-dawn sky. Throughout the day, more than 30 blazes -- several of them 
major -- were reported, most in the San Fernando Valley from Granada Hills to 
Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one person suffered serious burns, but no deaths were attributed to 
any of the blazes, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials said it was not surprising that the temblor that buckled 
buildings and freeways would rip apart the gas lines believed to have sparked 
many of the blazes. An estimated 100 mobile homes at three San Fernando Valley 
trailer parks were destroyed by fires believed sparked by broken gas lines or 
ruptured propane tanks. In Sylmar, 64 trailer homes in a single lot went up in 
flames, apparently fed by a ruptured gas line. In Granada Hills, five homes 
were lost when natural gas was apparently sparked by a motorist who tried to 
start his truck. And in Pacoima, thousands of gallons of crude oil from an 
underground line spilled onto a street and ignited, sending parallel walls of 
flame racing down the block and consuming parked cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just looked like an inferno," resident Luisa Grimaldo said as she stood 
near Wolfskill Street in Pacoima. "It all just exploded." 
</P>
<P>
 As of Monday evening, firefighters said at least 30 -- and perhaps as many as 
50 -- blazes had been reported in the Valley. Fires continued into the night. 
An apartment complex in the 16000 block of Chatsworth Street in Granada Hills 
caught fire shortly before 6 p.m. and burned out of control for several hours. 
Water-dropping helicopters were called in to help battle the flames. 
</P>
<P>
 Overwhelmed by thousands of calls and with their resources stretched thin, 
fire officials at Downtown headquarters were unable to determine the exact 
location of each fire. Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Bob Collis said 
the earthquake had knocked out the department's computer system, preventing the 
officials from tracking the fires. "It's just a mess," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 With thousands of miles of natural gas lines crisscrossing below the city, it 
was inevitable that a powerful temblor would rip some of them apart, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes quite a bit of force to cause a break in the line. But in this case, 
Mother Nature just gave a much greater blow to our underground pipe system," 
said Denise King, a spokeswoman for the Southern California Gas Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Broken gas lines were not the only problem. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Tahitian Mobile Home Park in Sylmar, where 64 trailers went up in 
flames, low water pressure hampered firefighters. "It's frustrating," Battalion 
Chief Jerry Bowie said. "We were here early in the morning, and we couldn't 
save it." 
</P>
<P>
 As flames raced from one trailer to the next, ammunition stored in one mobile 
home exploded. The dull roar of an open gas main sounded in the distance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never seen such a war zone," resident Keith Bedard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it suffered the most extensive damage, the Tahitian was only one of 
several Valley mobile home parks that erupted in flames. Less than a mile away, 
a fire at the Oakridge trailer park on Glenoaks Boulevard broke out after the 
quake ruptured gas lines. Fire officials had not determined how many trailers 
were lost in the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire also laid waste to the nearby Los Olivos mobile home park, where trailers 
were turned into twisted piles of metal. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the first residences set aflame after the quake were five homes on 
Balboa Boulevard in Granada Hills that burned when a 20-inch gas line ripped 
apart. 
</P>
<P>
 According to witnesses, a pickup truck stalled on a street flooded by a broken 
water main. When the driver tried to start the truck, he apparently ignited the 
natural gas, sending a massive fireball shooting down the street. 
</P>
<P>
 He appeared to be seriously burned and was taken to a local hospital, 
witnesses said. His condition was not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
 "When that thing blew, those houses went up just like that," resident Nancy 
Bunner said. "I was wondering if we were going to get out of here alive." 
</P>
<P>
 Natural gas released into the air is a time bomb, waiting for a spark from 
matches or electrical conduits to set it off, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it ignites, it's very bad," County Fire Department spokesman Brian Jordan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wolfskill Street in Pacoima, where crude oil fueled the wall of flame, at 
least 10 cars and two homes were scorched. Frantic residents tried in vain to 
beat back the fire with garden hoses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just came down on both sides," Grimaldo said. "It was just too much."

EARTHQUAKE: DISASTER BEFORE DAWN; SPORADIC LOOTING REPORTED CITYWIDE; CRIME: 
THIEVES HIT A FAST-FOOD RESTAURANT AND CLOTHING AND VIDEO STORES. POLICE MAKE 
MORE THAN 25 ARRESTS BUT SAY THERE WAS NO FREE-FOR-ALL.

<P>
 From the Valley to Hollywood to Downtown, the looting began almost as soon as 
the ground stopped shaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Looters stole purses in Downtown Los Angeles. They grabbed coffee mugs and 
T-shirts at the Wax Museum on Hollywood Boulevard. Down the street, they stole 
a 10-inch wooden spear and a stuffed badger at a hunting and taxidermy shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Department officers made more than 25 arrests and responded 
to many other looting reports citywide. The alleged looters ranged in age from 
teen-agers to elderly women. Still, most police stations received only sporadic 
reports of problems in the hours after the first temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was no free-for-all," said Police Officer Karen Owens. 
</P>
<P>
 But victimized business owners were still angry after having to contend with a 
one-two punch -- an earthquake and then the looting. At the Sherman Oaks 
Antique Mall, shop owner Rick Johnson said one of his assistants who arrived at 
5:30 a.m. saw "a couple of little old ladies making off with a silver tea 
service." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside a women's clothing store in Downtown Los Angeles, police said they 
caught two men with armfuls of dresses, the price tags still attached. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside a Northridge video store, police caught three people checking over the 
movie selections. 
</P>
<P>
 Some property owners took matters into their own hands after they heard 
reports of looting. Dan Vandermeulen, the Neighborhood Watch coordinator for a 
mobile home park in Canyon Country, stood guard, armed with a pistol. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be out all night," he said. "Put this in your paper: Tell looters we 
will shoot them. Period." 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Goldstein, owner of a Tarzana dry cleaner, said he scared off a group of 
looters by waving a gun at them about two hours after the quake. The five, whom 
he described as teen-age boys, were taking dolls and stuffed animals out of the 
shattered windows of a gift shop next door. Goldstein said he yelled at them to 
stop and pointed his unloaded gun at them. He said the youths dropped some 
items and left in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
 In Downtown Los Angeles, police arrested nine looters for stealing items at a 
purse store, a men's clothing shop and a dress shop, Detective Tim Dotson said. 
All were taken into custody within an hour of the quake. Although Monday's 
looters did not take much time, thieves had gone to work even sooner during the 
Whittier quake in 1987, Dotson said, going into a Downtown hotel while the 
building was still swaying. 
</P>
<P>
 "People began running out of their rooms when the earthquake began . . . but 
as they ran out, other people ran into their rooms to steal their stuff," 
Dotson recalled. "They were ripping them off before the quake was over." 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday afternoon, a number of Los Angeles business owners said earthquakes 
simply are a part of life in Southern California. It is the looting, they said, 
with which they have trouble coming to terms. 
</P>
<P>
 At Number 1 Chicken in Hollywood, owner Babak Omrani said he found his 
restaurant trashed when he arrived at work early Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "They took everything, all the hamburger, chicken, french fries, everything," 
he said. "They broke the brand-new cash register. . . . They just tortured the 
whole place. We have nothing left. They broke everything we had. Everything." 
</P>
<P>
 David Bateman, a co-owner of a hunting and taxidermy shop on Hollywood 
Boulevard, said looters broke into his store and stole about 25 classic hunting 
knives, among other items. Bateman, who employs a security guard during working 
hours, was so disgusted by the looters that he is thinking of leaving Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I might pack up and say: 'Goodby, L.A.,' " he said. "I've got no insurance 
because it's too high. With a small business, how much can you pay? This is 
just terrible. It shows what kind of people we have here, what kind of city we 
are in." 
</P>
<P>
 In San Fernando, a reporter saw four young men reaching through a broken 
window at a shoe store and loading up with armfuls of women's shoes. Asked why 
they were stealing women's shoes, one of the men said: "Why not?" 
</P>
<P>
 Down the street at McMahan's Furniture -- which also stocks electronic goods 
and bicycles -- store employee Leticia Quintanilla, 33, and her husband George, 
38, were standing by with a heavy flashlight to discourage looters. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time we got here, the looters had already opened up the back," said 
Quintanilla, who stood by the store's shattered front windows. "We were driving 
up from the corner, and I saw some guys looking in. They looked like they were 
tempted, but I shook my finger at them, and they walked off. . . . The people 
who own this store are good people. It's not right to steal from them."

EARTHQUAKE: DISASTER BEFORE DAWN; EDUCATION: EMPLOYEES ARE ASKED TO REPORT FOR 
CLEANUP AND DAMAGE ASSESSMENT. BUS ROUTES MUST BE ALTERED.

 All 640 Los Angeles Unified School District campuses are closed today as 
officials embark on the giant task of assessing widespread and costly damage 
that is likely to keep many campuses closed for days, especially in the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 While students must stay home today, all district employees who can safely 
make it to work have been asked to report to their schools and offices for the 
arduous task of cleaning up badly jumbled classrooms, surveying damage and 
preparing for the reopening of class. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities will announce today a full list of school closures, openings and 
amended bus routes after a clear damage picture emerges. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are extremely fortunate that there were no children in classrooms Monday," 
said school board President Leticia Quezada, referring to the Martin Luther 
King Jr. holiday. "The closures today will give us an opportunity to figure out 
where we go from here. I would suspect there is going to be an incredible 
amount of damage." 
</P>
<P>
 Information on campus damage trickled in Monday as many principals, school 
police and maintenance workers began to survey their schools. At least 12 
schools suffered structural damage, including Kennedy High School in Granada 
Hills and University High School on the Westside.

<P>
 Despite regular earthquake preparedness sessions at Telfair Elementary School 
in Pacoima, Principal Consuelo Garcia said she was not prepared for the scene 
inside her school: light fixtures dangling by wires above children's desks, 
overturned shelves, books everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Several San Fernando Valley principals said it will take days to clean up 
their schools and expressed concern over serious structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real mess," said Vicki Montez, principal of hard-hit Morningside 
Elementary School in San Fernando. "I have floor-to-ceiling gigantic cracks in 
the walls, ceiling tiles down. I walked into my office and all I could think 
was thank God we weren't in school." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Supt. Ruben Zacarias said early indications show that many schools have 
burst water mains. A water tank atop the roof of Bravo Medical Magnet High 
School in East Los Angeles toppled, drenching the classrooms below. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahead lies a mammoth logistical task as officials decide how to reroute school 
buses for 22,000 students and identify alternative school sites for children 
whose campuses are badly damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Ivy, a district busing supervisor, expressed concern that numerous 
traffic hazards may impede school buses and said any new routes will be 
carefully mapped. 
</P>
<P>
 Even an earthquake could not quell strife between the district and its 
teachers union, as United Teachers-Los Angeles President Helen Bernstein 
sharply criticized the request for employees to report to work today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm telling teachers that in my opinion it is unsafe to go to school," 
Bernstein said. "We certainly don't expect anyone to endanger themselves. What 
really irks me about this is no one from Downtown bothered to tell me." 
</P>
<P>
 Zacarias said that safety should be the top concern when deciding whether to 
report to work. He said employees will not lose pay if they decide it is unsafe 
to return.

EARTHQUAKE: DISASTER BEFORE DAWN; DEATH, FICKLE IN THE RUINS, TAKES AT LEAST 
33; VICTIMS: COLLAPSED APARTMENT BUILDING CLAIMED AT LEAST 15. A BUCKLED 
FREEWAY KILLED ANOTHER. MANY DIED AT THE EPICENTER, BUT ONE WAS 102 MILES AWAY.

 It was, as always, the most fickle of catastrophes, bestowing death with 
nature's cold caprice: Fifteen from a stucco Northridge apartment building. Two 
from a million-dollar home in Sherman Oaks. One from Skid Row. One from the 
ranks of the Los Angeles police. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Ann Brace, mother of two, was in her home in Rancho Cucamonga, 102 
miles from the epicenter of Monday's Northridge quake. Death found her anyway. 
When she ran to check the baby, officials said, she apparently tripped on a 
toy, fell and dashed her skull against her child's crib. Her husband, a 
gray-haired, bespectacled man, was in the next room checking on their 
5-year-old son. By Monday afternoon, he said, he still had not mustered the 
courage to tell his children their mother is gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Brace's death was the most distant, but it was by no means the only one. By 
nightfall, the death toll from the 6.6 magnitude earthquake had reached an 
unofficial count of 33. At least six were victims of heart attacks. The others 
were casualties of chaos and its aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the stucco-and-steel rubble that had been the Northridge Meadows 
apartment complex on Reseda Boulevard, firefighters had found 15 bodies by late 
Monday, all from the flattened first floor. Survivors said the three-story 
building began to collapse when the first jolts of the quake knocked out the 
ground-floor pilings that supported the parking garage. 
</P>
<P>
 As the earth rolled, they said, the middle floors collapsed as if they were a 
house of cards. First, witnesses said, the air was filled with screams. Then it 
was suffused with silence. Among the youngest victims was a 14-year-old boy, 
Howard Lee, who had left his boarding school to visit his parents. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the pitch-black overpass where the Antelope Valley Freeway segues into 
the Golden State; an LAPD motorcycle officer plunged to his death when his 
vehicle catapulted over a gaping hole in the buckled asphalt. Witnesses 
watched, horrified, as Clarence Wayne Dean, 46, of Lancaster, a 26-year veteran 
of the force, flew off the edge of the bridge and plummeted 40 feet to the 
pavement below. 
</P>
<P>
 "His lights were still flashing and he just came tumbling down," said Andy 
Jimenez, 33, of Santa Clarita. "It was unreal." 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD Lt. John Dunkin said Dean apparently did not realize in the dark that the 
freeway had collapsed, and he was unable to stop in time. Dean, assigned to the 
Valley Traffic Division, is survived by a 26-year-old son, Dunkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Room 610 of a Skid Row flophouse, a mentally ill former convict died 
without a witness to say whether it was an accident or a suicide. Jose 
Hernandez either fell or jumped from his open window when the Frontier Hotel at 
Main and 5th streets began to sway. Authorities did not discover his body until 
about 15 minutes later, when security guards began to evacuate the 
establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said it appeared that Hernandez, a transient in his 40s, was taken by 
surprise when the building began to shudder and that he fell accidentally. But 
the manager of the hotel, where he had stayed off and on since November, said 
Hernandez's parole officer had described him as unstable; he speculated that 
the man had "panicked and jumped." 
</P>
<P>
 * On a canyontop cul-de-sac in Sherman Oaks, on a street known for its 
breathtaking views, Mark Yupp, a 31-year-old entertainment industry executive, 
and his 32-year-old fiancee, Kerry, were found dead in what was left of their 
downstairs bedroom. Police said the two were apparently asleep when the quake 
uprooted their hillside home. Beams and wiring, furniture and concrete were 
scattered for more than 100 yards down the slope from the house's foundation, 
punctuated in two spots by the wreckage of their cars, a BMW and a Porsche. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a dozen neighbors, barefoot and shivering, tried to rescue the 
couple, digging frantically with their hands. But when aftershocks hit, they 
said, they were forced to run to safety. Only the couple's whimpering puppy 
survived. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone yelled up the street in the darkness, 'Dial 911! The house here went 
down the hill, the cars, everything!' " said Chuck Mitchell, 53, a retired 
sheriff's deputy who was staying in a nearby house. "We all ran down there with 
our flashlights, but we couldn't see anything. The house was totally gone." 
</P>
<P>
 * Nearby, in the 3600 block of Beverly Ridge Drive, another mountainview home 
was knocked off its stilts and down the side of a canyon, trapping and killing 
a 4-year-old girl. Bert Lockwood, a neighbor whose own home sustained 
considerable damage, said it took firefighters about two hours to scramble down 
the hill and cut through the debris with chainsaws to free the home's owners, 
Stas Vigil and Nancy Tyere. But it was not until midmorning, he said, that 
rescue workers were able to locate their daughter, Amy. Lockwood said he 
watched sadly as the workers wrapped the little body in a blanket and took her 
away. "You could look down the hill and see teddy bears and pink blankets," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The child was the youngest known casualty late Monday, authorities said, but 
they warned that the toll probably will rise. 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency workers said Monday that it will take as long as two weeks to clear 
the debris from the spot where the Antelope Valley Freeway collapsed onto the 
Golden State and to unearth any vehicles that might have been crushed there. 
And several of those injured at Northridge Meadows remained in critical 
condition Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, as night fell, coroner's investigators continued to increase the 
death toll: a Chatsworth man who was fatally struck on the head by a falling 
object inside his mobile home. A 45-year-old man in the Fairfax area who also 
suffered a fatal head injury. A 92-year-old woman who died in a trailer fire in 
Northridge. And a 25-year-old Sherman Oaks man who was electrocuted when he 
touched a wire. 
</P>
<P>
 As coroners' investigators struggled to identify the dead, survivors grappled 
with the devastation of sudden loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a hard time explaining how she fell so hard," said Brace's stricken 
husband, Thomas, 49, standing red-eyed in the pastel living room of their 
four-bedroom Rancho Cucamonga home. Surrounded by a litter of Aladdin coloring 
books and baby toys, Brace seemed stunned as he recounted the particulars of 
their life. 
</P>
<P>
 He and Elizabeth, he said, had married late and had moved from Lomita to the 
Inland Empire because they could afford a bigger home and she could afford to 
become a full-time homemaker and mom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything was exactly as we had planned it," he said. "Except we didn't plan 
this morning." 
</P>
<P>
 They were in bed, he said, when they felt the jolt. They waited a moment 
before rising to check on the children. He went to their daughter's room while 
she ran to check on their son, 17 months. He heard a thump, he said, and found 
his wife unconscious near the crib. 
</P>
<P>
 San Bernardino County Coroner's Deputy Monika Padilla said an autopsy is 
pending, "but from the looks of things, it looked like she just hit the crib 
the wrong way -- like it was just one of those freak accidents." 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband was at a loss for words. Asked to describe his wife, he looked 
blankly at a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved her very much," was all he could say. The Toll 
</P>
<P>
 A magnitude 6.6 earthquake, centered in Northridge, struck at 4:31 a.m. 
Monday. Officials reported the following: 
</P>
<P>
 * DAMAGE: Sections of several freeways and highways were closed after 
suffering major damage. Utility service was disrupted for hundreds of thousands 
of people. Damage to homes and businesses was reported as far north as Fillmore 
and as far south as Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 * DEATHS: At least 33 deaths were reported, 15 at the Northridge Meadows 
apartments. Hundreds of people throughout the area were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 * CURFEW: Mayor Richard Riordan declared a citywide curfew, making it illegal 
for people to remain on the streets between dusk and dawn.

Worker Trapped Eight Hours 
</P>
<P>
 A maintenance worker was trapped for eight hours under eight feet of concrete 
at Northridge Fashion Center. The southwest parking structure collapsed as the 
man was cleaning the lot. He suffered crushed legs and a partially dislocated 
spine. How he was freed: 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters tried to open up enough space in the rubble to extricate him. 
They slipped deflated rubber air bags into crevices, pumping air into them to 
raise collapsed concrete slabs. They continued to open up space by alternately 
wedging in 4x4 wood poles and air bags until the man could be pulled out. 
</P>
<P>
 A Lifesaving Wedge 
</P>
<P>
 * Flat bag can be squeezed into a tight space. 
</P>
<P>
 * As air is added, bag expands, enlarging space around it. 
</P>
<P>
 * Handles are used to maneuver bag into position. Northridge Apartment 
Collapse 
</P>
<P>
 Three stories became two when the Northridge Meadows Apartments collapsed. 
About 40 first-floor apartments were compacted, killing at least 14 people. One 
section remained intact, with visible vertical splits. To rescue trapped 
first-floor residents, firefighters used a "hydraulic cushion" of compressed 
air to lift a corner of the 160-unit stucco structure.

EARTHQUAKE: DISASTER BEFORE DAWN; WHOLESALE DEVASTATION RIPS APART NORTHRIDGE; 
EPICENTER: SUBURBAN COMMUNITY BECOMES A SCENE OF FATALITIES AND MIRACLE RESCUES 
-- IMAGES SEEN BY THE NATION AND MUCH OF WORLD. 
</P>

<P>
 Portions of their mall collapsed. The roof on their university's library caved 
in. Smoke billowed from science buildings and city streets as residents took to 
their roofs with hoses to fight back flames -- at least the lucky ones did. 
</P>
<P>
 This was suburban Northridge, the epicenter of Monday's earthquake, the scene 
of more than half the fatalities, several miracle rescues and, in general, 
wholesale devastation. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere was the toll more evident than at the Northridge Meadows apartments, 
where a three-story complex lurched six feet to one side before collapsing into 
its first floor. At least 15 people died and many others were trapped for hours 
in scenes broadcast round the world. 
</P>
<P>
 But the disaster also wreaked havoc at Cal State Northridge, the Northridge 
Fashion Center and countless single family streets that make up the foundation 
of this prototypal bedroom suburb of 65,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be good here. I think it's still going to be good," said resident 
Joseph Momjin, an inspector for Continental Airlines. "But let's wait and see 
if we're done." 
</P>
<P>
 In a day of repeated aftershocks, he would conclude: "We're not done yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, at 28,000-student CSUN, fires erupted in chemical-laden science 
buildings, a four-level parking garage collapsed and chunks of the library roof 
fell off. 
</P>
<P>
 A damage estimate was not expected until today, but the library is a prized 
facility, housing a $2-million robotic retrieval system -- dubbed Leviathan II 
-- for its collection, earning billing as the world's first fully automated 
library. 
</P>
<P>
 No dollar estimates could be placed on the fear emanating from the sprawling 
campus as black smoke rose from multiple blazes in three science buildings, 
where hazardous and low-level radioactive materials are stored. The blazes were 
spread by 30 to 40 explosions that blew out lab windows. 
</P>
<P>
 University officials sealed off the area temporarily, fearful that hazardous 
materials might be released into the air. But in one of the few pieces of good 
news, fire officials managed to contain the flames before they reached the 
radioactive substances. 
</P>
<P>
 A load of sulfuric acid spilled, however, when the quake jolted four 
locomotives and 24 cars of a freight train off the tracks south of the 
Northridge Fashion Center, prompting an emergency cleanup effort. 
</P>
<P>
 On the streets of Northridge, an oil line exploded and the resulting fire 
claimed rows of parked cars. Later, steam billowed from the pavement alongside 
the burned hulks of the vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 As residents of the primarily middle-class professional community tried to 
calm their jittery nerves, helicopters flew overhead, gawkers armed with video 
cameras flooded the streets and blaring fire engines streamed past. 
</P>
<P>
 While the nation, and much of the world, received a collage of images from 
around the community, few here could see much past their block -- much less the 
televised images of scientists at Caltech describing their home as the 
epicenter of what many called the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "The film has been showing all over the nation. But we haven't seen it. We 
have no television, no electricity, no water," said nine-year resident Bruce 
Andrew, a scout for baseball's Colorado Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be a zoo around here for quite a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of his neighbors had no place to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 At the corner of Andrea Circle and Lindley Avenue, three longtime residents of 
the Northridge Townhome Estates sat in lawn chairs at the curb, staring at the 
smoldering wood, pipes and other debris that used to be their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventeen townhomes caught fire early Monday, apparently after a gas line 
burst. In less than an hour, the entire block was engulfed as a shortage of 
water severely hampered firefighters' efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we had water in the hydrants, we could have made a better stand," Fire 
Capt. Don Sawyer said. "Between the shortage of water and the wood shake roofs, 
it was like trying to swim against a waterfall." 
</P>
<P>
 Marian Bogrow and her husband, Milt, said they had lived in the townhome 
development since it was built 16 years ago -- but weren't planning to move 
back even if it is rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's time to move on," she said with a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
 More fortunate Northridge residents sought to prepare for the uncertain 
immediate future. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Ralphs supermarket at the corner of Reseda Boulevard and Devonshire 
Street, lines formed for $2 containers of water. At a nearby Lucky, supermarket 
workers gave away water and batteries until they ran out of stock by 
mid-morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Further shaken by a continuing series of aftershocks, many residents brought 
their remaining glassware, ceramics and other breakable valuables onto their 
lawns, giving the community the appearance of a massive yard sale. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Fashion Center mall, a popular landmark noted for its crowded corridors 
and tony department stores, the roof of Bullock's collapsed and its distinctive 
geometric facade almost slipped completely off. 
</P>
<P>
 The strongest drama at the center occurred as firefighters braved aftershocks 
that rocked a collapsed parking structure to rescue a maintenance worker who 
had been buried in his street sweeper for more than seven hours under more than 
20 tons of concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was in a lot of pain and he kept saying 'Come down and pray with me, come 
down and pray,' " said Rey Lavalle, a city firefighter who communicated with 
the man, Salvador Pena, in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Blasting their way through slabs of concrete, the firefighters risked their 
lives to reach Pena -- who was airlifted to UCLA Medical Center with crushed 
legs and a partially dislocated spine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I almost cried," fire Capt. Jim Vandell said after the rescue. "I was elated. 
We all were."

 The lifelines of water, electricity and natural gas that keep the sprawling 
Los Angeles metropolis working suffered some serious fractures Monday, most 
spectacularly shown in a fire at a cracked underground gas line in the northern 
San Fernando Valley and breaks in the two main aqueducts carrying water from 
Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of thousands of area households were still without gas, power or 
water by Monday evening and authorities said it could take several days for 
full service to be restored. Residents of the Valley and neighborhoods north of 
Sunset Boulevard and west of Western Avenue were being warned to boil water 
before drinking in case of contamination through pipe cracks. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials were unable to estimate the damage in dollars to crucial 
infrastructure, but they expressed relief that the vast networks of pipes and 
transmission stations were not devastated even more. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, the most worrisome damage 
was at an electrical converter station on Sepulveda Boulevard in Sylmar that 
receives power from hydroelectric plants in the Pacific Northwest and 
distributes it into local grids. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a major, major loss," said DWP spokeswoman Dorothy Jensen. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, several transmission towers bringing power into the San Fernando Valley 
from a generating facility at Castaic Lake were damaged, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the interdependence of Western power grids, brief power outages 
caused by the quake were reported as far north as Portland and Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the Los Angeles area lost electricity in the quake, and about 520,000 
of the DWP's 1.4 million customers had not had their power restored by 
nightfall, officials said. In areas outside of the city of Los Angeles, 
Southern California Edison had restored power to all but 150,000 homes and 
businesses by late afternoon -- and hoped to whittle that number down to 50,000 
by nightfall. 
</P>
<P>
 The DWP had no count of how many households and businesses had lost water 
service, but the agency warned that wide swaths of the western San Fernando 
Valley might have low pressure or no water at all for days. 
</P>
<P>
 The water service problems are mainly caused by electrical outages that 
cripple pumping stations, said DWP official Jan Merlo. "At this point, it's 
very difficult to say what the power situation is, so we are asking people to 
conserve water," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The older of the two aqueducts bringing water from the Owens Valley broke in 
an area south of Soledad Canyon near Santa Clarita. Water flow was shifted to 
the second aqueduct, which was later shut down after a crack was discovered in 
a section north of Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
 Repairs on both concrete tubes -- 90 inches and 72 inches in diameter -- were 
said to be under way. Authorities were not calling it an emergency because 
water supplies were said to be plentiful in a dozen area reservoirs. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no reports of major damage at area reservoirs or dams. But a major 
trunk line out of the Los Angeles reservoir complex in the Sylmar area sprung a 
five-foot-long leak and a filtration plant in that area was damaged, causing 
service problems in Simi Valley, Ventura County and the city of Los Angeles, 
according to the Southern California Metropolitan Water District, the regional 
water wholesaler. 
</P>
<P>
 The main gas problems involved breaks in four high-pressure transmission 
pipelines in the San Fernando Valley, including one that erupted into flames on 
Balboa Boulevard in Northridge, destroying two nearby structures. Those four 
breaks were later controlled through shut-off valves and transmissions were 
rerouted, said Rich Nemec, a spokesman for the Southern California Gas Co. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 150 gas distribution lines and individual service lines ruptured, 
contributing to fires in some cases. All those breaks were reportedly under 
control by noon. By Monday night, Nemec said, about 18,000 of the 4.7 million 
customers of Southern California Gas remained without service, a situation that 
may continue for several days. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel pretty good in the way our own facilities have held up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Thomas O'Rourke, a Cornell University expert on the effects of quakes 
on pipelines, said many more gas and water lines may have fractured than 
originally known, with further fires possible over the next few days. He said 
that the rupture of a water line under Balboa Boulevard may have caused 
underground erosion, undermining the nearby 22-inch gas line that burst into 
flames Monday.

EARTHQUAKE: DISASTER BEFORE DAWN; FEDERAL OFFICIALS GEAR UP RELIEF EFFORTS; 
RESPONSE: CLINTON CONFERS WITH STATE LEADERS AND SIGNS DISASTER DECLARATION. HE 
SENDS AIDES TO LOS ANGELES BUT DOESN'T PLAN PERSONAL VISIT YET. 
</P>

<P>
 Federal officials Monday cranked up the machinery to pour monetary salve on 
Southern California's wounds for the third time in less than two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ask the American people to remember the people of Los Angeles County in 
their thoughts and prayers," said President Clinton, who was informed of the 
earthquake about half an hour after it struck. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton spent much of the morning meeting with aides and talking on the 
telephone with Gov. Pete Wilson and Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan. He then 
dispatched several Cabinet members to Los Angeles to assess damage and plan a 
response. Shortly after 2 p.m. PST, he signed a formal disaster declaration 
that will release federal relief funds for the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We intend to do everything we possibly can to help," Clinton said earlier in 
the day, before opening a ceremony remembering the birthday of Dr. Martin 
Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government has $1 billion available in its emergency relief 
account, and officials said Clinton would ask Congress to appropriate more if 
necessary. White House officials said, however, they do not expect preliminary 
cost estimates until today. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before Clinton signed the declaration, federal emergency officials began 
their assistance -- from U-2 spy planes flying overhead to look for fires and 
signs of further movement, to medical and search-and-rescue teams on the ground 
helping local officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've mobilized about all the resources we can," said White House Chief of 
Staff Thomas (Mack) McLarty. 
</P>
<P>
 But with Southern California already well prepared for earthquake response, 
the bulk of the federal effort will come later as Washington tries to help 
individuals, families, businesses and local governments with recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big damage will be the highways," McLarty said. Transportation Secretary 
Federico Pena and Federal Highway Administrator Rodney Slater will be among the 
senior officials traveling to Los Angeles today. 
</P>
<P>
 The President said he would like to go to Los Angeles to see the damage 
personally but doesn't "want to get in the way." A presidential visit could 
compound the already difficult traffic conditions, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton dispatched White House aide John Emerson, a former deputy city 
attorney in Los Angeles, to head the federal response. James Lee Witt, director 
of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Housing Secretary Henry G. Cisneros 
and Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy were also en route to California. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to helping pay for highway reconstruction, the federal government 
will offer low-income loans for homeowners and businesses, housing assistance 
for up to 18 months for those displaced by the disaster and other forms of 
emergency aid. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency still has outreach offices open in the 
Los Angeles area to help victims of last fall's fires. Additional offices may 
be opened, with FEMA staff flying in from Denver to assist California-based 
staff with the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the cost of the earthquake to the federal Treasury almost certainly 
will be far higher than the cost of the fires, not only because of the damage 
to freeways but also because private insurance generally covers far more of the 
cost of fire damage than of earthquake losses, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, officials said, no reliable damage estimates are available. "It's 
pretty bad, is all I can say," said FEMA director Witt. 
</P>
<P>
 As news of the disaster rolled in throughout the day, White House aides -- 
particularly the many California natives on Clinton's team -- stared at 
television sets and hoped to hear word from relatives in the region.  
</P>
<P>
 Clinton himself, shortly after being told of the earthquake by Housing 
Secretary Cisneros, called his brother, Roger, who lives in a Los Angeles 
apartment, to make sure he was all right. He was. 
</P>
<P>
 White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers had somewhat less luck. She told 
reporters she had been unable to reach her relatives. Family friends told her 
that her parents were fine but that the quake noticeably damaged their house, 
which is not far from where a section of the Antelope Valley Freeway plunged 
onto the Golden State Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Others marveled at the string of disasters, both natural and man-made, that 
have befallen the region lately. The 1993 fires, some of which were 
deliberately set, came 18 months after the 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles has certainly had more than its share," McLarty said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first signs of more tangible federal assistance were special medical units 
and urban search-and-rescue teams organized by FEMA. The teams, made up 
primarily of firefighters from other Western cities, were dispatched early in 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA expects to have 1,000 people to help with disaster relief over the next 
few days, said Richard Krimm, FEMA's associate director for response and 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think all federal agencies will respond to this better than we did in 
Hurricane Andrew because we're better prepared," Krimm said. "We no longer wait 
for the state to request specific assistance, we go right in." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal disaster assistance teams already in or on their way to the 
quake-stricken area included four special medical units, several mobile 
communication systems capable of providing satellite and microwave telephone 
hookups, and 12 urban search-and-rescue teams, eight of which are based in 
California and four from other Western states. 
</P>
<P>
 The search-and-rescue units include dogs, tunneling experts and listening 
devices to detect victims who may be buried in collapsed buildings. The medical 
units are "basically civilian versions of Army M.A.S.H. units" and will set up 
mobile field hospitals, FEMA spokesman Phil Cogan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Krimm said FEMA also expects to send water purification units, firefighting 
equipment and more mobile communication networks to the Los Angeles area over 
the next 24 hours. "While we don't have any assessment of this as yet, we can 
also set up food kitchens and provide tents if need be." 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether, more than two dozen federal agencies are ready to help state and 
local disaster programs, Witt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the Army Corps of Engineers were beginning inspections of dams to 
check for quake-related flaws. The Department of Housing and Urban Development 
plans to assess longer-term shelter needs, and Transportation Department 
officials will be joining their state and local counterparts to inspect 
highways.

EARTHQUAKE: DISASTER BEFORE DAWN; THE SILVER LINING IN L.A.'S STRING OF PERILS: 
FAST ACTION; RELIEF: THE FEMA DIRECTOR SAYS EMERGENCY OFFICE IS ALREADY SET UP. 
IT IS THE ONE STILL OPEN SINCE THE FIRES, WHICH IS THE ONE STILL OPEN SINCE THE 
RIOTS. 
</P>

 When he was roused from sleep with the news of the earthquake, the director of 
the Federal Emergency Management Agency was relieved, in an odd way, that the 
fires that scorched Southern California last year caused him to keep open the 
disaster relief office that had been set up in response to the Los Angeles 
riots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't say it's fortunate" that the Los Angeles area has had such a 
string of disasters, said James Lee Witt, the director of FEMA, said on an 
airplane en route to California. "But at least people were there in place. It 
saves the two or three days that it would normally take to set up a disaster 
relief office." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to expediting services to disaster victims, this gives FEMA -- an 
agency working hard to improve an image damaged by sluggish responses to past 
disasters, such as Hurricane Andrew, a chance to look good. 
</P>
<P>
 "What it really helps is that the state and federal agencies are already in 
position for a coordinated response," said Witt, the chief strategist for 
federal disaster relief efforts. "They were already coordinating from the very 
instant (the quake) happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Such disaster relief field offices usually function for a few weeks or months 
after a disaster. The fires broke out just as FEMA was planning to close the 
office it opened in response to the riots. Last week, FEMA officials were 
talking again about eliminating it. But as they made their way through an ice 
storm in Washington to get to the airport to fly to Los Angeles, they discussed 
making it permanent. 
</P>
<P>
 During the plane trip across the continent, Witt was briefed by his assistants 
and studied maps, charts and news releases. He conferred with staff from the 
White House and various departments and with Secretary of Housing and Urban 
Development Henry G. Cisneros. 
</P>
<P>
 The President sent Witt, Cisneros and Transportation Secretary Federico Pena 
to California to assess the damage and report back to him. He decided against 
going immediately himself because he did not want his arrival to detract from 
the serious work of disaster relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President does not want to get in the way of the response," said Witt, 
who was dressed for a disaster in blue jeans and ostrich-leather boots. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day, FEMA mobilized about 400 urban search-and-rescue workers, 
several medical assistance teams and disaster assessment squads from places as 
far-flung as Fairfax, Va., El Paso, Tex., and King County, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I talked to the President this morning, he said how important it was 
that we provide whatever resources we have available to the state and local 
government to be able to meet the needs of the disaster victims," Witt said. 
</P>
<P>
 To pay for initial relief efforts, the federal government has discretionary 
funds available left over from the $2 billion Congress allocated in response to 
the floods in the Midwest last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros, who was charged by the President with managing the federal 
assistance to the South Florida regions hit by Hurricane Andrew, said the 
Clinton Administration will not make the same mistake with this quake that the 
Bush Administration was criticized for: delayed response. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no time lag here at all," Cisneros said. "They were clearly on the 
job within a half an hour. None of the recriminations that characterized the 
Hurricane Andrew situation -- who's on first, who's on second, who's 
responsibility is it -- are applicable." 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros said that the federal role will be to fill in the gaps and help the 
local officials, not direct the response. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is important to support the efforts of local officials, assess where they 
need help and look at spaces where additional resources are needed to create a 
seamless intergovernmental team," Cisneros said.

EARTHQUAKE: DISASTER BEFORE DAWN; NEWS ANALYSIS; RADIO WAS THE LIFELINE, BUT TV 
PROVIDED PATHOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Just months after the trauma of devastating fires, Southern Californians 
endured a new round of frightening TV reports Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge quake followed recent edgy TV reports about a succession of 
smaller temblors. 
</P>
<P>
 For many residents, however, the terror of the moment became even more 
uncertain when they could not see the effects of the killer quake because power 
outages blacked out TV in some areas. For those people, radio coverage became 
the main conduit of information. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, though, the burden of responsible, non-inflammatory coverage fell 
heavily on Los Angeles television stations, which all stuck with the biggest 
L.A. area quake in 23 years for hours on end, handling themselves respectably, 
for the most part. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the daily crime-story obsession of stations such as KNBC Channel 4, 
the local channels -- particularly since the verdicts in the Rodney G. King 
civil rights case and Reginald O. Denny beating trial, and last fall's fires -- 
seem to have responded to angry criticism from the public and have mostly toned 
down their sensationalism on major breaking events that have racked the 
Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's quake also got lengthy, enormous play across the nation, from ABC's 
"Good Morning America" to "CBS This Morning" to CNN, with extended reports 
using coverage from Los Angeles stations and involving such anchors as Jane 
Pauley, Connie Chung and Ted Koppel. NBC's Tom Brokaw and ABC's Peter Jennings 
flew to Los Angeles to anchor their nightly newscasts from the site of the 
story. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton took to national television twice by early afternoon to 
commiserate with Southern Californians and promise aid. In the morning, he 
said, "There's been a severe disruption of life there." In the afternoon, he 
added that "the people of Southern California have been through a lot lately," 
from the fires to the economy to the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no single local reporter dominated coverage of Monday's big shake the 
way David Horowitz captured the audience during the 1971 Sylmar quake, poignant 
vignettes followed one after another in the latest scare. 
</P>
<P>
 But a disturbing failure was the relatively scant attention paid to reaction 
to the quake in such minority areas as South-Central and East Los Angeles. At 
one point, in typically absurd fashion, KCBS Channel 2 went to the inevitable 
shots of rich areas populated by celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
 Although radio may have been more effective than TV in informing residents 
about the damage, audio reports could not come close to the eerie image of KABC 
Channel 7's Marc Brown walking alone along the broken and empty Santa Monica 
Freeway. "The freeway seems to have dropped about 15 feet," he said, pointing 
at a spot where two cars had hit an abruptly raised portion of the freeway and 
crashed out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 Viewers saw mobile homes go up in flames in Sylmar. "We had maybe 15 minutes 
to get out of here with our lives," a resident told KCBS Channel 2. The shots 
of damage at a Northridge shopping center were unsettling. Mayor Richard 
Riordan, wearing a Lakers sweat shirt, told viewers in a brief message: "Let's 
all stay cool." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the recent catastrophes that have hit Los Angeles, several reporters 
seemed taken back by the enormity of the damage. At one point, reporter Frank 
Buckley of KCAL Channel 9 showed a heavily damaged house on a San Fernando 
Valley hillside. "What you're looking at is a house that is gone . . . just 
gone," he said, almost in disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
 KABC reporter Bob Banfield was shocked when several customers standing outside 
a supermarket in Chatsworth suddenly converged on a tall cart loaded down with 
meat. "I'm not even sure people are paying for this," said Banfield in an 
incredulous tone, adding that the manager of the store may not have used the 
best technique for distributing the food. 
</P>
<P>
 KTLA's Stan Chambers was outstanding with his lengthy, detailed coverage of 
firefighters' hours-long rescue of a man trapped in a collapsed parking 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
 But mostly, TV viewers watched yet another Los Angeles nightmare on a very bad 
day.

OPPOSITION TO VIOLENCE, ASSAULT WEAPONS ARE FOCUS OF KING DAY

 President Clinton lamented violence in the streets, the New York Legislature 
began a special session on assault weapons, and Ohio activists marched on Ku 
Klux Klan leaders' homes as people across the nation marked Martin Luther King 
Day with a burst of activism. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said the slain civil rights leader would be pained to know his country 
had done so little to bring peace. He suggested King would ask, "How come this 
is so?" 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, who has been accused by some civil rights activists of talking more 
than acting, also announced the start of an "empowerment zone" community 
development program and signed an executive order on housing discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech at Howard University, Clinton saluted King as the nation's premier 
voice "for human rights and human potential." 
</P>
<P>
 Coretta Scott King, on the day marking the 65th birthday anniversary of her 
husband, said poverty and injustice do not justify violence and brutality. 
</P>
<P>
 "No injustice, no matter how great, can excuse even a single act of violence 
against another human being," Mrs. King said in her annual "State of the Dream" 
speech in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 But racial divisions also were apparent on the holiday. In New York City, 
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani told a mostly black audience that he was troubled by 
reports many blacks fear him. A black woman shouted at him, "We find you 
despicable." 
</P>
<P>
 Giuliani, who is white, defeated David N. Dinkins, the city's first black 
mayor, last year in a bitterly contested election. 
</P>
<P>
 In Albany, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo was interrupted several times by applause when 
he spoke at a holiday ceremony about banning assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ohio, activists turned their attention to the Ku Klux Klan, trudging 
through snow to stage protests against klansmen in their own neighborhoods, 
including demonstrations at klan leaders' homes in Cleveland and Coshocton, 
about 50 miles east of Columbus. There were no reports of violence or arrests.

ADMINISTRATION INDICATES IT WILL CONTINUE INDONESIA'S PREFERENTIAL TRADE 
TREATMENT; ASIA: MOVE PUTS U.S. IN A DIPLOMATIC MINEFIELD AS IT TRIES TO FOSTER 
HUMAN RIGHTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the midst of a full-drawn campaign to boost the United States' economic 
clout in Asia, the Clinton Administration stepped gingerly Monday through the 
minefield of human rights in a growing, $3-billion market, indicating that it 
will continue Indonesia's preferential trade treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, embarking on a weeklong visit to Indonesia, 
Thailand and China, said he urged President Suharto in a private meeting to 
relax quickly his opposition to expanding Indonesia's extremely limited labor 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Using cautious language about a nation where, human rights monitors say, labor 
organizers have been jailed and beaten by soldiers, and where the military has 
intimidated labor negotiators, Bentsen said, "We're seeing progress take place 
in Indonesia; we hope for more." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials made it clear that President Clinton, who is scheduled to visit 
Indonesia next fall for a meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation 
forum, is unlikely to come down hard on Indonesia and remove the duty-free 
treatment given to its exports to the United States -- a step that would be 
likely to prompt retaliation and would sour U.S. ties with an important and 
growing customer. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, they said, a temporary extension of the preferential treatment is the 
almost-certain course. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is more than protection of human rights in general and the rights of 
workers in particular to organize unions, important as those matters may be. 
With a growth rate over the last two decades that far outpaces that of the West 
-- it ranged from 5.5% to 7% a year for each of the past five years -- 
Indonesia exemplifies the economic explosion occurring in the developing 
nations of Asia, among the fastest-growing and most competitive markets in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the debate brings into potential conflict the moral leadership 
traditionally assumed by Washington, Clinton's own commitment to human rights 
and the politically important role that trade with Asia can play in building 
job-creating exports for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a debate that will be continued when Bentsen arrives later in the week 
in China, where Clinton is under pressure to remove the trade benefits he 
extended for a year last June unless progress is demonstrated on a wide range 
of human rights issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue is coming to a head in Jakarta because the White House must decide 
by Feb. 15 whether to continue the duty-free status given to many of 
Indonesia's exports under the trade provisions known as the Generalized System 
of Preferences. Indonesia is expected to present details of its case to 
officials in Washington on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Last June, Jakarta was given an eight-month extension, under an annual review 
conducted by the federal government, after the Administration said it was "very 
seriously concerned" because Indonesia did not conform to internationally 
accepted labor rights. Across the 3,500-mile chain of islands that make up 
Indonesia, there is one government-sanctioned labor union. 
</P>
<P>
 In issuing the extension in June, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said 
the export benefits would be in "serious jeopardy" if Jakarta could not 
demonstrate "substantial concrete progress."

BOSNIA'S SERBS THREATEN 'ALL-OUT WAR' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb leaders threatened Monday to unleash "all-out war" against the 
Muslim-led government if coming peace talks end without agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "This round of negotiations will mark a definite turning point," Radovan 
Karadzic, leader of the self-proclaimed Serbian state in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
told a Serbian assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it becomes clear there will be no peace, we shall have to prepare for 
all-out war," said Karadzic, adding that the Serbs would launch an offensive to 
capture about 20% of the land now held by the government. 
</P>
<P>
 The heavily armed Serbs currently hold 70% of Bosnia after 21 months of war, 
while the government holds about 15% and Croats hold the rest.

RABIN PLEDGES NATIONAL REFERENDUM ON ANY GOLAN HEIGHTS WITHDRAWAL; MIDEAST: 
GOVERNMENT MAKES IT CLEAR THAT ANY DEAL WITH SYRIA WOULD HAVE TO BE SOLD TO A 
VERY SKEPTICAL NATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's government pledged Monday to hold a national 
referendum on any major Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights as a result 
of a peace agreement with Syria. 
</P>
<P>
 Mordechai Gur, the deputy defense minister, told the Israeli Knesset, or 
Parliament, that Rabin would seek popular approval -- in effect, a renewal of 
the mandate for peace he won in June, 1992, elections -- before pulling troops 
off the strategic plateau. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this stage, I want to make clear that if the territorial price demanded 
from us on the Golan Heights is substantial, the government will bring this to 
a referendum," Gur told the Knesset, stressing that he was speaking for Rabin. 
</P>
<P>
 In terms of negotiations with Syria, the declaration made clear that Rabin 
considered himself bound by public opinion -- that any deal would have to be 
sold to a very skeptical nation for which the Golan Heights are a key element 
in its defenses and for which retreat from the region would be psychologically 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rabin was also challenging the vociferous opposition Likud Party not in 
the general election that it seeks but in a popular contest in which political 
odds currently favor his Labor Party. He was thus making clear his 
determination to reach a comprehensive peace with all Israel's Arab neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, Gur's declaration was Israel's cautiously affirmative response to 
overtures from Syrian President Hafez Assad who, in a meeting Sunday with 
President Clinton in Geneva, declared his readiness for a full and normal peace 
with the Jewish state. 
</P>
<P>
 Gur, a former army chief of staff, signaled Israel's readiness to make the 
necessary withdrawals -- even the total pullout sought by Assad -- in return 
for regional stability and for peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a very strong country," Gur said. "We will provide a solution to the 
security of Israel. . . . On the basis of our strength, it is our duty to take 
the calculated risk." 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the 13,000 Israeli settlers on the Golan Heights, convinced that 
the country supports them, welcomed Gur's declaration as an answer to their 
long campaign against territorial concessions there. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very pleased," said Yehuda Wohlman, one of the campaign's leaders. "I 
see this as an extraordinary achievement in our struggle. It's good that the 
prime minister has been so sensitive to our feelings." 
</P>
<P>
 But Environment Minister Yossi Sarid of the leftist Meretz bloc objected to 
the referendum pledge, saying that the government had neither discussed nor 
decided on this and already had an electoral mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The subject has never been deliberated in the Cabinet," Sarid said, "and the 
government has never taken a decision on this matter." 
</P>
<P>
 A referendum, in fact, would require new legislation -- and there would be a 
parliamentary battle over it. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the dictionary of political science, the term 'national referendum' is 
known as a manipulative tool by the government to design popular opinion, 
apparently to gain legitimacy but thus to circumvent elections that are the 
classic instrument to determine public opinion," declared Tzachi Hanegbi, a 
Likud member of the Knesset. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin has said in the past that he did not think the Israeli public was 
prepared for an agreement returning the Golan Heights, or a major portion of 
it, to Syria so soon after the accord with the Palestine Liberation 
Organization on limited self-government for Jericho, in the West Bank, and for 
the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 A referendum would thus offer him a way to consolidate his political position 
and do both deals. But Israeli political commentators say that Rabin could also 
initial a peace agreement with Syria and then call a national election to 
reconfirm public support for his entire peace platform. 
</P>
<P>
 Syria's central demand in two years of negotiations with Israel has been for 
the return of all the Golan Heights, captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East 
War, in return for full peace. Israel has offered to pull back its forces in 
the region as part of a peace agreement, but says that the extent depends on 
what full peace means. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Ross, the U.S. State Department's coordinator for the Mideast peace 
talks, briefed Israeli leaders in Jerusalem on the U.S. assessment of the 
Clinton-Assad talks and said he expected Israel and Syria to move forward when 
they resume direct negotiations next week in Washington.

SEPARATISTS WIN BIG IN CRIMEA VOTE; UKRAINE: CANDIDATES WHO FAVOR INDEPENDENCE 
OR REJOINING RUSSIA GET 73% OF PRESIDENTIAL BALLOTS. SHOWING COULD DERAIL 
NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT PACT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a development that could inflame Russian-Ukrainian relations and derail the 
nuclear disarmament agreement that President Clinton signed in Moscow last 
week, Crimean separatists have scored a stunning electoral victory in the 
peninsula's first presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Five candidates who want the strategic Black Sea outpost to seek independence 
from Ukraine -- or to rejoin Russia -- won a total of 73% of the vote, 
according to preliminary results Monday. A nearly unknown candidate who was 
backed by Russian neo-fascist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky and who had promised to 
defend the interests of the Russian majority in Crimea won 13.5% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the former Communist boss who supports keeping Crimea an 
autonomous republic within Ukraine won only 17.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Because no candidate received a majority, a runoff will be held Jan. 30, with 
separatist candidate Yuri Meshkov favored to become the new president of the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Russian and U.S. officials said they feared a secessionist movement 
in Crimea could pit Ukrainian nationalists against Russian extremists. Such a 
conflict could torpedo the agreement that calls for Ukraine to give up its 
nuclear weapons in exchange for guarantees that Russia will respect Ukraine's 
existing borders, which include Crimea. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the nightmare scenario -- for everybody," a senior U.S. official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue is so touchy that Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin's press 
secretary, Vyacheslav V. Kostikov, refused to accept a question last week about 
Crimea's possible impact on the disarmament deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll put our president in a very awkward position if you ask this 
question," Kostikov said. "You must understand that this is an explosive 
issue." 
</P>
<P>
 The lovely, subtropical Crimean peninsula juts smack into the center of the 
Black Sea, making it a geopolitical prize that has been fought over for 
centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 But though populated by about 105 different ethnic groups, it was considered 
Russian territory until Moscow gave it to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist 
Republic in 1954 to celebrate "Ukrainian-Russian friendship." 
</P>
<P>
 Crimean restiveness was evident even before Ukraine achieved independence from 
the Soviet Union. In January, 1991, Crimeans voted for autonomy, and on May 5, 
1992, while Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk was on a visit to the United 
States, the peninsula declared independence. Crimea quickly rescinded the 
declaration after the Russian Supreme Soviet declared the 1954 transfer of 
Crimea to Ukraine unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 Russians make up 68% of the 2.5 million residents, and Ukrainians, at 28%, 
consider themselves an embattled minority. But 83% of all residents -- 
including Ukrainians -- say Russian is their native language -- and many see in 
Russia a prosperous homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 Opinion polls taken in August -- polling has since been banned -- found that 
62% of Crimeans wanted some kind of reunion with Russia. Some secessionists are 
Russian military families in Sevastopol, while others are retirees who long for 
the re-establishment of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, more than 200,000 ethnic Tatars, deported by Soviet dictator Josef 
Stalin in 1944 for allegedly collaborating with the Germans, have returned from 
exile in Uzbekistan and are camped out in tents and shantytowns. Tatar leaders, 
wary of Russia, want Crimea to remain part of Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
 They have supported Nikolai Bugrov, the former Communist boss who is now 
Speaker of the new Crimean Parliament. Bugrov placed second with 17.5% of the 
vote; separatist Meshkov, head of the Crimean Republican Party and of the 
Russian Society, got 38.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Meshkov is an extremist," said Vasyl Bohutsky, director of Crimea's only 
Ukrainian-language newspaper, "Crimean Chamber." "He has said that his first 
act as president would be to hold a referendum on joining Russia." 
</P>
<P>
 Like many Ukrainians, Bohutsky believes that a separatist victory could bring 
armed conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are poor and angry," he said. "Just throw in a match and it will 
explode." 
</P>
<P>
 Since November, two politicians have been killed, two beaten and the Tatar 
movement's headquarters bombed with Molotov cocktails. The paramilitary 
Ukrainian National Self-Defense group is reportedly preparing for conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials note that by signing the agreement on Ukraine's nuclear weapons 
Friday, Yeltsin has renewed Russia's commitment to respect Ukraine's borders. 
</P>
<P>
 But Russian parliamentarian Zhirinovsky's ideal map of Russia includes both 
Ukraine and Crimea. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will protect Russian people wherever they are," Zhirinovsky said last 
week, endorsing the separatist leader of the Russian Party of the Crimea, 
Sergei Shuvainikov, for president. 
</P>
<P>
 Such rhetoric awakens Ukrainians' worst fear: Russia meddling in Crimean 
ethnic strife. Kravchuk, who is trying to persuade the Ukrainian Parliament to 
give up nuclear weapons, has argued that Ukraine faces no outside military 
threat. Violence in the Crimea could weaken his case. 
</P>

 With a brief moment of trembling, the earth left a swath of destruction that, 
this morning, we must sift through, pack up, put behind us. But how? The urgent 
things come first, of course, from first aid and how to turn off the gas to 
securing food and shelter.Crawling, literally, from the wreckage, we survived 
fires, freeways caving in, flooding and landslides. But in these coming days 
and weeks, we face mundane but difficult tasks. With our lifeline severed, how 
does one travel from home to office or market? In time, do we or don't we 
rebuild in this place plagued by natural disaster, and how do we mend and patch 
what remains? How can we help others? Here is a guide to dealing with life 
after the fearsome quake-and to getting ready for the next one.

 The lifelines of water, electricity and natural gas that keep the sprawling 
Los Angeles metropolis working suffered serious fractures Monday, most 
spectacularly shown in a natural gas fire in the San Fernando Valley and a 
break in a main aqueduct carrying water from Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of thousands of households were still without gas, power or water by 
Monday evening and authorities said it could take several days for full service 
to be restored. Residents of the San Fernando Valley and neighborhoods north of 
Sunset Boulevard and west of Western Avenue were being warned to boil water 
before drinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials were unable to estimate the damage in dollars to crucial 
infrastructure, but expressed relief that the vast networks of pipes and 
transmission stations were not devastated even more. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, several transmission towers bringing power into the San Fernando Valley 
from a generating facility at Castaic Lake were damaged, said Department of 
Water and Power spokeswoman Dorothy Jensen. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the Los Angeles area lost electricity in the early morning quake, but 
about half of the DWP's 1.4 million customers had power restored by the 
afternoon, officials said. In areas outside the city of Los Angeles, Southern 
California Edison had restored power to all but 150,000 homes and businesses by 
late afternoon -- and had hoped to whittle that number down to 50,000 by 
nightfall. 
</P>
<P>
 The DWP had no count of how many households and businesses had lost water 
service, but the agency warned that wide swaths of the western San Fernando 
Valley might have low pressure or no water for several days. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, it's very difficult to say what the power situation is, so we 
are asking people to conserve water," DWP official Jan Merlo said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no reports of major damage at area reservoirs or dams, but a major 
trunk line out of the Los Angeles reservoir complex in the Sylmar area sprung a 
leak, causing service problems in Simi Valley, Ventura County and Los Angeles, 
according to the Southern California Metropolitan Water District. 
</P>
<P>
 The major gas problems involved breaks in four high-pressure transmission 
pipelines in the San Fernando Valley, including one that erupted into flames on 
Balboa Boulevard in Northridge, destroying two nearby structures. Those four 
breaks were later controlled, said Rich Nemec, a spokesman for Southern 
California Gas Co.  
</P>
<P>
 Telephone service appeared to suffer minor disruptions. Pacific Bell said that 
none of its customers -- not even those in Northridge -- lost service. General 
Telephone's Southern California headquarters in Thousand Oaks could not be 
reached, but GTE operators and Pacific Bell said they were unaware of massive 
outages. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Bell limited incoming calls for four area codes -- 213, 310, 818 and 
805 -- by 75% to avoid overloading the system. A Guide to Gas Leaks Natural gas 
leaks can be stopped by residents who know where and how to turn off the gas 
where it enters the home. Find your gas meter, usually, located at the side of 
a home. Locate shut-off valve on the pipe leading to the meter. Use an 
adjustable wrench to turn off the valve. The longer the wrench, the easier it 
is to turn the valve. The gas company advises residents to keep a wrench wired 
to the meter for quick use. The valve is turned off when the bolt runs 
crossways to the pipe.

 The quake has hit and now you want your home or business back in one piece as 
soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Before randomly picking a contractor from the phone book, owners should do a 
spot inspection after the earthquake: Walk around the property and check the 
ground for muddy spots that would indicate a broken water or sewer pipe; check 
gas meters for leaks -- a rotten egg smell is a giveaway; check all overhead 
electrical and phone lines for damage, and check water heaters, furnaces and 
air conditioning units for leaks, broken wires or broken plumbing. 
</P>
<P>
 When a home or businesses has broken windows, it may be smarter to board them 
up -- and have them inspected -- instead of immediately replacing the glass. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it shakes enough that your metal structure is out of whack, then the 
windows should be boarded up because the new glass will be out of line," said 
Jennifer Loudon of Crystal Glass, a board-up service in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 After the self-inspection, property owners should call their county or city 
building department -- or a private consultant -- and ask for an inspector to 
assess the damage, said Christine Diemer, executive director of the Orange 
County Building Industry Assn. This service is usually free when done by a 
municipality. 
</P>
<P>
 BIA chapters throughout the area have lists of licensed contractors who are 
members of the trade group. The Greater Los Angeles-Ventura chapter's number is 
(818) 591-2001. 
</P>
<P>
 If you do need to hire a contractor, here are guidelines: 
</P>
<P>
 * Get several bids and remember that any deal that sounds too good to be true 
usually is. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ask to see the contractors' wallet-sized license and a driver's license or 
some other form of identification. Check to make sure the name on the pocket 
license and second form of ID match. It is illegal for a contractor to use 
another's license. 
</P>
<P>
 * A full-service inspection, which includes checks for roof, plumbing and 
structural damage, should cost about $200. 
</P>
<P>
 * Call the Contractors State License Board's toll-free line, (800) 321-2752, 
to ensure that the license has not been suspended. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ask to see a copy of the contractor's certificate of workers' compensation 
and liability insurance coverage. Call the contractor's insurance carrier to 
verify that the policy is in force. 
</P>
<P>
 * If your insurance isn't paying the bills and you have to borrow to finance a 
repair job, be wary of any contractor who insists on specifying who you select 
as a lender -- you could become the victim of a kickback scheme that will 
increase your costs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Insist on a written contract that spells out exactly what will be done, what 
materials will be used, the brand names of any materials you prefer, the 
estimated time it will take to do the work, the timing of each payment and how 
any disputes will be resolved. Assume nothing -- if it's important, get it in 
writing.

 If an earthquake shakes the books off the shelves and leaves cracks in walls, 
what should be done? Most homeowners, after securing their safety and that of 
their family, will then think about the welfare of their home. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California contractors who have done earthquake damage repair in past 
years say that most cracks in walls, though ugly, can be covered by a coat of 
paint or a hanging picture.The larger cracks, though, may demand immediate 
attention.  
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, it is pretty simple and cheap to find out which crack is which. 
</P>
<P>
 Most construction companies and smaller contractors will send somebody out to 
inspect damage and do a free estimate of the cleanup and repair costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually damage like a crack in the wall is just cosmetic," said Mario 
Callirgos, architectural manager for California Remodeling in Buena Park. "But 
people get worried about it because it looks so bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Callirgos said homeowners should worry most about cracks in beams that support 
the roof or additional floors, or are over doorways. If possible, residents 
should strap damaged beams in the attic to other sturdy beam before aftershocks 
arrive, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 William Long, owner of Hammerford Construction in Whittier, said repair the 
crack if you can fit your finger into it, otherwise apply a coat of paint and 
forget about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would not be overly concerned," Long said, adding that most homes built in 
the past 25 years are sturdy and reliable. "We have gotten calls from several 
people (since the earthquake) who have noticed some small cracks around 
doorways. Those are not a concern."

A LOS ANGELES TIMES SPECIAL REPORT; COPING WITH THE QUAKE; RECOVERING FROM 
DISASTER, PREPARING FOR THE FUTURE; HOMEOWNERS MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR TAX RELIEF 
ON DAMAGED DWELLINGS 
</P>

<P>
 Homeowners whose dwellings were damaged by Monday's earthquake and resulting 
aftershocks may be eligible for some tax relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance payouts for quake damage are free of federal income taxes, even if 
they amount to more than the price that a homeowner paid for the house, 
provided they come in areas that President Clinton officially designates as a 
disaster zone, said Jack W. Anderson, a certified public accountant in Fountain 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 And the value of damage not covered by insurance can be written off as a loss 
on income taxes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county assessor could prove helpful as well. Assessors have the power to 
reassess property damaged or destroyed by the earthquake. A lower assessment 
can result in lower property tax bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Under California law, property owners who incur at least $5,000 in damage 
qualify for a reassessment. Many homeowners applied for deductions recently 
after brush fires swept through Malibu and Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Los Angeles County Assessor Kenneth Hahn nor Orange County Assessor 
Bradley L. Jacobs could be reached for comment Monday, a county holiday, about 
plans for revaluing quake-damaged properties.

<P>
 T housands of Southern California homeowners reeling from the devastating 
earthquake could face a plethora of financial woes -- from huge uninsured 
losses to delays and unexpected costs in selling or refinancing a home.  
</P>
<P>
 Will your losses be covered? Will your house fall out of escrow? Will your 
lender require a new appraisal before completing your refinance?  
</P>
<P>
 Here are some answers.  
</P>
<P>
  
</P>
<P>
 Question: Who is insured for earthquakes? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Unfortunately, most California homes aren't covered by earthquake 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Estimates of the number of Southern Californians with earthquake coverage 
range from 20% to 40% of residential policyholders.  
</P>
<P>
 After earthquakes, "people rush to buy" quake coverage, said Mary Crystal, 
spokeswoman for the Los Angeles-based Western Insurance Information Service. 
"But then after awhile they decide to drop it, especially if we don't have any 
quakes for awhile." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What does earthquake insurance cover? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Earthquake insurance, like fire insurance, covers losses to the structure 
and contents of your home and yard in the event of a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 However, you generally must sustain large losses before this coverage kicks 
in, because the average deductible on earthquake insurance -- the amount you 
must pay before coverage starts -- amounts to 10% of the policy limits. 
</P>
<P>
 It's important to note that quake coverage can vary widely, depending on your 
insurer. 
</P>
<P>
 Some insurers apply deductibles on structure and contents separately. Others 
apply just one deductible. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, if you have a so-called "guaranteed replacement cost" policy, it 
could cost you when you report a quake loss. That's because some insurers hike 
the deductible based on the actual cost of replacing your home. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider someone with a $100,000 guaranteed replacement cost policy with a 10% 
deductible for earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 This person normally could assume that any loss above $10,000 would be 
covered. However, if the insurer finds the house would cost $200,000 to 
replace, the company may declare that the deductible is actually $20,000 -- or 
10% of true replacement cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What if my house was hit by fires or flooding generated by quake-damaged 
water and gas lines? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: The answer depends on whether you were hit by fire or flood. 
</P>
<P>
 If your house burned down, you're in fairly good shape, from an insurance 
point of view. Fire -- regardless of the cause -- would be covered under the 
fire insurance portion of your policy. The average homeowner has just a $250 to 
$500 deductible on this coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 If your damage was caused by flooding, you may be out of luck -- unless you 
have separate flood insurance. Normally, damage from "a rising tide of water" 
is covered only if you have a flood rider, says Bill Sirola, spokesman for 
State Farm Insurance in Bloomington, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 With a quake, though, the issue may be debatable. That's because insurance 
does cover water damage from broken pipes. 
</P>
<P>
 If you need help persuading your company to provide coverage, you can seek the 
help of a professional -- a lawyer specializing in insurance coverage or a 
public adjuster. Or else call the state Department of Insurance. The 
department's hot-line number is (800) 927-4357. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: If I had damage, when should I call my agent? And how should I prepare for 
the conversation? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: "First of all, make sure that everyone is safe," Crystal said. "If you have 
earthquake insurance, or are not sure, give your agent or company a call as 
soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before you start to clean up, take inventory of what happened," Crystal said. 
"Keep a record you can share with the adjuster, in terms of what's been lost." 
Homeowners are encouraged to take pictures or use a video recorder to chronicle 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What if my home is damaged or destroyed?  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: "If you can't get into your house because of damage or destruction, go to a 
hotel," Crystal said. "(Earthquake) insurance will cover those day-to-day 
expenses." 
</P>
<P>
 Even insured property owners without earthquake coverage will have their hotel 
costs paid if they are ordered out by police or fire officials. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I've never had earthquake insurance before. But now I want to buy it -- 
before the big aftershocks, if possible -- and my agent says he can't sell it. 
What's going on? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Most insurers impose temporary bans after an earthquake on the sale of new 
policies. The moratoriums range from a few days to several months. 
</P>
<P>
 Mainly, insurers want to make sure that they don't sell you a policy for a 
loss that's already occurred. They sometimes also want to determine how much 
they've lost in a particular catastrophe before adding to their "risk pool." 
</P>
<P>
 In time, you will be able to buy quake coverage. Insurers are required to 
offer it with homeowner's coverage in the state of California. But you may have 
to wait a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Does damage from an aftershock incur a new deductible? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Aftershocks tied to an earthquake are covered under the initial claim, so 
the deductible would not apply again, according to the Western Insurance 
Information Service. However, a quake that occurs several days after the 
initial shock might be classified as a new quake. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What does earthquake coverage cost? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: That depends on where you live and the type of home you own. 
</P>
<P>
 It's generally more expensive to buy earthquake coverage for brick and masonry 
homes than for those made of wood and stucco. Your premium also depends on how 
many quakes have hit your area and their intensity, insurers say. The annual 
earthquake premium for $100,000 in coverage could cost between $150 and $600. 
</P>
<P>
 Renters can add earthquake insurance to an existing fire or tenant's package 
to cover damage to household contents and personal belongings. Condo owners can 
buy insurance to cover the contents of their unit. Condominium associations 
sometimes buy coverage on the real property.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is earthquake coverage worth the cost? Considering the high deductibles, I 
doubt it would ever kick into effect. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: That may be true. Earthquake insurance is truly for catastrophic losses 
only. Unless your house falls off its foundation or collapses in a quake, the 
chances are slim that you'll collect. 
</P>
<P>
 However, there still are some property owners who would be wise to buy it. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have a very old home -- one built near the turn of the century -- you'd 
be wise to get earthquake coverage, because construction requirements for 
foundation were far different in those days, and the chance of major damage is 
far grater. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, if you live in a fill area -- if your housing tract was built on 
landfill -- or an area where the soil is sandy and loose, you're likely to 
suffer greater damage than people who have homes built on bedrock. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What should I look for in quake coverage? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: First, consider the deductible. While the industry standard is 10%, there 
are companies that offer smaller deductibles and a few with higher thresholds. 
You should also find out how the deductible is applied. Is it combined? Are all 
of your losses -- whether they relate to contents or structure or landscaping 
-- lumped together to meet the deductible? Or must you meet one deductible on 
structure and a separate one for contents? 
</P>
<P>
 Then examine the exclusions. While some policies exclude nothing, others 
exclude all masonry structures -- block walls, brick veneer and chimneys, says 
Larry Arnold, partner at the Santa Ana Heights law firm of Cummins & White. 
Since these are the items most likely to be damaged in a quake, you don't want 
them excluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, look at what type of land movement is covered. While some policies cover 
only earthquakes, others will compensate you if your foundation cracks because 
the land beneath it settles, Arnold says.  
</P>
<P>
 Finally, look at the cost. As with other types of insurance, there is great 
variation in the price from insurer to insurer.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: I'm in the middle of selling my house. Will earthquake damage affect my 
escrow? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: It could. 
</P>
<P>
 The standard California sales contract provides specific guidance on home 
sales after an earthquake. If the damage to the home amounts to less than 1% of 
the purchase price, the seller must repair the damage -- but the buyers do not 
have the option of walking away without forfeiting their deposit. 
</P>
<P>
 If the damage amounts to more than 1% of the purchase price, the buyer can 
walk away without penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What happens to my refinance? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: It will probably be delayed.

 Many California banks offer disaster relief programs for customers who are 
victims of earthquakes. After past disasters, one major bank extended a 
three-month payment deferral on car loans, credit cards and lines of credit and 
waived penalties for early redemption of certificates of deposit. 
</P>
<P>
 After a series of earthquakes struck Humboldt County in April, 1992, another 
major lender let credit card customers apply for a one-month grace period and 
credit line increases. Consumer and home loan customers affected by the quakes 
were eligible for a 90-day payment moratorium. Time deposits and IRAs could be 
withdrawn without penalty.

LETTING KIDS TALK ABOUT THEIR FEARS AND REASSURING THEM OF THEIR SAFETY CAN 
EASE ANXIETY.

 Whether or not they slept through an earthquake, children may experience 
anxiety from it, says psychologist Nancy Hubbell, director of special services 
for the Laguna Beach Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 "Typically, if kids feel an earthquake, they may be fearful," said Hubbell, 
who has counseled school-age victims of the Laguna Beach firestorms. And if 
they weren't aware of it when it was happening, watching television coverage or 
hearing adults talk about the earthquake can trigger anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
 Following a quake, children may become more active or restless or become 
easily upset or withdrawn. Many children are afraid of sleeping or taking a 
shower for fear another quake will strike. Some worry about what will happen to 
them if their homes have been damaged and what has happened to their lost pets. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents can help. 
</P>
<P>
 Expect children to be clingier, says psychologist Ruth Torres, who counseled 
elementary school children after the 1989 Whittier earthquake. She suggests 
that parents try to make children feel safe, and gradually they will get back 
into old patterns. If their anxieties don't lessen over time, she suggests 
parents seek additional help. Sometimes just a few sessions can be helpful.  
</P>
<P>
 One important fact for parents to remember is that children are "earthquake 
prepared" in school, Hubbell said. "So it's important for (parents) to be every 
bit as prepared at home. If they aren't, parents have already set up an anxious 
situation for their children." 
</P>
<P>
 Go over earthquake preparedness with your children. Reassure them that you 
have all the supplies you need in your earthquake kit. 
</P>
<P>
 Think of the aftermath of a major earthquake as a 36-hour car ride through the 
desert with your kids, says Dr. Neil Kaufman, head of ambulatory pediatrics at 
Cedars Sinai. "Parents should have a bag ready with books, age-appropriate 
toys, cookies and crayons to keep their children's minds off the fear. Quakes 
are a very fearful thing to kids." 
</P>
<P>
 More ways to help your children cope with the effects of an earthquake:  
</P>
<P>
 * Allow them to talk about it. Avoid the temptation to say, "Don't worry, 
everything will be fine." It's important that their fears come to the surface 
and are treated as legitimate. Sending the message that it's "so bad we can't 
talk about it" can make them more afraid. 
</P>
<P>
 * It's important that adults control their emotions in front of children. If 
parents can handle a quake, kids are likely to handle it too. 
</P>
<P>
 * Parents shouldn't allow children to watch the news after a quake. It is too 
frightening for them to hear about the "the Big One." 
</P>
<P>
 * Give your children factual information about the earthquake. Explain calmly 
and matter-of-factly where the event took place and how close it was so your 
children don't have a heightened sense of anxiety. Acknowledge that it can be 
scary, but that you have a plan to cope with it efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
 * Children typically have separation anxiety under these circumstances. It's 
important to assure them that, should you be separated, you have a plan how to 
get to them. Remind them that their school has a disaster preparedness plan and 
they will be safe until you come for them. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bedtime can be difficult for children in the aftermath of an earthquake. 
During these times it is natural for children to want to be close to their 
parents. It may be possible to rearrange the household sleeping arrangements to 
accomplish this.  
</P>
<P>
 * If going over their fears and giving them reassurance does not assuage you 
child's anxiety, professional counseling may be necessary.  
</P>
<P>
 * Experts agree that it is helpful for children to participate in post-quake 
repairs and shopping trips for emergency supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 * Maintaining children's routines as much as possible is another good way to 
keep children's minds off earthquakes. "There's a sense of safety in routine," 
Torres says. "A lot of children (who experienced the 1989 Whittier earthquake) 
said they felt safer at school than at home after the quake." 
</P>
<P>
 School personnel can help pay particular attention to students for whom 
English is a second language. These students may have more difficulty coping 
with trauma because they have not gained full information from media reports or 
family members, Hubbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Also, some members of the Hispanic community have experienced similar traumas 
in their homeland before coming here -- so it's especially traumatic for them."

 Pets may become tense, anxious and panicky in an earthquake. If you have a 
missing pet or other animal - care problem, call Los Angeles County Animal Care 
and Control at (310) 940-8888. The center is staffed to direct callers to the 
agency best suited to help with specific problems in specific locations.  
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, call the Department of Animal Regulation at (805) 388-4341. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Following is additional advice for dealing with pets in an earthquake from 
Warren Eckstein, host of a pet show on KABC radio:  
</P>
<P>
 Question: How can you calm your dog or cat after an earthquake? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: The best thing to do is talk calmly to the animal and remain calm 
yourself. You should confine your pet with a leash and collar or cage because 
it may try to bolt out the door. Be careful if it's not your pet because it may 
react aggressively after being separated from its owner. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q Will pets require attention or should they be left alone? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A After a quake, touching, stroking and favorite toys have a calming effect on 
pets. And since a pet is a part of the family, it should go with you in case of 
evacuation. If the shelter doesn't accept pets, leave the tub full of water and 
open a bag of food. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q What should you do if your pet runs away? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Check two to three times a day with humane organizations within a good 
radius of your home. Your pet's identification tag should have your home phone 
number and that of a relative in a different area. The best ticket home for a 
dog is an up-to-date license. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q What are common first aid techniques for pets? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A After a quake, a pet will often chew something out of anxiety and choke. The 
Heimlich maneuver works on dogs. Straddle the dog with your hands in a fist 
right behind the last rib and push up and forward to force air up. If your pet 
is injured and bleeding, apply direct pressure using a sterile article such as 
gauze. Seek additional medical care as needed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q What supplies should pet owners keep on hand? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A An earthquake kit for your pet should contain leashes, collars, a pet 
carrier in case of evacuation, a few days of food and water and a fresh supply 
of special medications. Keep medical records on file as well. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q Are there other steps that may be useful in a quake? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A It's good to establish a relationship with a fellow pet lover in the 
neighborhood so that in case you are not home, there will be someone to help 
your animal. Pet stores sell signs that alert firefighters and neighbors that a 
pet is inside your house if you are away or injured. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. County Animal Care and Control 
</P>
<P>
 (310) 940-8888, makes referrals for county shelters and takes requests for 
help in moving and finding animals. If your pet is missing or you have another 
animal-care problem, you will be directed to the appropriate agency.

 Surviving an earthquake involves more than readjusting picture frames or 
sifting through piles of rubble. Anger, irritability, disbelief, shock, rage, 
nightmares, sleeplessness, hyperactivity and headaches are just a few of the 
aftereffects of a quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The most common reaction among adults to a large quake is an overwhelming 
sense of helplessness, said Dr. Mory Framer of the Barrington Psychiatric 
Center in Los Angeles, which trains mental health workers to counsel disaster 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Quakes, Framer said, remind us of our mortality and that we are not in 
control. "The power of disaster reduces us all to children." 
</P>
<P>
 Anxiety and other reactions may occur regardless of the amount of property or 
physical damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have to experience destruction to be afraid of an earthquake," said 
Dr. Irwin Rosenfeld, chairman of psychiatry at Saddleback Memorial Medical 
Center in Laguna Hills. "Just feeling the ground move underneath your feet is a 
pretty daunting experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Mental health professionals agree that expressing your feelings is the first 
step to healing the mind after experiencing disaster.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's important for people to talk about what happened with regard to their 
feelings and fears," said Marvin Sellers, director of services at Hotline Help 
Center in Orange. "It is vital that people allow those feelings to surface 
before they internalize" them. 
</P>
<P>
 Call-in opportunities abounded Monday as television and radio stations offered 
numbers for people to call for information and to discuss their feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Sims, news director at KNX 1070 news radio, aired a special segment early 
Monday featuring psychologist Kimberly Heart of Los Angeles. Sims said 
acknowledging the emotional component of a natural disaster is crucial both in 
terms of news coverage and responsibility to his listening audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you get the news out, and you start to examine the emotional harm, you 
begin to think about how to help people sort through their feelings," Sims 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Mental health professionals offer these strategies to help you cope after an 
earthquake: 
</P>
<P>
 * Share your feelings and fears with others. Rosenfeld said that may be as 
simple as chatting with the supermarket checker. Regardless of the quality or 
quantity of the venting, any expression is positive. 
</P>
<P>
 In helping others, don't minimize someone's feelings by telling the person not 
to worry. Listen even if his talking is incessant. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you sustained property damage, sort through remaining belongings. Doing 
so -- however futile it may seem -- serves as therapy, Sellers said.  
</P>
<P>
 * Don't immerse yourself in a 24-hour-a-day cleanup campaign. Take breaks 
whenever possible for leisure or hobbies. Such diversions are crucial to one's 
overall coping strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep as close to your routine as possible, in terms of diet, exercise and 
activity. Not only does this serve as a source of comfort, it also helps one 
return to normal -- both physically and emotionally.  
</P>
<P>
 * If your experience is very painful or if your reactions disable you from 
functioning -- that is, if you can't drive on a freeway overpass or ride an 
elevator -- you may need professional help, Framer said.  
</P>
<P>
 * Finally, take what you hear with a grain of salt. "After every disaster, 
there is a tremendous influx of rumors and statistics that get twisted," Framer 
said.

 After the shaking stops, see if anyone is hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 That's always a priority, say disaster emergency officials and medical 
experts. Taking the right steps can help minimize injuries and physical stress 
from earthquakes.  
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the injuries we've seen in earthquakes are from people trying to run 
outside and they trip and fall on the stairs or they're hit by glass or objects 
on the way out," says Dr. Isi J. Russ of Palos Verdes. Russ is director of the 
emergency department at Chapman General Hospital in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the initial quake is over, however, that doesn't necessarily mean you're 
out of danger. After-shocks can also be quite severe, so any loose objects -- 
pictures, things still hanging on -- should be taken down, Russ says.  
</P>
<P>
 "If it's a major earthquake, hospital emergency departments are going to be 
inundated with victims with major injuries -- from heart attacks, from people 
falling, from collapsing buildings," Russ says.  
</P>
<P>
 If you suffer relatively minor injuries or are unable to get immediate 
treatment for more serious ones at a hospital, there are "temporizing measures" 
you can take. Here are some of them: 
</P>
<P>
 * Broken limbs. If you've fallen and think you have a broken ankle, wrist or 
finger, you can use a ruler, baseball bat or any other available object to form 
a splint. Wrap the injured area so that it doesn't move around. If ice is 
available, keep the injured area elevated and intermittently apply ice packs to 
keep the swelling down.  
</P>
<P>
 * Smoke inhalation. If you're in a house that is engulfed in smoke, you can 
soak a towel or shirt in water and put it over your nose and mouth and breathe 
through that. Stay as close to the floor and crawl out because smoke rises. Get 
fresh air as fast as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 * Heart attack. If somebody already has coronary artery disease or high blood 
pressure, the stress of an earthquake or other disaster will increase blood 
pressure and adrenaline in the bloodstream and can cause a heart attack. If you 
have a chest pain you've never had before, dial 911, or if 911 is not 
available, have someone take you to the nearest hospital emergency department 
immediately.  
</P>
<P>
 * Burns. People who suffer minor burns can also treat themselves. "You've got 
plenty of time to treat burns," says Russ. The best thing is to put wet, moist 
compresses on it. Within the first 24 hours, however, you should try to go to a 
hospital and have the burn assessed. * Bleeding. The best way to stop most 
bleeding is to apply direct pressure and wrap the area with a bandage, towel, 
handkerchief or any other clean dressing you have. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gas fumes. Russ says most people won't have a problem inhaling gas -- 
they'll smell it and run out of the house. But if they do inhale, he says, "the 
most important thing they need to do is get out in the fresh air." If they're 
still having trouble breathing, they should be taken to the hospital for 
evaluation. (Do not bring charcoal barbecues into the house for cooking or 
heating.)  
</P>
<P>
 * Food. Eat perishables first, frozen foods second and canned foods third 
because they have the longer shelf life. * Water supply. Two gallons of water 
are needed to cover daily drinking, first aid, sanitation and cooking needs for 
each person. Residents of the San Fernando Valley and neighborhoods north of 
Sunset Boulevard and west of Western Avenue are being advised to boil drinking 
water for 20 minutes, said Bruce Kuebler, director of water quality for the 
Department of Water and Power. If boiling is not possible, an alternative is to 
put eight drops of unscented household bleach into a gallon of water, if the 
water is clear from the tap. If the water runs cloudy, use 16 drops. Allow the 
water to stand for 30 minutes before drinking.

 You made it through this one. You could probably use a little breather. 
</P>
<P>
 Not just yet. Take a couple of minutes to remember the one absolutely 
inflexible, ironclad, irrevocable rule about big earthquakes in Southern 
California: There are going to be more of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Your first job, then -- right after you pick up the broken dishes and get the 
clock radio to quit blinking "12:00" -- is to mentally and physically get ready 
for the next time. A review never hurts. In fact, it's essential. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Quake  
</P>
<P>
 * Inspect the house. Know which areas are safe (doorways, under tables, in 
corners) and unsafe (near glass, fireplaces, hanging objects, tall furniture). 
</P>
<P>
 * Plan a meeting place for your family if you're separated at the time of the 
quake. Decide on an out-of-state relative or friend to whom family members can 
report their whereabouts. This avoids tying up local phone lines. Keep 
emergency phone numbers clearly posted. 
</P>
<P>
 * Reduce, as much as possible, the possibility that things will fall. Secure 
water heaters and heavy furniture that can topple, keep breakables on bottom 
shelves and anchor plants, picture frames and mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Learn basic first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Learn how to shut off the gas, water and electricity in case the lines are 
damaged. But DON'T attempt to relight a gas pilot. Call the utility company. 
</P>
<P>
 * Latch cabinet doors that could swing open and allow objects inside to fall. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep hazardous or flammable materials -- paints, pest sprays, cleaning 
products -- secure or on lower shelves and away from sources of ignition. 
</P>
<P>
 * Know the emergency plans at your children's school or day-care center. Make 
backup plans to pick them up if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 * Store important papers in a fireproof storage or safe-deposit box, a freezer 
(with documents tightly sealed in a freezer bag) or with an out-of-town 
relative or friend -- and send copies, not originals. 
</P>
<P>
 In Scotts Valley, an isolated area near the epicenter of the 1989 Loma Prieta 
quake, a group of residents' pre-planning saved houses and possibly lives. The 
neighbors learned the layout of each others' homes and exchanged keys and 
telephone numbers. They set up caches of food, water and emergency supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanie Mann, author of "Safe Homes, Safe Neighborhoods" (Nolo Press, 1993) 
offers advice on organizing such a group: 
</P>
<P>
 * Neighbors can do a lot for each other after an earthquake. They may rescue 
your child or pull you out of debris. It's important that you know if there is 
a doctor, nurse or firefighter in the neighborhood. You also need to help your 
neighbors. If one house goes, the whole block can go. 
</P>
<P>
 * Neighbors should distribute an emergency neighborhood map with names, phone 
numbers and symbols for gas and electricity. Signal each other by agreeing that 
a red symbol on the mailbox indicates a problem and a white symbol indicates 
that everything is OK. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Quake  
</P>
<P>
 You've been through it now, and you know what it feels like. Next time, 
recognize it for what it is and don't panic. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you're indoors, stay there. Get under a desk or table, stand in a corner 
or in a doorway. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you're outside, stay there, too. But get away from trees, buildings, 
walls or power lines. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you're in a high-rise building, don't use the elevators. Stay away from 
the outside walls. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you're driving, pull over and stop. Stay away from overpasses and power 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you're in a crowded public place, don't rush for the doors. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember: It'll almost certainly end within a minute. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Quake  
</P>
<P>
 * Check for injuries. If there are any, apply first aid. Don't move seriously 
injured people unless they are in immediate danger. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't use the phone unless it's an emergency -- a serious injury or fire. 
</P>
<P>
 * Check for gas and water leaks, broken electrical wiring or sewage lines. If 
you find damage, turn off the utility at the source. 
</P>
<P>
 * Check your water supplies. You can get emergency water from water heaters, 
melted ice cubes, toilet tanks (not bowls; and don't drink if you're using a 
disinfecting agent in the tank) and canned vegetables. Drinking pool water over 
a long period isn't advisable. Likewise, water stored in vinyl plastic 
containers, such as water beds, isn't suitable for continued use. 
</P>
<P>
 * If the electricity is out, turn on a portable radio for immediate news. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you have broken windows, tape them to prevent flying glass in case of 
aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't drive anywhere. Keep the streets clear for emergency vehicles. But, 
for future use, keep at least a quarter tank of gas in your car and maps in the 
glove compartment. 
</P>
<P>
 * Check for structural damage to your home. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you have to evacuate, leave a note telling family members where you are. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember: Strong aftershocks are likely after a strong quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency Supply Kit  
</P>
<P>
 Having a well-organized cache of emergency supplies is as essential to every 
Southern California household as a snow shovel is to every home in Wisconsin. 
It should include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Flashlights and extra batteries. Avoid matches or open flames unless you are 
certain there are no gas leaks. 
</P>
<P>
 * A portable radio and extra batteries. 
</P>
<P>
 * A first-aid kit. 
</P>
<P>
 * A fire extinguisher. 
</P>
<P>
 * Non-perishable food -- enough of it to support every person in the house for 
a week. 
</P>
<P>
 * Water -- one gallon per person per day. Replace it every six months. 
</P>
<P>
 * Food and water for pets. 
</P>
<P>
 * Blankets, clothing and shoes that are sturdy enough to walk over debris. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sufficient medication, special diet food, extra eyeglasses or contact 
lenses. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cash. Automated teller machines may not work and merchants may not accept 
checks or credit cards. After a major quake, cash is likely to talk loudest. 
</P>
<P>
 * Another way to cook. A barbecue or camp stove will do, along with a 
hand-operated can opener, matches and heavy-duty aluminum foil. 
</P>
<P>
 * Large plastic bags for trash, waste and water protection. 
</P>
<P>
 * Personal hygiene items. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tools. Basics: heavy gloves for clearing debris, an adjustable or pipe 
wrench for turning off gas and water. Desirable: an ax, crowbar, shovel, broom, 
screwdriver, pliers, hammer, knife or razor blades. A garden hose for siphoning 
and firefighting. 
</P>
<P>
 If You Don't Clip This Story or Forget Where You Put It . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Check the table of contents in the white pages of your telephone book. You'll 
find that in the front of the book is "the most marvelous, comprehensive 
earthquake survival guide," said Martin Wyatt, a spokesman for the state Office 
of Emergency Services. "I wouldn't add or change a thing in it, and everybody's 
got one in their home."

A LOS ANGELES TIMES SPECIAL REPORT; COPING WITH THE QUAKE; RECOVERING FROM 
DISASTER, PREPARING FOR THE FUTURE; COMMUTERS FACING FREEWAY ORDEAL; TRAFFIC: 
WITH MAJOR ROUTES BLOCKED, DRIVERS WILL NEED PATIENCE, CAREFUL PLANNING, 
EXPERTS SAY.

<P>
 After beginning your day with radio traffic reports this morning, it might be 
best to calm your nerves with an easy-listening station. Believe this: For 
millions of drivers it is going to be tedious behind the wheel for some time. 
</P>
<P>
 With the state's major north-south artery severed and some of the busiest 
roads twisted like saltwater taffy, it's hard to keep track of which highways 
are closed or damaged. For how best to navigate the Southland post-earthquake, 
traffic experts offer some advice for getting from here to there. 
</P>
<P>
 In a nutshell: Don't drive anywhere you don't have to, leave extra early and 
-- in the event you unexpectedly find roads blocked -- carry a detailed map of 
the area you are leaving and heading to. And faithfully check radio traffic 
bulletins. 
</P>
<P>
 When it is deemed safe to return to the road -- late Monday engineers had only 
begun checking the region's freeway system and it was unclear how long repairs 
will take -- commuters should allow double their normal drive time, according 
to David Rizzo of Long Beach, author of "Freeway Alternatives." Most of all, he 
said, be patient. 
</P>
<P>
 "It definitely eases frustration," Rizzo stressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Even some seemingly good alternate routes that have been spared structural 
damage may have fallen debris that hasn't been cleaned up. So commuters should 
be prepared to venture farther from their normal freeway paths to find 
freer-flowing streets. 
</P>
<P>
 This is why drivers should also carry a detailed map: In case they need an 
alternate to their alternate route, said Rizzo, who has studied and teaches 
traffic flow patterns at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most critical freeway collapse in Monday's quake was at the 
junction of the Antelope Valley (California 14) and the Golden State 
(Interstate 5), the latter Southern California's key freeway link to the rest 
of California. 
</P>
<P>
 Next most devastating is the closure of the Santa Monica Freeway in both 
directions from La Brea Boulevard to the San Diego Freeway. The Santa Monica 
Freeway (I-10) is one of the most heavily traveled freeways in the world and a 
primary east-west route for hundreds of thousands of workers daily. 
</P>
<P>
 Undamaged streets that would otherwise make good alternate routes should be 
avoided if they intersect damaged freeways. Washington Boulevard and Fairfax 
Avenue, for instance, will surely be jammed with cars because of the overpass 
damage on the nearby Santa Monica Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Santa Monica Freeway carries a daily average of 270,000 vehicles at 
La Cienega Boulevard, according to a 1991 Caltrans survey, the freeway's 
closure is sure to create a traffic nightmare for commuters from Santa Monica 
and the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 The following are primary road closures and suggested alternate routes: 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica Freeway 
</P>
<P>
 Between Santa Monica/Venice and Downtown Los Angeles, closed near the junction 
with Fairfax Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Alternate Routes: Olympic, Venice and Pico boulevards. Usually Washington 
would be a good route from Venice to downtown, but because it crosses near the 
damaged freeway, it is going to be backed up. Thus opt for Venice or Olympic, 
or other east-west streets. Same with La Cienega as a north-south artery. Best 
to drive just east of La Cienega Boulevard to a street like La Brea. 
</P>
<P>
 Interstate 5  
</P>
<P>
 Between San Fernando Valley and Bakersfield; closed at California 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Alternate Route: If not taking the coastal U.S. 101, northbound motorists can 
travel from the Los Angeles Basin by taking the Riverside Freeway east to 
Interstate 15 in Riverside County. Travel north on Interstate 15 to U.S. 395, 
which can be taken to California 58 in Kern County. Take 58 west to catch 
Interstate 5 or California 99. 
</P>
<P>
 Fairfax Avenue 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Santa Monica Freeway and linking Inglewood to Hollywood, closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Alternate Route: Use La Brea Avenue, Hauser Boulevard or La Cienega Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 California 118 
</P>
<P>
 Closed between the Foothill Freeway (Interstate 210) and Tampa Avenue in the 
San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Alternate Route: Victory Boulevard, Roscoe Boulevard, Sherman Way. 
</P>
<P>
 Interstate 405 
</P>
<P>
 Closed at Devonshire Street in Northridge.  
</P>
<P>
 Alternate Route: Exit at Devonshire Street and take Sepulveda Boulevard. (The 
405 is also closed at Nordhoff Street and at the freeway tunnel to the 
northbound Golden State.) 
</P>
<P>
 Other Closings 
</P>
<P>
 The following roadways were closed Monday but there were either no alternate 
routes or no reliable information about whether those routes were passable: 
</P>
<P>
 California 14 at the I-5 intersection, between San Fernando Valley and 
Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 California 126 between Santa Paula and Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 California 23 between Moorpark and Fillmore, and all of Angeles Crest Highway.

 Travel on public transportation may prove difficult during the first days 
afterthe earthquake given the uncertain state of roadways and rail lines. 
</P>
<P>
 But as inspections are completed and aftershocks wane, trains and buses may 
help reduce commute times and headaches. And, the stress of dealing with 
post-earthquake commuting delays and devastated freeways may actually be enough 
to force some people to consider -- imagine it! -- car-pooling. 
</P>
<P>
 "They may find their resistance to trying it has been overcome," said Raymond 
Novaco, professor of psychology and social behavior at UC Irvine, who has 
conducted numerous studies on long-distance commuting stress. 
</P>
<P>
 Amtrak was operational by noon Monday between San Diego and Los Angeles. 
However, any earthquake of magnitude 5.5 or greater requires the line to shut 
down and all tracks to be inspected before travel can resume. This shutdown 
occurred at least twice Monday. (Commuters call the toll-free reservations 
number, (800) 872-7245, for details on operation.) 
</P>
<P>
 Expect some delays as buses take detours around damaged areas, said Bill 
Heard, spokesman for the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 All lines were running Monday except for Line 243 serving Woodland Hills. Bus 
and rail riders can call the MTA's main service number, (213) 626-4455. Be 
patient. Even the bus information service was knocked out by a power outage 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Line rail service between Los Angeles and Long Beach is running, but 
passengers will likely have to board buses in the middle of the line to get 
around a damaged bridge at the Slauson station. The bus ride is free, but the 
delay could add up to 30 minutes to the normal trip of an hour, Heard said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Line subway appeared to have minimal damage, but if service is 
interrupted today, officials said special buses will take its place. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink, the 200-mile network of commuter rail to outlying cities, was still 
assessing late Monday whether to resume its normal schedule today.

MOST SUPERIOR COURTS CLOSED TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles Superior Court officials announced Monday that many criminal and 
civil Superior Courts will be closed today, including those Downtown and in Van 
Nuys, Santa Monica, San Fernando, the Mid-City area and Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Superior Courts, including Torrance and Norwalk, were scheduled to open. 
</P>
<P>
 The closure in Van Nuys means there will be no deliberations today in the Lyle 
Menendez murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "How long we're going to be closed, I don't know," said Superior Court Judge 
Robert Letteau, supervising judge of the Van Nuys Courthouse.

TWO GUNMEN RELEASE HOSTAGE, SURRENDER AFTER 9-HOUR SIEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Armed carjackers who led police on a 65-mile chase before crashing and fleeing 
into the county Hall of Records in Downtown released a hostage early Monday and 
surrendered, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Four people, including a California Highway Patrol officer, were hurt during 
the chase. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunmen held a woman hostage for about nine hours in the bullet-ridden 
building. The sobbing woman, identified only as a county worker, was escorted 
out of the building by SWAT team members and was unharmed, said Lt. John 
Dunkin, a police spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men, who were not identified, were taken from the building and put in 
separate patrol cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Police sealed off the Downtown Civic Center area Sunday afternoon after the 
men fled into the multistory county building. It was not clear who had fired 
the shots that struck the building's glass front. 
</P>
<P>
 The pickup was stolen at gunpoint in Sacramento, and its driver was taken to 
an automated teller machine at a bank where he was forced to withdraw $300, 
Sgt. Robert Gomez of the Kern County Sheriff's Department said. The man was 
later released unharmed.
