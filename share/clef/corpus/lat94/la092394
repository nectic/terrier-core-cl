MOVIE REVIEW; 'SHAWSHANK': SOLID PORTRAYALS BUT A DUBIOUS TREATMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Awash in a bad news culture where horrors compete for media attention, 
America's appetite for feel-good movies is all but insatiable. How else to 
explain "The Shawshank Redemption," a film that hides a warm and cuddly fantasy 
about prison life behind sleek brutality, so much the better to convince us 
that even inside those walls life can be grand? 
</P>
<P>
 Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman as two lifers who demonstrate the 
great things prison can do for you, "Shawshank's" sentimentality is of a New 
Hollywood variety. Its message of hope and friendship comes premixed with a 
sizable dollop of unappetizing violence, intended to convince audiences that 
what they're watching isn't a big glob of cotton candy after all. 
</P>
<P>
 Adapted from a Stephen King novella, "Shawshank" also labors under its 
literary origins, with many of its situations feeling like thin doodles blown 
up to big-screen size. And its entire last section has the kind of serious 
plausibility problems that are only apparent when the written word takes 
physical form. 
</P>
<P>
 The film gets its name from a fictional prison that is supposedly Maine's 
toughest. It is to Shawshank sometime in 1947 that bank vice president Andy 
Dufresne (Robbins) is sent to serve a double life sentence for the murders of 
his wife and her boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief prologue, we've seen Andy looking potentially murderous with a 
bottle and a gun in his hand, but he claims to be guilty only of confusion, not 
homicide. This strategy convinces no one, and Andy, a loner who strikes the 
judge as icy and remorseless, is convicted without a second thought. 
</P>
<P>
 Andy's arrival at Shawshank is observed by Red Redding (Freeman), an impassive 
20-year veteran of the place who lets on that "there must be a con like me in 
every prison in America. I'm the guy who can get it for you." 
</P>
<P>
 The story of Andy's time at the Big House is related by Red in an extensive 
voice-over that is one of the film's strongest points. In fact anything Freeman 
touches is the better for it; his effortless screen presence lends "Shawshank" 
the closest thing to credibility it can manage. 
</P>
<P>
 The film's periodic bouts of violence are probably also intended as a reality 
booster. For Shawshank is run by a harsh warden (Bob Gunton) who believes in 
discipline and a sadistic guard captain (Clancy Brown) who knows how to enforce 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 What this leads to is a series of off-putting violent episodes -- one man 
beaten to death, Andy regularly pulverized by a psychotic homosexual (Mark 
Rolston) and his pals -- that are unpleasant to endure while adding nothing to 
the film's sense of truth. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because writer-director Frank Darabont, in his theatrical feature 
debut, has envisioned the rest of the cons as a bunch of swell and softhearted 
guys who were probably put away for overzealous toenail clipping. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This blubbery Boys Club atmosphere is underlined by the nicknames of Red's 
crew, guys like Skeet, Jigger and Snooze, who the audience is invited to view 
as harmless as Snow White's dwarfs. The inappropriateness of having them in the 
same film with vicious attempted gang rapes seems not to have occurred to 
anyone with any influence. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, "Shawshank" concentrates on an overly long, two-hour-and-22-minute 
parade of prison vignettes that show, among other things, how Andy uses his 
financial expertise to make himself indispensable to the warden and his 
lackeys. Some of these moments are effective, but even nice performances like 
James Whitmore's as a veteran con lose something by being overly familiar. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Tim Robbins always seems to be playing a part, he is good at it, and it 
is nice to see the chaste though loving relationship between Andy and Red 
develop over 20 years. Paradoxically, it is "Shawshank's" zealousness in trying 
to cast a rosy glow over the prison experience that makes us feel we're doing 
harder time than the folks inside. 
</P>
<P>

 Animated 'Cats': Steven Spielberg's Amblimation is set to begin production in 
October on a full-length animated feature version of Andrew Lloyd Webber's hit 
musical "Cats," to be released by Universal Pictures in 1997. The film, based 
on a screenplay by Tom Stoppard ("Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead," 
"Brazil"), will feature many songs from the original musical, including 
"Memory," as well as a song composed by Lloyd Webber especially for the film. 
The most successful musical of all time, "Cats" has grossed more than $2 
billion worldwide and is the winner of seven Tony Awards.

 Permit Center Planned: Forty-five representatives from the film industry, city 
of Los Angeles, and Los Angeles, Ventura, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino 
counties met in Los Angeles on Thursday in the first step in creating a 
Southern California Regional One-Stop Film Permit Center. In the next of many 
hurdles facing the plan, the representatives agreed to seek approval from 
various government agencies that would be affected in the L.A. metropolitan 
area. L.A. County has already approved the plan and the city of L.A. is moving 
in that direction. Together, those two jurisdictions account for 70% of the 
filming that goes on in the area. TELEVISION

 Best Showing Yet: "Tonight Show" host Jay Leno concludes his weeklong stand in 
Las Vegas tonight, with the road trip already paying off big in the ratings. 
Overnight ratings for the week's first three programs showed "The Tonight Show" 
drawing an average of 660,000 more viewing homes each night than "Late Show 
with David Letterman," resulting in Leno's best advantage so far over his 
rival, who usually leads the ratings competition. Of the three nights, 
Wednesday's program fared the best, drawing an estimated 5.9 million viewing 
homes and a 19% share of the audience. Letterman, meanwhile, attracted about 
4.8 million viewing homes and a 15% audience share. And at home in Los Angeles, 
Wednesday's Vegas program brought Leno his best ratings performance since May 
5, 1993.

 KCBS Suit: Two former KCBS Channel 2 News employees have filed race and sex 
discrimination lawsuits against the station, CBS and KCBS management. Liz 
Chavez, the station's former programming and broadcasting standards manager, 
and Arturo Gonzalez, an assignment editor, both allege that they were harassed 
and mistreated at the station, and were the victims of racist and sexist 
employment practices. They also charged that they felt that the newsroom had an 
anti-minority atmosphere. KCBS executives would not comment specifically on the 
allegations, saying that they had not been served with the suits. But they 
denied that there was any discrimination or bias against minorities at the

MOVIE REVIEW; 'SLEEP WITH ME' IS REALLY A CONVENTIONAL LOVE TRIANGLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For most of its length "Sleep With Me," directed by first-timer Rory Kelly, 
offers up maundering set pieces involving its young actors carousing, yelling, 
arguing. Talking nonstop is a tic they can't shake. 
</P>
<P>
 Is the talk worth listening to? That depends on who is talking and when. The 
film's gimmick is that six screenwriters -- all friends, each contributing a 
separate segment -- worked on it independently. The result is no more or less 
of a patchwork than most bigger-budgeted Hollywood films -- many of which also 
have six writers, or more, if you include all the uncredited hands. In fact, 
the near-seamlessness of the script -- credited to Kelly, Duane Dell'Amico, 
Roger Hedden, Neal Jimenez, Joe Keenan and Michael Steinberg -- is somewhat 
off-putting. With all these supposedly different sensibilities at work, why 
concoct something that rolls along without a bump? 
</P>
<P>
 Fashioned as a new-style love triangle movie, "Sleep With Me" ends up, despite 
its free-form acting and "modern" attitudes, being rather conventional. It 
mints the same old familiar romantic cliches for the late-20s, early 30s 
generation. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph (Eric Stoltz) and his best friend, Frank (Craig Sheffer), have a 
problem: Joseph's wife, Sarah (Meg Tilly). Beginning with a casual flirtation 
on the day before her wedding, Sarah comes on to Frank and drives him to 
distraction. It turns out he always loved her; she's flattered, wary, 
seductive, standoffish. When Frank declares his love for her at a gathering of 
friends, Joseph turns against both his wife and his friend. Frank spends most 
of the rest of the movie crashing various parties in order to importune Sarah; 
most of his circle of friends, who also include a snooty Brit (Thomas Gibson) 
and a struggling screenwriter (Todd Field), keep their distance too, or else 
try to foment the fighting. The guys' weekly poker game degenerates. 
</P>
<P>
 The actors are talented and loose-limbed enough to keep the wayward sequences 
watchable. But there's precious little character development. Once you get 
their drift, the scenes begin to pile up rather than develop. There may be a 
certain dramatic logic to this: We're probably meant to register how these 
layabouts fritter away their time and recycle the same peeves. But the effect 
is like a great big actors' studio exercise -- lots of gnashing and carrying 
on. And Kelly tries to give it all a forlorn friskiness.  
</P>
<P>
 There are some terrific moments, like the funny-hostile scene where a sometime 
girlfriend of Frank's, played very well by Vanessa Angel, talks about 
rebirthing and her love for men; or a party scene where a nonstop gabber played 
by Quentin Tarantino goes on about the homoerotic subtext of "Top Gun." (The 
funniest thing is, he's right.) "Sleep With Me" keeps you in its whirl while 
it's spinning, but there's not much to savor when it comes to a stop. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: R, for sexuality, language, drug use. Times guidelines: It 
includes some marijuana smoking and brief sexual friskiness .

MOVIE REVIEW; 'TERMINAL VELOCITY' RACES INTO ROMANCE AND COMEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Terminal Velocity," a rousing, good-looking action-adventure with romance and 
comedy, couldn't be more up to the minute, yet its pleasures hark back to 
movies' earliest days of exuberant, lightning-fast, cliffhanging serials of the 
silent era and the aerial exploits of such classics as "Wings" and "Hell's 
Angels." 
</P>
<P>
 The special effects are state of the art -- how could they dare be otherwise 
nowadays? -- but they don't overwhelm the people. There's a consistent sense of 
humor and lightness of touch that's often lacking in such hard-driving 
pictures. "Terminal Velocity" succeeds because it's without pretense, 
unashamedly offering pure entertainment. There's an appealing throwaway quality 
to the entire undertaking that attests to the consistent sound judgment of 
director Deran Sarafian and writer David Twohy, who co-wrote "The Fugitive," in 
not taking themselves too seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 The film is chock full of mind-boggling incidents, with twists and turns at 
every instant. At heart its premise is simple and timely, shrewdly not revealed 
to us and our equally bewildered hero, Charlie Sheen's daredevil sky diver 
Ditch Brodie, until more than an hour into the story. Against mounting yet 
mysterious danger the filmmakers create imaginative and amusing characters for 
Sheen and leading lady Nastassja Kinski to play to the hilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Brodie is a warm and funny guy, a reckless grandstander and an uninhibited 
pursuer of beautiful women. When Kinski's beguiling Chris Morrow turns up at an 
Arizona parachuting center, Brodie figures he can give her a lesson and wine 
her and dine her into a quick seduction, getting to sleep early. No sooner are 
they up in the air, however, than Brodie is hurtled into danger and excitement 
that it looks like he'll never be able to stop running, let alone get some 
rest. He's hard put to keep up with the tenacious, no-nonsense Morrow, who's as 
formidable as Jackie Chan in outwitting ferocious bad guys James Gandolfini and 
Christopher McDonald. (Brodie's crusty pilot is played by Melvin Van Peebles, a 
groundbreaking black actor/filmmaker of the late '60s and early '70s). 
</P>
<P>
 There's no point in revealing what Morrow is up to, but, as the film 
approaches its climactic sequence, it pauses to allow Kinski a big scene in 
which her selfless heroine confronts Brodie with his immature All-American 
self-absorption and ignorance. Even the blithest of escapist entertainment 
needs a serious moment to give its people a crucial measure of reality. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: PG-13, for scenes of strong action/violence and for brief 
strong language. Times guidelines: Although its violence is swift and 
cartoon-like, it may be too intense for young children. 'Terminal Velocity'

JAZZ NOTES: COVERING THE SCENE HAS FILLED HER HEART, NOT HER COFFERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seven years ago this month, Myrna Daniels made a decision that changed her 
life: She expanded the newsletter she had been writing on jazz in Los Angeles 
into the L.A. Jazz Scene -- now a respected monthly journal that offers 
interviews, club and album reviews, news and schedules of events at local 
venues. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a pretty dramatic choice," Daniels says. "I had no background in 
journalism or publishing or music." 
</P>
<P>
 Daniels had to borrow money to get started and gave up a room in her Burbank 
home for office space. She began to spend more time in clubs to write reviews. 
On her free nights, she found herself handling the myriad tasks involved in 
getting the paper ready for its print date, which is the last Friday of the 
month. All this, and the paper was a "great drain financially" for the first 
two years, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 But Daniels, who works for the nonprofit Head Start program in the San 
Fernando Valley, says that she's glad she's hung in with her tabloid-sized 
venture. The paper, which seven years ago had a press run of 10,000 copies, now 
publishes about 38,000 copies each month and has grown from the initial 16 
pages to the current 28. And while she still carries some debt from the paper's 
outset, the L.A. Jazz Scene has enough ads to pay for itself -- "though there's 
no salary for me," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniels apparently isn't in this for the money, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still satisfying to go into a club and hear what the musician is going 
to give me," she says. "There's still an element of surprise. Jazz is 
challenging music. It works at you, and you have to constantly work to get 
somewhere with it. To understand any one musician, period or style, you have to 
really work, and that's challenging." 
</P>
<P>
 She finds interviewing to be another rewarding experience. She's written about 
such artists as Hiroshima's Dan Kuramoto, saxman Rickey Woodard, trumpeter 
Wallace Roney and singer Al Jarreau. 
</P>
<P>
 "The interviews have helped me understand the musicians, what they get out of 
the music, how they become creative people," she says. "The creative process, 
that's what interests me, and in a roundabout way, I have come to understand my 
creative process by exploring it in others." 
</P>
<P>
 And while her paper may not have led to a jazz renaissance in Los Angeles, 
Daniels believes that it has helped. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more we do, the stronger jazz here gets," she says. "Jazz won't ever die, 
but it won't grow, either, if we don't do something. The paper is our little 
way of making a contribution to the culture of Los Angeles."

 Back to the Lighthouse: Ex-bassist and bandleader Howard Rumsey returns 
Tuesday to his old haunt, the Lighthouse in Hermosa Beach, talking about the 
bands he led there for more than two decades, in a benefit for Arts Hermosa, 
which supports arts causes in the beach city. The event also features drummer 
Bobby White's band. Information: (310) 374-3813.

 More Lighthouse: The legendary Lighthouse, where jazz used to be spotlighted 
seven nights a week, has gone mostly to a blues and rock policy, says Jim 
Harvey, assistant manager. "But we're game for more jazz," he says. "We're 
expanding our bookings, featuring jazz a couple of Tuesdays in October. As more 
people come around for it, we'll have more."

TV REVIEW; IN 'SIRENS,' HIGH-CONCEPT COPS FOUNDER ON THE ROCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 That's "Sirens" as in fabulous babes -- vis-a-vis the title of a new 
syndicated series about female cops -- and, of course, "Sirens" as in lights. 
But will it be "Sirens" as in luring viewers onto the rocks? It's there, in 
that third definition, that the high-concept breaks down a bit. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening scene lives up (or down) to what you'd expect out of this premise: 
A gorgeous gal in uniform angrily enters a quizzical hunk's apartment and 
announces, "You have the right to take your clothes off," adding, as she strips 
down to black lingerie, "Anything you touch can and will be used against you." 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, Miranda! 
</P>
<P>
 But, for better or worse, the prurience level flags sharply thereafter. Turns 
out these are two married cops celebrating their anniversary, and the 
postcoital mood is shattered mere minutes later when the husband is gunned down 
on the street, leaving his blond widow, Jessie (Jayne Heitmeyer), to go 
sleuthing for his assassin, most likely a murderous fellow peace officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, Jessie bonds with Lynn (Adrienne-Joi Johnson) and Molly (Liza 
Snyder), as we know she will, since the silly opening credits feature these 
three performing synchronized, model-type moves together. (A fourth female cop, 
Ellen Cohen, also joins in the camaraderie but isn't included among the series' 
principals.) 
</P>
<P>
 But the series isn't nearly as campy as it promises, or probably needs, to be. 
Amazingly, this two-part opener (which continues next week) wants to hew closer 
to "Hill Street Blues" or "Homicide," what with its hand-held camera work, than 
to "Charlie's Angels." 
</P>
<P>
 These aspirations hardly hold up in a story whose mystery villain is 
telegraphed almost from the start and whose gritty dialogue includes zingers 
like "Real good -- for a woman!" and "Degenerate male-chauvinist pig!" The glam 
cast does its admirable best to make this credible, but any scripting they 
touch can and will be used against them. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Sirens" premieres at 9 tonight on KCOP-TV Channel 13.

MOVIE REVIEW; '. . . AND GOD SPOKE' SENDS UP FILM BIZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A hilarious "mockumentary" in the tradition of "This Is Spinal Tap," ". . . 
And God Spoke" follows a pair of Hollywood schlockmeisters every 
trouble-plagued step of the way in their attempt to film the Bible, no less, on 
a low budget. Don't they remember when John Huston tried to do it? 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, Michael Riley's director Clive Walton and Stephen Rappaport's producer 
Marvin Handleman have managed, as a team, to turn out 11 pictures in 15 years, 
including such unforgettable gems as "Dial S for Sex" and "Nude Ninjas," all of 
which are glimpsed in delicious clips. Somehow they've gotten a studio to give 
them enough money to spark their delusions of grandeur, and now, basking in the 
constant attention of a documentarian's camera, they've become a pair of 
comically pretentious auteurs, explaining how they managed to insert social 
significance even into "Nude Ninjas." 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, Brando turns down the role of God, but Clive and Marvin take 
every setback with the determined optimism of an Ed Wood. The only trouble is 
that there seems to be nothing but setbacks -- a Noah's Ark too wide to go 
through a sound stage door, an Eve who never let on about that tattoo until the 
cameras roll and, finally, in the name of product placement, a Moses who 
carries a six-pack of Coke along with the Ten Commandments. 
</P>
<P>
 A prize-winning UCLA cinema alumnus and a production assistant on several 
major studio films, Borman, making his feature debut, clearly knows the ins and 
outs of how movies are made, which makes all the more convincing his depiction 
of all the wrong ways of going about it. This aura of authenticity serves only 
to fuel the laughter: Satire this film may be, but its exaggerations, as 
outrageous as they may seem, are really not that far from reality. After all, 
the late screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky insisted that everything in "Network" was 
inspired by actual incidents; surely, everything that happens in ". . . And God 
Spoke" has occurred at one time or another. 
</P>
<P>
 In the large and marvelous cast up pops three good-humored guest stars: Lou 
Ferrigno as Cain (to skinny Andy Dick's kvetching Abel), Eve Plumb as Mrs. Noah 
and, best of all, Soupy Sales as Moses. Sales' moments on screen have got to be 
among the funniest of the year. As dumb and foolish as Clive and Marvin seem to 
be, Riley and Rappaport make you root for them as the odds keep escalating 
against their chances for success. Indeed, you start wondering just how Borman 
and his co-writers are going to wrap up ". . . And God Spoke," only to discover 
they've saved their best joke for last. 
</P>

DANCE REVIEW; ABT DAZZLES IN THARP'S 'UPPER ROOM' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oh, Joy. American Ballet Theatre has Twyla Tharp back. Or a piece of her. Or 
rather, one of her works. Break open the champagne. Send up the balloons. 
</P>
<P>
 Performed for the first time since it was reacquired last month by artistic 
director Kevin McKenzie, Tharp's "In the Upper Room" closed the repertory 
program offered Wednesday at the Orange County Performing Arts Center. A 
rapturous audience only reluctantly let the final curtain come down, sending 
wave after wave of applause toward the dancers. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience was exactly right. 
</P>
<P>
 How different from the perfunctory acknowledgments at the end of the Shade 
Scene from "La Bayadere," which opened the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there was even other good news: the West Coast premiere of James Kudelka's 
engrossing if problematic "Cruel World." 
</P>
<P>
 To be honest, the current ABT cast could not efface memories of the halcyon 
1988 performances of "Upper Room" at the Center in which Tharp veterans Jamie 
Bishton, Kevin O'Day and Daniel Sanchez led the modern contingent. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet such ABT paragons as Kathleen Moore and Gil Boggs continued to exemplify 
the necessary crisp style, and the rest of the cast danced with invigorating 
commitment. Above all: The dancers simply looked natural and at home in this 
work, staged by the memorable Tharpian Shelley Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Remaining intact with all its cumulative power, "Upper Room," to music by 
Philip Glass, unfolded dazzlingly from rigorous geometric symmetries and 
crystalline patterns to exhilarating images of seemingly free-form motion. 
</P>
<P>
 Set to a string orchestra version of Tchaikovsky's "Souvenir de Florence," 
Kudelka's "Cruel World" uses duets and ensembles to explore both formal dance 
issues and human relationships. It was danced with powerful authority by the 18 
company members. 
</P>
<P>
 The work opens with the stage full of couples, who impelled by raging inner 
drives engage, disengage, march and stalk the floor, form into phalanxes of the 
opposite sexes and return to couplings. A series of individual pas de deux 
occurs. These dances are turbulent, varied, conflicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Kudelka distorts the formal vocabulary with off-center balances and skewered 
limbs, creating vivid images that transmute formal considerations of shared 
weight into psychological categories which almost instantly dissolve back into 
technical dance problems. The speed and power of these shifts are arresting, 
disturbing. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for an occasionally slowed-down gesture or swoop of an arm, it is 
mainly when physically apart that the couples exhibit any calm or lyricism, and 
such moments are short-lived. The couples simply have to re-form, whatever the 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second movement, Marianna Tcherkassky finds herself imprisoned, passed 
around, exulted by six men who create weird picket-fence images by bending 
down, touching the floor with one arm and thrusting the other into the air. 
</P>
<P>
 With the third movement, intended to mirror (invert?) the second, something 
goes wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be partly a formal problem in that the situation of one free-ranging 
man (Guillaume Graffin) in opposition to six rather indifferent women is not 
fraught with an equal kind of weight or threat as would be one woman faced with 
six manipulative men. It may also be a failure of choreographic imagination. 
Graffin's folk-derived steps and the musing poses of the women appear 
lightweight and less motivated by the music. The section also is too prolonged 
to sustain interest, even when Cynthia Harvey finally detaches herself from the 
group to dance with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the ballet doesn't recapture its initial energy, although the 
couples recapitulate the anguished, formal, intricate pairings of the opening. 
</P>
<P>
 Carmen Alie designed the ominously muted, evocative middle-European costumes. 
Scott Zielinski provided the sensitive lighting, sometimes brightening the 
proceedings as if to suggest momentary opportunities of less troubled 
relationship or time. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, Kudelka's choreography did not always bear out this sometime 
optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Barker led a vitalized Pacific Symphony in a brilliant performance of 
Tchaikovsky's music, mirroring exactly the drama and power and spectral 
eeriness that Kudelka (but few others) has heard in the score. 
</P>
<P>
 In comparison to both works, the Shade Scene from "La Bayadere," as staged by 
Natalia Makarova, looked like a quaint period piece to which few of the dancers 
related. Happily, Susan Jaffe offered a striking performance of Nikiya, 
creating the illusion of uncanny inner stillness and the dissipation of 
material weight. Dancing Solor for the first time, Parrish Maynard encountered 
some major problems, including almost dropping Jaffe in a lift. Jack Everly 
conducted. 
</P>
<P>

MUSIC REVIEW; INSPIRED NONSENSE FROM ROYAL NORTHERN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sometimes a little nonsense is good for the soul. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was Wednesday night in Bing Theatre at USC, where visiting students from 
England's Royal Northern College of Music presented Harrison Birtwistle's 1969 
dramatic pastoral "Down by the Greenwood Side" as part of the UK/LA Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Essentially an avant-garde setting of a traditional English mummers' play with 
the old Scottish ballad "The Cruel Mother" passing through the action like a 
ship in the night, "Down by the Greenwood Side," with a text by Michael Nyman, 
uses modern music cacophony for comic purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 40 minutes of action is spoken dialogue, with roles for such 
characters as Father Christmas (as master of ceremonies), St. George (here, 
played as a fop) and Dr. Blood, who brags that he can cure such ailments as 
"wind in the knees" and "bellyache in the big tom toe." 
</P>
<P>
 With just such low humor, with medieval jousts on hobbyhorses, with 
wonderfully silly costumes (one character removes his green head as if it were 
a hat in order to get down to work), "Greenwood" turns out to be exactly the 
kind of inspired nonsense that only the British seem to create. And 
Birt-wistle's acerbic music, for a mixed ensemble of nine (the conductor offers 
a prefatory burp before they begin), far from keeping an abstract distance, 
adds gas to the giddiness: It seems the musical embodiment of the tomfoolery 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 The playing, the singing (a fluid Mary Hitch in "The Cruel Mother" role), the 
costumes, the dreamy, autumnal set design and especially the spirited acting 
were all top-notch. 
</P>
<P>
 On the first half of this music theater program (repeated tonight and Sunday 
afternoon), the Manchester-based collegians offered William Walton's 1967 
"extravaganza" "The Bear," a one-act, three-singer, small instrumental ensemble 
setting of a Chekhov vaudeville. Walton's musical pastiche method works well 
here, particularly in capturing the coy battle of the sexes that ensues when 
creditor and debtor suddenly find themselves in love. The solid, fresh voices 
in the main roles are Sarah Castle and Craig Smith. TIMOTHY MANGAN

POP MUSIC REVIEW; JUDYBATS TAKE OFF WITH SOFT, SAD, APPEALING THINK-ROCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHUCK CRISAFULLI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Judybats create gentle, moody music that mixes up a bit of country twang, 
some Memphis soul and a good dose of danceable melancholia. The Knoxville, 
Tenn., quintet's soft-edged think-rock has become a staple of college radio, 
and at the Troubadour on Wednesday a small group of fans watched as the low-key 
outfit grooved its way through a set of mostly new material. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer Jeff Heiskell is a charismatic frontman, although the way he teases out 
his lines can occasionally approach "Star Search" overkill. He and the group 
were most impressive when they settled into the dynamic, mid-tempo lilt of such 
songs as "Happy" and "Wounded Bird." 
</P>
<P>
 Songs with a harder, funkier edge were less engaging, though the band did cut 
loose effectively on the pro-homeliness two-step "Ugly on the Outside." 
Heiskell was at his sardonic best taking a few digs at Morrissey, MTV and 
stylish depression in "The Cachet of Misery." 
</P>
<P>
 Devoid of flash, the Judybats seem to take some pride in being uncool. Their 
squareness of purpose doesn't always lead to great music, but it can be 
appealing -- a somewhat shaky encore of the Bee Gees' "Jive Talkin' " wasn't as 
gloriously dumb as the original but was unhip enough to be quite entertaining.

CLUB REVIEW; KICKING OUT THE JAMS AT TOE'S TAVERN IN PASADENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HEIDI SIEGMUND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "You Shoulda Been Here Yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
 That statement, prominently displayed on a banner behind the stage at Toe's 
Tavern, rather sums up one's experience at the colorful, surf-themed club in 
Pasadena.Between its friendly clientele and preponderance of good live music, 
the 6-year-old club is just the place you don't want to miss. 
</P>
<P>
 From surfer punk to local funk, the music mix entices -- recent shows at the 
199-capacity club have featured Agent Orange, PopDefect and Thelonious Monster. 
Along with the two-tiered venue's four pool tables, the shrine-o'-surfing decor 
also offers plenty of amusement.  
</P>
<P>
 The club, which is filled with dozens of hanging surfboards and photos of 
surfing action, is painted every color of the rainbow -- a nice switch from the 
more somber venues of Hollywood. A 14-foot, hat-wearing shark hovers over the 
pit, and a huge heifer rides a board on the club's second level, with 
"Cowabunga" -- of course -- painted on its side in giant letters. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the atmosphere is so neighborly that even the homeless folks who 
hang around the parking lot kindly direct newcomers to Toe's back-alley 
entrance. And you really shoulda been there last weekend, when a hot local 
band, Velouria, determined that it's not too early to be covering Nirvana 
songs.

THEATER BEAT: CONFESSIONAL-STYLE 'VIRGINS' CRIES OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By F. KATHLEEN FOLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the remarkably candid "Virgins and Other Myths" at Theatre Geo, Colin 
Martin employs the format of the autobiographical one-person show as a private 
confessional to examine his personal psychosexual history in minute detail, 
from his earliest homosexual longings onward. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is risky, raw, frequently funny and at times harrowing. Despite the 
painfully frank nature of his material, Martin never lapses into sensationalism 
or self-caricature. 
</P>
<P>
 With great charm and a dancer's grace, Martin lures us along the path of his 
sexual odyssey, from all-American teen to jaded New York City hustler. Every 
step of the way, director Bruce Blair shows great sensitivity for Martin's 
material. 
</P>
<P>
 The first act closes with the rape of the 15-year-old Martin by a man he meets 
in a movie theater. The pantomimic assault is performed in lyric slow motion to 
sweeping music, an ironic staging that emphasizes the sheer brutality of the 
crime. The assaults, both psychic and physical, continue. An adored high school 
teacher turns out to be yet another would-be seducer. An early misdiagnosis of 
AIDS and subsequent sexual addiction leave Martin on the ropes. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Martin's show is not just an episodic narration of traumas and 
peccadilloes past. At the evening's shocking close, the reminiscences coalesce 
into the piteous outcry of a sexually abused child -- a cry that can never be 
forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Virgins and Other Myths," Theatre Geo, 1229 N. Highland Ave., Hollywood. 
Tuesdays, 8 p.m. Ends Oct. 18. $12. (213) 466-1767. Running time: 1 hour, 55 
minutes. 'Beachwood' Cast Gutsy at Tamarind 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't fair to judge "Beachwood Palace Jubilee" at the Tamarind on the basis 
of one performance. The cast and material change weekly in this potluck 
showcase, which consists primarily of comedy sketches, with a little song and 
dance thrown in. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening this reviewer attended, Barry Saltzman -- playing regular host 
Ademola Olugebefola -- failed to hold the proceedings together. The show was 
overlong and the laughs were intermittent, except for those bombastic and 
interruptive responses of the performers' offstage pals. 
</P>
<P>
 However, it's an ambitious program, and those involved have to be awarded 
points for sheer audacity. If you are interested in seeing gutsy young 
performers working without a net, all for the ticket price of about $3, then 
this could be the show for you. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Beachwood Palace Jubilee," Tamarind, 5919 Franklin Ave., Hollywood. Tonight 
only, 11 p.m. Opens next Friday at the Hudson, 6539 Santa Monica Blvd., 
Hollywood. Fridays only, 11 p.m. Ends Oct. 21. $3-$3.99. No reservations 
necessary. Running time: About two hours. F. KATHLEEN FOLEY

THEATER BEAT: 'CRADLE': A MUSICAL WITH A MESSAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP BRANDES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1937, amid the turbulent emergence of the labor movement, composer/lyricist 
Marc Blitzstein's socialist musical parable about prostitution, "The Cradle 
Will Rock," shook many a complacent bourgeois crib by broadening its thematic 
focus on the oldest profession from a traditional sexual context to moral 
harlotry at every level of society. 
</P>
<P>
 Combining the biting social commentary of his friend and mentor, Bertolt 
Brecht, a stirring score reminiscent of Aaron Copland's elevated populism, and 
sophisticated, witty lyrics more akin to Stephen Sondheim musicals than the 
escapist fluff of his Broadway contemporaries, Blitzstein created a work of 
operatic complexity with a uniquely American voice.  
</P>
<P>
 And while the scaled-down revival by The Blank Theatre Company/Rose & Thistle 
Productions may come across more like an intimate chamber piece than full-blown 
opera, Daniel Henning's insightful staging and inspired performances from his 
first-rate cast showcase the enduring brilliance in this underappreciated 
watershed musical. 
</P>
<P>
 On the eve of a massive worker's strike in mythical Steeltown, a spunky 
streetwalker (engagingly sung by Sandra Terry) runs afoul of the law by 
refusing to trade sexual favors for protection. While facing arraignment in 
night court, she finds herself in the unlikely company of the anti-union 
Liberty Committee mistakenly arrested amid the unrest. 
</P>
<P>
 The Committee members represent generic facets of a corrupt status quo -- 
preacher, doctor, newspaper editor, college president, painter and musician, 
all willing slaves to the town's fat cat overlord, Mr. Mister (Peter Van 
Norden). Compared to the depths of pandering to which each of these upstanding 
citizens will descend to curry favor, the conventional hooker seems like a rank 
amateur. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the cerebral detachment of Brechtian theater, Blitzstein sought 
to engage his audience with a full range of emotions, from vaudevillian comedy 
to tragic pathos, and in this the production succeeds handsomely. Only when the 
heroic union organizer Larry Foreman (Jeffrey Rockwell) resists a seductive 
bribe from Mr. Mister, signaling a triumphant uprising by the oppressed 
workers, does "Cradle" lapse into a naive idealism that feels hopelessly dated. 
The social problems Blitzstein framed so eloquently are as timely as ever, but 
we're still waiting for a solution.

Running time: 1 hour, 50 minutes. 'Feets!' Takes a Tumble at Open Fist 
</P>
<P>
 Despite obvious ambitions to run the distance, "Feets! Don't Fail Me Now" 
trips over its own dramturgical limitations in a premiere staging by Toe Action 
Productions. 
</P>
<P>
 Loosely adapted from novelist Ishmael Reed's historical fantasy "Flight to 
Canada," about a runaway slave (Mark Daniel Cade) at the close of the Civil 
War, David Trotman's script retains and even builds on Reed's quirky 
anachronisms -- surrounding the 1886 characters with cellular phones, network 
news broadcasts, theme parks -- for a jarring collision of period and 
contemporary sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 But Trotman's unfocused sense of narrative development stumbles too often into 
unnecessary plot convolutions, despite intermittent scenes with genuine 
dramatic promise. Especially suggestive are the implied parallels between 
slavery and a plantation owner's (Mark Voland's) sadomasochistic session with 
an Indian dominatrix (Fallon) -- although differences in the issue of choice 
are conveniently sidestepped. Erratic pacing undermines the intensity in Cheri 
Lynn Brown's direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Without major revision, "Feets!" won't gain much of a toehold in theatrical 
revival.

ART REVIEW; JOEL OTTERSON'S FURNITURE HURTS SO GOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID PAGEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brutality and luxury intermingle in Joel Otterson's polymorphous pieces of 
excessively decorative yet fully functional furniture. Mounted on small, 
heavy-duty wheels, his hyperactive hybrids of recycled pipes, dismembered 
bathtubs, patchwork cushions, potted plants and goldfish bowls speak -- in many 
voices at once -- of an irrepressible desire for physical comfort in a world 
relentlessly hostile to pleasure, refinement and lavishness. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoshana Wayne Gallery's cavernous main space at the new Bergamot Station 
complex feels like some futuristic pirate's hide-out. The treasures here have 
been pillaged from a wild array of mass-cultural sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Delicate dessert dishes emblazoned with rock 'n' roll logos recall grandma's 
mismatched china and the grandchildren's favorite bands. Odd candelabrum do 
double duty as fruit bowls. 
</P>
<P>
 A Cher ashtray conflates summer-camp arts-and-crafts with High Style camp. And 
a fragile glass decanter, with matching goblets cast from plastic bottles of 
dishwashing liquid, demonstrate Otterson's ability to make beautiful objects 
out of common household materials. 
</P>
<P>
 His aesthetic of over-the-top accumulation is exceptionally resilient. It 
embodies a sensibility that is adaptive and practical, capable of making the 
best out of adverse circumstances. Chippendale sophistication and Road Warrior 
ruggedness seem to be the unlikely bedfellows from whose union Otterson's art 
springs. 
</P>
<P>
 The animated glee of his multilayered pieces includes a healthy dose of 
reality. Far from being an escapist fantasy of outlandish piracy, his voracious 
installation is a moving meditation on art's place in contemporary life. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1961 jukebox, flanked by two life-size human skeletons made of ruby red, 
hot-sculpted glass, serves as funerary urn for the ashes of Richard Alan 
Shiffler, a musician who recently died of AIDS-related complications on his 
33rd birthday. Otterson's poignant memorial fuses fragments of popular culture 
and pieces of plumbing to form a personal shrine that provides different levels 
of comfort, depending upon what each viewer brings to it. 
</P>
<P>
 All of these flamboyant sculptures take their place in an ongoing cycle of 
life and death. They make a necessity of decoration, stealing fugitive 
pleasures from an impersonal world and striving to infuse some joy amid much 
sorrow. 
</P>
<P>

 Endurance Test: Visiting Mike Kelley's exhibition at Rosamund Felsen Gallery 
feels like being trapped in a building whose burglar alarm has been 
accidentally triggered. Lights flash and ear-splitting sounds assault you as 
you wander around the makeshift sculptures, paintings, drawings and 
photographs, wondering if you should wait for someone to silence the annoying 
noises or if you should just give up on the art and leave. 
</P>
<P>
 With a nasty, aggressive twist, Kelley transforms the difficulty usually 
associated with Modern art -- particularly abstraction -- into a painful 
endurance test. Masochism, his work effectively screams, lies at the root of 
the way Americans currently think of art. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea that looking at art is good for us gets skewered in his pugnacious 
installation. Spending time with Kelley's enlarged photographs of lint, 
sculptures made of chicken-wire and tinfoil, and egg-shaped paintings based on 
a fusion of 1950s horror movies and biomorphic abstraction does not result in 
any sort of moral improvement. On the contrary, all you're left with is a 
headache. 
</P>
<P>
 For such bodily ailments, Kelley's drawings in the back gallery sarcastically 
recommend Immodium A-D, Pepto-Bismol or acupuncture. 
</P>
<P>
 The remainder of the exhibition resembles ill-fated, back-yard experiments by 
a crackpot scientist or handyman. Leapfrogging back to the wacky birdhouses he 
made in the 1970s, Kelley's new works focus on eggs and incubator-like 
containers, suggesting that art's job is not to offer moral improvements but to 
hatch ideas, creating new, mutant forms, however distasteful they might be.

 Pricey Gamble: Hiro Yamagata is a graphic artist whose mass-produced 
screenprints have assured his commercial success but have earned him little 
critical recognition. "Earthly Paradise," a well-financed exhibition at the Los 
Angeles Municipal Art Gallery at Barnsdall Park, is meant to alert viewers to 
Yamagata's significance as a serious contemporary artist. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan backfires. Badly. 
</P>
<P>
 Yamagata's schematic, tacky paintings of tropical plants, gorgeous flowers and 
snazzy toucans, adorning seven perfectly restored, 1951-52 Mercedes Benz 
Cabriolets, get things drastically backward. 
</P>
<P>
 These brightly colored pictures on fenders, doors, hoods and trunks might be 
fine as murals along the freeway or as innocuous designs for beachwear. As 
embellishments of the cars, however, they look terrible. 
</P>
<P>
 Yamagata's paintings detract from the beauty of the rare, hand-assembled 
convertibles. Worse, the attempt to secure Yamagata's significance as an artist 
is based on a cynical belief that contemporary art is meaningful because it's 
expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Art is pricey not because its materials cost a lot -- as Yamagata's certainly 
do -- but because it coveys ideas and elicits experiences a culture deems to be 
valuable. Yamagata's effort fails because it puts too much emphasis on money, 
forgetting that while high prices are often the result of art, they are not its 
cause.

 A Focused Edge: Linda Burnham's paintings at Christopher Grimes Gallery are 
sharper, less cluttered and more resolved than any of her previous images, in 
which stylized designs and calligraphic flourishes energetically overlap with 
silhouettes of frogs, bugs and bears, as well as a wide variety of patterns, 
textures and techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 The crisp clarity of her new paintings is due, in part, to their being 
collaborations -- of a sort. Burnham made this body of work on unfinished 
canvases left behind by her husband, artist Robert Overby, at his death last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Ghostly outlines of lips, eyes and fingers remain from his wispy, linear 
sketches. These soft details appear to hover beneath the surface of Burnham's 
more thickly built-up layers of oil, alkyd, acrylic and resin. The contrast 
between her tactile accumulations of gooey paint and his shadowy, seemingly 
intangible after-images yields a delicate tension that gives these paintings 
their off-balance edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Burnham's earlier works, which seem tentative and excessively indebted 
to the styles of other artists, her most recent paintings are bold and focused. 
They signal her maturity as a painter.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; WHERE PIZZA, PANINI, PASTA ARE INFORMAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Cafe Angelino is not a scene. You don't have to dress. You don't have to valet 
the car. You don't have to make reservations -- in fact, you can stroll by, 
tether the dog, have a latte and maybe a slice of chocolate walnut pie and read 
most of the paper. Or don't sit down at all: call ahead, and your pizza, pasta 
and/or insalata will be bagged and waiting for you. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucked close to a couple of the real heavies among L.A.'s Italian restaurants 
-- Orso and Locanda Veneta -- this tiny Mom and Pop operation on 3rd Street 
confidently fills a basic neighborhood need for a no-frills, multi-purpose cafe 
where you can wander in wearing sneakers or flip-flops for a bowl of soup or a 
four-course meal to eat in or take out. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio Riccardi, the former chef of Rosti-Toscana in Brentwood, runs the 
kitchen and his wife Gail runs the front. Earnest and personable, Gail Riccardi 
believes equally in her husband's cooking and her customers' happiness: In 
today's world, such enthusiasm is unusual and refreshing. 
</P>
<P>
 The small, butter-colored dining room has wooden tables and chairs, antique 
photographs on the wall and an overall, appealing modesty. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Customers seem to exhibit similar patterns of behavior. Upon entering, they 
peer first at the day's antipasti (dark juicy caponata, slices of grill-marked 
eggplant, bright blanched carrots studded with garlic) and desserts (ricotta 
cheese pie, chocolate-dipped cookies). Then, there's a glance into the steam 
table at the various roasted and sauced chickens and finally, the choosing of a 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu is familiar enough in Los Angeles, but Cafe Angelino distinguishes 
itself through the use of high-quality ingredients, the imprint of a competent 
chef and extremely reasonable prices. Nightly specials offer a little added 
variety. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, the food here deserves Gail Riccardi's endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
 Try the generous insalata tricolore ; wide, side-by-side stripes of arugula, 
radicchio and endive make a colorful vegetal flag. Shaved parmigiano, an extra 
$1.50, turns a starter into a meal. 
</P>
<P>
 Panini are recommended: especially a melt-in-your-mouth grilled eggplant on 
crusty bread or, even better, the prosciutto made juicy with tomato and 
mozzarella.  
</P>
<P>
 Pizzas have thin, bubbly crusts, their bottoms scorched just enough to add a 
good, smoky flavor. Toppings are simple, elegant, applied with restraint. 
Mozzarella melts into a fresh tomato puree and a few basil leaves garnish the 
pizza margherita . The cheeseless puttanesca presents more of the fresh tomato 
puree sharpened with oregano, and scattered judiciously with capers and a few 
good olives. Best of all, however, is the focaccina , that thin, crackery crust 
topped first with a luscious blanket of melted mozzarella, then with a 
paper-thin coverlet of prosciutto. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pastas are also well-focused and restrained, although sometimes, especially 
with take-out items, the noodle element can be overcooked. Bow ties with 
artichokes have just enough of the light fresh tomato sauce to accentuate the 
thistles' nuttiness without overwhelming it. The same versatile tomato sauce 
changes character completely when matched with penne and a lot of aromatic, 
silken porcini mushrooms. A soft and creamy bechamel smooths a tangy meat sauce 
in the lasagna; too bad the noodles are so soft. 
</P>
<P>
 A vegetable risotto with carrots, peas and artichokes is stirred to order. 
Rice grains are still singular and chewy and the dish itself is good and saucy, 
which is how I prefer risotto. 
</P>
<P>
 All of Angelino's entrees are chicken and each selection is served with good 
roasted potatoes and colorful but uninteresting fresh vegetables. There's 
namesake pollo Angelino , a moist, classic, well-salted roasted rosemary 
chicken. Also, chicken breasts are available in both a cream and oyster 
mushroom sauce, and in a fresh tomato sauce with black olives and oregano. 
</P>
<P>
 In creamy, warm, fresh-from-the-oven creme brulee, raspberries explode with 
intense berry flavor. Deceptively pretty, a dense ricotta cheese pie is oddly 
grainy and dull. Pass it up in favor of a good tiramisu or that virtuously 
dense, intensely flavored chocolate-nut pie.  
</P>
<P>
 * Cafe Angelino, 8735 West 3rd St., Los Angeles , (310) 246-1177. Open daily 
for breakfast, lunch, dinner and take out. No alcohol served. Major credit 
cards accepted. Dinner for two, food only $20 to $34.

HOME ENTERTAINMENT; RETAILERS MIFFED AT SONY OVER STREISAND TAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The exclusive deal cut by Sony and Blockbuster Video for the new Barbra 
Streisand concert tape -- giving Blockbuster an extra song that other retailers 
won't have -- has made the competition furious. 
</P>
<P>
 Tower Video, which has 109 stores, has canceled its order for "Barbra -- the 
Concert," which comes out Tuesday. So has Philadelphia's Movies Unlimited, and 
other retailers are considering joining the boycott or taking other punitive 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 They hate the deal because it gives customers another reason to shop at 
Blockbuster, already the industry heavyweight with more than 2,000 stores. 
They're also afraid that this may happen again with some other video. They 
liken it to other sorts of exclusives that favor one outlet over another, such 
as McDonald's buying the rights to sell old MCA/Universal videos at a cut rate. 
</P>
<P>
 What's on "Barbra -- the Concert" is her recent HBO special. Buy it at 
Blockbuster, though, and the tape includes an extra song, "What Are You Doing 
the Rest of Your Life?" The suggested list price is $30, but most stores will 
probably sell it for $20-$25. 
</P>
<P>
 According to distributor sources, about 200,000 cassettes have been shipped -- 
a lot for music videos, which don't sell at anywhere near the volume of motion 
pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 But no copies of the Streisand title will be sold at Tower. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to shortchange our customers," Tower Vice President John 
Thrasher said. "We don't want to sell edited product if the unedited product is 
available elsewhere and we can't sell it." 
</P>
<P>
 He was particularly critical of Sony, the distributor. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they're doing is a slap in the face to the other retailers," Thrasher 
said. "We've supported their projects in the past. It's totally unfair for them 
to do this." 
</P>
<P>
 The Blockbuster deal may come back to haunt Sony, he hinted: "We don't have to 
carry Sony product. They have tapes other than the Streisand tape they need us 
to sell. I'm not saying we won't carry Sony product, but when they need us, we 
may not be there." 
</P>
<P>
 There isn't likely to be widespread support for Tower's course of action, but 
many retailers may follow the lead of Palmer Video, an 86-store chain based in 
Union, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to give this title the kind of promotional support we'd 
normally give it," said Palmer Vice President Peter Margo. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearing that other stores might not carry the tape was music to the ears of 
Ron Castell, senior vice president of Blockbuster. 
</P>
<P>
 "A boycott helps us," he said. "It means that if I'm a Tower customer and I 
can't get it at Tower, I'm going to get it at Blockbuster." 
</P>
<P>
 What those customers will find at Blockbuster are prominent displays of other 
Streisand product -- old movies in the video outlets and CDs and audiotapes in 
the company's music stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to promote all her music and movies," Castell said. "People who 
want the new tape are likely to want her other tapes and CDs. This isn't about 
selling that one tape but selling a lot of other product too." 
</P>
<P>
 Tower is boycotting only the video. It will carry both the CD and audiotape of 
the concert and the $50 laser version, which comes out Oct. 4 -- and will 
include that extra song. 
</P>
<P>
 Video Sales 
</P>
<P>
 Movies that premiere on home video in the rental market usually aren't 
repriced for the sales market until six to 12 months have gone by. But Warner 
plans to reduce "Grumpy Old Men," featuring Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, to 
$20 on Nov. 2, only four months after its video launch. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a few years ago, the sales market was a small, secondary phase of a 
movie's video life. But that has changed, with video sales booming as marketing 
techniques have become more sophisticated and more outlets have opened up. 
</P>
<P>
 The movies-for-sale market has expanded so much that even some old films, 
backed by shrewd marketing, can sell as well as recent hits. For instance, 
FoxVideo's "An Affair to Remember" is a big hit -- again. The company shipped 
1.6 million copies of the 1957 Cary Grant tear-jerker, repriced at $10, making 
it an impulse-buy item. A spokesman said the company is planning to ship 
500,000 more, which may be needed when the remake starring Warren Beatty and 
Annette Bening comes out next month. 
</P>
<P>
 MPI's massive marketing push on "Hondo," the 1953 John Wayne Western that just 
premiered on home video at $20, should make it a big seller. If the movie had 
come out five years ago, it would have been priced at about $30 and would not 
have been bolstered by a major marketing campaign. The result would have been a 
fraction of the business. 
</P>
<P>
 What's New On Video 
</P>
<P>
 "Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult" (Paramount). With Leslie Nielsen back for 
the third time as the bumbling cop, there's a high quota of laughs, 
particularly in the spoofs of the "The Untouchables" movie and the Academy 
Awards ceremony. For some fans, though, the presence of supporting actor O. J. 
Simpson may be a bring-down. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being Human" (Warner). This one came and went from theaters so fast you may 
never have heard of it. Robin Williams plays five different characters of 
questionable courage in various stages of history. He's not the manic Williams 
his fans love but very subdued. This confusing, poorly written movie is easily 
the worst of his career -- even worse than "Toys." 
</P>
<P>
 "Mother's Boys" (Miramax). Jamie Lee Curtis plays a psychotic who abandons her 
husband and children and then tries to reclaim them three years later. More 
silly than scary, it steals from other thrillers, among them "Fatal 
Attraction." It's surprising to see a quality actress like Vanessa Redgrave 
co-starring in such a grade-B movie.

THEATER REVIEW; SOME OF 'BEST FRIENDS' IS A DOG; THE REST IS WORSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every now and then at the Way Off Broadway Playhouse, the charm at the core of 
"Some of My Best Friends" will pop to the surface. But it's like an occasional 
bubble in what should be an effervescent evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley Hart's comedy concerns a widgets tycoon named Andrew who has come out 
the other end of mental and spiritual trauma and who, now settled happily in a 
humble life of painting in Greenwich Village, finds he is able to talk with 
non-human creatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally (15 years ago), the play was directed by no less than Harold Prince 
with Ted Knight as Andrew, which was wonderful casting. Even in his adopted, 
carefree bohemian lifestyle, Andrew still has something of the tycoon about 
him, advising and determining his hapless family members' business affairs. 
That two-sidedness is what makes him so funny and odd: He can ace a stock 
portfolio in two seconds flat and carry on deep discussions with his effete 
dog.  
</P>
<P>
 After losing actor David Walloch to injury (and postponing the opening of the 
show three times), Tony Reverditto, who directed "Best Friends" with Jolynn 
Jones, decided to play the role himself. But he is too young for Andrew by a 
good two decades, a fact that no amount of makeup and beard growth can hide. 
</P>
<P>
 And the problems are more than skin-deep: Reverditto is all hesitancy, static 
pace and palpable fatigue. This is a play that should be merry and light on its 
feet; here, it plods from beat to beat as if under some sort of obligation. 
</P>
<P>
 The focus shifts from Andrew's fancy-free spirit to his wife Dorothy's 
self-centered Angst and their moody son Lawrence's insecurity -- even though 
Robert Germon wrenchingly overplays Lawrence's juvenile outbursts. 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Sharp grows into her role as the rich yet highly confused Dorothy; Ron 
McCaw's energetic clowning wins us over as he romps about as Albert, the 
world's most opinionated dog; and there is nice interplay between Reverditto 
and Jan Tiehen as Irma, who happens to be a ficus tree in this lifetime (having 
been Millard Fillmore in a previous one). 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy Merrifield injects some much needed warmth as Sari, a dog-walker and 
desperate single mom (with a very loud baby, played very loudly by Adam Jaso). 
But by then it's too late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The basement apartment setting fits comfortably into Way Off Broadway's own 
basement space, and Perry Ash clearly had a ball with some of the play's 
outlandish costuming opportunities (although he may want to deck Tiehen out 
with more leaves). But a lot of comic business involving stylized flashbacks is 
ill-timed and hampered by a primitive lighting system. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the telling of Andrew's tale seems so much more a chore than it 
should have been. Somewhere, one suspects, the play's innocent fancy was lost, 
still to be found.

 Re "Still More Lumps for 'Rogue' Brokers," editorial, Sept. 10: 
</P>
<P>
 In my experience, management culture, not "rogue" brokers, is the major 
problem for stock investors. In two years the major firm handling my 
IRA-rollover never sent me an error-free monthly statement.They over-reported 
my initial rollover amount to the IRS, took substantial amounts out of IRA 
tax-protection status, contrary to written instructions, and stonewalled my 
pleas for corrections. In addition, the office manager admonished my broker 
because I invested in outside mutual funds rather than inferior in-house 
products. 
</P>
<P>
 The broker is essentially helpless against coercion by incompetent or greedy 
management. Management can put accusations into the broker's U-4 report in the 
Central Registration Depository at will. As reputable firms do look closely at 
a broker's report before offering employment, vindictive management can easily 
wreck an honest broker's career. 
</P>
<P>
 Brokers do not act alone. They work for the brokerage firm. Reputable firms 
can and do closely monitor broker activities. When something goes wrong, we 
need to look more at the firm than at the individual broker. 
</P>

 If an investor wants to risk transferring funds from safe, low-yield accounts 
to higher yield stock funds, let him also bear the risk of running into a "bad 
apple" broker as well. The SEC will no doubt need more funds to observe and 
police every agent or broker in the business. As a taxpayer who keeps his 
savings under his mattress, I don't want to subsidize a program to reduce the 
risk and increase the yield of an investor in the stock market. Let the buyer 
beware! That's part of the risk.

FIXING A CIVIL-RIGHTS WRONG; CONGRESS HAS A CHANCE TO REMEDY ALASKA CANNERY 
OUTRAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Why are 2,000 Alaskan cannery workers of Filipino, Samoan, Chinese, Japanese 
and Alaska Native descent unable to seek all the protections provided by the 
Civil Rights Act of 1991? Because the state's two senators -- Republicans Frank 
H. Murkowski and Ted Stevens -- succeeded in attaching to the act an amendment 
that bars the workers from suing the Wards Cove Co. cannery for alleged 
discriminatory employment practices. Congress was derelict in agreeing to this 
egregious exemption.The amendment robs the workers of civil rights protections 
available to other Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1974, Frank Atonio, a U.S. citizen of Samoan descent, filed what became a 
class action suit alleging discrimination in Wards Cove's racially segregated 
housing, mess facilities, recruitment and jobs. A 1989 Supreme Court ruling in 
the case made it harder for minorities to challenge job discrimination. 
Ironically, that ruling helped generate support for the Civil Rights Act, which 
restored longstanding protections against job discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 For three years there has been an effort under way to end the unfair exemption 
against the Wards Cove workers. The Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee 
recently cleared legislation known as the Justice for the Wards Cove Workers 
Act. Now Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) and Senate Minority 
Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) must quickly bring the bill up for a full vote, before 
this session ends. The House then would take up the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 If the bill is sent to the Senate floor, there are fears of a filibuster by 
Murkowski, the author of the unconscionable exemption. Championing such an 
injustice would suggest that the senator from Alaska had forgotten that it is 
his duty to represent all of his constituents. The Wards Cove workers deserve 
equal protection under the law.

MONEY IN SENATE RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "TV Blitz Fueled by a Fortune," Sept. 12: Your report on the Mike 
Huffington-Dianne Feinstein Senate race is a shameful admission to what so many 
believe, that "we have the best Congress money can buy." 
</P>
<P>
 Presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford, as co-chairmen of "Project Vote 
Smart," with prominent founders such as Barry Goldwater and George McGovern, 
are lending their support to the Center for National Independence in Politics, 
providing a wealth of important facts about all candidates running for 
Congress. The center just issued its 1994 election edition of the Voter's 
Self-Defense Manual, which not only monitors the campaign financial history of 
all candidates but also their performance in voting on 15 legislative areas, 
their key votes plus much more relevant information. 
</P>
<P>
 Since campaign finance reform has been pledged by both Democrats and 
Republicans, and with a bill now pending in Congress, the manual reveals some 
interesting figures. The money raised for the 52 Californians running for the 
House of Representatives amounted to $37,239,353 as reported to the Federal 
Election Commission from Jan. 1, 1991, to Dec. 31, 1992. This amounts to an 
average of $716,141 for each candidate. Even deducting the amount used by 
Huffington ($5,443,247), which includes unprecedented personal funds, from the 
grand total for that time period, it amounts to $611,443. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course the above figures are peanuts compared to the current spending of 
$100,000 per day by Huffington and $62,000 per day by Feinstein to see who can 
outdo the other in their campaign for the Senate.  
</P>
<P>
 Complete finance information and more about all candidates' performance may be 
had free by calling this hot line number: 1-800-622-SMART.

 Only in California could an unknown Texas oilman, in three short years, move 
to California, use his wealth to unseat popular Santa Barbara Republican Rep. 
Robert Lagomarsino, promise to remain in that office for many years, then turn 
around, one year later, and make a run for Feinstein's Senate seat, funded by 
$10 million of his own money. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlimited funds mean unlimited access to the best campaign consultants money 
can buy. This is a frightening prospect for politics in general. Soon, only the 
wealthy will be running this country. Anyone who could fund his own campaign, 
regardless of previous political experience, could buy a seat in Congress. 
Perhaps we should suspend the months of political campaigning and simply put 
the various House and Senate seats up for bid. This will guarantee triple flips 
in the graves of the founders of this once-democratic nation.

Congress.

 We must admit that the innuendoes, falsehood and character denigrations, by 
either candidate, will misinform the voters and move them toward ballot 
decisions based on misleading sound bites.

 As a lifelong Santa Barbara resident, I read "On Huffington's Turf, 
Republicans Hold Fund-Raiser for Feinstein" (Aug. 28) with much interest. For 
far too long, the Republican Party has dissipated its energy in bitterly 
fighting among itself over personalities and issues that divide moderates from 
the far right of the GOP. In defeating Lagomarsino in 1992, Huffington has 
continued to bear the brunt of hostilities from the divisions in the Santa 
Barbara Republican Party.  
</P>
<P>
 Your article unfairly characterizes the majority of Huffington's constituents 
as being angry with his performance, when in reality his detractors are a 
small, vocal minority. Huffington has been solid and very credible in 
representing the 22nd District. 
</P>
<P>
 For the good of the Republican Party as a whole, it is time for all 
Republicans to lay down their swords and wholeheartedly support him in his 
efforts to win the Senate seat in November.

the Senate seat cannot be bought, but who am I kidding?

GOOD . . . NOW KEEP IT CLOSED; U.S. TO TEMPORARILY SHUT DOWN SAN CLEMENTE 
BORDER CHECKPOINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The decision to shutter the Border Patrol checkpoint south of San Clemente has 
been billed as a temporary measure that will permit the redeployment of 
personnel to immigration control efforts along the border. The closing is good 
as far as it goes, but it ought to be made permanent. 
</P>
<P>
 The change, for which no starting or ending time was announced, will open the 
way for Operation Gatekeeper, an immigration control initiative announced by 
U.S. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno. That initiative, due to begin next month, will 
entail transferring the 95 agents assigned to the checkpoint. They will work 
immediately along the border -- a far more useful allocation of personnel than 
placing them 62 miles inside the country.  
</P>
<P>
 Illegal immigration has become a convenient political target, and the new 
operation does coincide with the final weeks of the election campaign. However, 
the money is not there to do everything, and the federal government should be 
credited for recognizing it must make tough choices. 
</P>
<P>
 The handwriting was on the wall earlier this year when the U.S. Immigration 
and Naturalization Service acknowledged that it couldn't afford an ambitious 
$30-million plan to upgrade the checkpoint. The agency said then that it was 
taking a welcome look at the checkpoints in light of fiscal realities. 
</P>
<P>
 It makes more sense to put the proposed extra agents -- more than 200 -- in 
San Diego than to stop people on a busy interstate after they already are well 
across the border. There has been pressure as well from Congress members and 
others who wanted the INS to abandon the checkpoint because of questions about 
effectiveness and safety. 
</P>
<P>
 It is time to conclude that the long-running show at the Interstate 5 
checkpoint has been a flop. Do what any Broadway producer would do in similar 
circumstances: close the curtain.

STARVED CHILD

<P>
 Re "Boy Who Starved Was Returned to Parents by Reluctant Judge," Sept. 14: 
</P>
<P>
 The 4-month-old baby was removed from his parents' custody in 1989 after 
suffering a fractured skull from his father's beating. His grandparents, who 
lived with the parents, were appointed his legal guardians after a social 
worker said the grandparents would protect him.The judge admits the parents 
weren't doing their parent counseling, that the injuries were serious. A foster 
parent warned that she fears the child would end up dead. Nevertheless, the boy 
was returned to the parents' home.  
</P>
<P>
 The 5-year-old boy was found dead in that home last April. He weighed just 19 
pounds. His parents are charged with murder, his grandparents with felony child 
endangerment. But what are the reluctant judge and the uncaring social worker 
charged with? I accuse them of aiding and abetting in the cruel sadistic 
killing of a helpless child.

 If cases like these were exposed, front-page style, by every newspaper in the 
land, what are the chances that each judge might be held more personally 
accountable after making such an obvious error? Yes, our courts are 
overburdened by abuse cases, but think what the judge's mistake meant to this 
suffering child and then multiply the tragic results of court leniency many 
times over.

CRIME WATCH; STRIKING OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Little is surprising but much is dismaying in RAND's new study of the likely 
effects of California's sweeping "three-strikes-and-you're-out" law. 
</P>
<P>
 RAND analysts predict that the law, which imposes 25 years to life in prison 
for a third conviction on a wide range of felonies, could reduce crime by as 
much as a third, but they say the mammoth cost involved in fully implementing 
the law makes any such reduction unlikely.That cost, which RAND estimates at 
$5.5 billion each year, or $300 from each taxpayer, would necessitate either 
substantial tax increases or steep reductions in spending on higher education, 
environmental cleanup and other state programs. 
</P>
<P>
 RAND concluded that alternatives could be as effective in reducing crime and 
would not carry the devastating economic impact of the "three-strikes" law. 
These alternatives include implementing the law's "two strikes" provisions, 
which triple penalties for a second conviction, and fully enforcing the maximum 
penalties that were on the books before "three strikes" took effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon California voters will have the chance to heed RAND's ominous warning by 
defeating Proposition 184, a needless measure nearly identical to the new 
"three-strikes" law. Defeat would signal legislators that after passing a 
blizzard of tough-on-crime measures this year, they now need to get real about 
the cost and trade-offs required. Everyone wants less crime, but crime control 
must be both rational and affordable. Proposition 184 and the "three-strikes" 
law are neither.

PEROT ON NAFTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding Ross Perot's reported reluctance to concede defeat over the NAFTA 
issue (Sept. 11): 
</P>
<P>
 It appears the "giant trucking sound" going south that we now hear has not 
impacted the views of Perot or the membership of "United We Strand America 
Inc." Instead, we are again beseeched to open our ears to the now familiar 
"giant clucking sound" of our favorite banty rooster of populism. What has been 
most audible, however, is the "giant ducking sound" of a politician who seethes 
at the mouth when asked to provide a straightforward answer to a direct 
question. What say we start a Wake Up America movement, and settle things over 
a cup of coffee.

WHEN BUREAUCRACY KEEPS WATER FROM CHILDREN; AZERBAIJAN: PRIVATE AMERICAN RELIEF 
EFFORTS FOR REFUGEES ARE STYMIED BY A U.S. REGULATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE OLSON, Jane Olson of Pasadena, a board member of the Women's Commission 
for Refugee Women and Children, traveled to Azerbaijan recently with a 
commission delegation. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After six years of war between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the disputed 
Nagorno-Karabakh region in western Azerbaijan, there is optimism, finally, that 
a peace accord is near.  
</P>
<P>
 But it will be some time before the million refugees and internally displaced 
persons, many them from Nagorno-Karabakh, can return home. The "scorched earth" 
practices of both Armenian and Azeri military forces leveled villages 
throughout the beautiful mountainous region, an Armenian enclave that 
unilaterally declared independence in January, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, war-displaced families struggle to survive in every imaginable form 
of shelter: rusty abandoned railroad cars, improvised "dug-in" sod houses on 
hillsides, rundown schools and other public buildings, trucks or tractor wagons 
and tent communities across the countryside sheltering from five families to 
5,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 The need for food, shelter, medical care and sanitation facilities will remain 
critical at least through the coming winter, and U.S. policies are not helping. 
Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act of 1992, which regulates U.S. assistance 
to republics of the former Soviet Union, forbids assistance to the government 
of Azerbaijan because of its blockade imposed on Armenia. This restriction 
applies not only to direct, government-to-government assistance but also to 
humanitarian efforts.  
</P>
<P>
 On a recent trip to Azerbaijan, we witnessed many examples of the negative 
impact of U.S. policy on both victims and relief workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The International Rescue Committee, the largest U.S.-based relief 
organization, stored thousands of dollars worth of tents, blankets and clothing 
in a warehouse with a leaky roof. Even though covered with plastic, the relief 
supplies got wet and moldy because the staff could not spend $700 for tarpaper 
to repair the roof. The warehouse, like most property in Azerbaijan, is 
government-owned. (Azerbaijan is just beginning to privatize.) Thus, to repair 
the roof would be to assist the government, not allowed under Section 907.  
</P>
<P>
 Trucks needed to transport and distribute relief supplies also are 
government-owned, and convoluted deals must be made with local drivers to 
"privately" lease trucks, needlessly delaying delivery of vital supplies.  
</P>
<P>
 Desperately needed latrine and shelter-building projects also have been 
delayed or derailed because cement and roofing materials can be obtained only 
from government sources.  
</P>
<P>
 And in the most dangerous example of strict interpretation of Section 907, Los 
Angeles-based Relief International was reprimanded for translating instructions 
on emergency medical supplies to Azeri doctors and health-care workers hired to 
serve at refugee camps. A staff person from the U.S. Agency for International 
Development, which monitors compliance, considered the local doctors to be 
government workers, since the entire medical system and the university medical 
schools are state-owned. To translate medical indications, therefore, was to 
assist the government. 
</P>
<P>
 Even delivering water, the most dire need in every refugee situation, is being 
hindered. Azerbaijan reportedly has the worst water quality of the former 
Soviet republics. Children are deathly ill from diarrhea caused by poor water 
and lack of fuel to boil it. But the only company that can drill wells is 
government-owned.  
</P>
<P>
 There is hope: Responding to complaints about the bureaucratic complexities 
and confusion caused by Section 907, Congress passed a bill giving the 
Administration 60 days to investigate the impact of the restrictions on private 
organizations providing humanitarian assistance. President Clinton signed the 
bill Aug. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 It is always the most vulnerable groups who suffer from well-intentioned but 
poorly designed and applied government regulations. In this case, it is the 
women, children and the elderly, who constitute more than 80% of the refugee 
population in Azerbaijan and throughout the world.

ALL PRESIDENCIES ARE NOT CREATED EQUAL; HAITI: WITH THE PRESENT CONSTITUTION, 
RETURNING ARISTIDE TO POWER MAY PROVE FUTILE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. CAREY, John M. Carey is assistant professor of political science at 
the University of Rochester and co-author of Presidents and Assemblies: 
Constitutional Design and Electoral Dynamics (Cambridge University Press, 
1992.) 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Restoring Jean-Bertrand Aristide to office in Haiti is not the same as 
restoring him to power. There is no evidence, however, that U.S. policy-makers 
are aware of the distinction, or how it affects the prospects for establishing 
stable democracy in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 We have a tendency to assume that presidencies all over are more or less the 
same -- that all are endowed with substantial authority. In fact, the 
constitutional powers of presidents vary enormously. Many wield far greater 
formal powers than U.S. presidents, and some, Haiti's included, have virtually 
no political authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Haiti's president does not control the composition of the executive branch. He 
does not name the members of the cabinet and cannot dismiss them. This 
authority is given to Parliament. The Haitian president, moreover, has no 
formal lawmaking authority. He does not exercise a veto, nor does he have any 
authority to issue legislative decrees or executive orders. This is all the 
domain of a prime minister and cabinet who answer to the legislature, not to 
the president. 
</P>
<P>
 The sole source of power for a Haitian president comes from being the only 
government official elected by a nationwide constituency. This should give the 
president a say in national policy-making, but without any formal authority, 
the choice can come down to pursuing an agenda by unconstitutional means or not 
at all. 
</P>
<P>
 This was precisely what happened in September, 1991, when a congressional 
majority tried to dismiss Aristide's choice for prime minister. The Haitian 
military justified removing Aristide on the grounds that the president was 
inciting demonstrations to intimidate lawmakers from exercising their 
constitutional authority to choose the government. 
</P>
<P>
 The point is not whether Aristide or the military was more to blame for the 
breakdown of democracy three years ago. It is that a constitution providing for 
a popularly elected president, but giving that president no formal authority, 
is logically inconsistent, and could easily reproduce crises that threaten the 
stability of democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other stable democracies with elected, but largely powerless, 
presidents. A few European parliamentary systems allow for the popular election 
of presidents who serve effectively as ceremonial heads of state. Ireland, 
Iceland and Austria are examples. In these cases, however, the institution of a 
government responsible to parliament was established well before the elected 
presidency. Ceremonial presidents were introduced in the European cases to 
replace ceremonial monarchs as heads of state, without altering the basic form 
of government. There were no political expectations attached to the idea of a 
presidential mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 The opposite was true in Haiti when Aristide was elected in 1990. Without any 
tradition of parliamentary supremacy -- or any tradition of stable democratic 
institutions of any sort -- Aristide supporters were understandably frustrated 
by the inability of their champion to control policy through formal channels. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, the pending agreement, which centers on Aristide's return to 
office, only reinforces the disjuncture between expectations and likely 
results. Aristide, arriving with an escort of 15,000 U.S. troops and an 
eventual multinational peacekeeping force, will certainly encounter citizens 
who expect action and results from the president, whether they support or 
oppose him. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this brings us to the goal of the U.S. mission in Haiti. Does it 
involve "fixing" the Haitian constitution, to bring powers of the president in 
line with the expectations surrounding the office? The Clinton Administration 
has given no hint that such a plan exists, or even that it is aware of 
Aristide's powerlessness. Indeed, the Administration is adamant that its 
purpose is not to build a nation, but rather to simply restore stability and a 
constitutional government. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that stability and the current constitution might be 
fundamentally incompatible. In addition to its litany of other problems, Haiti 
has a bad constitution. In restoring it as it stands, we may be regenerating a 
cycle of political instability.

PERSPECTIVE ON IMMIGRATION; LATINOS WANT A TIGHTER BORDER, TOO; THE FLOOD OF 
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS HURTS THE WHOLE COMMUNITY, WHICH NOW MUST DO WHAT GOVERNMENT 
WON'T. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESSE LAGUNA, Jesse Laguna was born in Austin, Tex., and spent his career in 
applied mathematics with the Navy and General Dynamics. A member of the Save 
Our State Committee, he has long been active in Mexican American affairs in 
southern San Diego County. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am a Mexican American. I have proudly served my country in two wars, and 
there are millions more like me. We are proud that our country's immigration 
laws are far more generous than those of Mexico or any other place in the 
developed world. But we are also proud that we are a nation of laws, which 
means respect for laws, including those we may not like. And illegal 
immigration is just that: illegal. It is a crime. To condone, encourage, 
perpetuate or defend it is unconscionable. To aid and abet it is equally 
illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 It is one thing to break a country's laws when fleeing from persecution or 
when your life is threatened. It is a totally different matter to break the law 
and hope to profit. It is one thing to petition your own government for fair 
treatment. It is quite another to make demands on a foreign government and its 
taxpayers when you have illegally rushed across its borders. And it is a 
horrible thing to start your life as a would-be American as a criminal. 
</P>
<P>
 This has nothing to do with race. If Latinos are caught more often, it is 
because they illegally cross the border more often. Most of the Anglos I work 
with on Proposition 187, the "save our state" initiative, would feel exactly 
the same way if the border invaders were Canadians setting up camp in Montana 
and hollering for freebies. We take the position that the state of California 
can no longer be the Department of Health, Education and Welfare for the rest 
of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 What's interesting in this debate is the opinion of other Latinos. Maria 
Enchautegui, who has conducted immigration studies for the Urban Institute, 
acknowledges that "Hispanics are affected most by immigration. Hispanics 
compete more with new immigrants than do white and black Americans. They feel 
the negative effects more." 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas Morning News columnist Richard Estrada says: "The rank and file 
Hispanics were far ahead of other Americans in viewing illegal immigrants as 
economic and even social threats . . . because the effects of immigration have 
manifested themselves first and foremost in Hispanic communities of long 
standing." 
</P>
<P>
 The respected magazine Hispanic says: "There is an ironic inconsistency in the 
U.S. Hispanic community. On the one hand, Hispanic Americans have become 
subjects of an anti-immigration backlash, while on the other, the majority 
opposes current levels of immigration. Up to 84% say there are already too many 
immigrants coming into the United States." Hispanic's report was based on the 
Latino National Political Survey, which, the magazine said, is considered the 
most sweeping measure to date of Latino opinion on social and political 
topics." 
</P>
<P>
 The poll sought a response to the statement, "There are too many immigrants." 
The following agreed or strongly agreed: Cuban Americans, 66%; Mexican 
Americans, 75%, and Puerto Ricans, 79%. Surprisingly, non-citizens agreed or 
strongly agreed in larger percentages: Cubans, 73%, and Mexicans, 84%. 
</P>
<P>
 Some self-proclaimed Latino leaders insist that passage of Proposition 187 
will cause Latinos in general to be suspected, rightly or wrongly, of being 
illegal residents. Quite the reverse. The hostile tactics of those fighting the 
initiative, the boast by many Latinos that "we won't overcome, we will 
overwhelm," and the encouragement of young Latino hotheads to take back the 
Southwest, Texas to California, by armed force, can only lead Americans to 
suspect all Latinos of being a potential fifth column. 
</P>
<P>
 California's middle class, the main backer of Proposition 187, seems caught 
between the Mexican and U.S. governments. While proponents of an open border 
say that there is no way to close it (so relax and enjoy it), either 
government, if really determined, could shut it down in a month. Working 
together, if they had a will, they could do it in three days.  
</P>
<P>
 Why don't they? Because illegal immigration has become a big business, with 
the local taxpayer bearing the costs. It provides a pressure valve for Mexico, 
so instead of caring for its own people, Mexico ships them north. Our paralyzed 
legislators don't fight, acting like deer transfixed in headlights. Our 
$2-an-hour "employers" welcome it; it's the next best thing to getting workers 
free. Drug abusers need it; the coyotes carry their mail. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it goes, on and on and on, like the Energizer Bunny.

THE PEOPLE'S PROBLEM ISN'T RAIL VS. BUSES; TRANSIT: TAXPAYERS VOTED FOR BOTH; 
WHAT THEY GOT WAS THE MTA PLACING THE INTERESTS OF ITS EMPLOYEES AHEAD OF THE 
PUBLIC'S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDELL COX, Wendell Cox, a public policy consultant in Illinois, served on 
the L.A. County Transportation Commission from 1977 to 1985. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr.'s refusal to budge on his injunction 
blocking the MTA bus-fare increase is encouraging. The issue, overdue for the 
court's attention, is discrimination, but not principally as argued by the 
plaintiffs in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no denying that the rail system would provide little benefit to the 
poor, who would be hurt most by the fare increase. But even if the plaintiffs 
prevail, bus riders will ultimately lose, because the cause of MTA fare 
increases will not have been addressed. Even if this fare increase is averted, 
others will follow in short order, because MTA costs are out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 The voters of Los Angeles County approved hundreds of millions in annual 
transit taxes in 1980 and 1982, yet there is less MTA bus service. Fares were 
kept lower for a time but have been driven up sharply since 1985, at far more 
than inflationary rates. Virtually all of the money for bus-service 
improvements -- and then some -- has been consumed in cost increases above 
inflation. For years, bus costs have been substantially higher than necessary. 
This, not the rail system, and not the economic downturn, is the cause of the 
MTA budget deficit and the unnecessary fare increases from 1985 through 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The poor are not likely to prevail against MTA's expensive taxpayer-financed 
defense. Nonetheless, the low-income citizens who rely on MTA bus service are 
victims of discrimination. The source of the discrimination is special-interest 
control of transit. Transit unit costs in Los Angeles are at least double the 
competitive market rate for virtually the same services provided under contract 
by private companies with unionized work forces. The excessively high costs 
stem from lack of competition. The result is that MTA bus driver compensation 
is more than double that of private unionized drivers. MTA bus drivers, who 
require relatively little training, are paid more than school teachers, who 
must earn a college degree. And it's more than bus drivers; excessive employee 
compensation is rife at MTA. Low-income bus riders, other bus riders and the 
taxpayers all face insidious discrimination that places the private interests 
of MTA employees ahead of the public interest. 
</P>
<P>
 This same problem has manifested itself around the world. In response, an 
inexorable trend is under way toward competitive contracting (private 
contracting) of public transit services. A "seamless" system is provided to the 
transit customer, as the transit authority retains control over routes, fares, 
quality and safety. But there is a big difference. Competition for contracts 
keeps costs down. 
</P>
<P>
 London provides half of its bus service through competitive contacting and 
will convert the rest by the end of the decade. Sweden, Denmark and New Zealand 
are among the nations that have or are converting to competitive contracting. 
</P>
<P>
 And progress is being made in the United States. San Diego now provides more 
than 40% of its bus service through competitive contracting. The results have 
been impressive. Fifteen years ago, San Diego transit unit costs were higher 
than Los Angeles'. Competitive contracting has greatly moderated San Diego cost 
increases. If Los Angeles transit costs had risen at the San Diego rate over 
the last 15 years, MTA would be spending at least $250 million less in 1994 for 
the present level of bus service. 
</P>
<P>
 Competitive contracting has been a great success where tried in Los Angeles. 
For example, the competitively contracted Foothill Transit Zone and City of Los 
Angeles express bus services cost 60% less than their predecessor SCRTD 
services, with better quality and safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact is that MTA is spending hundreds of millions of dollars annually more 
than necessary to provide bus service. This is a waste of taxes and it is 
contemptuous of taxpayers who are already burdened by myriad growing public 
needs. Worse, it injures the people for whom transit subsidies were established 
-- the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 While urban rail systems are virtually the most expensive and least effective 
transportation improvements, there is no reason to choose between bus and rail. 
The people of Los Angeles County voted for rail and will get less than 
promised. They voted for more bus service and didn't get it. They voted for 
lower bus fares and got little of it. What they didn't vote for was excessive 
transit-employee compensation, and that is what they have received in 
profligate quantities. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatter's decision presents an opportunity to reverse "take the money and run 
government" and restore the promises made to all Los Angeles County citizens, 
rich, middle-income and poor.

 YOUNG FASHION: Most high school students fashion themselves as snappy dressers 
who can simultaneously fit into the latest trend yet retain their

POLITICAL BRIEFING: VICA PRESSES CITY COUNCIL TO FILL YAROSLAVSKY SEAT QUICKLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 THAT VACANT FEELING: The Valley Industry and Commerce Assn. is the latest to 
raise an apprehensive voice about what may happen if Los Angeles City 
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky's seat is left vacant for possibly as long as seven 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 VICA's executive board voted unanimously this week to endorse the idea of 
having the City Council appoint an interim member to fill Yaroslavsky's seat 
until his permanent successor can be elected. Yaroslavsky will be stepping down 
in early December from his 5th District council seat representing Sherman Oaks 
and sizable parts of Van Nuys to take on new duties as a member of the Los 
Angeles County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of the 5th District seat being vacant for up to seven months 
makes VICA uneasy, said Wendy Brogin, chairwoman of the business organization's 
local issues committee. Particularly spooky was the recent fight over 
housing-rehabilitation dollars at City Hall, Brogin said. In this coup -- later 
reversed -- central-city council members took advantage of the absence one day 
of several of their Valley colleagues to shift millions of rehab dollars away 
from the quake-ravaged Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Brogin said VICA sees the interim appointment as a Valley issue, not just a 
5th District one, and she vowed to try to mobilize the Valley's entire council 
delegation to support the plan. "I've got my running shoes on to work on the 
council to support this," Brogin said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The selection of a mass transit rail route (the Chandler Boulevard versus 
Ventura Freeway debate) and a proposal to set up a redevelopment project in the 
Valley to deal with earthquake recovery are just two of the critical 
public-policy issues that are headed for decisions in coming months. If the 5th 
District has no voice in these debates, its constituents and the Valley as a 
whole may be the loser, Brogin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Yaroslavsky got the interim-appointment debate rolling several weeks 
ago, nothing has been heard from him about the matter recently. In fact, 
council President John Ferraro said he did not sense that Yaroslavsky was 
really all that committed to the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 So has Yaroslavsky lost interest? "No, he's still very serious about this 
idea," Alisa Katz, the councilman's top aide, insisted Thursday. "He's talking 
to his colleagues about it. It's coming along. It's going to be a battle, 
though. People need convincing and we're continuing to try to do that." Katz, 
however, declined to say which of his council colleagues Yaroslavsky has been 
lobbying. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, VICA is also trying to develop a list of politically unambitious 
"elder statesmen" who might take the interim post -- it being an article of 
faith that only such a neutered appointee would be acceptable. But Brogin 
declined to name anyone whom VICA might be considering as a likely candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 One name that continues to float around: state Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van 
Nuys). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 SPIN DOCTORS AT WORK: Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and so, too, are 
political kudos. 
</P>
<P>
 So when two sides present different pictures of who deserves credit for a new 
law, who do you believe? It's a conundrum that grows more common as the 
November election creeps closer. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the case of AB 3096, a bill that -- again, depending on whose news 
release you believe -- either creates jobs or restores Mono Lake. It either 
carries out the wishes of the Wilson Administration or those of the bill's 
author, Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar). It either benefits the San 
Fernando Valley or the new west basin plant in El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, it does all of the above. The bill provides $9 million for new 
water-conservation programs in Los Angeles so the city can afford to take less 
water from Mono Lake. The programs, starting with an East Valley Reclamation 
Project, means new jobs for people to perform water audits and teach people how 
to conserve water. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Wilson's and Katz's staff put their own spins on the legislation, 
only part of the picture emerges -- the part that is favorable to that 
politician. 
</P>
<P>
 "Governor Signs Katz Water Conservation Bill . . . Valley Expects New Jobs," 
blared Katz's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Governor Pete Wilson Signs Legislation to Help Mono Lake," said Wilson's 
release, taking credit for an "agreement between the Wilson Administration, 
environmental groups, and the City of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Katz's handout said it best. The law, it observed, is a "win-win 
situation for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 SPEAKING OF KATZ: The assemblyman held a news conference earlier this week to 
urge Wilson to sign a bill giving the Los Angeles school district $1 million 
for campus security. "This is, in a sense, a waiting-for-Pete press 
conference," Katz said. "Find time among the photo ops. Find time among the 
press conferences. Do it today. Our kids can't afford to wait any longer." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Wilson was in his Sacramento office reading and signing bills. He 
signed Katz's bill earlier in the day, his office said. 
</P>
<P>
 How did the Katz team respond? With a revised statement: "Responding to a plea 
by students, school officials and parents, Governor Wilson signed a bill . . . 
to install metal detectors and increase school security." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 SPEAKING OF TIMING: It appears that every time Los Angeles schools Supt. Sid 
Thompson schedules a news conference on campus security, a shooting has just 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, a student was fatally shot outside Hollywood High School, the day 
before Thompson and others held a news conference on school security. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Thompson attended the aforementioned news conference on metal 
detectors. On Monday, a student was shot on the football field at Locke High. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson says there's not much the school system can do about stopping these 
shootings. "There are ways we could preclude some of this," Thompson said. "But 
we know when we open school, we stand a risk with the gang turf issue. We try 
to beef up . . . but things can't always be prevented." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 HERE COME THE LOOKY-LOOS: In an effort to stay abreast of the district's 
needs, the Sacramento staff of state Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) will pile 
into a bus for a tour of Los Angeles next week. 
</P>
<P>
 With about half of Hayden's district falling within the boundaries of the San 
Fernando Valley, the tour group will spend much of its time cruising the area's 
earthquake-ravaged boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Valley arguably is under-represented," said Hayden Chief of Staff Duane 
Peterson. "Roberti's leaving. (Sen. Herschel) Rosenthal's poised to move in, 
but is from outside the district. So Tom is very interested in aggressively 
representing the Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Hayden is more often identified with his home base of Santa Monica 
than this side of the mountains, he has added a Valley resident to his staff: 
former Daily News reporter Rocky Rushing.

HOWARD ROSENBERG / TELEVISION: BRINGING CLOSURE TO ANCHORS' GLIBNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No sir, no more television scams that elevate theater over truth. The movie 
"Quiz Show" recalls a level of TV deception in the 1950s that is no longer 
possible. Not today, especially not in news, where everyone worships at the 
shrines of honesty and integrity. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 What's to be made of a Sept. 20 memo to KCBS-TV Channel 2 anchors, news 
writers and producers from Larry Perret, the station's new news director? 
</P>
<P>
 First, backtrack a few weeks, when the station's reporters were implored by 
management to reinforce a "perception" that "Action News is everywhere" by 
signing off their stories in the field with a specific address or neighborhood 
("Reporting from the corner of. . . ."). 
</P>
<P>
 All right, a little show biz, along the lines of KABC-TV Channel 7 requiring 
its news staff to constantly promote the "Eyewitness News Van." But now comes 
this Channel 2 memo from Perret titled "Closure," a copy of which was made 
available to The Times: 
</P>
<P>
 "We require an abundance of 'live' reports in our newscasts. They're important 
because they add immediacy and credibility to our coverage. Viewers believe 
'live' reports are more reliable because they are not censored. That's a bonus 
for us. But there also is a danger in all the 'lives.' We must guard against 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 The danger ! All right. Very encouraging. At last, a local news executive 
noting not only the advantages of live coverage and in-the-field wraparounds 
that create the myth of live coverage, but also the extreme perils: There are 
no safety nets. The "live" process is too swift for fail-safe measures. The 
opportunity for error is far greater than for someone taking time to craft a 
videotape report -- you know, the old-fashioned way. 
</P>
<P>
 The message of live TV, then: Use care! 
</P>
<P>
 But that isn't the message of Perret memo. 
</P>
<P>
 "The danger is this: The anchors could appear to be reduced to simply playing 
the role of traffic cop who after each 'live' report utter, 'Thanks for that 
live report.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, by all means prop up news anchors, giving the appearance that they 
actually have something substantive to contribute, even when they don't. And 
how to do this? 
</P>
<P>
 "The anchors must provide a sense of closure to these stories," Perret's memo 
continues. "The producers and writers must help them do it. Instead of simply 
saying 'Thanks,' the anchors should provide additional information, add 
context, give perspective or insight, or a historical perspective. Any of the 
above will help give a sense of closure to a 'live' report." 
</P>
<P>
 That would make anchors look like sages instead of the mere news readers most 
of them are, and caring sages, too. Yet how can anchors do this without 
actually having personal knowledge of stories? Perret wouldn't want them to 
utter something just to keep up appearances, would he? 
</P>
<P>
 The memo: "Instead of telling the entire story, leaving nothing for the anchor 
to say, let's save something for them to add. For example, 'That's a 
frightening story, Brad. We'll be looking for reaction from City Hall.' Or, 
'The problem just seems to be getting worse. Let's hope your report helps us 
find a solution.' Etc." 
</P>
<P>
 That's a frightening memo, Larry. The problem just seems to be getting worse. 
</P>
<P>
 A creation of outside consultants emphasizing form over content, the theatrics 
of "anchor-involvement" began permeating TV news operations years ago. Under 
Perret's predecessor, in fact, Channel 2 itself has encouraged these scripted 
performances. But sometimes it takes a few words from the new boss to keep 
everyone transfixed on the station's priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Complete the story," Perret urges. "Involve the anchors. Help them provide 
closure." As the old quiz shows did for favored contestants, in other words, 
$50,000-a-year news writers are instructed to create and put into the mouths of 
these anchors -- one of whom, Ann Martin, reportedly earns $1.7 million a year 
-- pretend ad-libs designed to make them appear credible. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Channel 2 anchor lips appear to have been energized. Here was 
4:30 p.m. anchor Bob Jiminez on Wednesday after reporter Mary Park's live 
stand-up on a nursing controversy at San Bernardino Hospital: "Well, every 
hospital has its policy, and on this particular case, it's being challenged." 
Yes, yes, closure ! 
</P>
<P>
 Here he was again after another reporter's live stand-up about a travel 
newsletter: "That's much more detail than everybody gets in the back seats of 
airliners." 
</P>
<P>
 And here was Martin on Wednesday's 11 p.m. newscast, following reporter Harvey 
Levin's live wrap-up of his taped O. J. Simpson update: "Awfully interesting, 
Harvey, how those little bits of information keep coming out. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 And how those anchor lips keep moving. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reporter lips, too. What an auspicious start on Channel 2 Wednesday for former 
KABC-TV Channel 7 reporter Linda Breakstone, "breaking" the story that district 
attorneys for Los Angeles and Santa Barbara counties would announce that day 
their intentions not to pursue child molestation charges against superstar 
Michael Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, what Breakstone and "Action News" claimed to have broken was old 
news. 
</P>
<P>
 At 10:05 a.m. Wednesday, Channel 2 interrupted its live coverage of a 
preliminary hearing in the O. J. Simpson murder case to proclaim that "Action 
News has learned" that the Jackson investigation would end, but that 
prosecutors would have the option of changing their minds within the six-year 
statute of limitations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Breaking the news for us," anchor Jiminez announced, was the station's newest 
reporter, the veteran Breakstone, who then proceeded to fill in viewers on her 
scoop. 
</P>
<P>
 Again trumpeting its incredible coup, Channel 2 brought back Jiminez at 10:30 
a.m. to remind viewers that the "latest member of the Action News team has 
learned this morning exclusively that no charges will be filed against 
Jackson." 
</P>
<P>
 And still later in the morning, after a televised press conference by the two 
counties' district attorneys that confirmed the Jackson report, Jiminez assured 
viewers that "this comes as no surprise to Linda Breakstone." Cut to 
Breakstone, who agreed. "We found out what was going on this morning," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The question was how she had found out. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's see, now. If she had been watching the previous day's noon newscast on 
her new station, Channel 2, she would have found it out from her new colleague, 
Levin, who had reported "strong indications" that Jackson would not be 
prosecuted. Well, that was still a tad speculative. But if she had read 
Wednesday morning's Los Angeles Times, Breakstone could have learned 
definitively of the no-prosecution decision from a front page story by Jim 
Newton. And if she had been watching television that morning, she could have 
learned it from the other stations reporting the same story. In other words, 
you'd have to say that Breakstone has vast sources. 
</P>
<P>
 This is indeed baffling, a mystery for which there appears to be only two 
possible answers. Either Breakstone and her new bosses at "Action News" didn't 
glance at the morning newspaper or monitor other stations Wednesday, which 
would make them uninformed idiots, or they did see the paper and other TV 
reports but proceeded with the "learned . . . exclusively" fib anyway, which 
would make them liars. 
</P>
<P>
 In either case, this is a frightening incident that could taint the gleaming 
credibility Channel 2 has built up with its numerous live reports and scripted 
anchor ad-libs, a crisis that news director Perret will surely want to address 
in another memo.

IS AN EMMY WORTH A 51-YEAR WAIT? ASK FYVUSH FINKEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MICHAELSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fyvush Finkel says he never would have changed his name -- even if he had been 
asked. Nor would he have altered his nose, which distinguishes a face that can 
call up a rainbow of emotions with the speed of a photographer's flash. And 
when he won the Emmy Award last week as best supporting actor in a dramatic 
series for his portrayal of Douglas Wambaugh, the crafty but good-hearted 
lawyer on CBS' "Picket Fences," Finkel stood his ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care how much time they gave me," he said of the 30-second limit 
imposed on winners for their acceptance speeches, gloriously shaking his award 
off the Richter scale. "I waited 51 years to get on this stage!" 
</P>
<P>
 Over lunch this week at the commissary at Fox -- the studio where "Picket 
Fences" is filmed -- Finkel, who turns 72 next month, was still exulting, 
invariably punctuating sentences with deep, melodic laughs as he told jokes or 
when the likes of Mel Brooks stopped at his table. 
</P>
<P>
 "I waited a long time for recognition," explained the actor, a 
great-grandfather, in the company of his wife Trudy, to whom he's been married 
for 47 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
 His wait exceeds the longevity of the 46-year-old Emmys. A son of East 
European immigrants, Finkel has been in show business since age 9, starting out 
in Yiddish theater around the corner from his house in Brooklyn, when a boy 
soprano was needed. That, of course, was years before TV. After graduation from 
high school, where he learned a furrier's trade, he went on the Yiddish theater 
circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stayed in the Yiddish theater till I was 43 years old. When I left it, I 
was a star." 
</P>
<P>
 He was not the romantic lead -- "I never got the girl," he explained. At 
6-foot-3, he was supposed to play villains, but Finkel insisted on the role of 
a comedian, who came on stage wearing white socks, the comic's trademark, which 
itself provoked laughter. He segued to American theater with "Fiddler on the 
Roof." A baritone, Finkel was in the road company for more than 12 years, 
graduating from the role of the innkeeper at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in 
1966 (a role he reprised on Broadway in 1970) to the butcher, to Tevye. 
</P>
<P>
 He played the owner of the "Little Shop of Horrors" Off-Broadway for five 
years in the 1980s, and starred in both Off-Broadway and Broadway productions 
of "Cafe Crown," a revival about Yiddish theater. Finkel won an Obie in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Movie credits include "Brighton Beach Memoirs" and "Seize the Day." He also 
did commercials, played the Florida condo and Catskills circuits, occasionally 
appeared on a soap. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the biggest miracle in the world, getting a TV series at my age," said 
Finkel, who allows that he's "shrunk an inch" with age. "It's happened for 
other actors but I'm talking of myself -- that's the point." 
</P>
<P>
 And he did it without an audition, which for Finkel has special meaning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Picket Fences" executive producer David Kelley rented the 1990 movie "Q & A," 
in which Finkel had a brief cameo as a lawyer defending a gangster. "I just 
took one look at him and knew that was Wambaugh," said Kelley, taking a phone 
break from his writing. "I was looking for a character, a real character, that 
I could give legitimate, serious debate to, and yet, you could get a sense of 
comedy from him at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wambaugh was written as probably a grittier and tougher character, maybe a 
less redeeming character," Kelley says, "and then, when we melded it with 
Fyvush, we had to adjust it. Fyvush's own personality pervaded the character of 
Wambaugh, a person who really loves life. We had contemplated this as a man who 
really had a lot of scar tissue and maybe was angry at the world. Well, that's 
not Fyvush." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not now anyway. But there was a time, long before "Fiddler," when Finkel 
yearned for Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1952, he tried out for a role in Cole Porter's "Can-Can" and, after a 
call-back audition, was told Porter wanted to see him. "So you'd think it was 
in the bag. He said, 'Mr. Finkel' -- I'll never forget it -- 'you're a great 
artist. I go to see the Yiddish theater sometimes, because that's where I get 
my ideas for my music' -- because most of his music is in a minor key. 'And you 
are so wonderful, but unfortunately I can't seem to find a part (for you).' 
</P>
<P>
 "I turned white and green and blue," Finkel said. "I couldn't eat for a week. 
I said, 'To hell with them! I'm not going to audition anymore.' Then in 1965, I 
had to audition for 'Fiddler.' " He laughed. "When an actor makes a statement, 
that doesn't mean he's going to stick to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Finkel had been up for the Emmy last year; it went to Chad Lowe of ABC's "Life 
Goes On." "Inwardly I was (disappointed) but the smile remained," he recalls. 
"What are you going to do? Ninety percent of the critics said I would get it. 
This time, we came to the ceremony" -- he had started to say "service" -- "and 
we decided (that) no matter what happens, we're going to enjoy ourselves. To be 
nominated is an honor but winning is an even bigger honor." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the episode that helped Finkel win the Emmy resulted from some 
complaints that his lawyer character played into an anti-Semitic stereotype of 
an ambulance chaser. So by way of an answer, Kelley wrote an episode in which 
the rabbi of Wambaugh's temple wanted to revoke his membership, claiming 
Wambaugh was an embarrassment to Judaism. The show pointed out that while 
Wambaugh may be a "hustler" -- distributing cards that say "reasonable doubt 
for a reasonable fee" -- he is a good Jew and a good man, who defends some who 
can't afford to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wambaugh is an intellect, " Finkel said, savoring the word. "He knows the 
law. He might be eccentric, but only in the courtroom. At home he's a good 
father, a good husband, but when he enters that courtroom he's a madman 
sometimes. He twists around the judge, the D.A., his own witness sometimes. You 
can't fool him." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the actor, he says he's "getting the offers you never even dreamed 
before. Movies, guest shots on other shows, commercials. All in one week they 
came. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you know Mr. Mel Brooks?" Finkel asked his interviewer as the director 
approached to offer congratulations on the Emmy.

 "Did you see his revue 'Finkel's Follies' (at the Westwood Playhouse in 
1990)?" Brooks asked. "My wife (Anne Bancroft) and I went backstage; it was 
sensational."

 "There was no pretense about it," Finkel said. He could say the same of 
himself.

'MY FAIR LADY' GETS A FACE LIFT; 30 YEARS LATER, GEORGE CUKOR'S OSCAR-WINNING 
MUSICAL IS RESTORED. ISN'T IT LOVERLY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EMANUEL LEVY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Emanuel Levy is the author of the new 
biography George Cukor, Master of Elegance, published by William Morrow. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The newly refurbished version of George Cukor's Oscar-winning musical, "My 
Fair Lady," which opens at the Cineplex Odeon Century Plaza today, was restored 
by Robert Harris and James Katz, the team that reconstructed "Lawrence of 
Arabia." There are no new scenes added to the film, but the restorers worked on 
the color scheme and soundtrack, using the most sophisticated technologies. The 
re-release celebrates the 30th anniversary of one of Hollywood's most popular 
musicals, starring Rex Harrison as Professor Higgins and Audrey Hepburn as 
Eliza Doolittle, though few people know that it was in the making for two long, 
turbulent years. 
</P>
<P>
 You may think you're familiar with "My Fair Lady," but the following are 15 
loverly tidbits you never knew: 
</P>
<P>
 1. The struggle to acquire the film rights for Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick 
Loewe's mega-stage hit went on for years before Jack Warner struck a deal, 
paying an all-time record of $5.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 2. In its time the most expensive musical ever made, "My Fair Lady" was 
budgeted at $12 million, which by completion rose to $17 million, a hugely 
extravagant figure for the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 3. A prestige musical, casting the film generated a great deal of publicity. 
Lerner hoped that Rex Harrison and Julie Andrews would re-create their 
successful stage roles, but Warner selected Audrey Hepburn, a respected and 
bankable star. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Hepburn became the second actress in Hollywood to be paid $1 million for a 
picture; the first was Elizabeth Taylor, for "Cleopatra." 
</P>
<P>
 5. Neither director Cukor nor Harrison thought Hepburn was right. Harrison 
confessed: "I would much prefer to do it with Julie Andrews. Audrey had no 
voice and she didn't sing, which was sad. Being Dutch, she also didn't 
understand the Cockney accent. George was very patient, but she simply couldn't 
do it, and in the end he gave up." 
</P>
<P>
 6. Having sung in her movies (including "Breakfast at Tiffany's") before, 
Hepburn assumed she would do her songs -- she didn't know that Marni Nixon had 
already been secretly approached to do dubbing. Hepburn continued to work 
diligently on her singing, but her efforts resulted in smiles of embarrassment 
among the crew. No one wanted to tell her that her voice wasn't right -- even 
in the lower register. (Those who want to hear the real Hepburn singing will be 
able to on the anniversary laser disc to be released this fall, which features 
two songs dubbed in Hepburn's own voice.) 
</P>
<P>
 7. Cukor's first choice for Higgins was Peter O'Toole, the star of David 
Lean's forthcoming "Lawrence of Arabia." After seeing a rough cut in London, 
negotiations with O'Toole began but his manager made too many conditions. Cary 
Grant was also offered the part, despite Cukor's reservations about his speech 
-- "a little Cockney creeps in." But Grant turned it down in a gentlemanly 
fashion: "It was Rex's and only Rex's part." 
</P>
<P>
 8. Cukor wasn't even the first choice as director: Both Lerner and Warner 
wanted Vincente Minnelli, who had directed many successful musicals, among them 
"Gigi." When Minnelli made too many demands, the job went to Cukor. 
</P>
<P>
 9. Cukor resented that Hepburn was dependent on production designer Cecil 
Beaton, and could never forget that Beaton was hired before he had been, and 
was perceived as more vital to the film. The interaction between Cukor and 
Beaton got off to a bad start when the snobbish Beaton described the vulgar 
look of Hollywood's movies as "the Himalayan mountains of bad taste." For his 
part, Cukor poked fun at Beaton's flamboyant appearance, wearing Edwardian 
suits and broad-brimmed Panama hats to the set, in sharp contrast to his 
ordinary gray slacks and open shirt. Harrison's view of the conflict: "George 
was very anxious about the film's look, but he let Cecil have his way. 
Otherwise, there would have been a constant clash of two very strong 
personalities. Once the visual conception was established, they weren't on 
speaking terms." 
</P>
<P>
 10. Warner's comment on the first day of shooting, Friday, Aug. 13, 1963: 
"This is one time when we can't afford to be superstitious." 
</P>
<P>
 11. "Mary Poppins" led the Oscar race for films released in 1964 with 13 
nominations; "My Fair Lady" followed with 12. 
</P>
<P>
 12. Except for Stanley Kubrick ("Dr. Strangelove"), it wasn't a particularly 
strong year for directors; all but Cukor were first-time nominees. Cukor, age 
66, won the Oscar for "Lady," which marked his fifth nomination. Many believed 
it was Hollywood's long overdue tribute to a distinguished career, which had 
included "The Women" and "The Philadelphia Story." 
</P>
<P>
 13. The academy's failure to nominate Hepburn was "hell" for her, she confided 
to friends; to escape the hectoring press, she flew to Lausanne, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 14. It was Cukor's idea that Hepburn replace the convalescing Patricia Neal, 
who had suffered a stroke, as presenter of the best actor Oscar. It created a 
mild furor in Hollywood, but gave Hepburn the best press of her career. 
</P>
<P>
 15. "My Fair Lady" settled in for an indefinite run at the Egyptian Theatre in 
Hollywood, with its tenure ending in February 1966, after 68 weeks. In 25 
weeks, with total grosses of $1.65 million, it set a house record at the 
Egyptian; worldwide, it grossed more than $50 million in its first year.

NEW ANGLE ON A SYMBOL OF ART DECO; PAINTING: TAMARA DE LEMPICKA'S PORTRAITS OF 
THE '20S AND '30S LEISURE CLASS ARE FINDING REVIVED INTEREST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG TURNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tamara de Lempicka's life personified European Jazz Age hedonism and her Art 
Deco portraits of idle aristocrats, voluptuaries and hangers-on to the 
Continental smart set were emblematic of the era. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Hitler consumed Europe and De Lempicka moved to Beverly Hills. As she was 
exiled from her milieu, her talent seemingly evaporated, and her reputation 
with it. Now, the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts has mounted a large exhibition 
of the late painter's works, the first North American retrospective of an 
artist whom museum director Pierre Theberge describes as "an essential part of 
the great machinery of the 1920s and '30s." 
</P>
<P>
 The De Lempicka exhibition of 57 paintings follows a revival of interest among 
collectors, especially in Hollywood. In March, an Italian collector bought De 
Lempicka's "Adam and Eve" (1932) at auction from Barbra Streisand for $2 
million. Streisand had paid $135,000 for it 10 years earlier. That work and 
others still in Streisand's collection are not in the exhibition, but three 
paintings owned by Jack Nicholson are included. The Montreal exhibition runs to 
Oct. 2 and will not travel. 
</P>
<P>
 Theberge's idea for a De Lempicka retrospective dates from 1991, when the 
museum mounted "The 1920s, Age of the Metropolis." Three of De Lempicka's 
portraits were displayed then, and one was used as the show's signature work. 
</P>
<P>
 "In that context, she really appeared as an artist who defined the period, in 
terms of style and attitude, in a certain toughness," Theberge said in an 
interview. Echoes of her style can be found in German portraits of the same era 
by Christian Schad and Wilhelm Schnarrenberger. 
</P>
<P>
 Art scholars and critics are divided on De Lempicka, to say the least. Many 
regard her as an artist who merely reflected her times rather than helped to 
define them. And her post-European work inevitably diminishes her reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 Theberge makes clear that he does not equate De Lempicka with Picasso or with 
succeeding art geniuses who flowered in the 1920s. Rather, he puts her in the 
company of Josephine Baker, Greta Garbo, Coco Chanel and Colette, those who 
placed their distinctive stamp on European society between the wars. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The sloe-eyed decadence reflected in "Les jeunes filles" ("Young Girls," 
1929), the portrait of Montmartre nightclub owner Suzy Solidor in front of a 
Cubist skyline (1933) and the confident expression in a 1932 self-portrait 
behind the wheel of a green Bugatti are veritable advertisements for the era. 
Certainly, art in the De Lempicka style pops up across North America in 
billboards, signs, posters and other suggestions of the period. 
</P>
<P>
 Also contributing to the De Lempicka revival may be a contemporary resonance 
in her persona: independent, unabashed in her sexuality, self-promoting, 
ambitious. Sound familiar? Consider this: Madonna is a collector and has used 
images from De Lempicka in her music videos. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's astounding how contemporary she is to today's sensibility," said 
Theberge, who added that, in the 1920s and '30s, "you can count on the fingers 
of your hand the number of women artists who were successful." 
</P>
<P>
 "I live life in the margins of society and the rules of normal society don't 
apply in the margins," De Lempicka said, according to "Passion by Design," a 
1987 biography co-authored by the artist's daughter, Kizette de 
Lempicka-Foxhall, and Charles Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
 The artist was born Tamara Gorska in Warsaw around the turn of the century -- 
the precise date is uncertain. She summered in St. Petersburg and married a 
well-to-do Russian lawyer, Tadeusz de Lempicki, in 1916. Two years later, the 
couple fled the Bolshevik Revolution for Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 There, they moved into the circle of exiled Russian nobility and other 
out-of-work aristocrats. It was there that De Lempicka took up painting. The 
teacher who had the greatest influence on her was Andre Lhote, who sought to 
apply the principles of Cubism to traditional subjects such as landscapes, 
nudes and portraits. 
</P>
<P>
 Seriously ambitious in her art, the tall, blond De Lempicka managed to turn 
her headlong lifestyle into a business asset. Her notoriety attracted clients; 
clients became patrons, and lovers. And there were countless lovers, male and 
female. Her visits to the estate of Italian Fascist poet Gabriele d'Annunzio 
inspired a gossipy account by a servant that decades later was transformed into 
the audience-participation play "Tamara." The play opened in Los Angeles in 
1984 and ran for the better part of a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Tadeusz de Lempicki divorced her in 1928. She painted a portrait of him that 
same year, leaving unfinished the left hand, which would have carried the 
wedding band. In 1933 she married Baron Raoul Kuffner on the understanding that 
she could continue to live as she pleased.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 De Lempicka flourished through the Depression, but in 1939, she and Kuffner 
left for the United States, eventually landing in Beverly Hills. Her reputation 
faded, and from Beverly Hills she moved to New York, then Houston and finally 
Cuernavaca, Mexico, where she died in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Theberge theorizes she could not adjust to the "great break" of the war. Her 
glamour-based style was suddenly outdated, in the same way that the glossy 
musicals and screwball comedies of 1930s Hollywood were replaced in the 1940s 
by film noir and serious drama. 
</P>
<P>
 The Montreal exhibition was initially presented in Rome, organized by the 
Accademia di Francia and the Centro Culturale Alessandra Borghese. It was not 
intended to leave Italy, and Theberge had to do some hasty negotiation and 
organizing. As a result, it is not as complete or selective as he would have 
preferred. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the portraits of Tadeusz di Lempicki, Solidor and the artist 
herself, critics have singled out for praise a series of nudes, "La belle 
Rafaela" from 1927 and a portrait of the Duchesse de La Salle (1925). 
</P>
<P>
 But they have not been unstinting in their praise. For example, Ann Duncan in 
the Montreal Gazette praised De Lempicka's best work as "striking and 
seductive" but found her late work "barely this side of paintings on black 
velvet." 
</P>
<P>
 "In the end," Duncan concluded, "it is the woman that fascinates almost as 
much as her painting, which is an unsatisfactory state of affairs for any 
painter."

HE HELPED CHARLOTTE SPIN HER WEB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If you have a child -- if you were a child -- who loved books, chances are 
that Garth Williams is a treasured old friend. 
</P>
<P>
 You may not know the name, but you know his work: Williams' whimsical, 
beautifully executed pen-and-ink drawings of animals and people can be found in 
a raft of childhood literary favorites -- "Stuart Little," "Charlotte's Web," 
"The Rescuers" and "The Little House on the Prairie" books -- to name only a 
fraction of his output over 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
 An exhibit of Williams' original works from these and other children's books, 
will be presented at the Every Picture Tells a Story gallery in Hollywood today 
through Oct. 20. The 83-year-old artist, who divides his time between his 
castle in Mexico and a home in San Antonio, had planned to be at the gallery 
this evening for a special reception to launch the exhibit, but is ailing and 
unable to travel. 
</P>
<P>
 From the couple's San Antonio headquarters, Williams' wife Leticia explained 
that a 1961 bout with hepatitis after his move to Mexico left Williams with 
chronic fatigue syndrome.  
</P>
<P>
 Williams, the son of a professional cartoonist father -- "a tremendous artist 
who was Garth's inspiration," according to his wife -- and a landscape painter 
mother, began his own artistic career as a sculptor in England. Back in America 
(he was born in New York), he found his true calling when he was asked by an 
editor at Harper & Row to illustrate "Stuart Little," E.B. White's 1945 
poignant, comic fantasy about a spirited little mouse's coming-of-age in the 
world of humans. 
</P>
<P>
 From then on, Williams produced an amazing catalogue of work, illustrating his 
own original children's stories, books by White, Laura Ingalls Wilder, Margery 
Sharp, Margaret Wise Brown and scores of others. 
</P>
<P>
 His latest illustrations can be seen in "J.B.'s Harmonica," by Williams' 
godson, former Lovin' Spoonful lead singer John Sebastian, who will appear at 
the reception. 
</P>
<P>
 "Garth loves John like a son," said Leticia Williams, who expresses deep 
admiration for her talented husband of 21 years. "Garth came (back) to America 
with $1 in his pocket and Sebastian's parents invited him every day for supper 
and gave him money and never wanted to be paid back." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Williams is "retired now," she said, he isn't taking commissions, but he 
does plan to add a 99th book to his total. His next project is to illustrate a 
story written by the couple's 16-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 * Every Picture Tells a Story, 7525 Beverly Blvd., Hollywood, (213) 932-6070. 
Reception: tonight, 6 - 9 p.m.; gallery hours: Tue.-Sat., 10 a.m.-6 p.m.

ON THE ISSUE: INFORMED OPINIONS ON TODAY'S TOPICS; UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN AND 
EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTONIO OLIVO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Proposition. 187, the state ballot initiative to deny most government services 
to undocumented immigrants, entered a new dimension Tuesday when U.S. Secretary 
of Education Richard W. Riley stated that he would withhold federal funds from 
California school districts if it is approved by voters. This would result in 
the loss of more than $450 million in the Los Angeles Unified School District's 
$4.2 billion budget.  
</P>
<P>
 Because the measure would require schools to disclose information from 
educational records, Riley said he considers the proposition to be in violation 
of the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statewide poll conducted by The Times before Riley's announcement, 62% of 
registered California voters said they favored the ballot initiative's 
objectives. Recently, the San Fernando City Council went on record against the 
initiative, while the United Chambers of Commerce of the San Fernando Valley 
voted in its favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Should undocumented immigrant children be denied public education? 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Curry, United Chambers of Commerce of the San Fernando Valley 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a way to beat our political leaders in Washington over the head in 
order to get them to do something about our immigration problem. We have to 
maintain our borders and the federal government has not done that adequately. 
This is not a racist issue, but a method to control the major influx of illegal 
immigrants to our state. Economically, the only impact that Proposition 187's 
passage would have on our community, would be if the schools did lose that 
money. But I don't think our government would allow that to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Doude Wysbeek, San Fernando city councilman 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anybody is denying that we have an undocumented residents 
problem. But it is not humane to ban kids from school who are already here or 
to deny them health care. That is not the American way to solve problems. Being 
an immigrant myself, I believe that the American way is simply to protect the 
human rights of others. That is what we accomplished in World War II and we 
shouldn't forget it. When you have a tight economy, people tend to look for a 
scapegoat to their own failures. I believe people will oppose this in the end." 
</P>
<P>
 Juana Mora, chairwoman, Cal State Northridge Department of Chicano Studies 
</P>
<P>
 "If (Proposition 187) were to pass, fear would rise within the Latino 
community. Documented students would likely be targets of harassment. As it 
stands, the Latino community faces a huge dropout problem among its children. 
Undocumented students will leave school because they are afraid of being 
discovered and sent back to their country. They are afraid for their families. 
(Also), if the schools lost those federal funds, bilingual programs would 
suffer greatly." 
</P>
<P>
 Grace Foster, member, State Board of Managers, California State PTA 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no simple yes or no answer. It's a question of the federal 
government being responsible for resolving this problem that we're all angry 
about, not an individual state. It's a nasty situation that people are willing 
to revenge their anger on children. This initiative does nothing to resolve the 
issue. It doesn't close the border. It doesn't stem immigration at all. . . . 
Many of these kids may contribute significantly to our society. They're in 
school and trying to stay there and are grateful for the refuge and the 
opportunity. Why take it away from them?"

<P>
 While chewing on a Rolaids tablet is a common way to relieve heartburn, 
munching on woolly blue curl, a plant found in the Santa Monica Mountains, may 
be a better and more natural way to ease digestive problems. 
</P>
<P>
 This and other tips will be discussed during an overview of the medical and 
cosmetic use of native plants. 
</P>
<P>
 The lecture is the first in a free series of discussions planned at the Soka 
University of America Botanical Research Center and Nursery in Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 Melanie Baer-Keeley, a native-plant horticultural specialist, will lead the 
series with an overview of past and present uses of native plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Other discussions will include how applications of sugar bushes and the yerba 
mansa plant can help remedy colds.  
</P>
<P>
 Keeley will also explain how other herbs can be used to supplement protein 
deficiency, relieve arthritis pain and smooth the skin. 
</P>
<P>
 The first lecture is scheduled for 7 p.m. Oct. 12. Reservations are required.

PIANIST SMITH SAYS HUMOR IS THE KEY; JAZZ: HE HAS WORKED WITH ELLA FITZGERALD 
AND COMPOSED. TONIGHT HE WILL PLAY ONE OF 'FOUR GRAND PIANOS' IN LA MIRADA.

 "To me, piano is fun and games," said Paul Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Tall, tan and 72 years old, Smith is a master of technique who can play 
smooth, even lines at quicksilver tempos. But he loves to break things up with 
silly stuff, like throwing "Pop Goes the Weasel" into the middle of "Have You 
Met Miss Jones?" 
</P>
<P>
 And he is well aware this lighthearted approach doesn't sit well with 
everyone, especially critics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know everybody doesn't appreciate my sense of humor, but I play for the 
audience, and the listeners seem to go for it," he said. "I figure one good 
laugh is worth 1,000 good choruses. And if I get that one laugh, then maybe 
they'll listen to the 1,000 choruses." 
</P>
<P>
 He has worn many hats in his 53 years as a working musician. He has composed 
and arranged, played on the soundtracks of hundreds of films and backed artists 
from Ella Fitzgerald to Pat Boone on more than 150 albums. And, as a jazzman, 
he has recorded more than 50 albums of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 He will be playing jazz tonight at the La Mirada Theatre for the Performing 
Arts on a program called "Four Grand Pianos" that also will feature Steve 
Allen, Pete Jolly and Mark Massey. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Smith said he will play a little bit of everything tonight -- not 
just jazz but some pop, some classics, "stride, Mozart, boogie woogie. . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the studios, he recalled, "You had to be equipped to do it all. We 
were musical whores -- we had to sound like everybody else. Someone would say, 
'Give me an Erroll Garner introduction,' and you did it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now a guy will say, 'Give me an Elton John intro,' and I have no idea how he 
plays," he added with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 As one of the most active musicians on the L.A. studio scene, he would find 
himself accompanying "Dinah Shore in the morning, Ella in the afternoon, (opera 
singer) Dorothy Kirsten in the evening. But all the writing was good, so you 
never complained. It was a joy just to go in and listen to the string sections 
orchestrated by Alfred Newman or Max Steiner." 
</P>
<P>
 He started studying classical music in his native San Diego at age 8; by 19 he 
was a working professional. In the '40s he played with Tommy Dorsey and Les 
Paul. But he didn't much like life on the road: 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a clean liver, no smoking, no drinking, and I lasted about a month on 
Dorsey's bus. I couldn't stand the smoke and booze in the morning, so I bought 
a convertible. Louis Bellson, who also lived clean, and I drove from job to 
job." 
</P>
<P>
 He settled back down in Southern California in 1949, when his ability to 
emulate George Shearing landed him a contract with Discovery Records. He went 
on to record for Capitol (Shearing's own label), Verve, MGM and Warner Bros. 
Since 1974, he has been with Outstanding Records; his latest release is "The 
Paul Smith Sampler." 
</P>
<P>
 His versatility was obvious from the beginning. "One of the albums, 'Liquid 
Sounds,' had Bach-like counterpoint. Another (session), a commercial date, had 
me overdubbing four pianos. It was fun. I never became deadpan serious about 
jazz, or wanted to sit and play jazz in a club all night. I liked jazz, but not 
five nights a week. That's another reason studio work appealed to me." 
</P>
<P>
 To many listeners, Smith is best known for his work with Fitzgerald, with whom 
he played off-and-on from the mid-'50s until 1990. Their albums together 
include "Mack the Knife" and her songbook series, collections of Rodgers and 
Hart, Cole Porter, the Gershwins and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanying the First Lady of Jazz Song was tough, Smith said, but great fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "She worked hard. When I first signed up with her, it was for a 46-week tour. 
Sometimes she'd double-book, doing one concert in the Hague from 6 to 10 p.m., 
and then she'd hop a flight to Amsterdam to sing at 1 a.m. She loved to sing 
and she was having a ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of having a ball: 
</P>
<P>
 "My father told me when I was young that since I was going to have to work a 
very long time, choose something I enjoyed and I'd never have to work a day in 
my life. I'm 72 and I still enjoy playing. When I don't, I'll quit and play 
tennis a few more days a week." 
</P>
<P>

Mirada Theatre for the Performing Arts, 14900 La Mirada Blvd., La Mirada. 8

DANCE REVIEW; ABT DAZZLES AUDIENCE IN THARP'S 'UPPER ROOM' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oh, Joy. American Ballet Theatre has Twyla Tharp back. Or a piece of her. Or 
rather, one of her works. Break open the champagne. Send up the balloons. 
</P>
<P>
 Performed for the first time since it was reacquired last month by artistic 
director Kevin McKenzie, Tharp's "In the Upper Room" closed the repertory 
program offered Wednesday at the Orange County Performing Arts Center. A 
rapturous audience only reluctantly let the final curtain come down, sending 
wave after wave of applause toward the dancers. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience was exactly right. 
</P>
<P>
 How different from the perfunctory acknowledgments at the end of the Shade 
Scene from "La Bayadere," which opened the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there was even other good news: the West Coast premiere of James Kudelka's 
engrossing if problematic "Cruel World." 
</P>
<P>
 To be honest, the current ABT cast could not efface memories of the halcyon 
1988 performances of "Upper Room" at the Center in which Tharp veterans Jamie 
Bishton, Kevin O'Day and Daniel Sanchez led the modern contingent. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet such ABT paragons as Kathleen Moore and Gil Boggs continued to exemplify 
the necessary crisp style, and the rest of the cast danced with invigorating 
commitment. Above all: The dancers simply looked natural and at home in this 
work, staged by the memorable Tharpian Shelley Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Remaining intact with all its cumulative power, "Upper Room," to music by 
Philip Glass, unfolded dazzlingly from rigorous geometric symmetries and 
crystalline patterns to exhilarating images of seemingly free-form motion and 
stage-devouring dynamism. No, it may not finally fuse ballet and modern dance, 
as everyone hopes for. But no one else has squared that particular circle 
either. 
</P>
<P>
 Set to a string orchestra version of Tchaikovsky's "Souvenir de Florence," 
Kudelka's "Cruel World" uses duets and ensembles to explore both formal dance 
issues and human relationships. It was danced with powerful authority by the 18 
company members. 
</P>
<P>
 The work opens with the stage full of couples, who impelled by raging inner 
drives engage, disengage, march and stalk the floor, form into phalanxes of the 
opposite sexes and return to couplings. A series of individual pas de deux 
occurs. These dances are turbulent, varied, conflicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Kudelka distorts the formal vocabulary with off-center balances and skewered 
limbs, creating vivid images that transmute formal considerations of shared 
weight into psychological categories which almost instantly dissolve back into 
technical dance problems. The speed and power of these shifts are arresting, 
disturbing. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for an occasionally slowed-down gesture or swoop of an arm, it is 
mainly when physically apart that the couples exhibit any calm or lyricism, and 
such moments are short-lived. The couples simply have to re-form, whatever the 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second movement, Marianna Tcherkassky finds herself imprisoned, passed 
around, exulted by six men who create weird picket-fence images by bending 
down, touching the floor with one arm and thrusting the other into the air. 
</P>
<P>
 With the third movement, intended to mirror (invert?) the second, something 
goes wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be partly a formal problem in that the situation of one free-ranging 
man (Guillaume Graffin) in opposition to six rather indifferent women is not 
fraught with an equal kind of weight or threat as would be one woman faced with 
six manipulative men. It may also be a failure of choreographic imagination. 
Graffin's folk-derived steps and the musing poses of the women appear 
lightweight and less motivated by the music. The section also is too prolonged 
to sustain interest, even when Cynthia Harvey finally detaches herself from the 
group to dance with him. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the ballet doesn't recapture its initial energy, although the 
couples recapitulate the anguished, formal, intricate pairings of the opening. 
</P>
<P>
 Carmen Alie designed the ominously muted, evocative middle-European costumes. 
Scott Zielinski provided the sensitive lighting, sometimes brightening the 
proceedings as if to suggest momentary opportunities of less troubled 
relationship or time. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, Kudelka's choreography did not always bear out this sometime 
optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Barker led a vitalized Pacific Symphony in a brilliant performance of 
Tchaikovsky's music, mirroring exactly the drama and power and spectral 
eeriness that Kudelka (but few others) has heard in the score. 
</P>
<P>
 In comparison to both works, the Shade Scene from "La Bayadere," as staged by 
Natalia Makarova, looked like a quaint period piece to which few of the dancers 
related. Happily, Susan Jaffe offered a striking performance of Nikiya, 
creating the illusion of uncanny inner stillness and the dissipation of 
material weight. Dancing Solor for the first time, Parrish Maynard encountered 
some major problems, including almost dropping Jaffe in a lift. Jack Everly 
conducted. 
</P>
<P>

FORBERT USES SONG ENERGY TO KEEP PLUGGING AWAY; POP MUSIC: HE LOVES HIS WORK, 
DESPITE BEING LABELED A 'NEW DYLAN' AND HAVING RECORD COMPANY PROBLEMS. HE 
PLAYS AT THE COACH HOUSE ON SATURDAY.

 "The new Dylan." 
</P>
<P>
 It's an unfortunate tag, and it has been used to exploit dozens of musicians 
over the years, to peg each as the "voice of a generation." And it seems to 
have a curse upon it: The inevitable backlash it triggers seems to have stunted 
the career growth of such fine singer/songwriters as Phil Ochs, Loudon 
Wainwright III and John Prine as well as Steve Forbert, who will play solo at 
the Coach House Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, in 1978 when Forbert burst upon the scene in New York City, "new 
Dylan" already was a cliche. Still, when his "Best of" anthology was released 
last year, the term popped up again in the liner notes -- as it does yet again 
on his current press bio, all much to his chagrin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really like to think I've outlived that reference," he said a few days ago 
on the phone from a studio in Nashville. "I just see it as being something from 
way in the past, and I don't even want to comment on it." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not hard to understand his discomfort. After a heavily hyped and 
successful start, his career came to a crashing halt in 1983, after only three 
albums. Butting heads with his label, Columbia, over the direction of his 
future recordings, he sank into a legal labyrinth that prevented him from 
releasing anything until 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years without product can be an eternity in pop music, and he found that 
the demand for his work had all but evaporated. With neither a label nor a 
substantial following, he was back to square one. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many might have packed it in or at least become embittered, Forbert 
hammered away at a new beginning, moving to Nashville, starting a new band, 
buying a van and hitting the bar circuit in backwater towns throughout the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 "I chopped away at the legal difficulties like it was just a 9-to-5 thing I 
had to deal with, but the real story was that the songs were still happening," 
he said in his still-slow drawl, a product of his rural Mississippi upbringing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole deal of it is energy, and for me, where that comes from is the 
songs. And I had a lot of songs come along in that period that I liked, so I 
felt like, 'Hey, this is still happening.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Personal, compelling songs are what Forbert has always been about, whether 
they've been the eye-blinking, "golly gee" output of his early 
country-boy-in-the-big-city period or the more somber, experience-tempered 
material from his down years. 
</P>
<P>
 Always, through various stylistic changes and backing groups, he sounded like 
himself, an honest and questioning voice with a journalist's sense of 
observation and a folk singer's gift for melody. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1978 they said I was out of sync," he said. "But I'm not gonna come to New 
York and say, 'The thing now seems to be Graham Parker and Elvis Costello, so 
how can I fit in?' It's never been like that. I'm not a person who is 
interested in responding to trends. I'm not saying I'm too clever for that or 
above it or anything; I'm just saying my feeling for music has always been a 
simple sort of approach. I do what I feel." 
</P>
<P>
 His never-say-die outlook paid off, at least to a degree, in 1988 when he was 
signed by Geffen Records. A pair of albums brought a renewal of critical 
acclaim, but sales were less than staggering, and after the release of "The 
American in Me" in 1992, he found himself again without a label. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still undaunted, he is finishing up an album he hopes will be released early 
next year, with Garry Tallent of Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band on bass, 
Benmont Tench of Tom Petty's Heartbreakers on keyboards, longtime associate 
Clay Barnes on guitar and drummer Roger Clark, who played on Forbert's 
"Jackrabbit Slim" album back in '79. 
</P>
<P>
 Forbert said he is close to finalizing a deal with a new label but didn't want 
to jinx things by disclosing which one. He was, as usual, notably enthusiastic 
about the music itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really happy with this thing. The main thing is, the band I put together 
for this album really happened. They hadn't worked together before but it came 
out perfect. After a lot of work, I'm really happy with the way these four 
players worked with me. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new songs are a little more abstract. The last album was really concrete, 
you know? For this one, I wanted to do songs that are a little more, dare we 
say, out of the ordinary." 
</P>
<P>
 At 39, with enough experience behind him to write a pretty nasty book about 
the music biz, he maintains an optimistic, almost childlike naivete. He loves 
his music, and he still has the goals of a young dreamer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a problem, which is that I'm still way into doing this. I'd like to 
get back to touring with a band. I'd like to tour with a certain amount of 
comfort to it. I'd like to play in theaters. That would be nice." 
</P>
<P>
 * Steve Forbert opens for Al Stewart and Laurence Juber on Saturday at the 
Coach House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. 8 p.m. $17.50. (714)

 SETTING LIMITS: President Clinton's sending of troops to Haiti without 
Congress' permission has U.S. Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) concerned. 
. . . With that in mind, Cox is pushing a resolution calling for House debate 
and a vote on "the scope of" the occupation, to make clear precisely what the 
troops will do and how long they will do it. . . . "We owe it to our soldiers 
to debate and vote on the policy that is putting their lives on the line in 
Haiti," says Cox. 
</P>
<P>
 MUTUAL INTEREST: County Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder had a ready response for 
the consul general of the Philippines, who addressed the board of supervisors 
this week. Emmanuel C. Fernandez spoke enthusiastically about the improving 
economic climate in his country, which, he said, makes the Philippines a good 
place for foreign investment. . . . "As your people have more money," Wieder 
replied with a smile, "they can buy more of our products." Fernandez smiled 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 A CUT ABOVE: The eye-catching water tower house in Sunset Beach has been voted 
the most unusual home for sale in America by the National Assn. of Realtors. . 
. . Rising 87 feet, the landmark water tower-turned-luxury home beat out such 
competition as a ranch with an operating pet cemetery in Florida and a home 
shaped like a flying saucer in Chattanooga, Tenn. The tower, on Pacific Coast 
Highway at Anderson Street, has been on the market on and off for five years. 
Current asking price: $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 POINT OF VIEW: Teen-agers sometimes get a bad rap from adults, but what's the 
word from the even-younger set? . . . When Orange County kids as young as 3 
were asked to describe teen-agers and what they're like, the responses were 
decidedly mixed. (OC High, E3) For some, there's no thrill yet in the prospect 
of turning 13. Says third-grader Brittany Mann, 8, of DePortola Elementary in 
Mission Viejo: "I don't want to be a teen-ager. I don't want to grow up. I want 
to stay a kid."

LEONARD FEATHER; JAZZ CRITIC, COMPOSER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leonard Geoffrey Feather, a gifted composer and producer who, in the course of 
his career, gained wide recognition as a jazz critic, died Thursday in Encino. 
He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
 Feather, who had spent his final months completing a revision of his acclaimed 
"Encyclopedia of Jazz," had been undergoing treatment for pneumonia for the 
last six weeks. He died at Encino Hospital, where he had celebrated his 
birthday nine days before his death. 
</P>
<P>
 Described by jazz great Louis Armstrong as "one cat that really knows what's 
going on," and by Leonard Bernstein as an author who "opens one's eyes to a 
perspective view of jazz that is astonishingly new and rich," Feather's 
creative background brought musical authenticity and a well-informed viewpoint 
to his criticism, which appeared regularly in the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
 He was also, however, an artist who had a significant impact on jazz. He 
described himself as a modestly talented clarinetist and pianist, but he was a 
skilled and busy songwriter and composer. 
</P>
<P>
 Among his more than 200 published compositions are "How Blue Can You Get" (a 
hit for B.B. King), "Blues for Yesterday" (recorded by Armstrong), "I Remember 
Bird" (recorded by Cannonball Adderley, Oliver Nelson and others), "Signing 
Off" (recorded by Ella Fitzgerald, Andre Previn and other artists), "Born on a 
Friday" (recorded by Cleo Laine) and "Twelve Tone Blues" (recorded by Yusef 
Lateef). 
</P>
<P>
 As a producer and musical entrepreneur, Feather was instrumental in the hiring 
of Benny Carter for the BBC Dance Orchestra in the early 1930s. In the next 
decade, he produced and composed for sessions by Armstrong, Carter, Duke 
Ellington and Dizzy Gillespie, and he wrote arrangements for Count Basie. 
</P>
<P>
 Feather also produced the debut recordings of Sarah Vaughan, George Shearing 
and Dinah Washington. His "Evil Gal Blues," "Salty Papa Blues" and "Blowtop 
Blues" launched Washington's career. In the mid-1940s, he was responsible for 
establishment of the annual Esquire jazz polls, and in 1945, he produced the 
first record album chronicling the work of female jazz musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 With the publication of "Inside Be-Bop" (1949), and the release of the initial 
"Encyclopedia of Jazz" (1955), Feather became established as an important jazz 
journalist, commentator and critic. Subsequent writings included further 
editions of the "Encyclopedia" (with Ira Gitler), "From Satchmo to Miles," "The 
Passion for Jazz" and "The Jazz Years: Earwitness to an Era." 
</P>
<P>
 As an educator, he taught classes on jazz at UCLA, Cal State Northridge, UC 
Riverside and Loyola Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
 From the early 1960s, when he moved from New York to Los Angeles, Feather 
served as the jazz critic of The Times, which distributed his writings to other 
media. His reviews and articles also appeared in magazines around the world, 
including Esquire, Playboy, downbeat, Metronome and Swing Journal in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1964, Feather won the first journalism Grammy ever given by the National 
Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 His other awards included an Emmy nomination as producer of KNBC's "The Jazz 
Show" (1971); an award for excellence in local programming on KUSC's "The

MORNING BRIEFING: 46-YEAR-OLD LINEMAN TRULY ONE FOR AGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chuck Roseberry is a sophomore defensive tackle for Kutztown University, a 
Division II school in Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also 46 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Didinger of Knight-Ridder News Services writes that "Roseberry is quite 
possibly the oldest player in the annals of college football. 
</P>
<P>
 "The NCAA is not exactly certain of that, but a spokesman for the organization 
said he would be surprised if there has been anyone older." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who was the last NFL player to return two kickoffs for touchdowns 
in a game? 
</P>
<P>
 Praise, indeed: Player agent Ralph Cindrich, recognized in the Sporting News 
last January as one of the 100 most powerful people in sports, grew up in 
Avella, Pa., which he calls a "a shot-and-a-beer place." 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably the best compliment ever paid to me was from Carmen Policy, the San 
Francisco 49ers' general manager," Cindrich told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. 
"He called me a blue-collar SOB." 
</P>
<P>
 Silence: From David Letterman: "Yes, we won't be hearing the crack of the bat 
again until next April. Or in the Mets' case, maybe June or July." 
</P>
<P>
 Tire-biter: Bill Lyon of the Philadelphia Inquirer interviewing Eagle 
cornerback Eric Allen, who is listed at 5 feet 10 and 180 pounds, but is 
probably smaller, on tackling larger running backs: 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it's kind of like trying to stop a runaway bus by tackling one of 
the tires." 
</P>
<P>
 Bring back the rug: Tom Weir in USA Today: "In 1968, Tennessee helped inspire 
one of sport's worst trends as it became the first college to install 
artificial turf for football." 
</P>
<P>
 The Volunteers now have a grass field that was inaugurated Saturday with a 
31-0 loss to Florida. Time to dig up the grass? 
</P>
<P>
 FYI: Ichiro Suzuki, who goes by his first name because Suzuki is so common in 
Japan, became the first in Japanese baseball to get 200 hits in a season. 
</P>
<P>
 On target: When ESPN announcer Joe Theismann recently asked former New York 
Giant quarterback Phil Simms how his injured shoulder was doing, Simms replied: 
</P>
<P>
 "Fine, Joe. How are your alimony payments?" 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back: On this day in 1973, the Oakland Raiders defeated the Miami 
Dolphins, 12-7, in Berkeley on four field goals by George Blanda, ending the 
Dolphins' 18-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Ron Brown of the Rams on Nov. 24, 1985 against Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Nick Canepa in the San Diego Union-Tribune: "If Buddy Ryan coached 
the Miami Dolphins, he'd find a way to make Jim McMahon his starting 
quarterback." MAL FLORENCE

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: GREEN IS RENAISSANCE MAN OF SPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tim Green may be the most multifaceted person in sports broadcasting since Pat 
Haden. 
</P>
<P>
 Green, one of Fox's new football commentators -- he's working Sunday's 
Ram-Kansas City Chief game -- also was or is: 
</P>
<P>
 -- An All-American at Syracuse, and conference MVP in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 -- An eight-year NFL veteran who played linebacker and defensive end for the 
Atlanta Falcons. He started 69 consecutive games, a streak stopped by a broken 
elbow in 1992, and had 100 or more tackles for three consecutive seasons, 
1989-91. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A Football Foundation Hall of Fame scholar. 
</P>
<P>
 -- NCAA Top-Six scholar. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Academic All-American. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Phi Beta Kappa. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rhodes Scholar nominee. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Co-valedictorian of Syracuse's class of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Recent Syracuse law school graduate, with honors. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A once-a-week sports columnist for the Syracuse Herald-Journal. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A sports commentator for National Public Radio. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A novelist who has written two books and is working on a third. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A husband and father of three. 
</P>
<P>
 No, we're not making this up. There is such a person. 
</P>
<P>
 "One is considered fortunate to be blessed with either brains or brawn; Tim 
Green has been blessed with both," understates NBC's Bob Costas, another 
Syracuse graduate. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's the deal? Is Green an egomaniac or what? 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly. During a 45-minute phone conversation, Green, 30, was pleasant, 
humble, and easy to talk to. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, you'd figure this guy must be really driven. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think driven is the word," he said. "Someone asked me the other day 
if I felt I had to be the best at everything. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't. I want to do everything passionately. Whatever I'm doing I 
want to feel it, whether I'm playing football, announcing or writing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm also passionate about things like playing with my kids (Thane, 4; Tessa, 
3, and Troy, 5 months), or taking my wife out to dinner. I treat it as if it is 
a date. I make it a special evening." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Green: He said he became interested in football and writing at about the 
same time, when he was about 8 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I wasn't dreaming about someday playing professional football I was 
dreaming about becoming a famous novelist," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a kid (in the Syracuse suburb of Liverpool), I was your typical bookworm. 
Fortunately, I was also big and good in sports. Otherwise, I'm sure I would 
have been picked on." 
</P>
<P>
 It took Green four years to write his first published book, "Ruffians," which 
was called "chilling and fascinating" by The Times, and "a cross between 'North 
Dallas Forty' and 'The Firm' " by USA Today. 
</P>
<P>
 It took him two years to write his second, the just-released "Titans," the 
story of a pro football quarterback who gets involved with the mob. 
</P>
<P>
 And he is about 70 pages into his third, "Outlaws," which he hopes to finish 
in a year. 
</P>
<P>
 What does he consider himself first, a former football player, a novelist or 
an announcer? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's whatever I'm doing at the moment," he said. "Although what is really No. 
1 with me is being a father and a husband. My family is what's most important 
to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Green said the Fox job came about because of his friendship with Ed Goren, the 
network's executive producer of sports. He said he met Goren through Stu 
Lisson, the head of the video communications department at Syracuse, about four 
years ago and Goren called him this spring to offer him a job. 
</P>
<P>
 "If things hadn't worked out with Fox, I would have returned to football," 
Green said. 
</P>

 Complaint department: ABC is giving Southern California and 12% of the country 
a prospective blowout, Arizona at Stanford, on Saturday, while 48.6% of the 
nation gets Colorado at Michigan. Washington at Miami is going to 36% of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 At least cable subscribers whose companies offer the college football 
pay-per-view package can get get one or both of those games. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is more bad news. ABC last week picked up Alcorn State's game 
against Sam Houston State as one its regional telecasts, obviously because of 
Alcorn's Steve (Air) McNair. However, the game was added to the schedule too 
late to offer it as a pay-per-view option. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Recommended viewing: In one of the more revealing interviews Roy Firestone has 
done, former Denver Bronco receiver Vance Johnson unloads on "Up Close" on ESPN 
tonight at 9:30 p.m. Johnson talks about his abusive nature, his efforts to 
change and his suicide attempt several years ago. He tells Firestone he was 
starting to slit his wrists when the phone rang. Fortunately, it was his 
therapist. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add recommended viewing: "Arthur Ashe: Citizen of the World," an outstanding 
one-hour tribute written by Frank Deford and narrated by Ossie Davis, will be 
on HBO seven times, beginning Tuesday at 10 p.m. Among those interviewed are 
South African President Nelson Mandela. TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Green's play-by-play partner is Joe Buck, the 25-year-old son of Jack 
Buck. Joe Buck became an announcer for the St. Louis Cardinals four years ago, 
at the age of 21. . . . Because the Raiders didn't sell out in time to lift the 
television blackout, the NFL game on NBC Sunday at 1 p.m. is New England at 
Detroit. Los Angeles doesn't get Fox's second game, New Orleans at San 
Francisco, because the Raiders are home. 
</P>
<P>
 Howie Long names his "tough guy" team on Fox's pregame show Sunday. A sneak 
preview: Ronnie Lott, Marcus Allen and Seth Joyner are included. Also on the 
show, Terry Bradshaw interviews Neil Smith and Derrick Thomas of the Chiefs, 
and Lonnie Lardner profiles Chicago safety Shaun Gayle, an author of children's 
books. 
</P>
<P>
 The field for the Nov. 26-27 Skins Game at Bighorn Golf Club in Palm Desert, 
to be carried by ABC, was set Thursday. It will be Paul Azinger, Fred Couples, 
Tom Watson and three-time winner Payne Stewart. . . . The Julio Cesar 
Chavez-Meldrick Taylor fight, plus highlights from last Saturday's undercard, 
will be replayed Saturday on Showtime at 1:35 p.m. . . . HBO offers a 
heavyweight title fight, Lennox Lewis vs. Oliver McCall, from London on 
Saturday at 8 p.m. It's live in the East, delayed three hours in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS will open its boxing series on Oct. 8 with cruiserweights Kenny Keene and 
Terry Ray fighting at a site to be determined. Oscar De La Hoya was to have 
fought John Avila on that date at the Grand Olympic, but De La Hoya had to bow 
out. De La Hoya and Avila will now fight Dec. 10 on CBS. . . . CBS announced 
Thursday that it will televise a series of six figure-skating competitions, 
beginning Thanksgiving Day. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC's Keith Jackson has been selected by the American Sports Assn. as its 1994 
Hall of Fame inductee. . . . UCLA and USC will both be on Prime Ticket on 
Saturday. The UCLA-Washington State game at 3:30 p.m. is the Prime Pacific 10 
game of the week, with Phil Stone and Rodney Gilmore calling the action and 
Paul Sunderland reporting from the sideline. Tom Kelly and Craig Fertig call 
the USC-Baylor game at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 A power outage in San Diego on Thursday caused XTRA to fill about an hour and 
a half with programming from the Las Vegas-based American Sports Radio Network. 
. . . A "Best of Talk2" special on ESPN2 Sunday at 7:30 p.m. with Jim Rome 
features interviews with Chris Webber, Bobby Bonilla, recently retired Miami 
linebacker John Offerdahl and Jerry McMorris, the owner of the Colorado 
Rockies. . . . ESPN2 can now be seen in 41% of Los Angeles cable households (or 
about 1.2 million), making Los Angeles one of the top markets for the network 
that will be a year old on Oct. 1.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; UCLA; THIS SEASON HARDLY A KICK FOR MERTEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What do you expect of an All-American kicker? How about perfection? 
</P>
<P>
 Bjorn Merten is feeling the pressure of great expectations at UCLA, where he 
has been successful on five of eight field-goal tries. 
</P>
<P>
 Six of the eight have come from 40 yards or more, and the three misses were 
from 42, 42 and 44. Last season, when he became only the fourth freshman 
All-American in history, he was successful on 21 of 26 tries, but only four of 
those attempts were from 40 or more yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the difference is the offense, which has generated yards between the 
Bruin 20 and opposition 25, but few touchdowns, a point of concern to the 
coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Merten has an answer to the questions about his misses. It's technical, 
involving geometry. Basically, he is lining up less than 90 degrees to the 
intended line of flight and pushing the ball a bit. All three of his misses 
have been to the right. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot like golf," he said. "If you're a good golfer, you can learn the 
mechanics of kicking." 
</P>
<P>
 A bad golfer is certainly familiar with pushing the ball to the right. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 J.J. Stokes says he doesn't know if he can play Saturday against Washington 
State in the Rose Bowl, but Coach Terry Donahue is putting him on the Bruins' 
60-player list for Friday night's hotel stay in Pasadena. Stokes will be 
evaluated Saturday, but even if he plays, Donahue said, his time on the field 
will be limited. "If he's healthy, we can probably get 20 or so plays," the 
coach said. 
</P>
<P>
 Would 20 plays of J.J. Stokes make a difference? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stokes has not played since the first game against Tennessee, when he suffered 
a bruised thigh in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An MRI on left guard James Christensen has revealed a small tear in a ligament 
in his left knee, which will prevent him from playing Saturday and puts his 
season in jeopardy. Christensen missed all but the first two games of last 
season, also because of his knee. Mike Rohme will take his place on a depleted 
offensive line. . . . Fullback Greg Ford will also be out, because of a back 
injury. JIM HODGES

 Baylor puts much emphasis on the fact it has a 3-0 record with three freshman 
starters and seven freshman backups. However, USC is playing two freshman 
starters and eight freshman backups. . . . Baylor defensive coordinator Bob 
Cope was USC's secondary coach in 1991 and '92, and Baylor strength and 
conditioning Coach Robb Rogers held the same position at USC from 1989-92.

 The 68-yard interception return by Quincy Harrison at Penn State was the 
longest by a Trojan since Cleveland Colter went 94 yards on a 1987 return at 
California. . . . Punter John Stonehouse is off to a fast start. The junior 
from Pasadena is the early Pac-10 leader at 43.3 yards per punt, which puts him 
16th in the country. . . . USC has 38 active NFL players, more than any other 
school. Next are Notre Dame (34), UCLA (29), Tennessee (27), Ohio State and 
Washington (24). EARL GUSTKEY

LACHAPELLE'S FIRE IS RECHARGING EDISON; PREP FOOTBALL: VERSATILE PLAYER HAS 
RECOVERED FROM COSTLY MISTAKE LAST SEASON. HE'S AGAIN LEADING THE CHARGERS' 
DEFENSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Edison free safety Bryan Lachapelle has an extreme passion for football, but 
that passion almost drove him away from the game . . . for good. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bryan is an emotional player," Edison Coach Dave White said. "He's big, he's 
fast, and he can really hit. Whenever he's out there, he usually makes good 
things happen for us." 
</P>
<P>
 But something bad happened to Lachapelle and Edison last October. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison had battled Huntington Beach to a 7-7 tie with only minutes remaining. 
The Chargers, facing fourth and 23 from their seven, lined up to punt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Huntington had only 10 guys on the field and Bryan saw one of our players 
open," White said. "It wasn't the right time to make that call, but he called 
for a fake punt." 
</P>
<P>
 Lachapelle took the snap and rolled out to his left, but he had no open 
receiver. He was stopped after a four-yard gain, and with one minute remaining, 
Jason Bartusick kicked a 21-yard field goal to give Huntington Beach a 10-7 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers went on to win the Sunset League championship and advance to the 
Southern Section Division II championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt I cost the team the game," Lachapelle said. "Everything was going 
right in that game. The defense did what we wanted to and we stopped Tony 
Gonzalez. But that one play, I screwed up big time." 
</P>
<P>
 Lachapelle was so distraught he skipped the team meeting the next day.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was going to quit the team," Lachapelle said. "It's tough when the team is 
always looking to you to be a leader. You can't let them know when you're 
hurting because you have to be what they expect you to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Said White: "Sometimes, we all make football out to be bigger than life. But 
these are just 16-year-old kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Lachapelle: "I was so down after that Huntington Beach game. But Coach 
White saved me." 
</P>
<P>
 White brought Lachapelle back to football, and now the sport holds promise of 
a bright future. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific 10 schools, including Arizona State, California, UCLA and Washington, 
along with other schools such as San Diego State and Nevada Las Vegas have 
shown interest in Lachapelle, a 6-foot-1, 190-pound first-team All-Sunset 
League defensive back last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's one of the best defensive players to come through this school," White 
said. "I've always told my teams that a missed field goal at the end of a game 
or a game-winning touchdown on the last play, that one play doesn't make the 
game. There are a hundred or so plays besides that play that are just as 
important." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Lachapelle: "It took awhile for me to understand that." 
</P>
<P>
 Said White: "Bryan made a mistake in that situation and no one felt worse 
about it than he did. But the team really pulled together after that game. We 
finished with a great season." 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers won seven consecutive games after the Huntington Beach loss, 
finishing second in league and defeating Canyon Country Canyon in the first 
round of the Division II playoffs, 40-20. Eventual champion Los Alamitos beat 
Edison in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Lachapelle returned this season as one of only two starters back on defense. 
But two days before the season opener against Corona del Mar, he broke the 
metacarpal bone on the ring finger of his right hand during practice. 
</P>
<P>
 The injury hasn't sidelined Lachapelle, who plays with a fiberglass cast 
encased by a foam shell and sealed with athletic tape. 
</P>
<P>
 But with only one hand to tackle with, Lachapelle had trouble in the opener. 
So did the Edison defense, giving up 380 yards rushing to the Sea Kings before 
winning, 35-28. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers returned to an attacking style of defense and that helped them 
defeat Capistrano Valley, 21-17. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bryan was in on about 15 tackles and two sacks," White said. Lachapelle 
showed his versatility by moving to linebacker for that game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Against teams that throw more, he'll play more free safety," White said. 
"Against teams that run more, he'll play more linebacker. We'll try to position 
him so he can make as many plays as possible. He's our Ronnie Lott." EDISON VS.

KENNEDY MANAGES TO BEAT SEA KINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a makeshift lineup and maybe a makeshift attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy Coach Mitch Olson said following his team's 14-8 victory over Corona 
del Mar that his two starting inside linebackers missed the game and he had to 
move guys around. He had five players out of position on defense, he lamented. 
</P>
<P>
 So, who was missing? 
</P>
<P>
 "None of your business," Olson snapped. 
</P>
<P>
 Either Olson is taking Kennedy's No. 9 ranking pretty seriously, or he was 
still a little uptight after watching his team sputter toward the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever, Kennedy (2-1) got the victory and Corona del Mar (0-3) the loss. And 
Charlie Marino got his yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Marino, pressed into a makeshift one-back offense because of all the player 
movement, rushed 33 times for 132 yards and two touchdowns. His teammates ran 
17 times for minus-seven. 
</P>
<P>
 Marino also got some yards from the air. He caught three passes for 56 of 
Kennedy's 101 passing yards. The key reception was a 49-yarder he caught behind 
the Sea King secondary, setting up his one-yard touchdown run with 1 minute 24 
seconds left in the first half. It was part of a 12-play, 86-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, the Kennedy offense netted 226 yards, and Marino got credit for 188 of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar committed turnovers its first four possessions of the second 
half -- and three came on the first play of a series -- giving Kennedy 
possession at the Corona del Mar 35, nine, 13 and 24. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kennedy scored only once, when Marino's four-yard touchdown run capped a 
13-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
 That set the stage for a fourth-quarter rally by the Sea Kings. Brian Hogan 
(20 carries for 96 yards) rushed for 49 of the 55 yards on the drive and scored 
from the four with with 2:31 left. Quarterback Josh Walz ran in the two-point 
conversion to make it 14-8.

SEVEN PANTHERS SCORE TOUCHDOWNS AS ORANGE ROUTS WINLESS KATELLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was definitely a highlight film night for Orange as the Panthers rolled 
past Katella, 47-2, in a nonleague football game Thursday at Glover Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven Panthers scored touchdowns as their offense, including the reserves, 
moved the ball with relative ease the entire game. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange's defense was equally impressive, keeping Katella (0-3) in check. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange (2-1) struggled in its season-opening 28-10 loss to Newport Harbor but 
has improved dramatically in its last two game. The Panthers beat Saddleback, 
35-0, last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're developing," Orange Coach Dick Hill said. "Our guys are learning and 
getting a little better and that's what it's all about." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange, using eight ball carriers, rushed for 247 yards, and finished with 354 
yards in total offense. Katella was held to 67 yards in total offense. The 
Knights have been outscored, 115-20, in three games. 
</P>
<P>
 Markus Garza, playing only one series after halftime, gained 96 yards in 13 
carries. He also scored the first touchdown, a 22-yard dash around left end in 
which no Katella defender had a good enough angle to catch him. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Maize, a reserve fullback, added 53 yards in five carries, including a 
one-yard touchdown run with 11 minutes 9 seconds left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 His score put Orange ahead, 34-2. Maize had runs of 25 and 20 yards, the 
longest two from scrimmage for the Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange also got touchdown runs from Art Bell (14 yards), Carlos Heard (two 
yards), Sam Cureton (three yards), and Shawn Dixon (one yard). 
</P>
<P>
 Bell a receiver, scored on a reverse. He also had four catches for 60 yards 
and intercepted a pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange quarterback Andy Lauridsen also completed a nine-yard touchdown pass to 
Anthony Adame.

ESPERANZA HANGS ON TO BEAT CAPISTRANO VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Esperanza, ranked fifth in the county, needed a one-yard touchdown run from 
Dahrin Footman with one minute remaining to clinch a 32-25 victory over 
Capistrano Valley Thursday night at Valencia High. 
</P>
<P>
 Footman, who rushed for 136 yards in 22 carries and scored three touchdowns, 
capped a 74-yard, 11-play drive with his touchdown for the Aztecs (3-0). 
</P>
<P>
 But facing a fourth and 10 at the Capistrano Valley 28, quarterback Chris 
Stretch, who completed 15 of 32 passes for 269 yards, kept the drive alive by 
hooking up with Brian Forth for a 27-yard pass play. Footman scored on the next 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a screwed-up night," Esperanza Coach Gary Meek said. "We forgot to show 
up in the second half, and Capo came out and shoved the ball right down our 
throats." 
</P>
<P>
 Malaefou Mackenzie did the majority of the shoving, scoring three touchdowns 
for the Cougars (1-2). Mackenzie, a sophomore, rushed for 138 yards on 17 
carries, scoring on runs of one and four yards. He also caught seven passes for 
92 yards, including a 55-yard touchdown pass from sophomore quarterback Tim 
Hirchag. 
</P>
<P>
 That score came on the Cougars' first possession of the second half and made 
the score 24-14. He scored later in the third quarter on a one-yard run, to 
shave the lead to 24-20, then caught a pass from Hirchag for the two-point 
conversion to make it 24-22. 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Valley took the lead with 10 minutes 23 seconds remaining in the 
fourth quarter on a field goal by Brett Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Stephenson was called for roughing the kicker with three seconds 
remaining in the first half after Esperanza's Jason Florence missed a 47-yard 
field-goal attempt.  
</P>
<P>
 Stephenson was injured on the play and had to be taken off the field by 
ambulance and was taken to Placentia Linda Hospital where he was discharged 
later Thursday night, a hospital spokesman said.

WESTMINSTER ROARS PAST PACIFICA, 24-7 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Westminster relied on big plays to rally after a slow start and topple 
Pacifica, 24-7, Thursday night at Bolsa Grande High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Midway through the second quarter, the Lions had a negative net-yardage total 
and were fortunate to trail by only a touchdown, thanks to two Pacifica 
turnovers.Then, the Lions took over. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard Ibarra caught a pass from Jerry Allison and danced around tacklers, 
down the left sideline for a 70-yard scoring play, tying the score at 7-7 with 
4 minutes 29 seconds left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Heath Wilcox got the ball back for Westminster, intercepting a Ryan Johansen 
pass and returning it 58 yards to the Mariner 31. Allison hooked up with Jimmy 
Adkisson two plays later for a 37-yard touchdown and a 14-7 Westminster lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions went to the ground game after the half, holding on to the ball for 
18 minutes in the second half while not allowing the Mariners past midfield 
until the game was out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Leonard Ibarra, Westminster's leading rusher, was held to 12 yards, 
fullback Linzey Koahou had 33 yards in 11 carries, and four reserve backs 
picked up 42 yards in seven carries to help keep the clock moving.  
</P>
<P>
 The Westminster defense held Pacifica without a first down for the first 19 
minutes of the second half, and the offense was adding to the lead. David 
Jarrick capped a third-quarter drive with a 28-yard field goal for a 17-7 lead, 
and Allison accounted for the final score, falling on a Lion fumble in the end 
zone for a touchdown. ERIC MADDY

LOS AMIGOS SCORES FOUR TOUCHDOWNS IN 13 MINUTES, BEATS SANTA ANA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Amigos Coach Roger Takahashi had planned to unleash the right arm of 
quarterback Ape Tuato on Thursday night against Santa Ana. But before Takahashi 
got a chance to look at his game plan, the game was over. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Amigos scored four touchdowns in the first 13 minutes and rolled to a 41-0 
victory over Santa Ana in front of about 750 at Garden Grove High. Tuato got in 
some work, completing five of seven passes for 97 yards and a touchdown, but it 
wasn't enough for Takahashi. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know we can throw the ball because we did it well over the summer," 
Takahashi said. "Ape could have had a big game passing, but it got so out of 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to be balanced, but right now we are just rushing well. We're going 
to need to throw when we get to big games and the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Amigos (3-0) doesn't figure to have a big game until Oct. 14, when it 
plays at Rancho Alamitos. Until then, Tuato probably will have to get his 
throwing done before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Lobo running back Greg Fausto scored three touchdowns and ran for 97 yards in 
11 carries before backup Roger Calvillo took over. Calvillo rushed seven times 
for 78 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know Roger has the ability," Takahashi said. "He's more of a power runner 
than Greg. We might be able to use him on short yardage situations in the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
 There were few short-yardage situations Thursday night, though. The Lobos 
never punted and scored on six of their first seven possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Santa Ana (0-3) fumbled twice, had one pass intercepted, never 
crossed the Los Amigos 20-yard line and failed on five of six fourth-down 
situations. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Omar Gomez was the lone bright spot, rushing for 72 yards in 17 
carries.

SIMMS

 Buddy Ryan, yet to win with the Arizona Cardinals or settle on a quarterback, 
now says he's interested in Phil Simms. "I've got a call into him right now," 
the coach said after practice.While the Cardinals consider Simms, they have 
closed the door on Rich Gannon. Ryan says he will not pursue the former starter 
at Minnesota and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 In another personnel matter, Ryan said he will sign running back Barry Word if 
Word checks out medically. Word, 31, arrived at the training facility 
unannounced Wednesday and worked out for coaches after practice. 
</P>

 The NFL and its game officials reached a tentative agreement on a new contract 
that will increase salaries by nearly 50% and triple pension payments. NFL 
spokesman Joe Browne confirmed the nine-member board of directors of the 
officials association has unanimously agreed to a settlement pending a mail 
vote of all 101 game officials. It's expected to be completed by Tuesday. . . . 
The Washington Redskins lead the NFL with a payroll of $46.997 million, 
including pro-rated bonuses and player benefits, according to figures released 
by the NFL Players Assn. The numbers also show that 18 of the 28 teams are 
actually over the $34.6-million salary cap when pro-rated bonuses are included. 
Teams under the cap include Dallas, Miami and the New York Giants. . . . The 
Giants released wide receiver Mark Jackson to make room for waiver-wire pickup 
Coleman Rudolph. It marked the second time this year that the Giants released 
Jackson, their leading receiver in 1993. Jackson was waived in a salary-cap 
move in May, but was re-signed in training camp and made the roster as the 
backup to Mike Sherrard and Chris Calloway.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; FOX FAMILIAR WITH CHARGERS' OFFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The rivalry between the Raiders and the San Diego Chargers goes far beyond the 
playing field, considering that there are 13 members of the Raider organization 
who previously worked with the Chargers, including owner Al Davis and six 
assistant coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The most important former Charger heading into Sunday's game at the Coliseum, 
however, may be Raider first-year defensive coordinator John Fox, who spent the 
last two seasons coaching the Chargers' secondary. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a really big game for us regardless of who we're playing because of 
our 0-2 start," Fox said. "I don't know if it just because we're playing the 
Chargers, but I'm excited to get out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Having Fox calling defensive signals may be a plus for the Raiders Sunday; he 
spent the last two years practicing against San Diego's offense. "Knowing the 
strengths and the weaknesses of some of their players does give us a little bit 
of an advantage," Fox said. "But I don't think that it will make a big 
difference in the game." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive lineman Scott Davis practiced for the second consecutive day, but 
will not start against San Diego. The Raiders will start Anthony Smith, Nolan 
Harrison, Jerry Ball and Chester McGlockton on their defensive front. . . . 
With a pass interception returned for a touchdown, two fumble recoveries and a 
forced fumble against Denver, cornerback Terry McDaniel was named AFC defensive 
player of the week. . . . Cornerback Albert Lewis returned to practice after 
sitting out Wednesday with a shoulder and neck injury. Two key San Diego 
injuries may be a factor. Coach Bobby Ross said center Courtney Hall would be 
used only in an emergency because of a biceps injury, and defensive tackle 
Rueben Davis is questionable because of an elbow injury. LONNIE WHITE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Costa Mesa running back Charles Chatman rushed for a game-high 211 yards and 
two touchdowns in a 28-16 victory over Lakewood Mayfair in a nonleague game 
Thursday night at Bellflower High. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatman has rushed for 552 yards this season.Costa Mesa is 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Ball control was the game plan for the Mustangs, who ran 36 plays to Mayfair's 
14 in the first half, rushing for 173 yards to the Monsoons' 59 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 After a scoreless first quarter, Costa Mesa took advantage of a two-yard punt 
by Mayfair from its 27-yard line. Five plays later, Chatman dived over from the 
one-yard line for a 6-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 After another short punt, this one by Costa Mesa, Mayfair took possession on 
the Mustang 47-yard line. Four plays later, Brady Green caught a 39-yard 
touchdown pass from Shawn Augustine on his fingertips and Mayfair took a 7-6 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatman scored again from three yards to put the Mustangs ahead, 14-7, at 
halftime. RICK CHRISTOPHER

CONVERSION PASS HELPS CANYON EDGE LOARA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Canyon quarterback Adam Hoover threw for 168 yards and two touchdowns as the 
Comanches held on to beat Loara, 15-13, Thursday at Western High. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoover completed 17 of 25 passes, had one intercepted, but it was receiver 
Greg Jacobs who caught the biggest pass of the night, a two-point conversion in 
the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 On its first possession of the second half, Canyon (3-0) scored on a five-yard 
pass from Hoover to Jacobs to break a 7-7 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs then picked up a bad snap on the point-after attempt, rolled left, and 
hit tight end Brian Owens in the end zone, giving the Comanches a 15-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Loara mounted a threat late in the fourth quarter, starting on its 33-yard 
line with four minutes left. Quarterback Jim Kirkland marched the Saxons down 
field in nine plays, capped by a one-yard touchdown run by Kerry Peoples. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kirkland's two-point conversion pass flew over Matt Barling's head, 
leaving Loara with its third consecutive defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoover put Canyon ahead in the first quarter, hitting Larry Witt on a 38-yard 
touchdown pass. Loara tied the score just before the end of the first half, on 
a 22-yard touchdown pass from Kirkland to Eddie Williams. JON CLIFFORD

SADDLEBACK SHUTS DOWN CHERRINGTON, WINS

 Saddleback's defense smothered Santa Ana Valley's running attack in a 28-0 
nonleague football victory Thursday night at Santa Ana Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Roadrunner front line of Rafael Lucero, Jimmy Ambriz, Morrow Potts and 
Juan Leal stifled Falcon star running back Dwayne Cherrington, who had rushed 
for 398 yards in the first two games.The Roadrunners limited him to 24 yards in 
17 carries, including only four yards in the first half, when the Roadrunners 
took a 21-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel our line can match up with them one-on-one," said Saddleback Coach 
Jerry Witte before the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Valley (1-2) did not get a first down until there was 22 seconds 
remaining in the first half.  
</P>
<P>
 Brian Killingbeck kept the Falcon defense off-balance with the option, 
connecting on six of seven passes for 78 yards and two touchdowns and carrying 
the ball 10 times for 64 yards. Killingbeck had a seven-yard scoring pass to 
Omar Palacios in the first quarter and an 18-yard scoring pass to Hector 
Hernandez in the second. MIKE WOJCIECHOWSKI

 Santiago stopped a 15-game losing streak that spanned three seasons by beating 
Buena Park, 14-3, in a nonleague game Thursday night at Buena Park High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Santiago last won on the field in the fifth week of the 1992 season, a 20-6 
victory over Bolsa Grande.Santiago was awarded a victory over Garden Grove 
because Garden Grove used an ineligible player in its 28-0 victory in the 
seventh week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels great," said first-year Santiago Coach Ben Haley. "We were ready for 
this. I couldn't ask for anything more from them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cavaliers (1-2) took a 6-0 halftime lead on Christian Cortez's two-yard 
run with 6 minutes 56 seconds left in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 After Santiago's Jose Palacios fumbled the second-half kickoff and Jonathan 
Smiech recovered for Buena Park (0-3) at the Santiago 36, the Coyotes drove to 
the Cavalier nine. But Matt Eckert sacked Osvaldo Olmos on third and six, and 
Buena Park settled for Jude Reyes' 30-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 On Santiago's next play from scrimmage, Palacios fumbled again, and Corey 
Lyday recovered for Buena Park. But Santiago's defense held again, and Reyes 
missed a 35-yard field-goal attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Santiago clinched the victory on Anthony Callari's eight-yard run with 4:53 
left. GABE LACQUES

EL MODENA TAKES ADVANTAGE OF TUSTIN TURNOVERS TO WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 El Modena football Coach Steve Howard said he was "scared to death" in the 
second half against visiting Tustin. He had no reason to be. 
</P>
<P>
 El Modena's defense and five Tustin turnovers helped the Vanguards record a 
25-7 nonleague victory Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 El Modena (2-1) scored on its first play and never trailed. Though it held a 
12-7 lead at the half and struggled offensively in the third quarter, Tustin 
was unable to take advantage. El Modena put the game away by scoring 13 points 
in the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defense played their hearts out," Howard said. "I was scared to death 
Tustin might rally. But the defense rose up and we got some turnovers." 
</P>
<P>
 El Modena took a 6-0 lead in the first quarter on an 85-yard reception by Greg 
Hanson from quarterback Chris Goodwin. The Vanguards made it 12-0 with 10:56 
left in the second quarter when running back Jason Said scored on a two-yard 
run. 
</P>
<P>
 An interception by Ricky Cherry late in the second quarter led to Tustin's 
only score, a three-yard run by quarterback Kevin Timone with 13 seconds 
remaining in the first half. But Tustin (0-3), which lost its ninth in a row, 
couldn't manage much else. 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron Santana's 12-yard touchdown run and two field goals by Frank Rubalcaba 
in the fourth quarter sealed it for El Modena.

FAIRPLEX; FAVORITE RUN DOWN IN STAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ROBLEDO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trainer Jim Buss knew his Desert Mirage was the fastest horse in the race, but 
he was worried about the small Fairplex Park track with its tight turns. 
</P>
<P>
 His worst fear came true Thursday when New Aspirations, ridden by G.F. 
Almeida, made a strong move around the far turn and held off the late-charging 
and heavily favored Desert Mirage to win the $110,000 Barretts Juvenile by 2 
1/2 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 "This horse ran big today," trainer Jack Van Berg said of New Aspirations. "We 
were worried about (Desert Mirage), but the way this horse ran, nobody was 
going to catch him." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second year in a row that Almeida had the winning mount in the 6 
1/2-furlong Barretts. He rode Stepoutoftheboat to a victory in this race a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just followed instructions," Almeida said. "I kept him inside early to save 
ground, then we made a big move outside and he really took off." 
</P>
<P>
 That was the kind of race Buss had in mind for Desert Mirage, but he fell too 
far behind in the early running and had some traffic problems in the nine-horse 
field at the top of the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really too bad," Buss said. "This horse was by far the best in this 
field, but it's tough to make up a lot of ground on this track. He was trying 
to find room down the stretch, but I think he got clipped (heels) and had to 
change course before he got going." 
</P>
<P>
 Score Quick finished third.

ART; GROUP EFFORT BLENDS TRIO OF TALENTS; 'THREE WOMEN TWO' IS THE ARTISTS' 
SECOND COLLABORATIVE SHOW AT NEW CANYON GALLERY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY KAPITANOFF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Nancy Kapitanoff writes regularly 
about art for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They're together again for the second time at New Canyon Gallery. Rebecca 
Andrews, Connie Mississippi and Ann Robbins had such a good time organizing an 
exhibit last year in this 5-year-old cooperative gallery in Topanga, they 
decided to do it again. 
</P>
<P>
 Their current show, "Three Women Two," present Andrews' ceramics, 
Mississippi's sculpture and Robbins' paintings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was such a positive experience the first time," Robbins said. Suggesting 
that the solitariness of making art can use some counterbalancing, she added, 
"It's nice to work in a group." 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins has known Mississippi since 1974, when they worked together at the 
Craft and Folk Art Museum. All three artists belong to a women's support group 
that Mississippi started 2 1/2 years ago. Group members come from various 
creative fields and range from women in their 30s with young children to 
grandmothers in their 60s. 
</P>
<P>
 "The support of the other women is very important," Mississippi said. "It 
doesn't just happen during the show. It happens all year long." 
</P>
<P>
 Mississippi's finely made, elegant turned wood pieces -- some of them painted, 
some with carvings -- employ geometric shapes precariously positioned on 
laminated plywood bases to convey various sensations of life. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a different direction for me," Mississippi said. "I'm becoming more 
concerned with shape rather than surface." 
</P>
<P>
 "And I Will Never Grow So Old Again" perches a carved, ball-shaped birch 
piece, painted black with lacquer, on the edge of an unpainted Baltic birch 
plywood base. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we are most despondent, that's when we feel our oldest," Mississippi 
said. "Chronological age is not all that important." 
</P>
<P>
 Three California red cedar sculptures -- "Wound," "Scar" and "Hope" -- hang 
near one another. Each piece was turned on Mississippi's custom lathe, which 
allows her to make works up to 47 inches in diameter and eight feet long. Most 
lathes restrict an artist to a 12-inch diameter. 
</P>
<P>
 Mississippi first saw the cedar in the back of a Santa Monica city dump truck. 
Attracted by the wood's beauty and concerned about its fate, she followed the 
truck and purchased the wood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scar" was created around the lengthy, natural scar in the wood. "Wound" was 
formed around a smaller, round injury. "Hope" embodies its name in its dynamic 
shape and lack of blemishes. 
</P>
<P>
 The surface of Mississippi's "Tombstone," made in collaboration with Steve 
Ernsdorf, is covered in a mosaic of colorful ceramic tile pieces made by 
Andrews. She began her own tile factory in Topanga in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews has surrounded many of her ceramic masks with tile mosaics. "Last 
year, I did just masks. Then, after the earthquake, having a tile business, I 
decided that mosaics were the way to go," she said. Although her primary 
interest is in creating faces, incorporating a face into a mosaic "puts it into 
a whole context," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews' 27-year-old daughter, Serena, is the inspiration for "Isis' " sweet 
but also mysterious face. "Seine," a mask without mosaic, is a self-portrait. 
The fanciful "Gandalf" comes alive with his mosaic turban. "Eve's" face emerges 
from earth-like colored tiles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who's to say that Eve didn't come from a rock," Andrews said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins focuses on the shape of our contemporary universe through the tangible 
object of an envelope. Her oil on canvas "Letter" paintings depict images of 
envelopes with ambiguous, stream-of-consciousness words scrawled about. 
</P>
<P>
 "The letters are very mysterious -- you can't quite read them," Mississippi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Envelope shapes are structural, rhythmic," Robbins said. "I hope the 
paintings have some feelings that something has been exchanged with the viewer, 
as there would be with words or letters." Where and When 
</P>
<P>
 What: "Three Women Two." 
</P>
<P>
 Location: New Canyon Gallery, 129 S. Topanga Canyon Blvd., Topanga.

THEATER; ACTS OF GOODNESS; JANE ANDERSON EXPLORES THE TRAGIC CONSEQUENCES OF 
DOING THE RIGHT THING IN A REVIVAL OF HER PLAY 'THE BABY DANCE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Robert Koehler writes frequently about 
theater for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "In my generation," says 39-year-old playwright-screenwriter Jane Anderson, 
"to be honest, to do the decent thing, is considered a heroic act." 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in the courtyard patio of her Hollywood Hills home and framed by a 
window with a panoramic view of the smoggy Los Angeles Basin, Anderson is 
genuinely puzzled by this cultural devaluation of goodness. Yet she argues -- 
primarily through a growing body of plays and films -- that characters animated 
by the good deed can be dramatically powerful. And when deeds crash on the 
shoals of good intentions, as in her first full-length drama, "The Baby Dance," 
revived and opening tonight at the American Renegade Theatre, goodness breeds 
tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson's opus is unusually visible right now: By a fluke, "The Baby Dance" 
is also being revived in an acclaimed staging by Bud Leslie at Beverly Hills' 
Theatre 40, while "It Could Happen to You," the film written by Anderson about 
a cop (Nicholas Cage) who shares his lottery winnings with a waitress (Bridget 
Fonda), is in local theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The small miracle of that movie," says Anderson, "is that the idea that made 
me sit down in front of my computer to write the script over three years ago 
actually made it to the screen. I wondered how great it would be if good people 
actually were rewarded." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The Baby Dance" dramatizes the dark side of the decent act. Wanda and Al are 
poor and overburdened, with too many mouths to feed. When Wanda is pregnant 
again, they take up an ad offer in the paper from an affluent and childless 
young Los Angeles couple, Rachel and Richard, who wish to buy "a healthy white 
baby." 
</P>
<P>
 The coming together of these two couples is a cultural train wreck: 
Secularism, eco-awareness and business-like efficiency collide with religious 
tradition, poverty, patriarchy and a common sense born of necessity. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Jessica Kubzansky notes that staging "The Baby Dance" at American 
Renegade is, for her, a "wonderful change" from such stylized theater work as 
"Monsieur Shaherazad," which she took to the Edinburgh Festival and London with 
actor Ron Campbell. Anderson's play contains "such longing and yearning, with 
the tragedy that no one gets what they want. It would have been easy to make 
characters into good and bad guys, but Anderson is incredible in how she 
manages to make them all people trying to get what they need to survive." 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the issues raised by "The Baby Dance" -- a play that is fast becoming a 
staple in American theaters -- it isn't surrogate parenting that most inspired 
Anderson: "You know, it was the clash of classes. Class differences are a real 
concern of mine. I guess I realize how lucky I am. Some of us are born with all 
of the opportunities in the world, and some aren't. But it's no one's fault how 
they were born. And I think of this little soul in the play, floating between 
two completely different kinds of lives. The baby could become a drunk on 
welfare, or a doctor. Where we're plunked down is what makes us or breaks us." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson was plunked down in a well-to-do Bay Area family, then studied at 
Boston's Emerson College and Ohio University, and struggled as both an actor 
and stand-up comic. While she learned "the efficiency of the craft" of TV 
writing, she also developed a pair of perhaps the most charming and memorable 
writer-actor performance works in '80s L.A. theater: "How To Raise a Gifted 
Child" and "Defying Gravity." 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately, her voice was in place, her concerns absolutely focused. From 
then on, every Anderson play and film has dwelt on common folk, their responses 
to crises beyond their control, all within highly crafted narratives triggered 
by topical events. "There are two types of writers," says Anderson, "the ones 
who feed from within, like O'Neill or Anne Sexton, and others, like me, who 
feed off of what we see." 
</P>
<P>
 Her plays have observed incarcerated journalist hostages in the Middle East 
("Hotel Oubliette"), a homeless family venturing to Disneyland ("Food & 
Shelter"), and a seminar on crisis preparedness, from quakes to locusts ("Smart 
Choices for the New Century," upcoming at the next Humana Festival at Actors' 
Theatre of Louisville).

 And even in film and TV, where writers can hardly be auteurs , the same themes 
dominate. The Emmy-winning "The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged Texas 
Cheerleader-Murdering Mom" was a brilliant display of Anderson's black wit, and 
an instant TV movie classic.

 Two upcoming film projects concern circles of unusual women: "Lady Icarus" 
reveals the hidden tale of female test pilots who almost became astronauts, 
while "How to Make an American Quilt," adapted from Whitney Otto's novel, 
observes the quilting culture of women. After "The Baby Dance" premiered at 
Pasadena Playhouse, the play was stopped cold in New York, running headlong 
into a thorough pan from the New York Times' Frank Rich.

THE BUDDY SYSTEM; COMIC 'FRIENDS' HAS SERIOUS BENT, EXPLORING PERSONAL CRISIS 
AND RELATIONSHIP OF LONGTIME PALS.

 There have been stories, songs, films and poems about friendship. Everyone 
knows about it and revels in it; some bemoan the lack of it. Playwright Lee 
Kalcheim has written a play about it, from a different angle, and with a 
different purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 Kalcheim's "Friends," opening tonight at the Little Victory Theatre, has a 
twist. But in that bending of circumstance, he takes the friendship between two 
unlikely college chums, who have not seen each other in a couple of years, and 
gives it a stature beyond pal-ship, beyond a poke in the arm during "Monday 
Night Football." 
</P>
<P>
 Is this male bonding? 
</P>
<P>
 Kalcheim hates the word. "The play has nothing to do with maleness or bonding. 
I don't know where that word came from. I always think about bonding with Super 
Glue. This is a rescue. It's about a rescue. One person is falling through the 
ice. Both of these guys have trouble in their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 The friends in question meet over a weekend in a country cabin. They were 
buddies when they were kids. They toured Europe together. They went to Yale 
together. They haven't seen each other in awhile. Mel, the playwright says, is 
an expatriate New York Jew who never got his act together. At the moment he's a 
cartoonist. Okie is a farmer's son from Oklahoma, a Rhodes scholar, very 
Clinton-esque and successful, currently an assistant ambassador to the United 
Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Mel has been trying to get in touch with Okie. He's in a kind of crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's who you call when you're in a crisis, your friends," Kalcheim says. 
</P>
<P>
 Classically, the play is a comedy, but Kalcheim says it has a serious core. "I 
like to think that all comedy is substantive. Good comedy has legs; it's 
grounded in reality. That's the funny thing, just watching people behave." 
</P>
<P>
 Kalcheim has barely had time to watch the preparation of this West Coast 
premiere of his play. He's busy as co-executive producer and co-creator of Gene 
Wilder's new series, "Something Wilder," which debuts Oct. 1 on NBC. As a 
playwright, he's familiar as author of "Breakfast With Les and Bess." He knows 
about comedy, even when it's serious. 
</P>
<P>
 When he began writing "Friends," Kalcheim says he wasn't trying to make a 
statement. "I don't think I thought that way," he says. "I just wanted to talk 
about friendship. I think it's crucial. Jean-Paul Sartre said that hell is 
other people. I think hell is the absence of other people." 
</P>
<P>
 The production's director, Rudy Gaines, was attracted to the play at first by 
the fact that the protagonists had not seen each other for a period of time. 
</P>
<P>
 "People drift apart from each other," Gaines says. "Nobody gets through life 
without something happening that kind of stretches a relationship apart. That 
dynamic appealed to me, that these two guys had to get past this period that 
had gone by, to reattach immediately. You get to it through being familiar with 
each other. But it's a struggle." 
</P>
<P>
 Gaines, with a busy theater background, is writing several development 
projects for the big screen, including "Ivanhoe" for New Line Cinema.  
</P>
<P>
 Someone in "Friends" is looking for help, and Gaines says that "a lot of 
people don't realize how difficult it is to actually go to somebody, even a 
friend, and say, 'I really need your help.' The interesting thing in the play 
is the revelation of the need. It doesn't just hit you in the face. It's 
something one of the characters really needs to figure out. The play is the 
uncovering, piece by piece, of what the core problem is." 
</P>
<P>
 Gaines is careful to point out that "Friends" is not just a guys' play. 
"There's no howling or chanting or biting chicken heads off," he says. "It's 
about two people, and there's a lot of insight into not only how men are, but 
how human beings are and how friends, whether they're men or women, react to 
each other. There's something in it for everyone."  
</P>
<P>
 The ability to tightly focus on the two characters in "Friends," without the 
gorgeous scenery and car chases of film and television, is one of the reasons 
Kalcheim keeps returning to writing for the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the great challenge," he explains. "I really like coming from the inside 
of characters, and pitting interesting people against each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "The nice thing about television," he says with a laugh, "is that it pays. 
It's hard to make a living in theater. And more people will see one episode of 
'Something Wilder' than will probably see all of my plays, in all of their 
productions, as long as I live. That's daunting, and quite wonderful." WHERE

THEATER REVIEW; FANTASY THE HIGH POINT OF WHINING PLAY; DESPITE FLASHES OF 
ENERGY AND NICE CASTING, THE DRAMA IS CAUGHT IN THE GRIP OF THE GRIPES.

 Mama Sarah complains that daughter Laura can't land the acting job that will 
bring in some cash, say $50,000. Laura complains that Mama doesn't let up on 
her. Sarah complains that Laura's husband is always pecking away at his 
computer and that no one is taking care of Laura's 7-year-old son, Jonathan -- 
whom Sarah still calls "the baby." Laura complains that Mama doesn't understand 
that her husband pecks away because he's a writer, and besides, Jonathan is 
well-nurtured. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, stop the squabbling. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the almost unavoidable reaction to Robert Rudelson's mother-daughter 
drama with the ungainly title "Who's Looking After the Baby?" at the Whitefire 
Theatre. Most valuable as a model to playwrights-in-training on fundamental 
traps to avoid, the play can't rise above the petty sniping that consumes so 
much of its dialogue, and misses the kind of archetypal conflict that could 
have raised the stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 It does venture a kind of magic realism involving the reappearing ghost of 
Sarah's dead husband, Charlie, but the magic here is threadbare under Lelia 
Goldoni's disappointingly slack direction, on a poverty-stricken set by William 
Wilday. Sarah, a seamstress before Charlie swept her off her feet and 
introduced her to the theater world, is the kind of woman who still owns 
chiffon. This isn't the kind of world for the burlap-type scrim that dominates 
the set. 
</P>
<P>
 Because his present action places Sarah, who has fainted at an 
Italian-American festival, in a hospital bed with Laura tending to her needs, 
Rudelson forces himself into a corner. The mother-daughter story unwinds in the 
most contorted way imaginable, with halfheartedly envisioned dream scenes 
serving a functional expository role -- including an embarrassing stab at 
Theatre of the Absurd in Act II. (As if to underline the idea, Laura remarks 
that she feels as if she's in a Samuel Beckett play, though nothing in the 
exchanges suggests Beckett in the least.) 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Erica Yohn, as aged, ailing Sarah slumped over in her hospital bed, 
looks like a Beckett character. But her despair contains no poetry, though Yohn 
is the life force on this stage, both weighted by regrets and past losses and 
brightened by the encounters with the (dead) man she loves. Janice Lynde, her 
cool Laura a nice casting opposite Yohn's tough approach, has little to do but 
grouse and roll her eyes. Al D'Andrea's Charlie is Mr. Suave in a 
double-breasted suit until he's forced to get silly in Act II. 
</P>
<P>
 For a show whose only energy is in its fantasy, it's a tad ironic that the 
message here is for one (namely Sarah) to drop one's fantasies and deal with 
life head on. A rich fantasy life looks good after this. Where and When

MUSIC; THE 'REAL DEAL'; JAZZ PIANIST BILL CUNLIFFE, THE 1989 MONK COMPETITION 
WINNER, GIVES SONGS FOOT-PUMPING SWING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Cunliffe is, as they call a top-notch player in jazz circles, the "Real 
Deal." 
</P>
<P>
 The Boston native, who has been in Los Angeles for five years, can take any 
kind of tune and instill it with such rhythmic vitality and melodic whammy that 
you won't be able to stop your feet from tapping. 
</P>
<P>
 He can't stop his: At a recent performance at Randell's in Santa Ana, the 
pianist's Nike-covered feet bounced up and down to the beat as he created long, 
heated improvisations that were exhilarating. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to swing," Cunliffe says of the rhythmic thrust that is essential to 
jazz. "That's the feeling you get when a rhythm section's reading each other's 
minds and falling together as they play a piece of music." 
</P>
<P>
 Cunliffe can make any song swing. His debut Discovery album, "A Paul Simon 
Songbook," added an invigorating, ingratiating drive to such numbers by the 
singer-songwriter as "Still Crazy After All These Years" and "I Do It for Your 
Love." The subsequent "A Rare Connection" focused on originals and jazz 
classics, and bubbled with excitement. His next recording, due out in January, 
will be called "Bill in Brazil." 
</P>
<P>
 "Brazilian tunes can swing, too," says the Reseda resident. 
</P>
<P>
 The pianist, who gained national attention when he won the 1989 Thelonious 
Monk International Piano Competition in Washington, D.C., appears in numerous 
configurations -- as a member of the rousing Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra, 
as well as with the contemporary jazz group Porcupine. But he says he likes 
playing in trio best of all. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the most fun I have," says Cunliffe. He performs with his trio, 
featuring bassist Dave Carpenter and drummer Joe LaBarbera, on Sunday at Jazz 
Vespers at First Lutheran Church in Glendale. (He also appears each Monday at 
Randell's, where he plays Hammond B-3 organ in a group that also includes Larry 
Koonse, guitar, and Tom White, drums.) 
</P>
<P>
 "In a trio, one guy can play one note that's different and the whole band goes 
somewhere else," he says.  
</P>
<P>
 The thrill in performing with Carpenter and LaBarbera -- who have been a 
steady unit for three years -- is that they know each other so well the 
possibilities are limitless, Cunliffe says. But the pianist adds that even from 
the first gig, when the band worked at the Jazz Bakery three years ago, that 
kind of telepathic interplay was there. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were playing 'In a Mellow Tone' and, just for fun, I started playing the 
shout chorus for the Buddy Rich big-band version of the tune," he says. "Within 
four measures, Dave and I were together, and soon, we were all playing it as if 
it were a rehearsed piece, as if we'd rehearsed it for hours. We played it from 
memory even though neither Dave -- with whom I played in Buddy's band in 1984 
-- nor I had heard it for years." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cunliffe looks forward to his appearance at First Lutheran, where he recently 
performed as part of saxophonist Jane Ira Bloom's quartet. "We were on a bill 
with saxophonist Robert Stewart, whose music is pretty energetic, and we played 
mostly ballads," he says. "Ballads in a big, echo-y building like that really 
work: You hit a note and it lasts a half an hour. And the audience was one of 
the finest I've ever had in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 The pianist plans to include several ballads by Monk in his performance 
Sunday, among them, perhaps, "Reflections," "Ask Me Now" and " 'Round 
Midnight." 
</P>
<P>
 Cunliffe, who has a master's degree in music from the Eastman School of Music 
in Rochester, N.Y., and who has played with Rich, Freddie Hubbard and Art 
Blakey, has plenty of fans. One is pianist Cecilia Coleman, who says, "Bill is 
a wonderful player. He plays such great lines." 
</P>
<P>
 Cunliffe would like to get his career going a bit, get out of town and 
perform, but he acknowledges how difficult that can be. "It takes a lot of 
work, and I have to be very aggressive about it," he says. "But I like to think 
about music. I don't like to think about that." WHERE AND WHEN 
</P>
<P>
 Who: Bill Cunliffe's trio. 
</P>
<P>
 Location: First Lutheran Church of Glendale, 1300 E. Colorado St., Glendale.

READINGS; ON THE ROAD FOR A NOVEL TOUR; PROLIFIC AUTHOR DONALD E. WESTLAKE IS 
NOW SIGNING COPIES OF HIS LATEST WORK, 'BABY WOULD I LIE?' FOR FANS AT A 
BOOKSTORE NEAR YOU. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If this is Wednesday, it must be North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald E. Westlake, master of the comic mystery, is on a national book tour, 
flacking his latest, "Baby, Would I Lie?" from Mysterious Press. 
</P>
<P>
 The cross-country trek started Sept. 6 in Chicago, and by mid-September 
Westlake is in Greater Los Angeles, signing books and doing whatever else it 
takes to pique the interest of potential buyers. On a recent Wednesday morning, 
he is in the North Hollywood studios of Pacifica Radio's KPFK (90.7-FM), where 
he is deftly fielding the questions of Pearl Skotnes, veteran host of "All 
About Books." Also on Westlake's local schedule: signing books until it hurts 
at bookstores from West Hollywood to Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 The book tour, and the interviews and book signings that are its heart, is a 
necessary evil, says Westlake, who in 1993 received the highest honor of the 
Mystery Writers of America and was named a Grand Master. Actually, he says, a 
book tour isn't nearly as ghastly as the other necessary evil in his 
professional life, taking meetings with movie producers. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake has produced more than 80 titles, if you count those written under at 
least five pseudonyms ("Nobody has ever asked me to write faster," he notes). 
But he is also a successful screenwriter. His script for "The Grifters" was 
nominated for an Academy Award, and he also wrote "The Stepfather," screenplays 
as dark as many of his novels are hilarious. Westlake says his mentor in the 
screen trade was the masterful William Goldman, who adapted Westlake's comic 
caper "The Hot Rock" for the 1972 film starring Robert Redford as hard-working 
criminal John Dortmunder. Instead of simply cringing at every change Goldman 
made, Westlake listened and learned as Goldman explained what works and what 
doesn't on screen. 
</P>
<P>
 But today Westlake is in town to move copies of "Baby, Would I Lie?" "To go on 
the road to hawk a book is certainly not as bad as not being asked to go on the 
road to hawk a book," he says philosophically. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows exactly what impact book signings have on book sales, although 
Westlake says he's heard that signed books move twice as fast as unsigned ones. 
Signings are good for business, especially at specialty bookstores such as 
Mysterious Bookshop in West Los Angeles, says manager Shelly McArthur. 
McArthur's regulars, many of whom would rather skip Christmas than a favorite 
writer's new novel, happily queue up to exchange a few words with an author and 
have him or her inscribe a pristine copy of the book. "Many times we're 
offering the one thing people can't get by buying the book at discount," 
McArthur says. 
</P>
<P>
 A book signing can be a sobering experience, according to Westlake. "It's very 
like drowning. My whole life passes before my eyes. The only difference is I 
have to sign it." 
</P>
<P>
 That can be a tall order. A fan once showed up at a local signing with two 
shopping bags full of back issues of Playboy magazine featuring Westlake 
stories to be signed. Unlike writer John Irving, who now only signs books for 
friends and overseas admirers, Westlake almost always obliges. His attitude 
toward fans, he says, is much like that of fellow novelist Stephen King. King's 
daughter once complained about the amount of time her Dad devoted to 
autographing books for devotees. "Those people buy your shoes," King told her. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there are the fans themselves. "You get the fans you deserve," says 
Westlake. His own followers are a fairly sunny lot, but mystery and suspense is 
a genre with a decidedly dark side, and some of his fellows attract a bizarre 
crowd indeed. According to McArthur, appearances by writer Clive Barker are the 
ones most likely to bring out the creatures of the night. Barker, who writes 
horror as well as suspense, is always being asked to sign fans' body parts, 
McArthur says. One local admirer even slashed his wrist so Barker could 
autograph his latest book in blood. The fan thoughtfully provided a quill pen 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Appealing to a different crowd, Westlake's new book is set in Branson, Mo., 
mecca for some of the nation's most rabid country-music fans. A New Yorker to 
the bone, Westlake spent several long weeks soaking up local color in Branson, 
where no breakfast is served without its grits and gravy. "It didn't seem like 
more than seven or eight years," he recalls. His wife refused to accompany him 
on the last visit, inquiring acidly, "Why can't you ever think of a story set 
in Paris or Rome?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Baby, Would I Lie?" deals with the murder trial of a country singing star 
(whose discography includes "If It Ain't Fried, It Ain't Food!") and the media 
circus that surrounds it. If all this sounds vaguely familiar, Westlake 
couldn't be happier. He is shamelessly willing to talk to interviewers about 
the sometimes startling parallels between his fiction and the O. J. Simpson 
case, including the high jinks of the tabloids and the use of a mock jury. 
"I've found a phrase for what I've been doing," says Westlake, whose book was 
finished before the Simpson-Goldman murders. "I'm surfing the Zeitgeist ." 
</P>
<P>
 Enormously respected by his peers, Westlake doesn't sell as many books as Dick 
Francis or Sue Grafton, but he isn't complaining. "Without doing it on purpose, 
I think I've found the perfect middle ground," he says. "I haven't had an 
honest job since April, 1959 . . . and I've never had the down side of fame." 
Instead of spelling out the down side, he does what he does best: He tells a 
story about it. It seems that Stephen King owns a baronial home in Bangor, 
Maine, and in puckish King fashion had finials in the shape of bats installed 
on his wrought-iron fence. One after another, the bats disappeared, sawed off 
by King fanatics. At first King had them replaced. Eventually he realized fame 
no longer allowed him to have them.

 So, what in the name of Myles Standish is that. . . . that thing standing in a 
smoky corner of The Rock, a Canoga Park tavern owned by Philip McGovern -- an 
Englishman, for heaven's sake? It looks like a dartboard. It plays like a 
dartboard. By George, it is a dartboard. Only this one has hundreds of tiny 
holes to catch plastic soft-tip darts. Scores are recorded electronically in a 
computerized game punctuated by whistles and bells. What's more, competitors 
must deposit 50 cents to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Call it darts on Astroturf. Purists call it blasphemy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people are against it, and I quite agree that it's pathetic," said 
McGovern, who has nine dart machines in The Rock and two other San Fernando 
Valley-area bars. "But I love it because I make money on the machines. They're 
becoming very popular." 
</P>
<P>
 Too popular, some say. In fact, the soft-tip game is at the bull's-eye in a 
pointed dispute that has polarized the pubs. Modernists raise their glasses to 
the user-friendly, yuppie version of darts. Traditionalists mutter in their 
schooners that arcade gimmickry is making a mockery of their sacred game of 
throwing skill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought they were a joke right to begin with," said Brian Caldwell, a 
native of England and manager of Scotland Yard, a British Pub in Canoga Park 
that caters exclusively to old-fashioned, steel-tip players. "We've got the 
real darts here." 
</P>
<P>
 The feeling is mutual at the The Royal Oak in North Hollywood, another 
steel-tip stronghold where plastic is pooh-poohed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Plastic is OK, I guess, for people who don't have any ambition," said Eddie 
Harmston, a regular at The Royal Oak. "There's no brain work involved in 
plastic. You don't even have to be able to count to 10. To me, plastic is like 
a toy." 
</P>
<P>
 Novelty or not, the soft-tip game has steadily gained popularity in the Valley 
area since one of the machines first appeared in a Van Nuys bar in 1984. In 
fact, soft-tip players today outnumber their steel-tip counterparts nearly 3 to 
1 among those participating in local leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of bars sponsoring soft-tip play entice competitors with prize money. 
Pub owners are encouraged by soft-tip promoters offering to organize leagues 
and share revenue deposited into machines they provide. Avid soft-tip players 
drop as much as $25 a week into the machines. 
</P>
<P>
 But the big draw is simplicity. Soft-tip players don't have to understand 
arcane variations of dart games or complicated rules. The machine is programmed 
for several games that players select at the press of a button. Not only does 
the computer register scores, it instructs players when and where to throw 
their next dart. 
</P>
<P>
 All they have to do is aim and throw. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything else is going computers these days. Darts might as well, too," 
said George Richardson, who competes in soft-tip leagues at The Rock and at 
other bars. "That's what I like about it." 
</P>
<P>
 It's also what critics hate. For purists who prefer to play with dartboards 
made of compressed sisal, a sturdy fiber obtained from the agave plant, the 
very notion of not keeping one's own score is ludicrous. Keeping score and 
knowing how to proceed in a game are a player's responsibilities, they say. 
Also, soft-tip play eliminates "chalking," the traditional task of tallying 
scores that idle players perform. 
</P>
<P>
 Steel-tip enthusiasts also are turned off by lightweight plastic darts, which 
do not exceed 16 grams. teel-tip darts can weigh as much as 50 grams, although 
most players choose darts that weigh between 21 and 25 grams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Soft-tip is for a different type of dart shooter," said Patrick Mulcahy, 
manager of The Royal Oak. "It's like comparing golf to pitch-and-putt. We used 
to have (a machine) in here, but it just gathered dust. We had a league, and it 
just died away." 
</P>
<P>
 Extinction might come sooner for the steel-tip game. In some bars where the 
two games coexist, steel-tip darts have become relics. And some soft-tip 
proponents boldly predict that in 10 years, steel-tip play will be dead as a 
dodo bird. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been saying it's a dinosaur," said Larry Hill, who leases 190 machines 
to more than 100 venues out of his Van Nuys store, Darts and Things. Hill is 
tournament director of the California Soft-Tip Dart Assn., which runs 35 
leagues involving more than 1,000 players. 
</P>
<P>
 "One clique of people will continue to play steel-tip," Hill said. "But 
they'll be playing the same people over and over during the next 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Die-hard steel-tip players concede that their following is declining. 
Membership in the Southern California Dart Assn., a governing body of the 
steel-tip game, stands at about 800 compared to about 3,200 in 1984. About 75% 
of association members compete in leagues affiliated with 16 Valley bars or 
lodges, says Mel Katz, the association's president. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz blames the presence of soft-tip machines for contributing to the decline 
in steel-tip participation -- not only in leagues but among those who play just 
for fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always been you could walk in off the street, pick up a set of darts 
from the bartender and play for free," Katz said. "The individuals who have 
made the machines and the individuals who supply the machines are the ones who 
are making the money, and it's turned out to be big business." 
</P>
<P>
 Players' preferences aside, economics indeed plays a role in the dart debate. 
About 1,000 Valley-area soft-tip players compete for prize money in leagues 
sponsored by Medalist Marketing, a Seattle-based company that manufactures 
soft-tip machines and sanctions regional and national competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Steel-tip leagues, which the dart association charges players $28 to join, 
offer no prize money. 
</P>
<P>
 Medalist players pay league registration fees of between $10 and $20 for a 
typical 14-week season. Those successful in league play are invited to compete 
in a biannual regional tournament in Burbank that attracts hundreds of players. 
Tournament entrants can win as much as $500 apiece, depending on how far their 
team advances. 
</P>
<P>
 More money can be won at an annual national tournament in Reno, Nev., that 
attracts about 2,500 Medalist players and boasts a total purse in excess of 
$175,000. Players reaching the pinnacle of competition can win as much as 
$2,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of soft-tip players, however, wind up playing for fun. But the 
incentive to win money is an attraction, says Jerry Indik, who operates a 
Medalist League and his own soft-tip leagues out of his Golden State Darts and 
Games store in Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why soft-tip play has become so much more competitive," Indik said. 
"The best players in the United States today are playing soft-tip." 
</P>
<P>
 Indik's attitude might be indicative of things to come. A former steel-tipped 
competitor once ranked fourth in the nation by the United States Darting Assn., 
Indik today embraces the plastic game as the future of darts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once people play soft-tip, they don't want to play steel-tip," Indik said. 
"Soft-tip players don't hold a grudge against steel-tip players. It's just the 
reversal. It's that English influence that pooh-poohs the whole idea of 
soft-tip." 
</P>
<P>
 Katz of the dart association insists his brethren harbor no grudges but share 
a passion for a game they fear might be fading away. For decades, steel-tip 
players have played only for pleasure and plaques. Those who simply wish to 
play for fun have played for free. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the way darts should be, Katz says. And that's the way darts should 
stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not promoting the game of darts, they're promoting a game for 
profit," Katz said of his soft-tip counterparts. "I have nothing against people 
who want to play soft-tip. Just take a lot of quarters with you." Where to Go

BARGAINS / GERI COOK: AFFORDABLE FURNISHINGS WITH FLAIR; AL'S DISCOUNT OFFERS 
PLENTY OF DECORATOR CHOICES -- FROM SOFAS TO DINING ROOM SETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sometimes in the search for bargains in home furnishings, you might dismiss 
the discounter when seeking out current designer styles. But Al's Discount 
Furniture is full of pleasant surprises -- including decorator choices. 
</P>
<P>
 A grouping of "slipcovered sofas," one of the hottest items in the home 
furnishings industry these days, awaits just inside the door. Yes, you could go 
to places like Shabby Chic in Santa Monica and pay thousands for the slightly 
rumpled slipcover look, or you can be just as chic at Al's for $800. That's for 
a standard seven-foot sofa upholstered with a preshrunk slipcover. 
</P>
<P>
 Preshrunk is the key to saving more money, since all but preshrunk fabrics 
must be dry-cleaned, which can run $80 each time out. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're looking for a more traditional but luxurious look, a down sofa that 
comes with a lifetime guarantee was offered for an amazing $2,300. Similar 
sofas start at $4,000. And if the manufacturer goes out of business, owner Al 
Segal says he will honor the warranty. 
</P>
<P>
 For the disposable furniture crowd that only needs a few years wear, a love 
seat and sofa combination were $350 ($150 for the sofa and $100 for the love 
seat). They were quite attractive in a jade and white striped fabric and have 
been spotted for $450 elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 For the essence of practicality, it's hard to beat Berkline's double recliner 
-- one on each end of a sofa -- with a snack tray and beverage counter in the 
center. It's not great to look at but perfect for TV viewing comfort in a den. 
In black leather, this was $1,299 instead of $1,499. 
</P>
<P>
 Upstairs is the clearance room, where you'll find many one-of-a-kind bargains. 
A five-piece country-style dinette set was $150, compared to $295 at several 
major stores. A glass-top pedestal table with four chairs that would fit a 
kitchen corner nicely was only $99. 
</P>
<P>
 Back downstairs and in the rear you'll find dining room sets and entertainment 
centers. From Singer, a dining table with one 18-inch leaf, six chairs (two 
with arms) for $1,599 recently was "on special" at a major furniture discounter 
for $1,899. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego Design's traditional oak entertainment center is a good buy at 
$1,299, priced elsewhere at $1,650. 
</P>
<P>
 To the left as you enter the store is bedroom furniture. A solid pine bed with 
headboard, footboard and side rails was $299. Segal says this, Broyhill's 
Fontana line, is the "hottest design in the country and sells at other stores 
for $399 and up." 
</P>
<P>
 Many major lines of mattresses are available at Al's -- Spring Air, Sealy, 
Aireloom -- and the prices are hard to beat. Actually, Al says he won't allow 
it. 
</P>

CLUB SCENE; HOT COFFEE, RUMOR AT COOL SPOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIA L. OLIANDE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The possibility that a major recording act will drop in unannounced is a 
definite perk of club-going in Los Angeles. Last Saturday, a rumor that R.E.M. 
would show up to play a set was sweeping Eagles Coffee Pub and Newsstand in 
North Hollywood. The band never materialized, but most in the crowd hung on to 
the end. 
</P>
<P>
 THE BUZZ: Everyone had heard the rumor that the band would be the last 
performers of the night, and speculation was running wild. One variation was 
that Slush, the scheduled headliners, was really a -- wink, wink -- pseudonym 
for the Georgia-based, Grammy-winning band. Another was that Slush was being 
bumped off the lineup. "We didn't know what to think when we heard the rumor," 
said Derek Davis, 22, who came from Fullerton hoping for a chance to see the 
group. "If it comes true, there couldn't be anything better." Alas, until the 
very last note of Slush's set, the crowd's hopes were still high. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SCENE: Eagles is a coffeehouse that thinks it's a nightclub, without the 
plastic smiles and "bar" attitude. It's divided into two sections with separate 
entrances, the coffeehouse and the newsstand. The coffeehouse is strictly 
nonsmoking and serves java, pastries and sandwiches and offers patrons 
virtually any board game to play at their tables. In addition to selling 
magazines, cigarettes and candy, the newsstand also houses the stage, where a 
handful of bands play on weekends, usually to standing-room-only crowds. The 
sidewalk tends to get the overflow, with tables, chairs and a couch provided 
for street-side conversation.  
</P>
<P>
 THE CROWD: The people are all ages, with most around 25, and men outnumber the 
women slightly. Dress is very casual, from grunge to jeans and shirts. Most are 
regulars who enjoy the friendly atmosphere and rave about the employees. "The 
people here aren't pretentious, trendy wanna-bes," said Crystal D'Angora, 14, 
of North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 THE MUSIC: For the most part, the bands who did show up were good, if a bit 
rough around the edges. Saturday featured Quetzal, a Latin alternative rock 
band; Grand Prix, another alternative quartet, and Lisa Flores, a Latin folk 
singer. Tracey and the Hindenberg, two guys with guitars, were first on stage 
with satirical lyrics like, "It was only his proof of insurance, but it looked 
like a pistol to me." Slush, an aggressive alternative band, played to an 
appreciative house. 
</P>
<P>
 THE GOOD: The people come to hang out, drink coffee, listen to music, play 
games and talk. "I've only lived here for four months. . . . This is the only 
(place) that you can find cool conversation," said Johnny Whiddon, 19, who 
came, stayed and got a job.  
</P>
<P>
 THE BAD: No alcohol, which most agreed was not a bad thing, but was sorely 
missed among others. "It's sad but true -- some people won't come here because 
they can't drink," said Victoria Lotspeich, 23, of North Hollywood.  
</P>
<P>
 THE WORD: "We'll be handing out aspirin now," said Peters, Slush's singer, 
after an earsplitting set. "We're sponsored by Tylenol." 
</P>
<P>
 Eagles Coffee Pub and Newsstand, 5231 Lankershim Blvd., North Hollywood. 
Hours: 7 a.m. to 2 a.m. Fridays, 9 a.m. to 2 a.m. Saturdays. (818) 760-4212.

HEALTH; MIND OVER MATTERS; STRESS-REDUCTION PROGRAM HELPS PARTICIPANTS GET IN 
TOUCH WITH THEIR BODIES AND MAINTAIN WELL-BEING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HAMMERS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Maryann Hammers writes regularly for 
The Times. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sitting in rush-hour traffic is hazardous to your health. So are fights with 
your mate, impending job layoffs, un paid bills, still-jolting aftershocks and 
whatever else stresses you out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life can never be stress-free," said clinical psychologist Mae Keyson. "There 
is job stress, money stress, relationship stress, earthquake stress. You can't 
stop the waves from coming at you, but you can learn to ride the waves." 
</P>
<P>
 That's the idea behind the Mind / Body Stress Reduction Program at Northridge 
Hospital Medical Center. Through yoga, nutrition education, group support, 
meditation, guided imagery and exercises in communication, breathing, 
relaxation and visualization, participants learn how to better deal with what 
gets them down. 
</P>
<P>
 Such tension-busting techniques not only help us mellow out, but they are also 
critical to our health and well-being, said Keyson, who co-directs the program 
with yoga therapist Marsha Accomazzo. Chronic stress can impair the immune 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 A UCLA study found that men with a history of severe work-related problems 
were five times more likely to develop colon or rectal cancer than men without 
job difficulties. Another study showed that people who care for spouses with 
Alzheimer's disease have respiratory infections more often than adults who do 
not care for an ill spouse. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Keyson, people with a wide variety of complaints can benefit from 
the Mind / Body program, including those with AIDS, heart disease, cancer, 
chronic pain, high blood pressure, asthma, diabetes, sleep disturbances, 
obsessive-compulsive disorders, panic attacks, eating disorders, depression and 
fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
 People who are going through a divorce or having family or job difficulties 
can also be helped. "Anyone who feels unhappy and stuck and wants to change the 
way they view life is a good candidate," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Keyson emphasizes that the Mind / Body program works with -- not instead 
of -- conventional treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 "The program is not held out as a magical cure or panacea," she said, "but it 
does offer an additional tool to complement standard medical care. It 
encourages patients to maintain and optimize health and be active participants 
in their own health care." 
</P>
<P>
 One technique taught in the Mind / Body program is mindfulness -- the act of 
concentrating on the present, rather than fretting about the future or dwelling 
on the past. "Focusing on the present moment is a way to reconnect with your 
body," Keyson said, "which is important, because when your mind and body become 
disconnected, you don't know when you are overextending yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 To help participants focus on the moment, Keyson leads them through a variety 
of poetic images. For example, she may darken the room and ask them to imagine 
themselves as mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Yoga also helps participants get in touch with their bodies. "Yoga produces 
tranquillity and serenity and encourages reflection," Accomazzo said. "During 
yoga, you are involved in the process -- the feeling of a pose or a breath -- 
rather than striving for a goal." 
</P>
<P>
 Accomazzo said she began practicing yoga about 20 years ago after two 
operations left her with 60% lung capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what it is like to be a patient," she said. "I know how bad it hurts; 
I know how scary it is. I know what it feels like to have your control taken 
away and your privacy invaded. There is nothing about yoga that condones 
getting off medicine, but it helps take away the pain and fear and give back 
the control. It helps people deal with whatever stress is in their life." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Mindy Sabin-Wheaton, in her 20s, who's an account manager for a telemarketing 
firm, said she signed up for the / Body program in the hope of lowering her 
cholesterol levels. "I think I am pretty healthy," she said. "I watch my diet 
and exercise. I thought the program would be one more thing I could do." 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, Sabin-Wheaton's high cholesterol was not lowered by the 
program -- but her outlook on life is much better. "When things get stressful 
at work, I am able to take a step back and just focus on breathing and being 
calm, and I realize nothing is as bad as it seems." LIAISON: Where and When

3-HOUR TOUR: SCIENCE'S HALL OF FAME; TO WALK THROUGH CALTECH IS TO REVISIT 
EINSTEIN, OPPENHEIMER, MILLIKAN AND OTHER 20TH-CENTURY LIONS OF THE FIELD.

 Caltech. The very name conjures headlines of seismology and Richter scales, of 
outer space and underwater exploration, of Einstein, Oppenheimer, Pauling and 
other marquee names in physics and chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
 As one of the world's premier research schools of science and engineering, the 
103-year-old California Institute of Technology is a mouse that roars -- only 
900 undergraduates and 1,100 graduate students with dreams that reach not just 
for stars but whole galaxies. 
</P>
<P>
 This is where Albert Einstein served as a visiting scholar in the early 1930s, 
where J. Robert Oppenheimer consulted while siring the atomic bomb, where Linus 
Pauling determined how atoms form molecules, where Charles Richter helped give 
birth to the modern study of earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 It has produced 23 Nobel Prize winners ever since astronomer George Ellery 
Hale, the first director of the Mount Wilson Observatory, and others founded 
it. In 1920, they gave what had begun modestly in 1891 as Amos G. Throop 
University -- a local arts and crafts school -- a new name (California 
Institute of Technology), a fresh start in problem-solving and a vision that 
could see forever. 
</P>
<P>
 Once-per-weekday tours of the 124-acre campus are aimed mainly at prospective 
students (separate architectural tours require reservations and occur on the 
fourth Thursday of each month except July, August and December; because of 
Thanksgiving, November tours occur on the third Thursday). 
</P>
<P>
 A video that starts the tour celebrates Caltech's centennial and rekindles the 
first impressions in 1931 of a freshman named Willy Fowler, who would become 
one of the school's renowned physicists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw Robert Millikan and Albert Einstein in a heated discussion on the 
steps," Fowler recalls. "I said, 'Boy! This is the place to be!' " 
</P>
<P>
 1:45 p.m.: Tourists should report first to Caltech's public relations and 
visitors center at 315 S. Hill Ave. Here, the 15-minute video explores not just 
the school's history and pedigree but also its world-class reputation for 
student pranks. 
</P>
<P>
 Examples: Caltech insurgents reconfigured a UCLA card stunt at halftime of the 
1984 Rose Bowl game to read: "GO CIT." And during the seniors' annual "Ditch 
Day" in 1987, others changed Los Angeles' famed hillside letters -- from 
HOLLYWOOD to CALTECH. Says one faculty member: "A lot of us are here because we 
can't wait for the next prank." 
</P>
<P>
 2 p.m.: It's a sprawling campus of 100 buildings -- grouped by scientific 
disciplines and arranged in some places to resemble Mediterranean plazas, with 
courtyards, arcades and handsome landscaping, eucalyptus trees and evergreens. 
</P>
<P>
 It's unhurried and uncrowded here -- owing to Caltech's ratio of just three 
students for every faculty member. 
</P>
<P>
 Our student guide, a senior from Escondido, backpedals as she talks, leading a 
dozen visitors south on Hill Avenue past a mansion that serves as campus 
residence of Thomas E. Everhart, Caltech's president since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 She looks back on four exhausting years of academic pressure among peers who 
ranked in the top 1% of their high school classes. "Around here," she says, "we 
tend to forget the real world." 
</P>
<P>
 Turning right on San Pasqual Street, we soon enter North House -- one of seven 
on-campus residence halls patterned not so much after fraternities but Oxford 
University's family-style of housing. About 60% of Caltech's students live on 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 North House is a remodeled 1960s-vintage dormitory with bunk beds designed by 
students to relieve overcrowding. On the main floor is a room lined with about 
60 personal computers. Each house has such a facility, with all terminals 
linked to a central campus-wide network and free electronic mail anywhere -- a 
perk to students who loathe writing letters. 
</P>
<P>
 2:15 p.m.: A few steps beyond North House sits an impressive Italian 
Renaissance-style building named the Athenaeum, which serves faculty and staff. 
"It's our version of an officers' club," the guide says. 
</P>
<P>
 With its archways, tile roof and courtyard, Athenaeum also has served as a 
location site for feature films such as "Beverly Hills Cop" (1984) and "The War 
of the Roses" (1989). 
</P>
<P>
 2:30 p.m.: We pass South House, a more elegant residence hall built in the 
1930s, and the Winnett Student Center, a brick building that contains the 
bookstore, coffeehouse lounge, piano room and Caltech's YMCA chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 Along a nearby sidewalk, a turn-of-the-century cannon looms -- a three-ton 
relic of the Franco-Prussian War on loan from Southwestern Academy in nearby 
San Marino (and sometimes pilfered by prankish students from Harvey Mudd 
College in Claremont, the guide says). 
</P>
<P>
 A cannon blast ("harmless -- but noisy," school officials say) fires about six 
times a year to herald important events such as final-exams week and 
commencement. 
</P>
<P>
 2:45 p.m.: Farther along the walkway is a knot of buildings including the 
Firestone (applied mathematics and flight sciences) and Guggenheim (aeronautics 
and applied physics) laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
 The Guggenheim Laboratory, which once tested the late Howard Hughes' Spruce 
Goose aircraft, contains wind- and shock-tunnels enabling the study of how 
aircraft perform at high speeds and high altitude. 
</P>
<P>
 3 p.m.: Near the west end of the campus, the nine-story Millikan Library 
(named for physicist Robert A. Millikan, who helped George Ellery Hale start 
Caltech on its new mission in 1921) dominates the landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 The library, completed in 1967, was built to withstand earthquakes of 
magnitude 8.0, officials say. During the 1971 Sylmar quake, the building 
survived, but countless books toppled along with their shelves (which now are 
bolted to walls). 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby is the Arms Laboratory (geological and planetary sciences), which is 
said to house the largest collection of gems and minerals in the Southwestern 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 3:10 p.m.: Mudd Laboratory-South, at the school's southwesternmost corner 
(California Boulevard and Wilson Avenue), cuts an even taller public profile 
than the Millikan Library. 
</P>
<P>
 It's Caltech's so-called Seismic Center, where Kate Hutton and other 
scientists hold court amid swarms of reporters and TV cameras after major 
Southern California earthquakes and aftershocks.  
</P>
<P>
 Here, instruments record an average of 30 earthquakes (mostly small) a day, 
the guide tells visitors. She points to cylinders of white paper nicknamed the 
"Pasadena Drum," a seismograph whose wavy lines become jagged whenever a 
high-magnitude quake occurs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not much is going on today," she says, with relief.  
</P>
<P>
 3:15 p.m.: Near mid-campus sits a white circular building with a pointed roof. 
It's Beckman Auditorium, scene of lectures, concerts, dance recitals and 
theatrical programs that attract crowds from across Greater Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Close by are the Beckman Institute, where biologists interact with chemists, 
and the Beckman Laboratories of Behavioral Biology, representing Caltech's role 
as one of the first schools to conduct major studies of the brain and nervous 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 3:30 p.m.: At tour's end, you can dodge the start of rush hour by strolling to 
the Pie 'N Burger (913 E. California Blvd.), a down-home, family-style cafe 
which, like Caltech, is a neighborhood institution -- popular with students and 
faculty for three decades. "My son likes it because they still make sodas there 
the old-fashioned way," one Caltech employee says of the Pie 'N Burger, 1 1/2 
blocks from the campus. "They pour the syrup and mix it all up right in front 
of you." Where and When 
</P>
<P>
 What: Public tours of the Caltech campus. Public relations and visitors 
center, 315 S. Hill Ave., Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 When: 2 p.m. Mondays through Fridays (except on holidays or winter break), 
preceded by showing of video at 1:45 p.m. Separate architectural tours occur on 
the fourth Thursday of each month (except for July, August and December; 
because of Thanksgiving, November tours occur on the third Thursday).

RESTAURANT REVIEW; SEARING THAI TREATS; THE EXOTIC MAKES THE MOST OF CLASSICS 
-- FROM COCONUT MILK-BASED SOUPS TO SEAFOOD DISHES AND FRIED RICE.

 Thailand is nicknamed "Land of Smiles," and smiles -- of various sorts -- come 
naturally at Exotic Thai Restau rant. When I was ordering pad se-eau , a 
terrific fried noodle dish that comes with a choice of meats, I had the 
temerity to ask the waitress to bring mine with mu (Thai for "pork"). Sensing 
my attempt at her language, she replied, with a jokey smirk, "That's what cows 
say in English." 
</P>
<P>
 (Naturally, like the American smart guy I am, I countered, "So what do Thai 
cows say? Oink?" We got it with pork.) 
</P>
<P>
 Although the waitresses in this personable Burbank restaurant smile and joke 
freely when you pose questions about dishes, they're not necessarily 
forthcoming with descriptions or recommendations, despite their generally 
fluent English. In the Land of Smiles tradition, service is diplomatic and 
noncommittal, so remember, you're going to be pretty much on your own. 
</P>
<P>
 Exotic Thai Cuisine's menu employs words such as "veggie" and "exotic" to 
describe classic Thai dishes, but whoever is working at the range doesn't 
compromise a whole lot in the way of taste. What I like best about this 
restaurant is the fact that the kitchen respects a request for hearty spicing, 
unlike the cooks at the typical suburban Thai restaurant, who are afraid to 
turn up the heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Larb , a ground chicken dish eaten with chiles, onions and lime juice, is 
billed as Eastern Thai Treat, and it's not for beginners. It burns your tongue 
and sears your throat and is about as hot a version as you can find in Los 
Angeles. There's an equally hot dish called naem sod, which the menu refers to 
as Northern Thai Treat. This dish treats pork to a healthy dose of ginger, 
chiles and sliced onion. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who don't feel up to either of those, Thai egg rolls ( poh pia ) are 
good mild starters. Exotic Thai Cuisine's version has a dense vegetable 
stuffing that gives them a satisfying heaviness, in place of the usual egg roll 
stuffing of glass noodles and minced pork. Dip them in the sweet, sticky sauce 
and eat them with the cucumber relish. They're habit-forming. 
</P>
<P>
 Exotic Thai Cuisine doesn't mess much with the traditional Thai soups. Tom kha 
kai is a wonderful creamy version of the coconut-milk based classic, with 
chicken, cabbage and a touch of galanga root. A warning, though: In Thai 
restaurants, soups are served in huge chafing dishes, resulting in portions 
that seem excessive in the case of rich soups like this one. Tom yum goong 
makes more sense in the tureen, because it is essentially a clear broth, 
distinctively edged with the flavor of lemon grass and chock full of large 
shrimp. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 From there, you'll want to move on to warm salads, which Thai chefs were doing 
generations before California cuisine. (But ask the waitresses to separate the 
courses, or chances are you will get your soups, salads and appetizers all at 
the same time.) 
</P>
<P>
 One of my favorite dishes here is spinach duck salad, thanks to the finely 
chopped topping of duck that has been lightly coated with honey and fried 
crisp. Thai beef salad, or yum nuea , is generous with the grilled beef (the 
kitchen coats with hot pepper upon request). Naked shrimp salad consists of 
marinated grilled shrimp in a lime sauce with celery, onions, lemon grass and 
wilted romaine. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't much care for the restaurant's traditional Thai curries, which are 
rather oily and leave a strong aftertaste. The most popular one is probably the 
one they call Thai curry, consisting mostly of reduced coconut milk, bamboo 
shoots and chile paste. But I certainly fancy the restaurant's spice-coated 
golden barbecued chicken (half a chicken to an order), and I positively crave 
the seafood dish called shrimp cake, which is four crisply fried disks you eat 
with a peanut-and-cucumber relish. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have room, the restaurant proposes interesting alternatives to white 
rice, many of which remind me of dishes I have stumbled on accidentally in 
Asia. Khao pad , called Exotic Fried Rice on this menu, includes shrimp, 
Chinese sausage, tomato, onion, eggs and a grainy curry powder. It is very 
exotic. The familiar Thai staple pad woon sen are clear, gossamer thin threads 
fashioned out of mung bean, which are then mixed up with similar components and 
fried. 
</P>
<P>
 Let us also not forget that delicious pad se-eau , flat rice noodles similar 
to Chinese chow fun. Exotic Thai Cuisine dry-sautes these tempting noodles with 
broccoli, garlic, egg and a choice of either shrimp, chicken, beef or pork -- 
the aforementioned mu . Where and When

BACK-TO-BASICS PROPOSAL MAY BE REDESIGNED; VENTURA: SCHOOL OFFICIALS CONSIDER 
USING FOUR CLASSROOMS INSTEAD OF CONVERTING A BUILDING. CONCEPT MEETS SOME 
RESISTANCE. 
</P>

 A year after proposing that one Ventura elementary school convert to a 
back-to-basics format, school officials said Thursday they may scale back the 
venture by launching it in a set of four empty classrooms at Will Rogers 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials said they would pursue the smaller back-to-basic program only if 
they fail to find an elementary school where parents and teachers agree to a 
total conversion. Such a program includes dressing students in uniforms and 
requiring parents to volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has ruled out some schools as too small and others because they 
are already overcrowded. And at still other schools, parents are giving less 
than wholehearted support to converting to a back-to-basics format. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest glitch is whether a school will go for it," said parent Brent 
Gerkens, a member of a subcommittee working on the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 And officials face other hurdles in their quest to start a back-to-basics 
school -- including continuing criticism that any such school would be elitist 
because it would draw only students from stable, well-to-do families with 
attentive parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea to fall back on using a bank of empty classrooms instead of 
converting an entire school is only one of several changes to emerge in the 
district's evolving proposal for the new school. 
</P>
<P>
 The back-to-basics subcommittee of school officials, parents and teachers is 
proposing a school that differs somewhat from the vision initially put forward 
by Supt. Joseph Spirito. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some elements are still the same: Students would wear uniforms. And parents 
would sign a contract, promising to volunteer at the school and make their 
children behave and do homework. 
</P>
<P>
 But Spirito had proposed last fall that the back-to-basics approach extend 
into the classroom, offering an alternative for children who learn better in 
highly structured classrooms. With this classroom approach, teachers may rely 
mainly on lecturing and drills. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as proposed by the seven-member subcommittee, the back-to-basics school 
would use pretty much the same curriculum and classroom techniques as any other 
elementary school in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we really went through the curriculum, we didn't see that much 
difference" between what exists at elementary schools and what is proposed for 
the new school, Gerkens said. 
</P>
<P>
 The change in the proposed curriculum, which must be approved by a full 
25-member back-to-basics committee, apparently may fuel criticism that the 
school would be elitist. 
</P>
<P>
 Lincoln School teacher Michael Elman, who sits on the full committee, said the 
idea of offering an alternative curriculum was one justification for setting up 
such a school. 
</P>
<P>
 He worries, he said, that the school as proposed would attract only students 
whose parents have both the interest and the time to become more involved in 
their children's education. 
</P>
<P>
 And these are not the students most in need of help, said Elman, a persistent 
critic of the back-to-basics concept. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are students who have good parental support and a good home environment 
and they would probably do well in any setting," Elman said. "Unfortunately 
these are the students I don't think we need to concentrate on right now." 
</P>
<P>
 But Spirito and other school officials said they are trying to counter any 
charges that the new school would be elitist. 
</P>
<P>
 The district is determined, Spirito said, that the school draw children of all 
races and ethnic groups from around the city. To ensure this, he said, the 
district may offer busing -- an option not usually available to children who 
transfer to a school outside their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the options for a location seem to be narrowing. 
</P>
<P>
 Subcommittee members said administrators have ruled out the district's four 
smallest schools -- Arnaz, Lincoln, Oak View and Pierpont -- because they want 
a location that can hold 400 to 500 students. In addition, they said three 
schools on the east end -- Juanamaria, Saticoy and Junipero Serra -- are 
already too crowded to take on additional students. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials want the back-to-basics school to be centrally located. But parents 
at one such school, Poinsettia, have had very mixed reactions to the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Will Rogers School Principal Jose Montano said his school may be a leading 
contender for the conversion, if parents agree. Even without strong parental 
support at Will Rogers, the district may decide to use a bank of four 
classrooms to launch the new school with children from around the district. 
</P>
<P>
 The district plans to survey parents at all schools on the issue later this 
school year.

HONOR STUDENT IS MOURNED BY FACULTY, CLASSMATES; TRAGEDY: THE SIXTH-GRADER WAS 
KILLED WHILE RIDING HIS BICYCLE. A 21-TRUMPET SALUTE IS PLANNED TODAY AT BALBOA 
MIDDLE SCHOOL.

 Teachers and classmates on Thursday mourned the death of Ventura honor student 
Christopher Grasmugg, planning a 21-trumpet salute today for the 12-year-old 
band member who was killed when he swerved his bike into a car. 
</P>
<P>
 A sixth-grader at Balboa Middle School, Christopher had recently written an 
essay about what he did best -- riding his bicycle. "It's kind of an irony," 
Balboa Principal Helena T. Reeves said. 
</P>
<P>
 A crisis-counseling team was at the school Thursday, and students wrote 
letters and made a poster to send to the Grasmugg family, Reeves said. A page 
of the school yearbook will very likely be dedicated to him, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher was especially well-known at Juanamaria School in east Ventura. He 
attended there for six years and worked as a volunteer until shortly before he 
was killed early Wednesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "The night that he died, he had been in the special ed room until 5 o'clock, 
helping the teacher," Juanamaria Principal Bonnie Switack said. She said 
Christopher had attended the PTA's back-to-school lunch for Juanamaria teachers 
as an "assistant teacher." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's one of our very favorite kids," Switack said. "He really liked teachers 
and principals." 
</P>
<P>
 Reaction to Christopher's death has been overwhelming, she said. "Everyone is 
just going around school with red eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 Switack said the tall, thin boy was one of the first to welcome her to the 
school when she arrived two years ago, and that he went out of his way to seek 
out new children and defend them against bullies. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Police Cpl. John J. Turner said the accident occurred at 6:30 p.m. on 
Blackburn Road near Petit Avenue. Chris Smith, 16, of Ventura was attempting to 
pass the cyclist on the left. But the boy also swerved to the left instead of 
heading toward the right shoulder of the road, Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher was not wearing a helmet as required by a new state law, Turner 
said. He said a helmet might have helped the boy. But the head injuries were 
severe, and the officer said he could not say whether a helmet would have saved 
the boy's life. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Switack said she frequently saw Christopher on his bike, and he 
"always had his helmet on." 
</P>
<P>
 Reeves said the boy was an excellent student with a great smile who liked to 
participate in class. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher played the trumpet in the school band, and the band members plan 
to honor him in school today with a 21-trumpet salute, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors include his mother Marion Cole and an older brother. Funeral 
arrangements are being made at Charles Carroll Funeral Home in Ventura.

A SHINING MOMENT; AFTER 27 YEARS, OXNARD MAN HONORED FOR VIETNAM HEROISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Paul Calcaterra is now officially a hero. 
</P>
<P>
 After waiting more than 27 years, the former U.S. Army private was awarded the 
Silver Star Thursday during a red-carpet ceremony at Point Mugu near Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Calcaterra, 48, was honored for his bravery during the Vietnam War when he 
sneaked into a Viet Cong underground cave to survey the medical supplies and 
weapons stored there. 
</P>
<P>
 Another soldier had been killed the previous day on a similar assignment, but 
Calcaterra, then 21, volunteered for the mission anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was cocky and proud of it," Calcaterra said. "But I was also trained by the 
best. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd been in Vietnam nine months and I was very confident." 
</P>
<P>
 Calcaterra discovered a huge underground complex with six roads leading to 
storage areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I landed there, I realized it was a lot hairier than I expected," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I returned with reinforcements and we blew it to smithereens." 
</P>
<P>
 After the mission, Calcaterra's commanding officer, James T. Scott, said he 
would receive the Silver Star for his bravery, but the request was lost in the 
shuffle of military paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
 "What he did for us that day was a very brave thing," Scott said. "I'm sure 
that by his actions scores of American lives were saved." 
</P>
<P>
 Calcaterra left the war in 1968 after he was wounded by a grenade as he walked 
across a rice field. He was awarded a Purple Heart and discharged from the Army 
after serving three years. 
</P>
<P>
 He moved to Oxnard 20 years ago, married and had two children. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, he saw his former commanding officer interviewed on "Good 
Morning, America" during the Persian Gulf War. The sighting triggered the 
Vietnam memory and Calcaterra, prompted by friends, wrote a letter to Scott, 
now a lieutenant general. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't do it when I came back from the war because I figured the last thing 
the people in Vietnam needed to worry about was a silly medal," he said. "Then 
the war went on so long and I never asked about it. I'd thought about it on and 
off, but I never did anything about it." 
</P>
<P>
 At Thursday's ceremony, Scott and Calcaterra met again for the first time 
since 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's shown exceptional humility in waiting this long to set the record 
straight," Scott said. "Paul was one of the dedicated, determined soldiers who 
did their jobs in the most belying set of circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 Calcaterra, who works as a claims officer for the Veterans Administration, 
whispered nervously to his wife, Corine, during the ceremony. Afterward, he 
dropped the star twice before his wife helped pin it to his blazer. 
</P>
<P>
 Calcaterra said the tardiness of the award doesn't diminish its importance. 
</P>
<P>
 "This means so much more to me today because 24 years ago people didn't care 
about Vietnam vets," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Calcaterra said seeing Scott again was also an honor. 
</P>
<P>
 "After one battle, I remember, we'd been mauled pretty badly and had lost a 
lot of soldiers, a lot of friends," he said. "Our morale was down. It was 
monsoon season and we had to sleep in the mud. We were up to our knees in mud. 
The first thing he did was issue air mattresses to everyone. It just restored 
our dignity to know that this guy cared about us." 
</P>
<P>
 Another time, Scott scored ice cream for the troops. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how he did it, but he did," Calcaterra said. "He's a very good 
man. He cares about his soldiers and always puts them first."

A 'FRIDAY NIGHT AT THE GYM' OFFERS ALTERNATIVE TO STREETS; RECREATION: CENTER 
IN OXNARD WILL OPEN FROM 9 P.M. TO MIDNIGHT IN AN ATTEMPT TO GIVE TEEN-AGERS A 
SAFE GATHERING PLACE. 
</P>

 Youths eager to shoot baskets or spike volleyballs on Friday nights instead of 
idling aimlessly in the streets of Oxnard can now look for action under the 
lights of the Colonia Gym. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting tonight, the gym's doors will open from 9 p.m. to midnight every 
Friday, hosting volleyball and basketball matches, dances, and workshops on 
topics such as drugs, gangs and AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers will also provide music and food -- all free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of kids out on the streets, especially on weekends," said 
Oxnard Recreation Coordinator Alex Flores. "The kids complain that they have 
nowhere to go, nothing to do. This is a good place for kids to gather." 
</P>
<P>
 Once word gets around about "Friday Night at the Gym," as the program is 
called, 50 to 60 high-school age youths are expected to attend every week, 
Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
 If Friday nights are successful, organizers plan to extend the Marquita Street 
gym's hours to 2 a.m. and open the facility on Saturday nights as well. And 
similar late-night programs may soon crop up at Santa Clara and Hueneme high 
schools, Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday Night at the Gym is sponsored by Oxnard's Recreation and Community 
Services Department and the Colonia Coalition on Alcohol and Other Drug Issues, 
a consortium of community activists and agencies. The program at Colonia Gym is 
expected to cost the city $3,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Coalition participants include the Oxnard Police Department, Ventura Alcohol 
and Drug Programs, El Concilio del Condado de Ventura and the Oxnard Housing 
Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard recreation officials, along with the California Beach Volleyball Assn. 
and Friday Night Live, an anti-drunk driving group, formulated a set of 
activities to draw high school students to the gym and away from mischief. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of basketball competition out here," said 14-year-old Felipe 
Lopez, who was looking to work on his game tonight. "A lot of people will go."  
</P>
<P>
 Midnight basketball and other late-night crime prevention programs became a 
symbol of liberal excess for critics of Clinton's Crime Bill, which the 
President signed into law earlier this month. But the programs were widely 
lauded by law enforcement agencies as an effective way to keep bored teen-agers 
from straying to the wrong side of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Recreation Supt. Karen Burnham said Oxnard officials considered 
late-night crime prevention programs long before the nationwide midnight 
basketball debate, and did not let it affect their plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've talked about this for awhile," she said. "Now we're going to give it a 
try." 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Reyes, a volleyball coach at Hueneme High, plans to go to the gym and 
school players on the fine points of the game. Flores, who coaches women's 
hoops at Oxnard College, said he'll do the same for basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 By and large, however, volunteers to help oversee late-night recreation events 
are tough to find. Organizers are still trying to coax firefighters, police and 
probation officers into spending some nights at the Colonia Gym. 
</P>
<P>
 But getting kids to go will be a cinch, Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know the kids in the area, and they'll take advantage of this," he said. 
"I anticipate a lot of female participation as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Playing Foosball at the Colonia Recreation Center Thursday, 18-year-old Arturo 
Campos said many youths in the Colonia neighborhood used to loiter around the 
gym after it closed because they had nowhere to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now they can hang a little longer," Campos said. "Some kids would stay all 
night if they could."

LOSER IN SCHOOLS CHIEF ELECTION FILES CLAIM OVER LOSS OF JOB; COURTS: DAN 
FLYNN, WHO LOST A JUNE BID FOR COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT'S POSITION, SAYS FIRING 
WAS POLITICALLY MOTIVATED. HE LAUNCHES A $3-MILLION ACTION. 
</P>

<P>
 A former principal who was fired after challenging county schools chief 
Charles Weis in the June election has filed a claim for more than $3 million in 
damages against Weis and the Ventura County Board of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 As the first step toward a lawsuit, Dan Flynn's legal claim demands $3 million 
from the county schools office and an unspecified amount from Weis as punitive 
damages for the July 1 firing. 
</P>
<P>
 Weis and the county board will consider the claim in closed session Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Weis said Thursday he will recommend the board reject the claim, even if 
Flynn follows through on his threat to sue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're certainly not going to pay the claim, I don't think," Weis said. "So, 
yes, I think we'll go to court. I think the claim is frivolous." 
</P>
<P>
 Weis effectively fired Flynn by refusing to renew Flynn's contract as 
principal of the three county schools for juvenile offenders who are in jail or 
on probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn had held the $62,000-a-year job for three years. His firing came just 
three weeks after he lost his bid for Weis' job, sparking charges by Flynn and 
some of his supporters that the action was politically motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 But Weis has maintained that Flynn's dismissal was solely a result of poor job 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Since July 7, Flynn has held a temporary job as an administrator for the Los 
Angeles County Education Office in Downey, where he had worked previously. 
</P>
<P>
 The position pays $5,600 per month -- $433 more per month than Flynn earned as 
a principal in Ventura County. But the job has no medical insurance or other 
benefits, Flynn said, and it ends Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 "As of next Friday, I'll be unemployed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn said he has interviewed for other permanent positions. But he said his 
job search has been difficult, in part because school officials in Ventura 
County who are potential employers know of the controversy surrounding his 
dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Flynn said he is eager to settle the legal action against the 
district, he said one advantage in taking the matter to court is the 
opportunity to clear his name. 
</P>
<P>
 Weis said he would prefer that the district not waste time and money on a 
trial. But he also said he would welcome the opportunity to open Flynn's 
personnel records in court to show the firing was justified. 
</P>
<P>
 Weis has kept those records closed and withheld detailed comment on the 
reasons for the dismissal, in keeping with privacy laws.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; VENTURA COUNTY TEACHER OF THE YEAR HONORED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A kindergarten teacher at Ventura's Montalvo School was named the county's 
teacher of the year Thursday for her work with bilingual children and success 
at bringing parents into the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Peinado, 38, was chosen for the award after being nominated by the 
parents of her students and the Ventura Unified School District. She will now 
be considered for California Teacher of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Peinado learned of her award after Montalvo School Principal 
Marie Atmore asked for her help in another classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 When Peinado entered the room, a class of her former students shouted 
"congratulations," and an official with the Ventura County superintendent of 
schools office handed her a dozen roses. 
</P>
<P>
 "No. I didn't win. No way," Peinado shouted, then reached to hug the children, 
now in first grade. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expected to walk in and find one of my former students on the floor 
crying," she said later. 
</P>
<P>
 Atmore said Peinado's biggest accomplishment at Montalvo has been getting 
Spanish-speaking parents to spend time at home helping with their children's 
schoolwork. 
</P>
<P>
 In Peinado's classroom, a sign reading "Parents Make the Difference," makes 
that priority clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, Peinado said, the hardest part is teaching the parents how to teach. If 
the parents have not finished school themselves, they may be shy about 
encouraging their children. Or they may think they don't have the time, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say, 'I can't read a story at night because I'm busy,' " Peinado said. 
"I don't buy that. If you have two kids you need to have time for two kids. If 
you have eight kids, you better have time for eight kids," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stella Brown, whose 7-year-old daughter attends Montalvo, said Peinado's 
enthusiasm for her job and concern for her students is contagious. 
</P>
<P>
 "She not only teaches them academics, but she teaches them to love and care 
for each other," Brown said. "I have two jobs and I didn't want to get involved 
in the school. Now I'm the first vice president for the PTA in charge of fund 
raising." 
</P>
<P>
 A teacher for the past 14 years, Peinado said she prefers to work with 
minority students whose families may be poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Peinado did not learn Spanish until she was in high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I seem to always be for the underdog," she said. "I don't think everybody 
wants to teach these kids and they deserve just as much of an education as 
anyone in this country." 
</P>
<P>
 Peinado said she had planned to be a nurse like her mother and two sisters. 
But she changed her mind during her senior year in high school when she worked 
part time as a preschool teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 She went on to earn her teaching credential, followed by a bachelor's degree 
in Spanish from UC Santa Barbara. Later, she returned to Cal Lutheran to earn a 
master's degree in education. JULIE FIELDS

<P>
 A 17-year-old El Rio boy was arrested Thursday for allegedly robbing a man at 
gunpoint, stealing his car and stripping parts from the vehicle, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident began about 11:15 a.m. when the youth approached Jesus Ahumada, 
22, of Nyeland Acres and asked him for a ride.Once in the car with Ahumada, 
with whom the youth was previously acquainted, the suspect jammed a gun against 
Ahumada's ribs and ordered him to drive to Simi Valley, Ventura County 
sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect then changed his mind, took $33 from Ahumada and ordered him out 
of the car. Ahumada returned to his home and called for help. 
</P>
<P>
 When deputies went to the youth's home in El Rio, the boy ran to a nearby 
home, where he was found hiding in a closet. He was arrested after deputies 
subdued him with pepper spray. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahumada's car was found later in Nyeland Acres. It had been stripped of its 
stereo, amplifier, speakers and wheels.  
</P>
<P>
 Through the investigation, deputies also identified and arrested a second 
suspect for his alleged role in the thefts. Fernando Candido, 18, of El Rio was 
arrested and booked into Ventura County Jail on suspicion of possessing stolen 
property. JULIE FIELDS

 A Nyeland Acres man accused of slaying his roommate after the two disagreed 
over the brand of beer the defendant brought home pleaded not guilty Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Allan L. Steele set a Nov. 28 trial for Miguel Garibaldi, 
38. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say Garibaldi and 31-year-old Jose Jesus Arrendondo-Sanchez argued 
Aug. 5 after Garibaldi brought home Natural Light beer by Anheuser-Busch. 
Arrendondo-Sanchez, who paid for the beer, wanted Michelob and poured the 
Natural Light down the kitchen sink. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrendondo-Sanchez was stabbed during an argument in the kitchen, prosecutors 
said. DWAYNE BRAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; PARKING ENFORCEMENT OFFICER HURT IN CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A civilian parking enforcement officer was in good condition Thursday at a 
Ventura hospital after an accident in which her three-wheeled scooter 
overturned and skidded for 75 feet on its side, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rene Richards, 36, suffered moderate injuries when the left tire of her 
800-pound parking vehicle struck the median of westbound Telephone Road between 
Petit and Utica avenues at about 1 p.m. Wednesday, Ventura Police Cpl.John 
Turner said. He said she was driving below the speed limit.  
</P>
<P>
 The scooter, one of the department's three new vehicles that replaced their 
lighter, less stable predecessors, turned onto its right side after hitting the 
curb and caused injuries to Richards' right shoulder and hand, Turner said. She 
was wearing her seat belt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her injuries would have been greatly exaggerated if she had been in (one of 
the lighter vehicles)," Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
 The scooter, estimated to cost about $6,000, was totaled, police said. The 
cause of the accident was under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Richards' husband, Ventura Police Officer Jack Richards, is involved with the 
D.A.R.E. drug education program, Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner, who has been in the traffic division since 1988, said he could not 
recall a similar accident involving a parking enforcement vehicle. GREG RIPPEE

 To keep children from being exposed to sexually explicit magazines at 
convenience stores, the Camarillo Planning Commission has proposed amending 
city codes to force shopkeepers to cover magazine racks holding the 
publications. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission approved the so-called blinder code on a 4-0 vote Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think is an appropriate action to take," Planning Commission Chairman Les 
Meredith said. "(The code) is a solution to a serious concern in the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 The change, which still must be adopted by the City Council, would not affect 
adult businesses in the city, officials said. J.E. MITCHELL

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; FATHER AND SON IN A CLASS ALL THEIR 
OWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Born into a family of educators, the last thing Doug Hedin wanted to do was 
become a schoolteacher. 
</P>
<P>
 But this month, the 26-year-old became the second Mr. Hedin in the Conejo 
Valley Unified School District's roster. Doug and his father, Ron Hedin, are 
the only father-and-son teachers in the Thousand Oaks school system. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Hedin embarked on his first year as a third-grade teacher at Park 
Oak Elementary School this month, while his dad started his 29th year as a 
science teacher at Thousand Oaks High School. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was 18, I said, 'I never want to do this,' " the younger Hedin said 
Thursday, seated uncomfortably in an elementary-size chair in his classroom. "I 
wanted to do something different." 
</P>
<P>
 Like his dad, young Hedin toyed with the idea of becoming a farmer -- then a 
scuba diver and a firefighter. But after working for a year at the private 
school where his mother was a first-grade teacher, Doug finally discovered his 
true calling. "I love it," he said of teaching. "I can't get enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he didn't push his son, the senior Hedin said he was pleased with his 
son's decision. "It pleased me because he would be in a steady job," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said they did not know the familial relation when they 
hired Doug this year, but were later thrilled to learn of the generational 
link. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is sort of like history repeating itself," said Leean Nemeroff, assistant 
superintendent of personnel services for the school district. "It is neat to me 
that we have this person who did the modeling and now we are benefiting from 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the fact that they have chosen the same profession in the same school 
district, the Hedins see themselves as very different teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes two different kinds of people," the senior Hedin said.

 The son enjoys his vibrant third-grade classroom and the banter with his young

environment of his science room where he teaches three courses of advanced 
biology.

 "I think we are both disciplinarians and we are both pushers," the elder Hedin

 But mostly, the Hedins enjoy watching their students learn. "Seeing the light 
bulbs go on when they understand something," the younger Hedin said, "that is 
the most rewarding thing." TRACY WILSON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: AHMANSON RANCH; LAS VIRGENES ROAD PLAN DENIAL 
APPEALED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ahmanson Ranch developers are asking the Calabasas City Council to throw out a 
Planning Commission decision and allow the firm to extend Las Virgenes Road to 
the Ventura County line. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council is scheduled to vote on Ahmanson Land Co.'s request Oct. 5 , 
following a public hearing at City Hall at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Planning Commission ruled Sept. 8 that the firm's application was 
incomplete, and denied the request to extend the road about 15 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson Land Co. wants to build 3,050 homes, two golf courses and 400,000 
square feet of commercial space in a hilly area southeast of Simi Valley near 
the Los Angeles County border. Las Virgenes Road would be part of a major road 
system to the development. 
</P>
<P>
 All the hearings to date have centered on technical issues, not whether the 
development would be good for Calabasas, said Steve Quintanilla, the city's 
deputy city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Planning Commission hearing and City Council hearing are not looking at 
the merits of the projects," he said. "We are just looking at whether the 
application is complete. Once the application is deemed complete, it will go 
through the regular review process." 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Bob Hill said this week that the city has "a fairly strict 
policy on how we review things." 
</P>
<P>
 "I can only speak for me, but if the facts are found to be accurate, according 
to the policies that we review applications on, it might well be that the 
Planning Commission's vote will stand," Hill said. FRANK MANNING

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; MAN PLEADS GUILTY IN 2 ATTEMPTED 
RAPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A Newbury Park man pleaded guilty Thursday in the attempted rapes of two 
elderly Thousand Oaks women in May. 
</P>
<P>
 David Paul Stewart will face 8 1/4 years in prison at his scheduled Oct. 28 
sentencing, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart, 33, entered guilty pleas in Ventura County Superior Court to two 
counts of assault with the intent to commit rape. He had entered a plea of not 
guilty by reason of insanity on Sept. 1. The victims are 87 and 73. 
</P>
<P>
 At a June 30 preliminary hearing, the older victim said she fought Stewart off 
by hitting him repeatedly with a telephone after he broke into her apartment. 
The 73-year-old woman said the defendant broke into her apartment and came into 
her bedroom about 2:30 a.m., touched her and tried to kiss her. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Stewart was still in the apartment building when they arrived. A 
Ventura County sheriff's detective testified that a drunken Stewart had been 
spotted at a local bowling alley several hours before the attacks on the women, 
and that he had been making advances at other women and offered one money to 
have sex with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Patrice D. Koenig said the victims did not want to have to 
testify at trial. DWAYNE BRAY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; KANE ADVISES AGAINST SLOW-GROWTH PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trying to avoid a costly lawsuit, the Moorpark city attorney has warned the 
City Council against adopting a strict new growth-control ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty.Cheryl Kane on Wednesday advised council members that a recent court 
case indicates the city's slow-growth measure under consideration may be 
legally indefensible. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second time in as many months that the council has heard warnings 
about legal troubles if it adopts the new ordinance, which would replace the 
existing growth-control law -- Measure F -- when it expires at the end of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, a building industry group threatened the city with a lawsuit if the 
council approves the proposed ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Oceanside recently lost a six-year legal battle over a similar 
slow-growth law. Oceanside spent $2 million trying to fight off a legal 
challenge made by the Building Industry Assn. of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointing to the Oceanside case, representatives from the BIA told the Moorpark 
City Council in August that city officials would lose a legal challenge against 
the slow-growth ordinance if it is adopted.  
</P>
<P>
 At Wednesday night's meeting, Kane told council members that the legal opinion 
in the Oceanside case could set a precedent for other cases. Although the 
California Supreme Court is considering hearing an appeal of the ruling, Kane 
said the case points out many weaknesses in the legal standing of Moorpark's 
potential ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 Several council members said that in light of the new decision, they would 
consider backing away from the proposed slow-growth law. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe we need a different approach," said Mayor Paul Lawrason. "I don't 
support spending public funds defending legislation that I find suspect in the 
first place." SCOTT HADLY

MOORPARK AIMS TO STILL WORM, STENCH WORRIES; COMPOST: OFFICIALS WILL INTERVENE 
IN DISPUTE BETWEEN NEIGHBORS WHO COMPLAIN OF ODOR AND FIRM THAT USES CREATURES 
TO RECYCLE GREEN WASTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 City officials in Moorpark are stepping into a fight between a company that 
uses worms to convert lawn and garden clippings into fertilizer and the 
company's neighbors who complain that the piles of compost the worms are eating 
give off an unbearable stink. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the company, The Worm Concern, is outside Moorpark's city limits, 
city officials have decided to help settle the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's neighbors have complained vociferously to county environmental 
health officials about the smell, dust and noise coming from the 24-acre 
facility off Tierra Rejada Road in Simi Valley. Many neighbors want the 
operation moved. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaints, along with a letter from Moorpark's planning director, led the 
county to request that The Worm Concern prepare an expensive Environmental 
Impact Report that the company says could put it out of business.  
</P>
<P>
 Now the Moorpark City Council wants to send a new letter to the county, asking 
county officials to address the neighboring property owners' complaints without 
requiring a full environmental impact report of The Worm Concern's operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would like to redraft a letter," said City Councilman Scott Montgomery, 
who also serves as chairman of the county's Waste Commission. "Worm Concern's 
existence is critical to the cities of Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks and 
Moorpark."  
</P>
<P>
 State law requires that cities reduce the amount of trash they send to area 
landfills by 25% by 1995 and by 50% by 2000. Because green waste, or trash from 
lawn and garden clippings, makes up as much as 30% of the trash that is sent to 
landfills, recycling that waste would go a long way toward helping cities meet 
the state deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
 The Worm Concern accepts about 100 tons of green waste a day, much of it 
coming from a curbside recycling program in Simi Valley. The company plans to 
bring in as much as 350 tons a day when similar programs in Thousand Oaks and 
Moorpark begin.  
</P>
<P>
 Though Montgomery said he hoped to keep the company in business, he also said 
that The Worm Concern should fully address the residents' complaints. He said 
he will be talking both to property owners and company officials to look for 
some middle ground. He said he would like them to come up with an agreement 
before the county requires that a full environmental report be done. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to be able to work out some sort of compromise between the two 
sides," Montgomery said. "I can tell you it is not an easy problem to solve. 
It's very delicate right now. There's a real chance that this will fail." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery said one compromise would be to conduct a less extensive review of 
the operation and allow the county to approve a permit if the odor, dust and 
noise problems are adequately addressed. But area property owners do not seem 
eager to compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's damn right, we want them to move," said Glenn Reiser, an Oxnard 
attorney representing Elvenstar Farm, a riding stable that sits about 1,000 
feet from the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a whole plethora of impacts that the farm has had to endure," Reiser 
said. "A stink permeates the area 24 hours a day, there's noise, dust . . . and 
rats." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Morhar, president of The Worm Concern, said the company fell behind in 
processing the waste and allowed about six months of the material to pile up, 
which contributed to the smell. But a new grinder installed on the facility is 
already cutting into the load of material and the smell has almost been 
eliminated, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Morhar said most of the stink that residents have complained about lately is 
coming from the decaying bodies of four dead cows that were dumped by a rancher 
near the property. Morhar said the environmental impacts from The Worm Concern 
are no different from many of the ranches in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "The smell is no worse than their horse manure," Morhar said. "Look, we want 
to be good neighbors. We've made some mistakes, but I think (Elvenstar) is just 
looking for anything to throw at us. They don't want us there. I hope we can 
work something out though." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the county Environmental Report Review Committee will decide 
whether Morhar will have to conduct a full environmental impact review. County 
officials have said that unless Morhar can present new information that will 
address their concerns, they will push for the full report. If it is required, 
Morhar said, he will appeal the decision to the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Vicky Howard, who visited some of The Worm Concern's neighbors this 
week, said the company has a lot of work to do to convince her that a full 
environmental report should not be required. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to recycle green waste," Howard said. "But it can't be at the expense 
of the health or environment of the people who live near there."

THE OAKS MALL CINEMA CLOSING FOR 2-MONTH RENOVATION; ENTERTAINMENT: NEARBY 
MERCHANTS EXPECT A SLIGHT DECLINE IN BUSINESS WHILE THE MULTIPLEX SHUTS DOWN 
FOR ITS FACE LIFT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Teen-age pals Dusty Benedix and John Sanker huddled over the popcorn counter 
in The Oaks mall movie theater and conferred with their buddy, concession 
vendor Joe Grayshock. 
</P>
<P>
 They had just learned that the six-screen United Artists theater, with its 
orange-and-red swirled carpet and textured beige wallpaper, would be closed for 
a two-month renovation starting Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 That meant Joe would be out of a job. Thousand Oaks would be out its sole 
multiplex cinema. And, most pressing at the moment, Dusty and John would be out 
of their favorite after-school hangout. 
</P>
<P>
 "We come here every day, we got friends who work here, we're mall rats," Dusty 
explained in a single breath. "They don't need to renovate this place. It's got 
its own little atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
 But that atmosphere, like the movie theater, is about 16 years old. "Look at 
that wallpaper man," Joe said, snickering from behind the glass counter. "It's 
so '70s. When they redo it, it's gonna be really nice." 
</P>
<P>
 United Artists executives could not be reached for comment on their renovation 
plans. Employees at The Oaks theater, however, said the six screens would be 
wired to high-tech sound systems, the decor would be spruced up, and the cinema 
would be made more accessible to wheelchair users. They expect the theater to 
reopen on Nov. 18, just in time for the Thanksgiving holiday rush. 
</P>
<P>
 During the hiatus, Thousand Oaks will boast only four screens: two at the 
Conejo Mann theater in the Janss Mall, and two at the independent Melody on 
Moorpark Road. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, just outside the city, movie theaters in Agoura Hills, Simi Valley 
and Camarillo will offer considerable variety. But some patrons said they would 
miss their hometown cinema. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they should touch this place," Thousand Oaks resident Chris 
Franz said indignantly, as he paused to check out the movie posters by the 
ticket booth. "If they're closing it down for two months, that'll really put a 
damper on things." 
</P>
<P>
 Dismissing the need for renovations, Franz added firmly: "I don't care if my 
seat rocks or shakes or whatever. I just want to be able to see the movie." 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo resident Catherine Hopkins, who takes in a movie at The Oaks at 
least twice a month, agreed: "It looks fine to me," she said. "As long as the 
floor's clean, that's all that matters." 
</P>
<P>
 If Franz and Hopkins will miss the theater, The Oaks mall merchants will 
surely miss them -- and the hundreds of other patrons who cruise by their shops 
on the way to the movies each week. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners of two mall restaurants, Olga's Kitchen and Sweeney's, said they 
usually draw about 10% of their evening business from movie-goers stopping by 
for a quick bite before the show. So both said they expected profits to dip 
slightly during the theater's closure. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Business at the mall has been so good, however, that neither restaurant 
manager expressed much concern. They predicted that the renovations will help 
the theater better woo patrons -- hopefully, hungry patrons. 
</P>
<P>
 "A little setback will be worthwhile as long as we can keep those feet coming 
into the mall sometime or other," restaurateur Bud Sweeney said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oaks' general manager, Barbara Teuscher, agreed that the movie theater was 
"past due for a renovation." Although some food vendors might suffer losses, 
she expects the theater's temporary shut-down to have little overall impact on 
mall revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess we'll find out soon how much of an impact it will have," Teuscher 
said. "But really, sales have been so phenomenally good lately that it's hard 
for me to imagine any (profits) going down."

YOUTH'S PROTEST SUITS HIM TO A T; SCHOOLS: SIMI VALLEY TEEN-AGER WEARS 
PATRIOTIC-THEMED SHIRTS IN A PERSONAL CHALLENGE OF SCHOOL'S DRESS CODE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Fourteen-year-old John Spindler does not see himself as a rebel. 
</P>
<P>
 But after learning this summer that his junior high school was adopting a 
strict new dress code, the Simi Valley teen-ager became determined to fight the 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 So wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the U.S. flag, John arrived for classes 
at Valley View Junior High School Thursday, only to be sent home for the third 
time in two weeks for violating the school's dress code. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth purchased three patriotic T-shirts bearing various American symbols 
before school started, knowing Valley View's new policy forbids shirts adorned 
with writing or pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 The ninth-grader's protest is a direct challenge to the school's tougher dress 
code, passed last spring in an attempt to curb campus violence after the fatal 
stabbing of a Valley View student in February. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some students at the junior high school have applauded John's defiance; others 
think his actions are foolish. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is good that somebody is standing up to the dress code," eighth-grader 
Cori Lee said. She said she objects to the school dictating fashion on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he is stupid," said ninth-grader Heather Terry. "The dress code was 
made so when he comes to school each day, his life is not in danger." 
</P>
<P>
 School officials say the policy makes the campus safer by banning gang-related 
attire and promoting a more professional learning environment. 
</P>
<P>
 But John believes the policy infringes upon his constitutional right to free 
speech. "It is against the First Amendment," he said. "You should be able to 
wear an American flag shirt." 
</P>
<P>
 John's mother, Ellen, fully backs her son's protest. "My husband is a Vietnam 
veteran and if our son cannot wear an American flag shirt, this has become a 
really sad state," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spindlers recently contacted the American Civil Liberties Union, and a 
private attorney, about their fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very, very actively reviewing this case in Simi Valley," ACLU 
spokesman Allan Parachini said. "We have been in touch with the family and we 
are aware of the situation. Obviously there have been issues of free speech 
over the American flag," Parachini said. "Whether this fits that pattern 
remains to be seen." 
</P>
<P>
 Parachini said the civil rights group will make a decision about the case 
within a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Simi Valley school board member Debbie Sandland said she intends to 
bring the dress code up for discussion at a future board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very concerned about it," Sandland said Thursday. "Everything I've read 
about dress codes says it has to be related to safety and health and it has to 
be reasonable. And I don't consider barring a kid with an American flag T-shirt 
reasonable." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, John said he plans to go to school every day in the T-shirt 
of his choice, hoping that school officials will eventually yield. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am going to continue to protest it," he said, even if it means being barred 
from his classes. "I just want to have everyone's rights back and my rights 
back."

DISPATCHERS GIVE AID TO STRICKEN COLLEAGUE; SIMI VALLEY: DRIVE RAISES $25,045 
FOR LYNN FROBISHER, WHO HAS TERMINAL CANCER. DONATIONS ARE BRAINCHILD OF FELLOW 
WORKERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lynn Frobisher has spent much of her working life -- as a policewoman and now 
as a Simi Valley police dispatcher -- helping total strangers in life-or-death 
crises. 
</P>
<P>
 Now she is terminally ill with cancer. And scores of people, including many 
city workers who are strangers to her, have pooled $31,719.52 to help her in 
the final months of her life. 
</P>
<P>
 Frobisher, 47, is to receive a $25,045.01 check today. The balance from a 
donation drive among city workers went to taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no words to describe how it feels," said the Simi Valley woman, a 
divorced mother of two teen-agers who has spent about 13 years with the Simi 
Valley Police Department. "I've always been the type who's tried to help 
others. It's been hard for me to accept help. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what to say, other than 'Thank you.' But those are small, small 
words." 
</P>
<P>
 The donation drive, the brainchild of Frobisher's fellow dispatchers, began 
Sept. 13. That was the same day that Frobisher's doctor told her she might have 
just one to three months to live because of liver cancer, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, 180 employees of the Police Department and other city agencies 
have pledged to give up 1,537 hours of vacation or sick time to help Frobisher 
defray her living expenses, Assistant City Manager Mike Sedell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the donations came in the first three days of the drive and nearly all 
of them involved at least a day of sacrificed vacation time, communications 
supervisor Lynn Freeman said. One person gave a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was symbolic to give time, because she doesn't have much time," Freeman 
said. "There was no hesititation. People were charitable, more than we'd 
expected. . . . . It was just heart-warming to see so many people pull together 
and help."

 Frobisher, described by colleagues as a diligent worker, said she has tried to 
continue working without complaint since doctors diagnosed the liver and colon 
cancer in late February, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, 1993, her colon was removed. Radiation and chemotherapy treatments 
followed, but doctors told her in July that she had a third cancer, a rectal 
tumor, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Dr. Hany R. Kahili told her last week that her liver cancer might give 
her as little as a month to live, she was stunned. 
</P>
<P>
 "It still doesn't seem true," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But her line of work -- so often involving the trials and tragedies of others 
-- has given her a perspective that others might lack, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a couple of months before, she recalled Thursday, she and fellow 
dispatcher Kathy Gott handled a call involving a baby who apparently fell 
victim to sudden infant death syndrome. When a police officer later told them 
the baby had died, they both cried, Frobisher said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just unfortunate that it was the baby's time to go," she said. "But it 
was his turn." 
</P>
<P>
 With her own death now nearing, she added, "I wonder why, why me? Why couldn't 
it be someone else? But, well, it's my time. There's got to be a reason. I just 
don't know what it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Frobisher, who was divorced from her third husband in January, said she plans 
to use the donated money for rent, utilities, groceries and other expenses not 
covered by her state disability income benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she also plans to use some of the money for tuition for her daughter, 
19-year-old Jennifer Walker, who attends the Bryan College of Court Reporting 
in Los Angeles. Her son, Richard Walker, 17, attends Simi Valley High School.

SAUGUS GETS THROWN FOR A 23-0 LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saugus High had the third-stingiest defense among Southern Section teams in 
the Valley area. Loyola had allowed only 14 points in its first two games. 
</P>
<P>
 Something had to give when these unbeaten teams met Thursday night at Canyon 
High. The Saugus defensive backfield gave -- generously -- in a 23-0 rout by 
the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola quarterback Kyle Spielbuhler threw three long touchdown passes against 
a Centurion defense that refused to bend against the rush but was short-handed 
in the secondary without injured cornerbacks Mark Beatty and Jeff D'Amico. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no excuses, though," Saugus Coach Jack Bowman said. "We blew three 
coverages." 
</P>
<P>
 The three touchdowns, plus a safety, all came in the first half. The 
Centurions (2-1), despite holding the Cubs to 100 yards rushing in 30 attempts 
(22 yards in the first half), couldn't stop Spielbuhler and his receiving 
corps. 
</P>
<P>
 The Loyola quarterback completed 11 of 13 passes for 194 yards. Midway through 
the first quarter, Spielbuhler hit Dan Farmer on a fade pattern. Farmer, 
6-feet-4, 200 pounds, blew past 5-8, 156-pound cornerback Pat Rafter for a 
36-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cubs made it 9-0 when Brandon Alvarado's punt was blocked in the end zone 
by Loyola's Soren Solari. Centurion Mark Pecaro recovered for the safety. 
</P>
<P>
 After the free kick, Loyola marched 66 yards in five plays, scoring on a 
42-yard pass play from Spielbuhler to Patrick Klein for a 16-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think one of our strengths is our wideouts," Loyola Coach Steve Grady said. 
"They're tall, strong and good athletes." 
</P>
<P>
 Farmer, who had five receptions for 104 yards and two touchdowns, scored again 
when Loyola surprised the Centurions on a 46-yard pass play with 15 seconds 
left in the first half after lining up without a huddle. 
</P>
<P>
 No defender was within 15 yards of Farmer when he caught the ball along the 
left sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 Saugus quarterback Kevin Carrasco completed only seven of 23 passes for 66 
yards and was sacked four times. 
</P>
<P>
 STILL UNBEATEN: Nordhoff High improved to 3-0 with an 18-7 nonleague victory 
over St. Bonaventure. C10

JUNIOR COLLEGES / FALL PREVIEW; FOR MOST AREA TEAMS, A POSITIVE OUTLOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUE; IRENE GARCIA, ; JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some hope to repeat their success of last season and others will try to redeem 
themselves. Some will find budding stars within their ranks and others who were 
supposed to shine won't show much luster after all. 
</P>
<P>
 But there should be plenty of excitement when the area junior colleges start 
their conference seasons in several sports the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a rundown of how the teams shape up: CROSS-COUNTRY 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale, which finished fourth in the 1993 State championships, is expected 
to be the top men's team in the area. The Vaqueros are shooting for their sixth 
Western State Conference title in the last eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the top individual honors could go to three runners who did not 
compete last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Wilson of Moorpark was the runner-up in the 1991 Kinney national 
cross-country championships for Newbury Park High before running for Brigham 
Young during the 1992-93 school year. He was scheduled to begin his two-year 
mission last fall, but by the time he decided not to, Brigham Young had 
exhausted its scholarship money for the 1993-94 school year. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson returned home and enrolled at Moorpark last spring. He will run for the 
Raiders before starting his mission in January. 
</P>
<P>
 He says he has "no idea" what he wants to accomplish this season, but Moorpark 
Coach Manny Trevino said that a top-10 finish in the State championships is a 
reasonable goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacques Salsberg of Glendale and Manuel Perales of Antelope Valley also could 
reach that milestone. 
</P>
<P>
 Salsberg won the 1992 WSC title, but transferred to Pasadena City in the 
spring of 1993 and briefly attended Butler County (Kan.) College last fall 
before returning to Glendale for the spring semester. 
</P>
<P>
 He finished second behind Wilson in last week's Santa Monica Invitational and 
the two will renew their rivalry today in the first of three WSC meets this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Perales was academically ineligible last fall and was slowed by injuries 
during track season, but he opened the season with a second-place finish in the 
Fresno Invitational on Sept. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he stays healthy, he can finish among the top 15 at the State meet," 
Antelope Valley Coach Mark Covert said. "If he runs great, he can finish in the 
top 10." 
</P>
<P>
 The Glendale women's team finished third in last year's State meet, but a 
similar finish is unlikely. Only two of the top seven runners have returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Auria Roberto (12th in the State championships), Louise Lakier (55th) and Tina 
Santana (135th) were freshmen last season, but they did not return after 
Gretchen Lohr was not rehired as coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Marilyn Davis, a two-time NCAA All-American at California in the mid-1980s, 
has replaced Lohr. 
</P>
<P>
 With Glendale down, Antelope Valley might be the top team in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marauders have only one returning runner -- Melissa Tibbs -- from last 
year's team that finished 18th in the State championships. But sophomore Joanna 
Potillo -- a transfer from Glendale -- and freshman Nicole Martin should give 
them a decent chance at winning their third consecutive Foothill Conference 
title. WOMEN'S GOLF 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, women's golf will be part of junior college athletics in 
California. Until now, women played on men's teams -- and shot from the men's 
tees. But no longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all schools are fielding teams this season, but Mission College is. 
</P>
<P>
 The Free Spirit, coached by Terry Bommer, will play in the South Coast 
Conference and use Braemar Country Club in Tarzana as its home course. The 
six-woman team -- five play in each match and the best four scores count toward 
the team total -- won a five-team tournament in Palm Springs this month and won 
a four-team tournament in Walnut on Monday. Kumiko Iijima won the individual 
title at Walnut and finished second at Palm Springs. Her teammates are Cathy 
Gallegos-Kehoe, Creela Harris, Jill Blurton-Jones, Layne Burr and Mikel Alpert. 
</P>
<P>
 Bommer, who has coached the men's team at Mission for 11 seasons and won the 
state championship in 1984, said the women's team could be a strong contender 
for the state title. 
</P>
<P>
 "I keep telling them they could make history by being the first women's (golf) 
state champions," Bommer said. MEN'S SOCCER 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale, Mission, Moorpark and Oxnard will start play Oct. 11 in the six-team 
Western State Conference. Moorpark and Glendale probably have the best shot at 
challenging defending champion and preseason favorite Santa Barbara for the 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark, 8-4-5 overall and 6-2-2 in the WSC last year, features several 
outstanding freshmen, but has lost two top sophomores because of injuries in 
nonconference matches. Sixth-year Coach Frank Parodi is not discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once we get rolling, we'll definitely be in the (conference) race," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To do that, Parodi must find suitable replacements for strikers John Steinkemp 
and Kevin Nelson, both sidelined because of ankle injuries. Steinkemp, who 
played at Chaminade High and transferred from San Francisco State, had surgery 
to repair torn ligaments and is out for the season. Nelson is questionable 
because of a severe sprain. 
</P>
<P>
 Parodi will rely on freshmen Paul Dojo, Kenny Hickman and Curtis Silverest 
along with goalkeeper Sean Scanlon, who played for the Raiders in 1989. Dojo, a 
midfielder, helped Moorpark High to the Southern Section Division V 
co-championship with Calabasas High last season. Hickman, a sweeper from Simi 
Valley High, was the Marmonte League player of the year in 1993. Silverest is a 
center-forward from Moorpark High. 
</P>
<P>
 About 80 players tried out for Glendale's team, which is coached by Joe 
Agoston. The Vaqueros were 6-8-4 overall and 4-5-1 in the WSC in 1993 after 
winning the conference the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do have a lot of depth. It looks very promising," Agoston said. "But we 
have a long way to go. We have a lot of individual talent. Now we have to put 
that into a team concept." 
</P>
<P>
 Goalkeeper Eric Alvarado, sweeper Sal Rizzo, defender Edwin Sinecio and 
forward Simon Castro were ineligible last season, but they are now the team's 
backbone. 
</P>
<P>
 Several sophomores return to anchor Mission under second-year Coach Ali 
Moshirifard. 
</P>
<P>
 The Free Spirit was 4-8-1 overall and 3-6-1 in WSC play last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "The team is looking much better," he said. "Last year, we had a lot of 
first-time players who were recreational players. This year, we have a much 
better group to start with." 
</P>
<P>
 Goalie Chris Askew was all-conference last season. Forward Chris Swanson and 
midfielder Oscar Hernandez are other players Moshirifard is counting on. 
</P>
<P>
 At Oxnard, second-year Coach Jorge Brescia is working to improve a team that 
won only one of 16 matches and finished last in the WSC with a 0-9-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
 But with only three returners among 21 players, that will be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to build the team from zero again," Brescia said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brescia said some of the key freshmen include midfielder Victor Sanchez from 
Buena High and defenders Calvin Craig from Santa Clara High and David Smith 
from Oxnard High. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore sweeper Juan Luna, who played at Oxnard in 1992 but sat out last 
season, provides experience. WOMEN'S SOCCER 
</P>
<P>
 New Moorpark Coach Ken Dale, an assistant with the Pepperdine women's team 
last season and the boys' coach at Simi Valley High, is hoping that the veteran 
Raider players will solidify the squad. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark and Oxnard played in the South Coast Conference in 1993, but both 
join the newly formed Western State Conference this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of our returners learned some valuable lessons last year," Dale said. 
"I think we should have a much more successful season. All the players are very 
intelligent." 
</P>
<P>
 Dale said two newcomers, defender Kristi Hufford from Royal High and forward 
Vanessa Macen from Santa Clara High, are among the top players. WOMEN'S 
VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley lost every player from last year's team that went undefeated 
(18-0) in the Foothill Conference. The Marauders made it to the second round of 
the playoffs and finished with a 19-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's pretty unusual that they're all gone," Coach Jane Cwayna said. "We're 
very young and inexperienced." 
</P>
<P>
 The team's only sophomore is outside hitter Kerri Puckett, a transfer from 
Glendale College. Cheaza Figueroa will be one of the Marauders' top hitters, 
Cwayna said. Figueroa, the state high school triple-jump champion at Quartz 
Hill last year, began playing volleyball in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Left-hander Balecha Fletcher, also a Quartz Hill graduate, will play at 
outside hitter and Kari Siotta will start at setter. Stephanie Eubanks and 
Christina Love will split time at middle blocker. 
</P>
<P>
 The team's top back-row specialists are Jessie Noche, Pam Tusalem and Darci 
McKee. 
</P>
<P>
 At Glendale, the Vaqueros have a new coach, Alicia McKinnon, and only two 
returning players -- Elizabeth Hook and Vanessa Oliva -- from a team that was 
2-16 last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Lisa Sartoris, a Burroughs High graduate, figures to be the team's 
best hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Katie Bomar is the team's top back-row player and server. Freshman 
Tara Pfaff is a solid all-around player. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very short and very young," McKinnon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark probably will have one of the state's top setters in Gretchen 
Gulbranson, a transfer from Cal State Northridge who started for the Matadors 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Right-side hitter Tammy Vaillancourt is the only returning player from a team 
that finished 11-7 in 1993. Freshman Kelly Farner, a Camarillo High graduate, 
will play at middle blocker along with sophomore Dina Jacobellis, a transfer 
from Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
 Erica Mertes, All-City at Chatsworth High in 1993, will start at outside 
hitter. Dawn Smith, an L.A. Baptist graduate, also will play that position. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some weapons," Moorpark Coach Steve Burkhart said. "It's going to 
come down to how well we can play defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce has no home court because the school gym was condemned after the Jan. 
17 earthquake. The team conducted preseason practice on one of the school's 
grass fields and now trains at Taft High. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even now we only get the Taft gym four times a week so we have to practice on 
the grass once a week," said first-year Coach Turhan Douglas, who was a men's 
assistant at Santa Monica College last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been tough, and practicing on grass has not been good for the girls."  
</P>
<P>
 Opposite hitter Thuy-Van Le is the only player back from last year's team, 
which finished 11-8. Freshman Valery Vargas from Birmingham High will start at 
setter. 
</P>
<P>
 Michele Diana (Cleveland High) figures to be one of the Brahmas' top hitters. 
</P>
<P>
 A new coach, Miki McFadden, takes over at Ventura with a predominantly 
freshman team. Only two sophomores, middle blocker Sasha Wood and outside 
hitter Tobi Clarke, return for the Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates were the WSC champion in 1990 and '91, and finished third last 
year under Sharon McAlexander, who resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyons has two returning players from last year's 6-12 team. Sophomore Hollie 
Christina will start at middle blocker, Nicole Johnson at outside hitter.  
</P>
<P>
 Setter Laura Wagoner was All-Southern Section last year at Saugus High. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very inexperienced but we have real good chemistry," said first-year 
Coach Fred De La Vega, an assistant for the past five seasons. WATER POLO 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Ventura finished ninth in the state after going 23-11-1 overall 
and 6-2 in the WSC, two games behind champion Cuesta. 
</P>
<P>
 Third-year Coach Larry Baratte is expecting even bigger things from the 
Pirates this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have the most-talented team with the greatest depth in the history 
of Ventura College," Baratte said. "The type of players it takes to succeed at 
this level are here." 
</P>
<P>
 That includes Brazilian two-meter man Pedro DeLima, who led the state in 
scoring last season with a school-record 162 goals and was named All-American. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Brazilian, driver Alexandre Martins, leads the freshman class that 
also features Janko Gogolja -- a Croatian-born driver who was an All-American 
at Dos Pueblos High and had offers to play professionally in Italy -- and Andy 
Bruininga, an All-American driver at Royal High and the Marmonte League player 
of the year in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 At Valley, Coach Bill Krauss starts his 22nd season with an inexperienced team 
that might not do much better than the 1993 squad that finished 4-14 overall 
and 2-6 in the WSC. 
</P>
<P>
 "The prospects for next year are better," said Krauss, who has 15 freshmen on 
the 19-man roster. "I guess you could call it a rebuilding year." 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomores Erin Fish, a driver from Agoura High, and Juan Flores, a two-meter 
man from Marshall High, return. The top newcomers include Oscar Villagomez, a 
driver from Burroughs High; Mark Stenpiak, a Polish-born driver from Glendale 
High, and Sergick Amiryan, a goalie from Hoover High. WRESTLING 
</P>
<P>
 After winning four consecutive WSC championships, Moorpark slipped to second 
place last season behind Cuesta.  
</P>
<P>
 But Coach John Keever has another strong squad that will help the Raiders make 
a run at another title. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders, state champions in 1990 and '91, feature 13 returners and several 
talented newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
 The sophomores include John Jimenez in the 126-pound class and Dan Burdis in 
the 177-pound division. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimenez was 23-13 last season and placed fourth in the state tournament. 
Burdis was 18-18 and finished sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Also back are Kyle Plummer (17-17) in the 150-pound class, heavyweight Gabriel 
Godinez (19-18) and redshirt freshman Norman Toy from Westlake High in the 
118-pound division. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the freshmen are Tim Bonebright from Thousand Oaks High, fifth in the 
state at 145 pounds; Jose Brizuela, a City Section champion at 140 pounds from 
Monroe High; Jeremy Pratt, third place in the Southern Section at 145 pounds in

 Nordhoff High's backfield duo of Josh Hawkins and Dallan Rigby combined for 
125 yards in an 18-7 nonleague victory Thursday night over St. Bonaventure at 
Ventura High. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins rushed for 79 yards in 16 carries and scored on runs of one and eight 
yards. Rigby rushed for 59 yards in 12 carries and had a one-yard touchdown run 
in the first quarter, bringing Nordhoff (3-0) within a point of St. 
Bonaventure.

SIDELINES; VENTURA DEVELOPING A HEALTHY APPETITE FOR WINNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Guess who's coming to dinner tonight? 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura College football team. And, for the second week in a row, the 
players will eat for free. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Coach George Rosales picked up the tab, making good on his promise 
to treat defensive players to a steak dinner each time they post a shutout. 
</P>
<P>
 He had no reason to believe his promise was risky business. Ventura last 
season was 0-10 and allowed an average of 33.5 points a game. There were 
shutouts -- six of them -- but the Pirates were on the wrong end each time. 
</P>
<P>
 Times have changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura defeated West L.A., 38-0, in its opener two weeks ago. The defense 
cashed in the following Friday, eating at a restaurant owned by Charles 
(Buster) Davis, a former Pirate defensive end. The cost of feeding about 45 
players was $100 because Davis gave the coaches a significant discount. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Davis offered an even sweeter deal. For each victory, the entire Ventura 
team -- about 90 players -- could eat dinner for free. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those guys don't have a lot of money and a square meal is heavenly," said 
Davis, who played for the Pirates in 1968 and '69 and then transferred to Cal 
State Long Beach, where he was converted to a tight end. "I understand that, 
being a former player." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis' fortunes have changed since his playing days. Certainly, Ventura's have 
changed in Rosales' second season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates won again last week, defeating Antelope Valley, 20-12. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Davis has circled Nov. 12 on his calendar. That's the date Ventura plays 
host to Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 Isaiah Mustafa, Davis' stepson, is a wide receiver for the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Watch, listen, attack: Steve Copping is willing to lend a helping hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Just be careful how you grab it. 
</P>
<P>
 Copping has coached jujitsu at Harvard-Westlake High since he established the 
school's program in 1984. The team, which competes against other martial arts 
clubs, includes 30 students who specialize in one or more of jujitsu's 25 
sub-arts -- including judo, tai chi and meditation. 
</P>
<P>
 Copping is ranked fifth in the world by the World Council of Jujitsu 
Organizations. On Saturdays, he offers free martial arts workshops, from 9 a.m. 
to noon, at Harvard-Westlake's Studio City campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "People can watch, they can talk to instructors, they can work out," said 
Copping, who has been teaching for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Little big Manny: If Manny Marquez ever makes a game-winning kick for the Cal 
State Northridge football team, it will take only one teammate to hoist him up 
and carry him off the field. The freshman from Bishop Diego High in Santa 
Barbara is only 5-foot-2, 140 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Small, but mighty. Though he is second on the depth chart for conversion kicks 
and field-goal duties, Marquez already is the Matadors' top man for kickoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a very live and creditable leg," Burt said. "Corey Pavin hits a golf 
ball a long way. It's not always about size." 
</P>
<P>
 Showtime: The Saugus High football team battled touted Loyola on Thursday 
night, but this afternoon the Centurions will suit up again and play a mock 
game on their home field in front of a director and a motion-picture camera 
crew. 
</P>
<P>
 Saugus Coach Jack Bowman has no details about the project other than a Santa 
Clarita-based production company selected his team for an episode of a 
children's show called "V.R. Troopers." Stats  
</P>
<P>
 The Newbury Park High football team has won 21 consecutive games against 
Ventura County teams. Over that span, which started in the sixth week of the 
1991 season, the Panthers are 28-3 -- their losses coming against San Marcos, 
Agoura and Nogales. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the Panthers have won 16 in a row, including last year's 14-0 
Southern Section championship campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Catching on: With 11 more receptions, Brian Comer will become Valley College's 
all-time pass-catching leader. 
</P>
<P>
 The sophomore from Chatsworth High has 74 receptions, including 16 this season 
for 278 yards and three touchdowns. Rob Mattram had 84 receptions in the 1970 
and '71 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Grounded: Palmdale High's football team has scored only six points in two 
games, ineptitude that can directly be traced to the Falcons' running game -- 
or lack thereof. Palmdale has gained two yards in 37 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Falcons take heart. It could be worse. Palmdale's ground game is twice as 
productive as that of El Camino Real's, which has gained one yard. St. 
Genevieve, which has lost 10 yards, and Poly, which has lost 16, are in the 
hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Path of little resistance: The 352-yards rushing Di-Onte Smith accumulated for 
Grant against Marshall last Friday probably is a school record. 
</P>
<P>
 However, it is not even the most yardage Marshall has allowed in the past two 
seasons. Tennell Young, then a junior at Eagle Rock, rushed for 393 yards and 
five touchdowns in a 35-7 victory over Marshall last year. Things to Do  
</P>
<P>
 Today, 3 p.m., through Saturday, Ventura High and Ventura College swimming 
pools: Buena High plays host to a 16-team tournament featuring five of the top 
10 high school water polo teams in the Southern Section Division IV.

U.S. TROOPS MOVE TO DISARM HAITI'S MAIN MILITARY BASE; OCCUPATION: AMERICAN 
OFFICIALS, PRO-DEMOCRACY LEADERS MEET IN BID TO SET UP NEW GOVERNMENT. 
CLARIFIED RULES PERMIT FORCE TO HALT VIOLENCE AGAINST CIVILIANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As U.S. Special Forces troops occupied Haiti's only major military complex 
Thursday with the cooperation of Haitian soldiers, American officials began 
meeting with local pro-democracy leaders in an effort to swiftly re-establish 
an alternative government to the dictatorship that the Americans came to evict. 
</P>
<P>
 And while U.S. soldiers expanded their contact with the Haitian people, 
American military leaders sought to clarify the rules of engagement, stressing 
that U.S. troops will now be allowed to use force to stop attacks by the 
Haitian army and police against local civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said soldiers are being told to use their "best judgment" about 
when to use force, and stressed that the decision on whether to intervene is 
still up to commanders on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules of engagement became a source of controversy in the opening days of 
the Haiti operation after at least one Haitian was killed by local police near 
the port of the capital, Port-au-Prince, as U.S. troops guarding the 
installation looked on. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thursday, American soldiers received Haitian help as they began disarming 
Camp D'Application, known as Heavy Weapons Company. The site is Haiti's only 
major military complex, which includes its military academy, just outside 
Port-au-Prince. Throughout the day, the troops confiscated machine guns, 
mortars, small missiles and ammunition belts, while Bradley fighting vehicles 
were brought in to tow away larger artillery, armored vehicles and gun systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Haitian soldiers traveled side by side with Americans in trucks carrying away 
the munitions. Gen. Richard Potter, commander of the special forces, said his 
troops had occupied the complex without incident Wednesday afternoon, after 
meetings between U.S. and Haitian military leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Potter said the Haitian troops have been cooperative, adding: "But they don't 
have any choice, do they?" 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, U.S. officials said that Gen. David Meade, commander of the Army 
forces in Haiti, and U.S. Ambassador William L. Swing met with Haitian labor, 
business and civic leaders Thursday in an effort to explain the U.S. role here 
and speed the process of re-establishing democracy -- even though exiled 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide has not fully endorsed the agreement struck 
between the Clinton Administration and the Haitian rulers to restore him to 
power. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said they expect the democratically elected Aristide to return 
to Haiti by Oct. 15, the deadline by which army commander Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras 
has agreed to give up power. In the meantime, they said they hope to begin 
reinstalling democratically elected officials -- many of whom are in hiding or 
in exile -- before Aristide's return. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, U.S. Embassy spokesman Stanley Shrager said that the Americans 
hope to help Port-au-Prince's elected mayor, Evans Paul, return from hiding and 
resume his post as mayor of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Shrager added that as U.S. troops begin to move beyond Port-au-Prince into 
other towns and villages, pro-democracy leaders who have been in hiding will be 
reinstalled in those places as well. 
</P>
<P>
 And officials said the United States is also working to reassemble Haiti's 
Parliament as quickly as possible so it can vote on an amnesty agreement -- 
part of the accord negotiated last weekend -- that members of the military 
regime demanded before they will leave power. 
</P>
<P>
 The government of provisional President Emile Jonassaint said in a statement 
Thursday that it will formally ask Parliament to go into special session to 
pass the amnesty for crimes committed by the military and its supporters since 
the September, 1991, coup that overthrew Aristide. The Jonassaint government 
also said it will soon announce a timetable for the election of more than 2,000 
new senators, deputies, mayors and other officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other serious concerns of American officials here has been the political 
impact of the beating incidents earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 In a press briefing Thursday afternoon, Col. John Altenburg, the U.S. Army's 
chief lawyer for the Haiti operation, said that the confusion over the issue of 
intervention came because of the last-minute change in the nature of the Haiti 
operation, from invasion to peaceful entry into the country. The Pentagon had 
prepared two sets of rules of engagement -- one for an invasion and a second in 
case the military dictatorship fled before a U.S. arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 Altenburg said the Army had not really planned for a peaceful entry while the 
military dictators were still in place. At the same time, U.S. commanders 
wanted to get their forces organized and established before getting involved in 
local affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, U.S. commanders agreed after U.S. troops landed Monday to give 
Cedras time to curb his forces' activities. Altenburg said Thursday that U.S. 
officers believed that they owed Cedras the chance to take care of the 
situation himself. 
</P>
<P>
 But by Thursday, it was clear that U.S. patience with Cedras and the Haitian 
military and police had run out. Officials said that Col. Michael Sullivan, 
commander of the U.S. Army's 16th Military Police Brigade, met with 
Michel-Joseph Francois, the Port-au-Prince police chief and a key member of the 
military regime, to tell him that U.S. forces will now forcibly stop any 
attacks on the Haitian people by other Haitians. 
</P>
<P>
 "They now are able to use force against the Haitian police," Altenburg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many U.S. soldiers, including a 1,000-member unit of military police 
newly arrived in Haiti, said Thursday that they had not yet been told of the 
new guidelines and were still under specific orders not to interfere.  
</P>
<P>
 "As it stands now, we're not supposed to intervene," said Sgt. Gorney Claywell 
of the 16th Military Police Brigade. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't heard anything different," said Pvt. Shane Nye of the MP brigade. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the continued presence in the country of the military dictators, the 
reality of the overwhelming force that the United States has brought in -- 
including more than 9,000 soldiers -- has clearly begun to sink in with the 
Haitian rulers. By Thursday, local armed personnel were no longer much in 
evidence on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The most striking example of the U.S. dominance was the scene at the Heavy 
Weapons Company, where as Potter spoke, an AC-130 gunship circled overhead. Its 
task would have been to devastate Camp D'Application with machine-gun and 
cannon fire if the invasion had taken place. 
</P>
<P>
 Potter, a gruff, old-school Army officer in the Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf 
mold, dismissed Haiti's military equipment as 15 to 20 years out of date and 
said that only half of it, at most, was operational. He added that he had been 
given a complete inventory of Haitian weaponry from U.S. intelligence sources, 
and that "according to U.S. intelligence, I've got it all." 
</P>
<P>
 The camp's soccer field, where the Americans gathered all of the Haitian 
army's major weapons and vehicles, was to have been a landing site for soldiers 
flown in from the Guantanamo Bay military base in Cuba.  
</P>
<P>
 The troops, many of whom were selected because they speak French or Creole, 
said they were rapidly building an easy rapport with the Haitian troops who 
were helping them confiscate their country's weapons. While Haitian officers 
watched silently, refusing to talk to reporters, Haitian enlisted men 
cooperated so much that they even pointed out weapons that U.S. troops had 
missed in their initial search. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last night, after we got here, we stayed up talking to some of them until 2 
in the morning, just getting to know each other," said Sgt. Rhette Watts of the 
3rd Special Forces unit, as he watched Haitian soldiers load munitions into a 
truck for the American military. "They are just as curious about us as we are 
about them."

REBUILDING JOB: STARTING FROM GROUND ZERO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH FREED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The American military takeover is easy," the industrialist said. "The 
soldiers simply point their guns and things get done. Rebuilding this country, 
now that is hard." 
</P>
<P>
 The industrialist was being flip, but the assessment was right on point. Haiti 
is so manacled by devastation and economic despair that the task is not one of 
rebuilding but one of constructing, almost from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
 Haiti has never had anything resembling a modern economy, and the overwhelming 
majority of its people have lived as virtual peons to a handful of rich 
plutocrats. Life expectancy has never been higher than 45 years, more than 10% 
of all babies die at birth, and more workers than not have never received 
wages. 
</P>
<P>
 And since the Sept. 30, 1991, military overthrow of President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide, what passes for life has become even worse. 
</P>
<P>
 The last three years of brutal military rule, awesome corruption, 
mismanagement and a crushing international economic embargo have left Haiti 
truly beggared, a largely barren lump of infertile dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 2,400 miles of roads that theoretically traverse this Maryland-sized 
nation, only 600 are "paved." Most of the rest can barely be described as dirt 
tracks. According to engineers, only one highway is capable of carrying heavy 
trucks safely and at reasonable speed: a 50-mile stretch built recently between 
Port-au-Prince and the Dominican Republic border to carry smuggled gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
 Most assembly plants and a large section of the country's shrinking 
agricultural areas have crumbled and are idle. Those that could be made 
productive in a hurry are no longer connected to anything by serviceable roads. 
</P>
<P>
 There is virtually no electricity outside Port-au-Prince, where service is so 
severely curtailed that lights are available for perhaps four hours a day to 
only a handful of neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Telephone service is a cruel joke. Not one of the country's 6.5 million 
inhabitants has access to public potable water. Most public workers have not 
been paid in two months; there is a shortage of local currency; inflation is at 
least 80%; an estimated 90% of the work force is unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have here is a pre-primitive society," a European economist said as 
he looked around. "Most primitive societies are self-sufficient. Haiti now 
can't even feed itself, let alone produce anything." 
</P>
<P>
 No matter the street stability brought by the presence of the 15,000 U.S. 
troops still pouring into the country, no matter the restoration of Aristide, 
no matter anything the Haitian people themselves do, constructing a new Haiti 
will be almost entirely in the hands of foreigners, according to several 
economic and political experts. 
</P>
<P>
 The necessary money -- at least for a start -- is there, in theory. Various 
government and international financial institutions have pledged about $1 
billion over the next half a decade, with about half of that for the first 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the gossamer nature of such commitments is underlined by the evaporation 
of more than $500 million in additional aid that had been earmarked for Haiti 
two years ago as the political crisis dragged on. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem then," an international economist said, "was the bleak outlook 
for a settlement. The (international) agencies simply couldn't hold all the 
funds in abeyance, and it went elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "A major problem now is the inability of Haiti to even absorb a lot of money. 
We'll need approved plans (from a restored Aristide government) and proof that 
the funds will be used efficiently and productively." 
</P>
<P>
 Now and for the foreseeable future, even lifting the international embargo 
will strain the country's capacity to unload and process new goods. The two 
main ports, here and in the northern city of Cap Haitien, are occupied by U.S. 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Other ports either are too small or lack working equipment to handle even 
mid-sized ships. Discounting the American military equipment, the 
Port-au-Prince docks have only one working crane and one forklift. 
</P>
<P>
 Warehouse capacity is weak, and existing petroleum storage tanks cannot handle 
more than one tanker at a time. So even when sanctions are lifted, there still 
won't be sufficient gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
 Another barrier is disagreement within Haiti about what should be done first. 
</P>
<P>
 International lending institutions and the private financial sector have 
accepted a free-market economic approach written by Haiti's most respected 
economist, former Finance Minister Leslie Delatour. And nearly all experts 
agree that the first task is political -- the establishment of a stable, 
rational political system that will draw foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
 But after that, the discord starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Bazin, a discredited political figure for his support of the coup but 
still a respected economist, argues for immediate construction of 
infrastructure -- "utility lines, wharves, refineries, factories, all connected 
by good roads. It makes no sense to build these things and then leave them 
useless and cut off," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the assembly-plant sector, which provided 36,000 jobs in 140 
factories making everything from T-shirts to baseballs until forced to close by 
the embargo, say what is needed after political stability is an immediate 
improvement in the lives of ordinary people. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to address the poverty, open real schools, stabilize prices with 
emergency measures, increase the money supply, create jobs," one businessman 
said. Then, he said, the infrastructure can be addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Lurking behind all the plans, proposals and hopes is concern among the 
business community and among diplomats and economists over Aristide's incoming 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
 During the seven months he was in office before the coup, Aristide delayed 
several major loans and financial-aid plans, either by failing to develop 
workable proposals for the money's use or by not addressing the corruption that 
seemed to be copied from the practices of his dictatorial predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took us six months to deliver $25 million in aid," said one international 
financial expert of the president's initial term, "because Aristide did not 
sufficiently explain how he was going to use the money or satisfy us that it 
wouldn't just vanish into the pockets of his people." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. diplomats and even some business leaders are optimistic that Aristide's 
return engagement will be different, even if the president doesn't want them to 
be. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's only got a year to go" before his term expires, one diplomat said, "and 
he won't be able to do much harm, even if he wants to, and I don't think he 
wants to. Aristide knows that if he is to change this country and have a 
political future, he needs the foreign money. So he will behave." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, a business leader said, "15,000 American troops will remind him of 
who is really in charge. He'll do what they tell him needs to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 The real issue, a diplomat said, "really isn't efficiency or even honesty of 
the government. What really matters is whether Haiti can ever recover."

MYERS' FUTURE WHITE HOUSE ROLE UNCERTAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A long-anticipated plan for reorganization of the White House appeared ready 
for another hasty revision Thursday night after Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers 
met with President Clinton to convince him not to immediately replace her with 
State Department spokesman Michael D. McCurry. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, it appeared late Thursday that Myers, one of the Administration's 
most visible faces, would stay on until near the end of the year in an expanded 
role designed to give her greater access to the inner circle, according to 
officials. At that point, McCurry would take over. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes are part of a reorganization considered by Chief of Staff Leon E. 
Panetta since his appointment on June 27, and may be announced as early as 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 The shake-up would also move Communications Director Mark D. Gearan into a 
long-range strategy and planning job, reporting to Panetta, and make George 
Stephanopoulos, now a senior adviser with a broad portfolio, an assistant to 
the President for policy. He, too, would report to Panetta. 
</P>
<P>
 But noting the quick changes of direction by the White House on other job 
announcements -- such as the Supreme Court nominations -- officials cautioned 
that details of the deal could still be undone by Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers, 33, who was raised in Valencia, Calif., became a target of criticism 
amid complaints about the White House's inability to publicize its successes 
and to convey an impression of internal order. She has been criticized for 
lacking access to the White House's inner circles; some outsiders have also 
said that as the chief spokeswoman she reinforced the image of the White House 
as a preserve of the young and inexperienced. 
</P>
<P>
 A stalwart of the 1992 Clinton presidential campaign, Myers has been one of 
the best-liked members of the White House staff for her good humor and quick 
wit. Panetta's long and public deliberations over her fate anguished her 
friends, particularly as she was forced to answer questions about her possible 
ouster in the daily briefings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a shame the way it was handled," said one staff member. "She is 
just one of the best people around here, amazingly devoid of ego and all that 
stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with a delay, Myers' expected resignation -- which follows the departure 
of several other top female aides in the White House -- would probably cause 
some discomfort for an Administration that has boasted of its gender and racial 
diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers was the White House's first female press secretary, although she never 
occupied the press secretary's traditional office, which was filled by her 
boss, Gearan. Myers also had a lower title -- deputy assistant to the President 
-- and made less money than earlier press secretaries. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as Thursday morning, many White House staff members expected to 
hear an announcement that Myers would be given bigger responsibilities and 
greater access, and would retain at least some briefing role.  
</P>
<P>
 She has been pursued for several outside jobs, including as co-host of the 
CNBC network show "Equal Time," with former Republican Party spokeswoman Mary 
Matalin. Myers has been Matalin's choice for the job, which would probably 
double her current $100,000 salary. 
</P>
<P>
 But she has also said recently she would like to return to California, where 
she worked for Sen. Dianne Feinstein during Feinstein's first senatorial 
campaign, and for former Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors about the impending announcement again roiled the White House on 
Thursday as Panetta talked to staff members one by one. Myers' regular briefing 
was first delayed, then canceled altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 But White House officials turned aside suggestions that this was to avoid the 
necessity of an on-camera discussion of the personnel changes, insisting that 
it was only because of a flurry of news over a NATO airstrike in Bosnia and 
other events. 
</P>
<P>
 If Clinton does choose McCurry as his press secretary, he would again be 
turning to an experienced Washington hand. The 39-year-old McCurry was earlier 
the spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, as well as for the 1992 
presidential campaign of Sen. Bob Kerrey and the 1988 presidential campaign of 
Bruce Babbitt, now Interior secretary. Earlier, he was spokesman for Democratic 
senators Harrison Williams of New Jersey, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, 
and John Glenn of Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 McCurry's campaign association with Kerrey -- then a bitter Clinton foe -- 
made some in the Clinton camp wary of him during the early days of the 
Administration. And it remains to be seen whether McCurry would be accepted 
within the Clinton inner circle, as he needs to be to succeed in the difficult 
press post. 
</P>
<P>
 McCurry continued to insist as recently as Wednesday that he expected no 
decision on the job for some time. At the State Department briefing on 
Thursday, he told reporters he "didn't know (the reports of his move) to be 
true," then insisted that "You'll see me at the podium here each and everyday. 
Five days a week. U.S. State Department." 
</P>
<P>
 The White House staff reorganization is also expected to see Bruce Lindsey, a 
Clinton confidant who carries the title of senior adviser, move to the general 
counsel's office as a deputy to Abner J. Mikva. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Lader, deputy chief of staff for administration, is expected to change 
jobs with Erskine Bowles, director of the Small Business Administration.  
</P>
<P>
 And there may be a new head of the White House political office, whose current 
head, Joan Baggett, has told insiders she wants to resign. A rumored 
front-runner is John Emerson, who was widely praised for his efforts in 
coordinating the quick federal response to this year's Southern California 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricki Seidman plans to leave as director of scheduling to become director of 
Rock the Vote, a Los Angeles-based organization aimed at younger voters. Her 
job is expected to go to Billy Webster, a longtime Clinton ally who has worked 
in the U.S. Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta has said that his reorganization is intended to streamline a White 
House that has been criticized for having too many free-floating staff members 
with ill-defined portfolios. He is expected to try to reduce the number of 
assistants to the President. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, even some within the Administration have questioned whether a 
reorganization that has centered on the image-making function will have much of 
an impact on Clinton's many difficulties.PANETTA, LEON E

RUSSIAN ROCKET FORCES LEFT IN THE DARK -- AND FUMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BOUDREAUX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Russia's nuclear arsenal survived intact for three decades of Cold War 
showdown with the West, but its custodians were reeling Thursday from a 
humiliating sneak attack on their headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 It came not from a weapon of destruction, nor a terrorist, nor a thief in the 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 It happened in broad daylight and has been blamed on a fearless but faceless 
bureaucrat at the Moscow power company. 
</P>
<P>
 For at least 74 minutes Wednesday, the utility shut off electricity to the 
Strategic Rocket Forces command center for failure to pay its $645,000 in 
overdue bills. 
</P>
<P>
 The command post -- in an underground bunker, full of communications gear with 
launch codes and monitoring equipment for 744 intercontinental ballistic 
missiles across the former Soviet Union -- switched to emergency backup power. 
</P>
<P>
 A statement from the base said "the military preparedness of the Strategic 
Rocket Forces was not impaired." 
</P>
<P>
 But the country's security Establishment erupted with fury Thursday over the 
bizarre blackout, which Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin called 
"scandalous." 
</P>
<P>
 To many, the incident seemed to show how the economic disorder and breakdown 
of authority in post-Soviet Russia pose indiscriminate threats to vital 
national interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Some officials suggested that it could undermine efforts by Russian President 
Boris N. Yeltsin at his summit next week with President Clinton to portray 
Russia as an increasingly stable country worthy of Western trust, aid and 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Americans will have doubts now whether Russia and the Yeltsin 
administration, in particular, are capable of being responsible for the 
conditions under which nuclear arms are stored," said Alexei G. Arbatov, a 
disarmament specialist and member of Parliament. "The people responsible should 
be put on trial and sent to prison." 
</P>
<P>
 What happened Wednesday is still a matter of conflicting accounts from the two 
antagonists: the Russian Defense Ministry -- which hasn't paid for a kilowatt 
since January -- and Mosenergo, the Moscow utility that claims the complete 
military owes it a total of 50 billion rubles, or about $21.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 A government rule prohibits power cutoffs to strategic military installations. 
But Mosenergo officials claimed not to understand that they were violating this 
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 They said they simply cut power at 2:30 p.m. to a Defense Ministry "object" 
known to them only by a code number. 
</P>
<P>
 "We turned off a cable to remind the leadership of this object to undertake 
measures to pay its debt," said Igor Goryunov, the utility's deputy director. 
</P>
<P>
 Mosenergo officials said power was restored at 3:44 p.m. after a telephone 
call from Gen. Igor Sergeyev, commander of the rocket forces base 12 miles west 
of Moscow. They said the general agreed to meet next week to discuss a debt 
payment schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Sergeyev did not sound agreeable at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no words in the Russian language, even unprintable ones, to comment 
on what happened," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocket forces officers said the blackout lasted four hours, and the utility 
knew exactly what it was doing. They said only the bunker, several hundred feet 
underground, lost power while officers' quarters on the base were unaffected. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Western and Russian specialists, communications equipment in the 
bunker can transmit launch codes via land lines, satellite and high-frequency 
radio to nuclear missiles. The equipment also lets Russian officers monitor 
missiles for tampering. 
</P>
<P>
 These systems are periodically checked to test backup emergency systems -- 
battery power packs and diesel generators, the specialists said. Even if 
backups fail, they added, missiles can be monitored and launched from Defense 
Ministry headquarters on Arbat Street in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 "A blackout by itself wouldn't cause a dire degradation of the rocket forces' 
combat capability," said Bruce Blair, an arms control specialist at the 
Brookings Institution in Washington. "But it might be a symptom of the weakness 
of Russia's central authority." 
</P>
<P>
 Top Russian authorities took it as an affront. Even as he assigned his energy 
minister to investigate the incident, Chernomyrdin sided with the armed forces 
and said, "Whoever is responsible for this disgrace will be punished today." 
</P>
<P>
 Many in the armed forces are angry at Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin for threatening 
to withhold part of their $20.5-billion budget allocation for 1994 because of 
lagging tax revenue -- a move that could cut defense spending to as little as 
half the 1993 level. 
</P>
<P>
 Budget-cutting across the board has tamed Russia's inflation and created a 
measure of stability that Yeltsin will tout at next week's White House summit. 
</P>
<P>
 But it has caused a payments crisis that grows as government agencies, 
state-subsidized companies and their clients limp along by building up huge 
debts to each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's blackout was a nightmarish example of how much clout the debt 
crisis gives bureaucrats and bill collectors. 
</P>
<P>
 As the government struggles for an orderly way to save essential or healthy 
enterprises and nudge unsound ones into bankruptcy, creditors in government 
agencies are making their own decisions on whom to cut off. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is simply unthinkable," said Valery F. Davydov, a Russian specialist on 
nuclear weapons. "How could a rank-and-file clerk at Mosenergo make a decision 
affecting the security of 170 million Russian people? He has demonstrated to 
the world what our lives are worth -- 50 billion rubles."

 Darrell Luery still remembers the day he came face to face with this city's 
new image as a family resort. It was at the vast new MGM Grand Hotel, where he 
almost tripped over a woman changing her infant's dirty diaper on the casino 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one of those yucky ones, and I had to see the whole thing!" he says.  
</P>
<P>
 What makes the incident particularly piquant is that Luery is president and 
chief operating officer of Bally's Las Vegas, a neighboring casino trying 
desperately to hold the line against this year's influx of Vegas vacationers 
with children. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bally's may be trying to turn back the tide. 
</P>
<P>
 Las Vegas this year is likely to see a record 29 million visitors. By most 
accounts an unprecedentedly high percentage will be children, hauled off for 
vacations in what used to be known as America's Sin City by parents dazzled by 
a burst of nationwide hype positioning Las Vegas as the country's newest family 
resort. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact was visible all summer long, as the fabled Las Vegas Strip was 
awash in children. They thronged the walkway in front of the new Treasure 
Island resort three times a night to watch an elaborate live pirate battle; 
ogled dolphins and white tigers at the neighboring Mirage, and dropped 
thousands of dollars worth of quarters into state-of-the-art video games at the 
new Luxor and MGM Grand casino-hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 But the one thing they were not permitted to do was gamble, and therein lies a 
key reason that the family resort idea is generating perhaps the most important 
debate about Las Vegas' future since Bugsy Siegel built the original Flamingo 
hotel-casino in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me it seems funny that we're going after a market for whom the biggest 
activity in town is illegal," says John A. Schibrowsky, an assistant professor 
of marketing at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas, who has studied the 
economics of the phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
 Phenomenal it is: Hotel occupancy rates in town have been running higher than 
98%, despite the addition of about 10,000 rooms in nine months. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you look at the numbers of people traveling to a casino destination in 
America, they're popping," says Glenn W. Schaeffer, the former president of 
Circus Circus Enterprises who is a partner in Gold Strike Casinos, which is 
planning a new family-friendly resort for the Las Vegas Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, at least, the city's resort planners seem to have found a formula to 
appeal to many visitors too young to gamble. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's awesome," said Randy Dickenson, 13, of Chicago after an hour's play at 
the Luxor Hotel's vast, two-story video arcade. (He estimated he had spent 
about $15 pumping quarters into Mortal Kombat II and virtual reality combat 
games.) 
</P>
<P>
 But Schibrowsky and others argue that Vegas is so dazzled by the near-term 
success of its family promotion that it has not focused on the problems a 
radical change in tourist demographics would bring to the city.  
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, the traditional practice of using rooms, restaurants and even 
air fares as loss leaders to get customers to the playing floor will have to be 
reconsidered if the number of rooms occupied by non-gamblers continues to rise. 
That in turn will cut into Las Vegas' price advantage over such 
more-established family resorts as Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "This town was built on cheap rooms and cheap meals to get people to gamble," 
says Dean Harrold, a senior vice president of Bally's. "Are (family customers) 
playing as much in the casinos? No, they're not. And if you can't make the 
money in the casino, you're going to have to make it up in the room rate." 
</P>
<P>
 The family market also means not only parents changing diapers in the casino 
but an apparent increase in gambling violations by minors. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month the State Gaming Board issued the first citation to a Strip casino 
-- ironically Bally's, which discourages family business -- for allowing a 
minor to gamble. (The 19-year-old lost more than $6,200 in three hours of 
blackjack.) 
</P>
<P>
 Bally's has agreed to pay a fine of $20,000 to $25,000 and to toughen its 
enforcement of underage gambling rules, according to officials of the casino 
and the State Gaming Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The case is widely seen here as a warning that gaming authorities believe the 
casinos are too lax about monitoring the behavior of people under 21, the 
state's legal age for gambling. Ron Asher, the Gaming Control Board's 
enforcement chief, says his agency regards underage gambling as "an 
industrywide problem" and that several more cases are being prepared against 
other casinos. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was growing up in Las Vegas we understood that you could not even walk 
through the casino to get to the restaurant," says Nevada Gaming Commissioner 
Steve DuCharme. "The hotels had to provide another route. Now everyone who 
comes in has to walk through the casino, because they put a sea battle out 
front and a 35,000-square-foot video arcade in the back." 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping children and gambling devices apart is not made easier by one of the 
axioms of modern casino design -- that slot machines should be located along 
the routes of heaviest foot traffic. Because those are generally the paths 
between, say, the video arcade and the room elevators, underage visitors 
inevitably confront temptation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Word of mouth and common sense tell you that if you put them in harm's way, 
some kids are going to reach in their pockets and plunk down their paper-route 
money," DuCharme says. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, a recent informal sortie around the casino floor at the MGM Grand 
turned up several children casually dropping coins in nickel or quarter slots 
and many more standing by as their parents played, which is illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 MGM executives say all their floor staff are trained to warn off underage 
gamblers. However, gaming authorities say that in periods of heavy family 
travel the flow of minors through casinos may be too great to police 
adequately. Like liquor store clerks, casino dealers and bosses may have to get 
into the habit of "carding" anyone who looks underage, Asher says. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Nevada law, a minor who gambles or loiters around a table game or slot 
machine and the casino where it occurs both can be charged with misdemeanors; 
violations carry fines of up to $1,000. The casino is also subject to 
administrative penalties, including fines of up to $250,000 or loss of its 
license -- regardless of whether casino personnel knew the gambler was 
underage. 
</P>
<P>
 Accordingly, accommodating families may mean redesigning casinos to keep 
children off the floor, upgrading swimming pools and other amenities to give 
them more to do, and acquiring more expertise in non-gaming entertainment 
attractions -- an area in which such major casino companies as MGM Grand and 
Circus Circus Enterprises lately have committed embarrassing fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say they need more facilities for the kids, other than letting them spend 
$200 an hour on the video games," said one frequent Las Vegas visitor, Frank 
Russo, a Coral Springs, Fla., businessman who was making his first visit with 
his daughter, Dina, 13, in tow. 
</P>
<P>
 Dina, weary of looking at man-made sights and being asked by security people 
to move along, agreed that Las Vegas needs more organized teen-agers 
activities. "There's a lot more for us to do on a cruise," she sighed. 
</P>
<P>
 Some casino executives fear, meanwhile, that repositioning this town as a 
family resort could alienate its traditional clientele of serious gamblers 
without significantly expanding the total market. Executives at the Las Vegas 
Hilton, the city's premier convention hotel and a mecca for high rollers, say 
they already are getting more business from customers who resent having to 
gamble elsewhere with a lot of kids around. 
</P>
<P>
 Other casinos already have embarked on counter-marketing against the family 
hype. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want people to think of us as the last bit of real distinction and class 
left in a place turning more mid-market and family-oriented," says Henry Gluck, 
chairman and chief executive officer of Caesar's World, the owner of Caesar's 
Palace, one of the top hotels for serious gamblers on the Strip. The hotel has 
upgraded several of its most luxurious high-roller suites and is planning to 
double the size of its upscale Forum Shops mall, which has three street 
entrances but only one exit -- into the casino. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some say that rising competition for gamblers' money across the country 
leaves Las Vegas no choice but to position itself as more than a gambling 
venue. Although casino gambling once was permitted only in Nevada and Atlantic 
City, N.J., 21 states have legalized full-range casinos and virtually all of 
the largest metropolitan areas are within 200 miles of slot-machine and 
table-game play. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last year or two, that competition has inspired Vegas hotel managers 
to try to broaden their appeal. "The overpowering statistic is that only 15% of 
vacationers in the country have ever visited Las Vegas," says Clyde Turner, 
Circus Circus Enterprises chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 If Las Vegas' traditional marketing target was a 50-year-old whose children 
had departed the nest, leaving him with plenty of disposable income and time, 
now the focus has shifted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our principal marketing target is the baby boomer in his 40s," says Gold 
Strike's Schaeffer. "He'll frequently choose to travel with his family, so you 
have to offer a full-service entertainment product."  
</P>
<P>
 The new marketing era took off with the launching late last year of three 
major Strip resorts costing more than $2 billion combined: The Luxor, an 
Egyptian-themed pyramid opened by Circus Circus; Steve Wynn's pirate-themed 
Treasure Island, and the MGM Grand, with Wizard of Oz decor and a theme park 
designed to resemble a mini-Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 They joined two properties also regarded as family-market oriented, both owned 
by Circus Circus Enterprises: the original 1968-vintage Circus Circus and its 
1990 spinoff, the Arthurian-themed Excalibur. 
</P>
<P>
 The three new mega-hotels were not all equally pitched to tourists with 
children -- Mirage Resorts, owner of Treasure Island, likes to call its 
properties "family-neutral" rather than "family-oriented." But the openings 
generated a world-class publicity blast, including a cover story in Time 
magazine just as many families were planning their summer vacations. The 
result: Near-capacity business all summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The hoopla inspired by the new resorts generated its own momentum. Already, 
ITT Sheraton has announced a 3,500-room, $750-million themed resort to go next 
to its Desert Inn hotel-casino and be called Desert Kingdom. Wynn, chairman of 
Mirage Resorts, plans to build a major themed resort on the Strip location once 
occupied by the Dunes, which he demolished to great fanfare earlier this year. 
All together, as many as 20,000 new rooms may open by 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest surge, however, has created an "identity crisis," in the words of 
Barry Shier, president and chief executive officer of the Golden Nugget, Mirage 
Resorts' high-grade hotel-casino for serious gamblers in downtown Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are an adult Disneyland, but we are not Disneyland, and I do not believe 
it is anyone's intent that we should become one," Shier told the magazine Las 
Vegas Style this summer. "Now with school out for the first extended period 
since these new properties opened, people are saying things like the gaming 
contribution per customer is not as it used to be. Well, big surprise! If 
you've got children occupying certain rooms, they can't gamble." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the evidence shows that parents coming with children also gamble less 
than those who come alone. Joseph Oxman, a Seattle food broker who recently 
spent three days at Treasure Island with his wife, Darcy, and two children, 
said he had budgeted $200 a day to play blackjack. On his last visit in 1984 -- 
without the children -- Oxman and his wife each had spent $400 a day. (This 
time, the kids each were spending about $30 daily on video games.) 
</P>
<P>
 "You come here and even if you want to gamble you can't, because you have to 
watch the kids," said Marvin Hicks of Monroe, Mich., a guest at the Tropicana 
whose family responsibilities were keeping him from the craps tables. Added his 
wife, Dawn: "You can't even drop a coin in the slot machines, because with the 
kids you have to keep moving through the casino." 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics bear out their experience. Visitors' average gambling budgets in 
1992, the last year for which such a breakdown is available, were highest in 
winter and fall when the percentage of tourists with children was lowest, and 
bottomed out at $39 per person per day in summer, when the percentage of 
parties with children peaked at 12%. 
</P>
<P>
 As it happens, economics and other factors have been driving down visitors' 
gambling budgets generally -- to $50 per person per day in 1992 from $105 in 
1982. That's a troublesome trend that will only continue if Vegas becomes more 
family-friendly, particularly when compounded by a growth in conventions, many 
of which bring non-gamblers to town. 
</P>
<P>
 (The percentage of non-gambling visitors rose to 10% in 1993 from 3% in 1987, 
according to the city's Convention and Visitors Authority.) 
</P>
<P>
 For now, there is reason to wonder whether Las Vegas can create the kind of 
resort flavor that keeps families coming back year after year without getting 
bored -- or offended. Girlie shows and other raw cabaret acts may largely have 
been shouldered off the glossy south end of the Strip ("The PG mentality is 
here," says Gold Strike's Schaeffer), but a large percentage of the taxis in 
town still bear roof placards advertising a downtown attraction called "Topless 
Girls of Glitter Gulch."  
</P>
<P>
 Some experts doubt that even top-notch gaming executives can prosper in the 
trickier entertainment business, as they must to maintain a family trade. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blackjack and slot machines are well understood and quite predictable," says 
Eugene Christiansen, a New York-based casino consultant. "But family 
entertainment takes a whole different set of skills." 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing proves that as well as the travails of Vegas' two most highly touted 
family attractions: the MGM Grand's Grand Adventures Theme Park and Circus 
Circus's Grand Slam Canyon, a venue of roller-coaster rides and themed 
amusements. 
</P>
<P>
 Both charged ambitious admissions prices when they opened last year -- $25 a 
head for MGM's park and $20 for Grand Slam Canyon. Both were flops.  
</P>
<P>
 Grand Slam Canyon was rife with design flaws, including a flume ride that 
drenched its customers ("Now it's just a light spray," says Turner). Attendance 
was so poor that the company shut down the attraction for three weeks last 
October for a total redesign. It reopened with an admission price of $3, with 
an additional fee charged for individual rides. 
</P>
<P>
 MGM, meanwhile, oversold its theme park's quality without devoting to it 
sufficient imagination and expense. "It was announced as a $110-million park," 
says a competing casino executive. "At Disneyland, Splash Mountain alone cost 
$80 million." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the MGM park's shortcomings is that it is open to the skies in a town 
where the daytime temperature during the summer vacation months can top 110 
degrees. The park closes at 7 p.m., just about the time the desert heat begins 
to wane. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, MGM Grand has cut the admission price twice, most recently to zero 
(customers wanting to enjoy its seven rides buy a separate admission at $15 for 
adults, $11 for children). That change almost instantly doubled revenues at the 
retail shops and restaurants in the park. Still, on a recent midday visit, the 
park was virtually deserted while the state-of-the-art video arcade inside the 
air-conditioned hotel was jammed. 
</P>
<P>
 For all that, most observers believe the family trend in Las Vegas is just 
beginning, powered by a generation of executives no longer convinced that the 
casino needs to be the only profit center in the hotel. The Mirage and Treasure 
Island are turning profits by selling trademark T-shirts in their retail shops, 
and room and food prices at the MGM Grand suggest they no longer are pure loss 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Visitors' gambling budgets may be lower, but their overall vacation budgets 
are not," says Schaeffer. "At the end of the day, it doesn't matter what part 
of the store they spend it in." New Look for Sin City 
</P>
<P>
 Tourism in Las Vegas is reaching record heights as a segment of the city's 
hotel industry sets out to draw families to what long has been an 
adult-oriented destination. But the new visitor mix is hammering away at 
gambling levels, which already had been falling for a decade as conventioneers 
and low-rollers displaced Las Vegas' traditional customers.

SOUTHLAND FIRMS DOMINATE MARKET FOR SMALL HANDGUNS; VIOLENCE: CHEAP WEAPONS ARE 
FAVORED BY CRIMINALS AND YOUTHS. MANY ARE TRACED TO SERIOUS CRIMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Southern California is home to a circle of gun makers who have virtually 
cornered the market in small handguns by doing it the American way -- cheaper. 
But for thousands of crime victims across America, the products they sell are 
proving all too costly, a Times study shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucked away in suburban industrial complexes in and around Los Angeles County, 
seven arms companies have become colossal players in the market for 
inexpensive, small-caliber automatics, the sort that have gained favor in 
America's inner cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Priced as low as $25, compared to $300 or more for the higher-quality 
handguns, the pistols produced by these firms have increasingly become the 
weapons of choice for criminals, crime-fearing citizens and America's youth, 
accounting for a disproportionate share of handguns traced in violent crime in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1 out of 5 times that authorities traced a handgun involved in a murder, 
robbery, assault or drug crime between January, 1991, and May, 1994, the weapon 
was traced to these companies, according to 300,000 federal firearms records 
reviewed by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies are Davis Industries, Phoenix Arms, Lorcin Engineering, Bryco 
Arms, Jennings Firearms, Raven and Sundance Industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the companies declined to discuss the findings. They previously 
have cited an anti-gun bias in the news media and have said that if more of 
their guns are involved in crimes and traces, it reflects the high volume of 
their sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Gun industry supporters say that these firearms provide a measure of 
protection to law-abiding citizens who live in high-crime areas and may not be 
able to afford more expensive handguns. 
</P>
<P>
 All of these companies, records show, are, or were, owned by relatives, former 
business associates and family friends of George Jennings, a one-time machinist 
who became a millionaire after founding Raven in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Raven founder Jennings is retired and does not own or control all 
these companies, the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms refers to 
them in official reports as "Jennings Firearms." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, these companies manufactured roughly 80% of all small-caliber 
firearms in the United States, eclipsing the production of industry giants such 
as Colt, Smith & Wesson and Ruger. 
</P>
<P>
 And guns made by "Jennings Firearms" companies show up in a disproportionate 
number of weapons traces after murders, robberies and other violent crimes 
nationwide, according to a Times computer analysis of 3 1/2 years of ATF 
records. 
</P>
<P>
 The .25-caliber automatic manufactured by Raven has become the handgun most 
frequently seized and traced by police, while a .38-caliber automatic 
manufactured by Jennings' son-in-law, Jim Davis of Davis Industries, has become 
the second most frequently traced handgun, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 During the period, guns made by "Jennings Firearms" companies were traced in 
connection with 2,675 assaults, 3,494 murders, 5,901 narcotics crimes and 1,223 
robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of company officials did not return calls. One member of the Jennings 
family said, "We're not about to comment." 
</P>
<P>
 But Richard Feldman, executive director of the American Shooting Sports 
Council, a legislative group that represents firearms manufacturers, 
wholesalers and retailers, said that if Jennings-related weapons did not exist, 
criminals would find some other guns to use. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy to rail against handguns and say that just because they are 
inexpensive, it's easier for the criminal to get," Feldman said. "But what does 
someone making $5,000 a week selling cocaine care about how much he pays for a 
gun?" 
</P>
<P>
 Handguns manufactured in a region renowned for making movies and music have 
been confiscated all across America by authorities investigating serious 
crimes, according to ATF records. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sandusky, Ohio, for example, a Lorcin .380 killed a star athlete from the 
local high school after a fight broke out at a Halloween party. 
</P>
<P>
 In Milwaukee, members of a youth gang took aim at a 21-year-old man sitting on 
a park bench. One of the weapons: A Lorcin 9-millimeter. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tucson, a domestic dispute erupted, escalated, and guns were fired. The 
victim: a 27-year-old woman. The weapon: a Sundance .25. Also found at the 
scene: A Lorcin .25. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last weekend, two rival gangs converged on a Salt Lake City home where 
some gang members were having a party. One member of another gang fired a 
Lorcin .380, killing an 18-year-old youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say that 99% of our homicide shootings in Salt Lake City are Lorcins, 
Ravens and Jennings guns," said police detective Jim Alcock. 
</P>
<P>
 The list of locales goes on: Washington. Chicago. Huntsville, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 A Times review of ATF data shows: 
</P>
<P>
 * Since 1990, such firearms have dominated the list of handguns most 
frequently found at crime scenes around the nation and traced. So far this 
year, 6 of the 10 most frequently traced handguns in the United States were 
made by "Jennings Firearms" companies. The top four are Lorcin L-380, Davis 
P-380, Raven MP-25 and Lorcin L-25. The sixth most often traced is the Jennings 
J-22, and the ninth is the Phoenix-Raven. 
</P>
<P>
 * Of 242,106 handguns seized from crime scenes nationwide in the past 3 1/2 
years and traced, 50,936, or 20%, were manufactured by these companies. By 
comparison, the nation's No.1 gun manufacturer, Smith & Wesson, which has been 
making guns for more than a century, made 31,521 of the guns seized and traced 
during the same time period. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys don't manufacture anywhere near the number Smith & Wesson does," 
said the ATF's John D'Angelo, "and yet it's their guns that show up in the 
traces. 
</P>
<P>
 * On more than 1,600 occasions, police seized and initiated a trace on a gun 
made by "Jennings Firearms" companies on the same day it was purchased. 
Authorities said this would indicate that the gun may have been used in a crime 
that very day. By comparison, this happened 1,041 times with Smith & Wesson 
guns. 
</P>
<P>
 * Though "Jennings Firearms" guns are manufactured here in Southern 
California, authorities in New York, Virginia, Michigan, Texas, Georgia, 
Illinois and Washington, D.C., requested traces of them more often than other 
states did. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cheap, 'Saturday night specials' are among the top 10 trace requests we get, 
and they are the ones from these companies," said Tom Hill, a Washington-based 
spokesman for the ATF. "What we need to figure out is why do the guns these 
companies manufacture end up in the hands of criminals." 
</P>
<P>
 A handful of states have outlawed several models made by "Jennings Firearms" 
companies as threats to public safety. Authorities say some of them could not 
be legally imported into the U.S. if they were made abroad because they would 
not meet standards for imported weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Garen Wintemute, an emergency room physician and the head of UC Davis's 
Violence Prevention Research Program, is author of a report to be released 
today on Southern California firearms manufacturers. The report says that guns 
made by "Jennings Firearms" companies are 3.4 times more likely to be used in 
crimes than are Colt, Smith & Wesson and Ruger handguns. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can be distinguished by their disproportionate use in crime," he said in 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 ATF statistics indicate that nearly 3,500 handguns made by "Jennings Firearms" 
companies were traced in connection with murders between 1991 and May, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of them took the life of Derrick Dickey. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Oct. 30, in Sandusky, Ohio, a town of 30,000 on the banks of Lake Erie, 
an 18-year-old youth shot a popular, 17-year-old high school basketball player 
in the chest, killing him instantly with a .380-caliber Lorcin. Dickey had a 
.25-caliber Lorcin handgun in his back pocket. Police said he never reached for 
the unloaded weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Dickey's gun was traced to Jack's Jewelers in Columbus, Ga. The dealer had 
purchased the gun in May, 1990, but when Moehling called the shop, it was out 
of business. 
</P>
<P>
 The gun Dickey's alleged assailant used came from Norcol Gun Shop in Columbus, 
Ohio, and was purchased by a Sandusky youth in April, 1993, six months before 
the shooting. The youth told police the gun had been stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Used to be that we'd get a murder here every two or three years," said Det. 
Curt Moehling, who investigated the Dickey death. "Now it's four or five a 
year. And 80% are coming from the Lorcins, the Ravens and the Jennings guns." 
</P>
<P>
 In Milwaukee, Jonathan Simmons, 21, was just beginning to turn his life around 
this summer when four members of the Black Gangster Disciples spotted him 
sitting on the step of a vacant corner store. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons tried to run, but the four gang members fired 32 times, hitting him 
eight times. He had bullet wounds to his chest, thigh, leg, forearm, abdomen, 
calf and knee. He died at the scene on a warm summer day across the street from 
a playground. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one weapon -- a 9-millimeter Lorcin pistol -- was found at at the scene, 
although casings were found from another 9-millimeter pistol and a .40-caliber 
handgun. 
</P>
<P>
 One 16-year Milwaukee police veteran who has spent the past five years 
investigating homicides said the Davis, Raven and Lorcin guns pop up often in 
murders. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The "Jennings Firearms" companies date back to 1970 when George Jennings 
founded Raven, records show. Eight years later, his son, Bruce, formed Jennings 
Firearms, which in 1985 became Calwestco and in 1990 became Bryco. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1982, George Jennings' son-in-law, Jim Davis, started Davis Industries, 
making mostly .25-caliber pistols at first. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in 1989, an associate of Bruce Jennings, Jim Waldorf, established 
Lorcin. That same year, George Jennings' nephew, Steve, formed Sundance 
Industries. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the company that started it all, Raven, was seriously damaged by 
fire, and that led to the establishment of Phoenix Arms. 
</P>
<P>
 According to ATF figures for 1992, the latest year for which manufacturing 
statistics are available, the five active "Jennings Firearms" companies -- 
Lorcin, Davis, Phoenix, Bryco and Sundance -- produced 541,489 handguns of 
.25-, .32- and .380-caliber. That represents 81% of all such small-caliber 
handguns manufactured in the United States.

 Inexpensive, small-caliber handguns manufactured in Southern California can be 
traced to thousands of violent crimes nationwide. In crimes committed from 
January, 1991, to May, 1994, in which police asked the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms to trace ownership of weapons, the following handguns were

POLICE DEFEND LATER SEARCH OF SIMPSON HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD and JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police officers who searched O.J. Simpson's home two weeks after the football 
great's ex-wife and a friend were found dead conceded Thursday that they seized 
items not covered by a warrant but said that what they took appeared relevant 
to the case -- including a note from Nicole Brown Simpson to her ex-husband 
promising not to call him anymore except in emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's hearing marked the first time that the note's contents were aired 
in public. Until it was removed from a package of evidence Thursday, neither 
prosecutors nor defense attorneys had copies of it, and it was not specifically 
detailed in a property report from that day's search of Simpson's home. 
</P>
<P>
 In the note to her ex-husband, found with family videotapes, Nicole Simpson 
wrote: "O.J., I understand that this is probably too late, but I have to do it 
for myself and the kids, or I would never forgive myself. I'll call Cathy from 
now on, and will only call in an absolute emergency. Please believe me and 
return these calls immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 A police officer had testified earlier that he seized the note because it 
appeared to suggest a motive for the slayings, but his recollection of its 
contents was substantially different from what was read in court. In fact, 
although the note is ambiguous, it could work against prosecutors by 
undercutting the belief that Nicole Simpson was being stalked by her ex-husband 
because it suggests that she wanted to maintain at least some relationship with 
him after their breakup. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Thursday, Simpson's housekeeper, Josephine Guarin, testified that a group 
of police officers sat in Simpson's family room during the June 28 search and 
watched a videotape about "Frogmen," a pilot for a television show in which the 
former football star had appeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives who were at Simpson's house had testified earlier in the day that 
they had not seen officers watching the video. Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark 
stated at one point that no such viewing had occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 The developments occurred on the second day of a crucial hearing to determine 
whether items from several searches can be admitted into evidence against 
Simpson.  
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito already refused to suppress items found 
during an earlier search that may be introduced as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not rule Thursday on the latest batch of disputed items, but said he 
plans to when court reconvenes this morning. Simpson is charged with the 
murders of Nicole Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman, who were slashed and stabbed 
to death June 12. He has pleaded not guilty, and jury selection in the 
celebrated case is scheduled to begin Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest contested search yielded a number of items, including clothing, 
videotapes, letters and a script for the "Frogmen" pilot. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson had recently finished filming for the pilot, which includes a scene in 
which he holds a knife to a young woman's throat. Excerpts from the show also 
were seized. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, officers took two drafts of a letter that had been faxed to 
Simpson from his business lawyer. The letters, one of which was written six 
days before Simpson's ex-wife and Goldman were killed, apparently related to 
Simpson's divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 But the warrant authorizing the search only gave officers permission to take 
clothing, a knife, packaging material, receipts for a knife and anything that 
appeared to be spotted with blood. As a result, Simpson's attorneys maintain 
that the officers exceeded the scope of the warrant and that the evidence they 
seized thus should not be used against their client. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's lawyers also accused officers of needlessly stopping to watch the 
"Frogmen" videotapes and of setting up photographs of Nicole Simpson to 
resemble a "shrine." If true, those actions could cast doubt on the integrity 
of the search. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald F. Uelmen, one of Simpson's attorneys, described the search that 
afternoon as a "grazing" for evidence, during which officers made themselves at 
home in Simpson's estate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would ask for the suppression of all items on this warrant," Uelmen said. 
If Ito decides against that -- and most legal observers predict he will -- then 
Uelmen asked that he suppress specific items seized by the police, including 
the "Frogmen" tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before Ito could rule, Deputy Dist. Atty. Clark conceded that another 
seized videotape, highlights of Simpson's football career titled "Ode to O.J.," 
should not be admitted as evidence. But she argued that other items seized that 
day should not be stricken. 
</P>
<P>
 In trying to cast the officers' conduct during the search as outrageous, 
Simpson's lawyers called his housekeeper to the stand to describe the officers' 
behavior during the three-hour search of Simpson's home and property. 
</P>
<P>
 Guarin testified that, on the order of the officers, she spent much of the 
afternoon in the kitchen, but that they at one point asked her to turn on 
Simpson's videotape player so that they could watch "Frogmen." About 10 
officers were gathered in Simpson's living room when she started the tape, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know they watched 'Frogmen,' " Guarin said. "That's all I know." 
</P>
<P>
 That could represent a problem for prosecutors if Ito rules that the evidence 
on the tape was not in "plain view" and therefore should not have been seized. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not plain view if you have play it," said Laurie Levenson, a Loyola law 
professor and former federal prosecutor. "That's what the defense is arguing." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Arenella, a UCLA law professor, agreed and said that if officers did 
view the tape at Simpson's home, they probably overstepped their bounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a close call on the 'Frogmen' tape," he said. "I don't believe that 
comes in." 
</P>
<P>
 Practically, however, losing that tape might not pose such a hardship for 
prosecutors. They could issue another warrant for the tape and might be able to 
obtain it elsewhere if they consider it important, legal experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 In their testimony, the officers denied that they had committed any 
improprieties and defended their decision to take items not covered by the 
warrant. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're permitted to seize those items specifically addressed on the search 
warrant itself," said Detective David Martin, one of about 30 officers involved 
in the search. "We're also permitted to seize items of obvious contraband. . . 
. We're also authorized to seize items which we believe might connect the 
suspect being investigated to the crimes being investigated." 
</P>
<P>
 As a general rule, officers who search a location are confined to seizing 
evidence outlined in a search warrant. But a widely used search warrant manual 
prepared by the Los Angeles County district attorney's office and employed by 
officers throughout California states that officers can seize material that is 
not covered by a warrant under certain circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the manual, contraband can be seized, as can evidence of crimes 
that is observed by the officers while they are executing the warrant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally, the courts do not require a strong showing as to why the officers 
thought the item seized was or might have been evidence of a crime," the manual 
states. "A reasonable, good faith belief is sufficient." 
</P>
<P>
 The "Frogmen" tape is more problematic, however, because officers could not 
have known what was on the tape before viewing it. And that, according to legal 
experts, generally requires a separate warrant. There is another potential 
problem relating to the correspondence between Simpson and his business lawyer 
regarding Simpson's divorce; those documents probably are covered by 
attorney-client privilege and are unlikely to be accepted into evidence, 
experts agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the debate over evidence has dominated the week in the Simpson case, 
Thursday's hearing opened with a furious denunciation of a local television 
station's report that a Maryland laboratory had concluded that a sock belonging 
to Simpson was spotted with the blood of his ex-wife. The station, KNBC-TV 
Channel 4, said that DNA tests by the Cellmark lab led to that conclusion and 
that a written report from the lab detailed those findings. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito, who has generally remained collected on the bench, exploded at that 
report, which was picked up by other news stations and wire services. Ito said 
it was so outrageous that he is considering taking action to clamp down on 
reporting about the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm beyond being outraged," the judge fumed. "For this kind of information to 
come out, and for it to be incorrect, and for it to be so prejudicial, is 
outrageous, it's irresponsible. . . . I'm very disturbed by this." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his obvious anger, Ito said some news organizations had refrained from 
reporting the inaccurate information about DNA tests. "My recollection is that 
the Los Angeles Times, for example, did not report this because it was not 
confirmed, so I don't want to paint all the news media with a broad brush of 
irresponsibility," Ito said. "But it causes me to wonder about professionalism 
and ethics in that profession." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark and Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., one of Simpson's lawyers, also criticized 
the report, albeit less stridently than Ito. Clark called the report false, 
though her denunciation was carefully worded and did not make clear whether she 
was objecting to the substance of the story or to certain details contained 
within it. Cochran warned that such misreporting could compromise Simpson's 
ability to get a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "The prosecution and the defense are united in our displeasure, in our upset 
with what has occurred with respect to this story," Clark said. "We urge the 
court to take any further measures it deems appropriate to prevent this from 
occurring again in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Cochran agreed, saying the outrage was shared "across the room." 
</P>
<P>
 "It impacts upon one person more than anyone else, and that's Mr. Simpson," 
Cochran said. "We certainly want to urge the court to do whatever you feel is 
necessary, short of sequestration, to do what is proper." 
</P>
<P>
 Station officials said KNBC stood by its story, but other sources said the 
socks so far have been tested using conventional techniques, not DNA analysis 
as the television station reported. Those methods are far less discriminating 
than DNA tests, but can still yield important information about the possible 
source of a blood sample. 
</P>
<P>
 In another development, Simpson attorney Robert L. Shapiro said his Century 
City offices were broken into early Wednesday morning and that file cabinets 
containing material related to the Simpson case were found open. According to 
Shapiro, two computer printers were stolen, but Simpson's lawyers are more 
concerned that files may have been copied. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only cabinets that were open were the Simpson cabinets," Shapiro said. He 
added that police were contacted, and "they have been exceedingly cooperative."

THE TIMES POLL; MOST BACK HAITI PACT BUT OPPOSE SENDING TROOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Americans generally approve of the negotiated settlement to the crisis in 
Haiti, but remain skeptical about long-term U.S. involvement in that country 
and unconvinced that any vital national interest is present there, according to 
The Times Poll. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the public is more supportive of President Clinton's handling of 
Haiti than of his handling of the rest of his job, the sharply divided view of 
the Haitian situation has had no measurable impact on Clinton's overall 
standing or on domestic politics generally. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's standing with the public remains low -- as low as at any point in 
his presidency -- and while Americans also remain skeptical of his Republican 
opposition, the GOP appears well-positioned to make substantial gains in this 
fall's midterm elections. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the poll, the public remains opposed to sending U.S. troops to 
Haiti, fears that the forces will become bogged down there, distrusts the 
Haitian generals and offers limited support for any long-term effort to 
"restore democracy" to the troubled Caribbean island. Americans do, however, 
accept "stopping human rights abuses" as a justification for U.S. intervention 
in Haiti -- a result that underscores how important it is for the 
Administration over the next days and weeks to find ways of reining in the 
Haitian armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Americans approve of the agreement, 67% to 27%, but disapprove of 
sending troops to Haiti, 53% to 43%. Those who approve of the agreement but not 
of sending troops to enforce it tend to be women. Republicans and conservatives 
also are more likely to fall into this category. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's approval ratings show continued slippage since the last Times Poll, 
taken in late July. That decline, which showed up in other polls taken in 
August and early September, appears unrelated to the Haitian crisis. Indeed, 
Clinton's handling of Haiti receives a narrowly favorable 47%-44% rating. Asked 
directly if Clinton's actions in Haiti made them feel more or less favorable 
toward the President, 65% said the subject had no effect, 16% said it made them 
more favorable and 16% said less favorable. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, only 52% of those polled now say they see Clinton as an 
"effective" President while 46% do not. Nine months ago, Clinton had a 65%-32% 
edge on that measurement. Only 34% said they see Clinton as a "strong and 
decisive leader" as against 59% who do not; 40% say Clinton has the "moral 
authority to serve as commander in chief" while 48% say he does not; and only 
17% say they have a good idea of Clinton's goals in foreign affairs, while 74% 
do not. 
</P>
<P>
 By 52% to 42%, the public disapproves of Clinton's overall handling of his job 
as President, up from 47% to 45% in July, and an extraordinarily high 34% say 
they "disapprove strongly," up from 27% in July. Clinton receives even worse 
scores on two specific aspects of his job -- the public disapproves of his 
handling of the economy, 52% to 39%, and disapproves of his handling of foreign 
affairs, 55% to 36%. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked which party they lean toward in this fall's House elections, voters 
are almost equally divided, with 44% favoring the Democrats and 43% the 
Republicans -- a result that points toward heavy losses this November from the 
Democratic congressional majorities. Democrats have generally led by much wider 
margins on this question. 
</P>
<P>
 By 35% to 33%, those polled see Republicans as the party best able to handle 
the nation's major problems -- a small difference, but the first time in 
Clinton's presidency in which the Times Poll has found Republicans holding an 
edge on that question. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll, supervised by Times Poll Director John Brennan, surveyed 1,340 
adults nationwide Tuesday and Wednesday, Sept. 20 and 21. The results have a 
margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
 While Clinton has derived no benefit from events in Haiti, former President 
Jimmy Carter appears to have improved markedly in public esteem. A decade ago, 
with then-President Ronald Reagan using bitter memories of Carter's performance 
in office as the foil for his "Morning in America" reelection campaign, 
Americans by 48% to 44% had an unfavorable view of Carter. Now, after several 
years of attention to his domestic charitable works and his international 
diplomacy -- and in the wake of his negotiations in Haiti and Korea -- the 
public views Carter favorably by a 68%-14% margin. 
</P>
<P>
 His support extends even to self-identified conservatives, 65% to 21%, and 
Republicans, 60% to 26%. Americans believe Carter had significant influence on 
the negotiations, with 71% saying he had either a "great deal" or a "good 
amount" of influence, while only 16% said they thought he did not have much 
influence. 
</P>
<P>
 A second member of Carter's negotiating team, retired Gen. Colin L. Powell, 
former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is similarly popular, 65% to 6%, 
with 29% saying they do not know enough about him to say. By comparison, the 
public's overall impression of Clinton, as opposed to his job performance, is 
only marginally favorable, 50% to 47%. 
</P>
<P>
 The public approval of Carter comes even though the poll shows considerable 
doubts about the agreement he negotiated. Nearly half of those polled, 49%, 
believe the deal is "too lenient" on Haiti's military leaders. Only 5% think it 
is too harsh, while 38% say it is "about right." Americans also have little 
confidence that the Haitian military will abide by the agreement -- 54% say 
they are doubtful about compliance, 30% express some confidence, and only 9% 
say they are very confident. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans also do not accept a key part of Carter's description of how the 
negotiations happened. When asked if Clinton's decision to launch warplanes 
while the negotiations were going on "helped bring Haiti's military leaders to 
terms," as the Administration maintains, or "endangered the talks," as Carter 
says, 50% say the launch helped. Only 19% believe the launch endangered the 
talks, while 22% say the move had little effect one way or the other. 
</P>
<P>
 A large majority of those polled report that they have been "closely 
following" events in Haiti, with 32% saying they are paying "very close" 
attention and another 52% saying they have been following events there 
"somewhat closely." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked if they believe American troops "will be able to finish their job 
and withdraw from Haiti in a fairly timely fashion," only 32% say yes. A 
majority, 54%, say they fear American forces will get "bogged down" in Haiti. 
Nonetheless, Americans are sharply divided on whether Clinton should 
"immediately set a definite date for the withdrawal of all U.S. forces," with 
47% saying he should, while 48% say the President should be "allowed some 
flexibility" on that subject. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the public does not expect high casualties in Haiti. Only 6% say they 
believe casualties will be heavy, while 70% believe casualties will be light or 
none at all. Another 19% expect moderate casualties. But whatever the casualty 
expectations, only 35% say they accept the argument that the United States has 
"vital interests" in Haiti, while 54% say no vital interests are at stake and 
11% are unsure. Clinton has made defense of U.S. interests a key argument in 
favor of his Haiti policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Black Americans are far more likely than whites to agree with Clinton that 
American vital interests are at stake in Haiti. Blacks agree, 51% to 37%, while 
whites disagree, 32% to 56%. Blacks are also somewhat more likely to support 
U.S. military intervention in Haiti. By 56% to 44%, blacks approve of Clinton's 
decision to send troops to Haiti. Whites disapprove, 41% to 54%. 
</P>
<P>
 A wider racial gulf shows up on the question of whether the U.S. should 
provide economic aid to Haiti after democracy is restored. Blacks favor 
economic aid, 68% to 22%, while whites oppose the idea, 45% to 50%. Overall, 
49% of Americans favor aid, 46% oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite those signs of racial division, however, majorities of both blacks and 
whites reject the argument that Administration policy toward Haiti has been 
significantly affected by the fact that Haiti has an overwhelmingly black 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 Majorities of both whites, 72%, and blacks, 57%, say that Haitians' race has 
had "little effect" on Administration policy. Those whites who did think race 
played a role mostly think the impact has been for Haiti to receive more 
favorable treatment -- 16% of whites take that view, while only 2% think the 
opposite. Among blacks, opinion is more split, with 14% thinking Haiti received 
more favorable treatment because of race and 18% thinking the treatment has 
been less favorable. 
</P>
<P>
 Blacks are also somewhat more likely than whites to believe that Haiti will be 
successful in achieving a "stable democracy" -- although doubters outnumber 
believers among both groups. Overall, 62% of Americans, and of whites as well, 
say they are "doubtful" that Haiti can achieve a stable democracy, and only 32% 
are confident it will. 
</P>
<P>
 Among blacks, 48% say they are doubtful, and 45% say they are confident about 
Haiti's prospects for democracy. Republicans are far more skeptical than either 
Democrats or independents on that subject. Only 19% of Republicans say they are 
confident that stable democracy can be established in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Given that skepticism, it is not surprising that Americans are not enamored of 
Clinton's argument that the need to "restore democracy" justifies a U.S. 
military presence in Haiti. Only 45% of those polled say they think that was a 
good argument, while 47% said it was not good. Similarly, those polled reject, 
53% to 40%, the argument that the need to maintain U.S. credibility justified 
intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Americans do support the argument that the military presence is 
needed to "keep a flood of Haitian refugees from seeking to enter the United 
States." By 57% to 39%, those polled say that was a good argument. 
</P>
<P>
 The most widely supported argument in favor of intervention, however, is the 
need to "stop the human right abuses by the current military government." By a 
64%-32% margin, those polled say that was a good argument. Making Sense of

 The Times Poll interviewed 1,340 adults nationwide, by telephone, Sept. 20 and 
21. Telephone numbers were chosen from a list of all exchanges in the nation. 
Random-digit dialing techniques were used so that listed and non-listed numbers 
could be contacted. The sample was weighted slightly to conform with census 
figures for sex, race, age and education. The margin of sampling error for the 
total sample is plus or minus 3 percentage points. For certain sub-groups the 
error margin may be somewhat higher. Poll results can also be affected by other 
factors such as question wording and the order in which questions are 
presented.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; U.S. SENATE; FEINSTEIN PROTESTS NEWEST HUFFINGTON ADS; 
INCUMBENT SAYS SHE AGAIN IS FALSELY ACCUSED OF BEING SOFT ON CRIME. THE 
CHALLENGER INSISTS THE SENATOR'S RECORD SPEAKS FOR ITSELF, WHILE A POLL CALLS 
THE RACE A DEAD HEAT. 
</P>

<P>
 In chilling new political ads that graphically report details of a brutal 
Florida murder, Republican Senate candidate Mike Huffington on Thursday accused 
Sen. Dianne Feinstein of being soft on crime by supporting lenient judges. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein countered that the latest ads are further proof that Huffington's 
campaign has been based "on character assassination and name-calling from the 
very beginning." She also said her record as a tough crime fighter is backed by 
endorsements from most of the state's major law enforcement groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Huffington (R-Santa Barbara) prompted the latest exchange by launching 
newspaper and radio ads throughout California on Thursday criticizing 
Feinstein's votes last year to name former Florida Chief Justice Rosemary 
Barkett to the federal appellate court. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington complained that Barkett voted against the death penalty in several 
Florida cases, including a 1974 murder in which one of the men convicted of 
killing a teen-age boy later boasted of his role in a tape-recording sent to 
the victim's family. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's ads include a chilling excerpt from the killer's tape that said: 
"He was stabbed in the back, in the chest, and the stomach -- it was beautiful. 
I enjoyed every minute of it. I loved watching blood gush from his eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 The Florida Supreme Court in 1992 upheld Jacob Dougan's death sentence for 
killing Jacksonville teen-ager Steven Orlando. Barkett, Florida's first woman 
chief justice, joined a dissenting opinion that opposed the sentence because of 
Dougan's troubled past. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's attack came as tension in the U.S. Senate race increased again 
Thursday with the release of a new independent statewide poll showing the 
candidates locked in a dead heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Feinstein and Huffington were supported by 42% of the state's registered 
voters in the Field Poll. Among those voters most likely to cast a ballot in 
November, the survey found both candidates favored by 43%. The results reflect 
a sharp drop in Feinstein's support and an increase in Huffington's since last 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 A frustrated Feinstein complained Thursday that the poll finding is due to 
Huffington's enormous campaign spending on television commercials attacking her 
record. Feinstein charged that Thursday's ads are another example of the 
name-calling that has dominated her opponent'srace. 
</P>
<P>
 The senator argued that she has tried to run on her accomplishments in 
Washington. As evidence, she noted recent endorsements from Los Angeles County 
Sheriff Sherman Block and about a dozen police groups representing most of 
California law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "His campaign has really been based on character assassination and name 
calling from the very beginning," she said. ". . . I've been endorsed by 
virtually all, if not the dominant majority of law enforcement in the state, 
and I've been there and I've performed. He has done nothing except what his 
script writers write for him to say. This is what is so frustrating about this 
campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, in his attack Thursday, sought to counter Feinstein's claim that 
she has been effective at opposing crime. He also dismissed her support from 
police groups and individuals as political pay-backs that don't represent the 
opinions of rank-and-file members. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason I brought up the judge is because one of the most important things 
a Senator can do -- perhaps the most important thing -- is the appointment and 
the vote for a judge," Huffington said in an interview. "They sit there long 
after the senator retires. I think (Barkett) is a travesty. And that's where 
she and I differ so dramatically." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein voted to approve President Clinton's nomination of Barkett twice -- 
once in her role on the Senate Judiciary Committee and again when the 
appointment passed on the Senate floor last year, 61 to 37. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservative opponents of Barkett, who complain that the judge has a 
reputation for sympathy toward criminal defendants with troubled backgrounds, 
raised the Orlando murder case as an example during a six-hour debate on the 
Senate floor. Feinstein declined to comment on Barkett's decision in the matter 
since she has not reviewed details. 
</P>
<P>
 She noted, however, that Barkett voted to uphold the death penalty in more 
than 200 Florida cases she handled. The senator also said Barkett won election 
to the Florida court in 1992 and she was recommended for the federal bench by 
the state's two death penalty supporting senators -- Democrat Bob Graham and 
Republican Connie Mack. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's campaign responded with a report listing 17 death penalty cases 
opposed by Barkett since 1987. Huffington also reached back in Feinstein's 
past, as other Republican challengers have, to question her commitment to the 
death penalty because of her relationship with former California Chief Justice 
Rose Elizabeth Bird. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, who was living in Texas when voters rejected Bird because of her 
decisions against the death penalty, said in newspaper ads Thursday that the 
former justice presided at Feinstein's swearing in three times. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is an old albatross," Feinstein said. "Rose Bird is not on the 
Supreme Court. . . . This woman has retired. She is entitled to her retirement. 
My views on the death penalty and Rose Bird's are very different." Political

THE WASHINGTON CONNECTION / JAMES BORNEMEIER: CALIFORNIA'S INSIDE MAN AT THE 
WHITE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BORNEMEIER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As White House chief of staff, Leon E. Panetta is the President's gatekeeper 
and all-purpose emissary. He tries to intercept all the cries and whispers that 
bombard the presidency and forge an agenda out of them. He seeks nothing less 
than to regulate the message that gets into the Oval Office and the message 
that gets out. 
</P>
<P>
 But this modern-day chamberlain also has Ansel Adams' prints of the California 
coast on his office walls and Monterey memories in his head. And when his 
buddies from the California congressional delegation call, they get called 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 And when the topics are base closings, Border Patrol agents, smog checks or 
fairy shrimp, Panetta needs no tedious explanations to get him up to speed. 
</P>
<P>
 Base closing? Panetta witnessed the loss of Ft. Ord, the mammoth Army base in 
his former congressional district. Fairy shrimp designated an endangered 
species? Panetta knows that such federal declarations produce temblors of 
resentment among developers and farmers. Immigration? Panetta has seen the 
issue evolve in California from a beckoning of Mexican farm workers to 
widespread condemnation of them as the ruination of the state's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Does California have special pull in the West Wing of the White House? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like having one of your best friends in there," said Pam Barry, the 
executive director of the California Democratic Congressional Delegation in 
Washington. "He's been their peer for years. It's like a mutual admiration 
society." 
</P>
<P>
 When Panetta was named White House chief of staff in June, as replacement for 
Clinton's best friend Thomas (Mack) McLarty, the 15-year denizen of Capitol 
Hill was seen as a widely respected nice guy who knew all the ugly truths about 
Congress and could salve the itchy relations between the executive and 
legislative branches. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knew how the digestive tract of Congress works," said Rep. Jane Harman 
(D-Marina del Rey), employing a graphic but apt metaphor for the legislative 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps most important, having Panetta in the inner sanctum gave 
California members of Congress that quintessential Washingtonian cachet: 
access. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the real key," said Rep. Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento). "We had 
access under Mack, and this not a negative on Mack. But when we talk about the 
fairy shrimp as an endangered species Leon knows how that could be a problem 
for us." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration has long touted its special commitment to California, 
starting with numerous Californians in top jobs: Warren Christopher at State, 
Mickey Kantor as U.S. trade representative, Laura D'Andrea Tyson as chairwoman 
of the President's economic advisers, Panetta as budget director. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Panetta ascended to chief of staff, he is largely credited with bringing 
in former California congressman and political sage Tony L. Coelho to reign 
temporarily as Democratic Party chieftain. 
</P>
<P>
 The overall effect is that tending to California issues is a fundamental White 
House mission. With the state's enormous electoral power, there's little chance 
the California focus will blur any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, having Panetta as chief of staff brings even greater knowledge to 
bear on the state's problems," said Tom Epstein, White House political aide -- 
and former deputy California insurance commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Having Panetta's sympathetic and knowing ear is one thing, but does it yield 
any concrete results? 
</P>
<P>
 Epstein and others say yes and quickly point to key budget decisions made 
during Panetta's 17 months as head of the Office of Management and Budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration says that its fiscal 1995 budget has 32% more money than 
the last Bush budget for programs to help states with costs of legal and 
illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 With pressure from Panetta (and angry governors), Congress budgeted -- for the 
first time -- $130 million (the White House wanted $350 million) to offset some 
of the states' costs of incarcerating criminal illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Would these decisions have been made if Panetta had not been enlisted by 
Clinton? Perhaps. But it's clear that Panetta's brainy but unpompous style 
played extremely well within Clinton's inner circle, and that his California 
viewpoint quickly gained broad influence. 
</P>
<P>
 But this being Washington, Panetta must avoid the mistake of appearing too 
friendly toward his home state. After years of enduring anti-California tirades 
from House members from more serene states, Panetta knows the value of not 
crowing too loudly.

NEW STUDY ON IMMIGRATION CITES HIGH COST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. JACKSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Legal and illegal immigration are more costly for large states such as 
California than recently estimated by the Clinton Administration, according to 
a new study. 
</P>
<P>
 A report by the respected Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington-based 
think tank, said Thursday that immigrants in 1992 produced a net national 
deficit of $29.1 billion, borne mainly by California and six other states. The 
center compared the cost of social services and education against taxes and 
fees paid by immigrants to come up with the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 This estimate contrasts with a finding by the Urban Institute, in an 
Administration-commissioned study, that immigrants had in fact brought the 
United States a net benefit of $28.7 billion. However, the institute 
acknowledged that it costs California $1.28 billion annually to pay for the 
education of illegal immigrant children. 
</P>
<P>
 While adding fuel to the debate over illegal immigrants, the report by the 
generally conservative Center for Immigration Studies provided no cost estimate 
of California's burden or that of any other individual state. 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics compiled by the White House-commissioned study showed California 
and six other states -- Florida, Texas, New York, Illinois, Arizona and New 
Jersey -- spending more money on federally mandated programs than was collected 
in taxes from the overwhelmingly young and poor population of illegal 
immigrants, which the study estimated at 3.4 million nationwide as of October, 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 But the center's report said the Urban Institute's estimate of about 15.1 
million foreign-born residents -- both legal and illegal -- is "overly 
conservative." 
</P>
<P>
 "It sticks closely to census numbers, but unlike the Census Bureau, is not 
prepared to acknowledge an undercount that is especially high in the 
populations targeted in these studies," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The center estimated the total foreign-born population of the nation at 22 
million in mid-1992, or about 7 million more than the institute's figure. This 
gap makes it possible for some analysts to reduce costs associated with illegal 
immigrants by several billion dollars, the center said. 
</P>
<P>
 It said the institute also inflated tax revenues accruing from immigrant 
workers. The institute's estimates that the immigrant population contributes 
$24.2 billion in Social Security taxes and $9.28 billion in unemployment taxes 
and other levies is about $6.8 billion too high, the center said. 
</P>
<P>
 David Simcox, who helped author the report, said California "clearly bears the 
heaviest burden of all the states. It has more illegal aliens than other 
states, and on the whole they tend to be less educated. In addition, California 
is very generous with its social services." 
</P>
<P>
 George High, the center's executive director, told a news briefing, "This 
study is helpful to states because it shows that immigrants, indeed, are 
costly." 
</P>
<P>
 The report said that "until recently, conventional wisdom had it that 
immigrants in general were an economic boon to the host country. That wisdom 
has been challenged in lawsuits filed by California, Florida, Texas and other 
states, which effectively serve the federal government with a bill for hosting 
immigrants." 
</P>
<P>
 "Those legal processes are founded on the premise that immigrants -- both 
legal and illegal -- and their offspring are costly to provide with education, 
medical coverage and other benefits of our extensive social safety net." 
</P>
<P>
 California Gov. Pete Wilson, in a series of high-profile challenges to the 
Clinton Administration's handling of illegal immigrants, has estimated that 
they cost the state $3.4 billion annually but pay only $739 million in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's office has concluded that the average illegal immigrant household 
receives $7,760 in government services each year. To cover the costs of such 
services, the average household would have to earn $100,000, he has said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has pushed for passage of Proposition 187, a November state ballot 
measure that would deny most government services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracing the roots of the controversy, the report said: 
</P>
<P>
 "Stubborn high welfare dependency among refugees coming since the 1970s was 
recognized in the 1980s in congressional hearings and by the Department of 
Health and Human Services. But state governments did not make a major issue of 
it until the federal government began shifting much of the burden of public 
assistance to them in the late 1980s." 
</P>
<P>
 But it complimented Los Angeles County for its attention to the situation, 
noting that "during the 1980s, the office of the county administrator regularly 
compiled the rising costs of such services (to immigrants) as indigent medical 
care, Aid to Families With Dependent Children and Medicaid to illegal aliens."

WILSON SUES U.S. OVER IMMIGRANTS' 'INVASION'; POLITICS: GOVERNOR CALLS ON 
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO REIMBURSE THE STATE FOR THE COSTS OF EDUCATING 
UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN. LEGAL EXPERTS SAY THE CLAIM HAS ALMOST NO CHANCE OF 
SUCCEEDING. 
</P>

<P>
 Escalating the terms of the immigration debate, Gov. Pete Wilson contended in 
a new legal claim filed Thursday that illegal immigrants in California amount 
to an "invasion" the federal government is constitutionally obligated to repel. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, who was immediately criticized by immigrant advocates for stoking 
racial animosities, also upped the ante in his effort to wrest federal money 
for immigration costs from Washington, increasing his claim on behalf of the 
state to more than $10 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "California simply can't wait any longer," Wilson said in a statement released 
by his office. "Our borders are a sieve that makes a mockery of our laws and 
cripples our ability to shape our own destiny." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's latest legal action -- the third he has filed this year -- added 
education expenses to his earlier claims, in which he sought reimbursement for 
the cost of providing emergency health care to about 300,000 illegal immigrants 
annually and jailing about 18,000 illegal immigrants convicted of felonies in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor is seeking $5.4 billion for the cost of educating illegal 
immigrant children in the state since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's lawyers on Thursday combined the three lawsuits into one and added a 
new argument: that the presence of so many illegal immigrants here amounts to a 
foreign invasion of California. 
</P>
<P>
 "The massive and unlawful migration of foreign nationals . . . constitutes an 
invasion of the state of California against which the United States is 
obligated to protect California," the lawsuit says. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit cites Article IV, Section 4, of the Constitution, which states:  
</P>
<P>
 "The United States shall guarantee to every state in this union a republican 
form of government, and shall protect each of them against invasion." 
</P>
<P>
 In its earlier lawsuits, the Wilson Administration had cited the 
Constitution's guarantee of a republican form of government in arguing that the 
burden of serving illegal immigrants was so great that California, in effect, 
had been denied its sovereign right to govern its own affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Several constitutional scholars told The Times earlier this year that such 
reasoning was almost certain to be rejected by the federal courts, which have 
ruled for more than 140 years that arguments over that section of the 
Constitution are best settled in the political system, not the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 USC's Erwin Chemerinsky, a law professor who is an expert on states' rights 
issues, predicted Thursday that Wilson's latest legal salvo would meet the same 
fate. 
</P>
<P>
 "An invasion was clearly meant to mean a military invasion of the United 
States," Chemerinsky said. "There's no reason whatsoever to believe that the 
framers ever envisioned that invasion might be taken to mean illegal immigrants 
coming into the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 Others criticized the governor for using inflammatory arguments in an effort 
to aid his campaign for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some experts dispute the exact number of illegal immigrants in the 
state, critics note that even by Wilson's reckoning there were at least 1.3 
million when he took office in 1991. But they say the governor did not begin to 
focus on the problem until fellow Republican George Bush lost the presidency 
and was replaced by Democrat Bill Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just histrionics," said Charles Wheeler, director of the National 
Immigration Law Center in Los Angeles. "It's unfortunate that the governor 
would continue his explosive rhetoric that only serves to feed the fires of 
prejudice and fear in this state." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Wilson's Democratic opponent, state Treasurer Kathleen Brown, 
attacked the governor for hypocrisy, saying his efforts as a U.S. senator to 
help farmers bring migrant laborers into the country and keep them here made 
Wilson the "field general for this illegal invading force." 
</P>
<P>
 Aides to the governor said Wilson was well aware that his characterization of 
illegal immigrants as invaders could be "misinterpreted." They said Wilson did 
not mean to imply that immigrants were coming with hostile intent or that 
foreign governments were sending them here. 
</P>
<P>
 But they said he chose to do it anyway because lawyers said the argument would 
bolster his lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot be deterred from making the strongest case in court by others' 
interpretations of the words," said Leslie Goodman, Wilson's communications 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodman said Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles, a Democrat, used the argument in a 
similar lawsuit against the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's suit is scheduled for its first hearing in federal District Court in 
San Diego on Oct. 11. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Justice Department said the 
federal government's lawyers had not received the latest claim and could not 
respond until they had read it.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; GOVERNOR; CANDIDATES AT A STANDOFF IN FIGHT OVER 2 
DEBATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
 The standoff over gubernatorial debates continued Thursday, with Gov. Pete 
Wilson accepting an invitation to debate state Treasurer Kathleen Brown on Oct. 
14, while Brown announced that she plans to debate Wilson two days later, even 
if he doesn't show up. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Schnur, Wilson's chief campaign spokesman, said the governor has agreed to 
face Brown on KVIE-TV, a public broadcasting station in Sacramento, at 6:30 
p.m. on Oct. 14. Because Brown has said she will accept any debate invitation 
from a legitimate sponsor, Schnur said he was confident that the one-hour 
debate would take place, to be aired by public TV stations throughout the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so fast, said the Brown campaign, which has been skewering Wilson all week 
for his refusal to participate in a proposed Oct. 16 debate, hosted by the 
California Broadcasters Assn. and KGO-TV in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be delighted to accept KVIE only if and when Pete Wilson accepts 
(the) offer from the CBA," said Julie Buckner, a spokeswoman for Brown. Buckner 
accused Wilson of deliberately choosing a small TV station in a less populated 
media market to host the Oct. 14 debate. She called that "just another step in 
his continued strategy to delay, deny, defer, dodge and duck debates with 
Kathleen Brown." 
</P>
<P>
 Nine weeks of negotiations over the Oct. 16 debate broke down last week after 
the Wilson campaign insisted, among other things, on playing a role in choosing 
the panel of reporters who would ask questions. On Thursday, the CBA's 
executive committee announced that because they have spent a year planning the 
forum -- and because 25 TV stations and 11 radio stations have expressed 
interest in airing it -- they have decided to host it even if Wilson does not 
attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown immediately issued a statement urging Wilson to "stop hiding," and 
saying, "I'll be there; will he?" 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's campaign initially said no, neither the candidate nor a 
representative of the candidate would attend. 
</P>
<P>
 "The format is not acceptable," said Schnur, Wilson's spokesman, who has 
repeatedly derided the broadcasters' proposed format for having too many "bells 
and whistles" and other distractions. "This is a gubernatorial debate. It's not 
MTV. The only thing they haven't proposed is a sky cam." 
</P>
<P>
 But late in the day, the Wilson campaign reversed itself, announcing that a 
surrogate will attend the broadcasters' debate on Wilson's behalf: none other 
than Schnur. 
</P>
<P>
 A letter faxed to CBA Executive Director Vic Biondi from Larry Thomas, senior 
counsel to Wilson's campaign, advised that "Gov. Wilson will be represented by 
his campaign Press Secretary Dan Schnur, who is looking forward to the 
encounter." 
</P>
<P>
 John Whitehurst, Brown's press secretary, said Wilson's response "underscores 
the silliness and the insincerity that they have approached this whole debate 
process with." He said Brown would not debate Schnur, adding, "sending Dan 
Schnur to debate is like sending Gomer Pyle to fight a war."

FORMER MAYOR BRADLEY OPPOSES PROP. 187 IN RARE APPEARANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, all but hidden from public view since he 
retired after 20 years in charge at City Hall, made a rare public appearance 
Thursday to emphasize his opposition to state Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley, who now works for a Downtown law firm, said the fact that this is the 
first public matter on which he is taking such a visible stand gives "some 
indication of how concerned I am about this issue and how strongly I feel about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 First and foremost, he said, it is not fair to turn the children of illegal 
immigrants into scapegoats by ejecting them from public schools and denying 
them vital health services. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm concerned that 300,000 youngsters will be thrown out into the streets of 
this state because they are kicked out of school," said the former mayor. 
"These youngsters not only would be without education but would be without 
medical attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of us, of course, are concerned about illegal immigration. But Prop. 187 
doesn't solve that problem." 
</P>
<P>
 The morning news conference at the Biltmore, sponsored by Taxpayers Against 
187, hearkened back to years of news conferences in Bradley's City Hall suite. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the emotion of his words, Bradley, looking fit in a dark blue business 
suit, spoke in the familiar monotone with which he delivered so many messages 
during his long public tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley also proved that he remains deft at sidestepping questions he prefers 
not to answer, declaring that such issues as whether illegal immigration was a 
net plus or minus for the city while he was mayor were not germane to the 
discussion of Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 After the news conference formally concluded, Bradley told reporters that his 
"new life is wonderful," but declined comment on his successor, Richard 
Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, Bradley, saying that he is retired, has refused comment on 
other public matters, including requests for an assessment of the city's 
progress in recovering from the devastating 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, Bradley acknowledged that the fight to defeat Proposition 187 is "an 
uphill battle," but he said it is nonetheless important to speak out on the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that the people of this state need to know that this proposition is 
poorly drafted, is full of holes, will create enormous problems and in fact 
will not solve the key issue of illegal immigration." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the news conference, in which two Jewish community activists also 
decried the ballot measure, Federation for American Immigration Reform 
spokesman Ira Mehlman said Bradley's opposition would have "about as much 
(impact) as all these other groups." 
</P>
<P>
 The ballot measure, which would deny most government services to illegal 
immigrants and their children, is opposed by a broad coalition of education, 
health and law enforcement agencies including the state PTA, School Boards 
Assn. and California Teachers Assn. However, recent polls show support by more 
than 60% of the state's registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in Los Angeles, the board of directors of the Los Angeles Area 
Chamber of Commerce, after hearing pro and con arguments, voted Thursday to 
take no position on the ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took a firm stand not to take a stand," said spokeswoman Shannon Jones.

AMNESTY UNLIKELY FOR HAITI LEADERS; POLICY: ADMINISTRATION SAYS ONLY DEPOSED 
PRESIDENT CAN CONVENE PARLIAMENTARY SESSION TO CONSIDER PARDONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a narrow, new interpretation of the agreement that averted an American 
invasion of Haiti, the Clinton Administration said Thursday that it is very 
unlikely that Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras and other Haitian military leaders will get 
the amnesty from prosecution they are counting on to remain in the Caribbean 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Administration officials, only exiled President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide has the authority to call the Haitian Parliament into session to 
consider legislation giving blanket pardons to the military for crimes 
committed in the bloody Sept. 30, 1991, coup or in the three years of 
dictatorial rule that followed. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide, who says he is willing to extend amnesty for "political" crimes, 
such as treason and insurrection, but not for "common" crimes, such as murder 
and rape, is not expected to summon the Parliament in time to save his 
political enemies from jail or exile. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedras believed that before Aristide returned he would be granted amnesty by 
the existing Parliament, which includes members whose credentials are 
questionable because they were elected after the 1991 coup. 
</P>
<P>
 Without amnesty, Cedras and his lieutenants will face arrest if Aristide 
regains power, as he is scheduled to by Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 That would give the military leaders their choice of three very bleak options: 
</P>
<P>
 * They could stand trial on charges that probably would produce long prison 
terms or execution. 
</P>
<P>
 * They could leave the country for exile abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 * They could refuse to resign and try to hold onto power, a step that probably 
would be blocked by the vastly superior, 14,000-member American intervention 
force. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no immediate reaction from the Haitian military junta Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 The reinterpretation of the amnesty provision -- done unilaterally and which 
likely was most swiftly conveyed to Haiti via television news broadcasts -- was 
part of a concerted effort by the Administration to snatch away some of the 
concessions former President Jimmy Carter gave to Cedras and his deputy, Brig. 
Gen. Philippe Biamby, during arduous negotiations last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven-point agreement Carter reached with Cedras and Biamby on Sunday 
seemed to offer the Haitian generals far more than President Clinton was 
willing to give. 
</P>
<P>
 When Clinton dispatched Carter, retired Gen. Colin L. Powell and Sen. Sam Nunn 
(D-Ga.) to make one final diplomatic attempt to head off an imminent invasion, 
the President said the delegation could only discuss the "modalities" by which 
Cedras, Biamby and Lt. Col. Michel-Joseph Francois, the Port-au-Prince police 
chief, would surrender power and leave Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 The President said the three must go -- the only question was whether their 
departure would be peaceful or as a result of military force. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of sticking to his narrow mandate, Carter negotiated a deal that 
called for the three officers to retire from the military by Oct. 15. But it 
let them remain in their posts during the interim, and it did not require them 
to leave the country. The agreement also seemed to promise an immediate lifting 
of the economic embargo imposed by the U.N. Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton accepted the Carter plan because it allowed American forces to enter 
Haiti unopposed and because it permitted Aristide to regain the presidency 
within a little less than a month. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Administration officials said Thursday, the President ordered State 
Department lawyers to probe the pact for possible loopholes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration announced earlier this week that the economic embargo will 
remain in force until Aristide is back in power. The Carter-brokered agreement 
said the sanctions "will be lifted without delay in accordance with relevant 
U.N. resolutions." Those resolutions specify that the embargo will be lifted 
only after Aristide regains the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter's agreement to extend a blanket pardon to Cedras, Biamby, Francois and 
other members of the military caused more consternation. Aristide complained 
bitterly about that provision, which his advisers said could set the stage for 
a new coup. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Thursday, State Department spokesman Mike McCurry announced an 
Administration interpretation that finessed both the amnesty and exile issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "The arrangements that were made last Sunday included general amnesty, but 
that is very clearly one that has to be granted by the Haitian Parliament," 
McCurry said. "Since they are out of session at this point, it will be up to 
President Aristide to convoke a special session of the Haitian Parliament." 
</P>
<P>
 McCurry said the United States would question the legitimacy of any Parliament 
convened by Emile Jonassaint, the Haitian president who was installed by the 
military earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Administration officials said William H. Gray III, Clinton's special 
envoy on Haiti issues, outlined the Administration's interpretation to Aristide 
on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The exiled president, pleased with the construction, endorsed the plan later 
in the day, ending a two-day sulk during which he pointedly failed to thank 
American officials for their efforts.

U.S. FORCE TO STAY IN HAITI AT LEAST THROUGH DECEMBER; MILITARY: WITHDRAWAL IS 
NOT LIKELY BEFORE ELECTIONS. COSTS COULD REACH $250 MILLION BY YEAR'S END. 
</P>

<P>
 The Clinton Administration said Thursday that the 14,000-member U.S. force it 
is assembling in Haiti will remain on the island at least through December and 
could cost up to $250 million to maintain through that period alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Secretary William J. Perry said the Administration was unlikely to 
begin withdrawing even a part of the force before the Haitian elections in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
 Even then, he said, it could take longer before the bulk of the contingent 
withdraws. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry's new estimates were the first formal indications that the 
Administration has given of how long and how costly the Haitian expedition may 
be. The secretary spoke while on an inspection tour at the Norfolk, Va., naval 
base.  
</P>
<P>
 Perry said the Administration probably will submit a supplemental budget 
request of $50 million to cover the first phase of the operation, through 
fiscal 1994, which ends Sept. 30. The remaining $200 million will be sought as 
part of the fiscal 1995 budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The hefty cost of the operation was considered likely to trouble congressional 
conservatives, who have been complaining that the Administration's military 
ventures in Third World trouble spots have been sapping money from 
military-preparedness programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides spending on the Haiti mission, the Administration already has laid out 
$1.4 billion for the American venture in Somalia, $267 million for U.S. forces 
in Macedonia, $124 million for the deployment to Rwanda and $106 million for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 It has also spent tens of millions of dollars on the recent effort to rescue 
and house Haitian and Cuban refugees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 The 14,000-strong U.S. force in Haiti is scheduled to remain on the island 
until it has secured the country for the return of exiled President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide and helped retrain the Haitian army and police force. 
The U.S. contingent will then give way to a 6,000-member peacekeeping force 
that is to include 2,000 Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry said the American force in Haiti was to have grown to about 11,000 
troops by late Thursday night, with 3,000 more expected today or early 
Saturday. He said Haiti was now in a "transition phase" before the 
multinational operation begins. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior Pentagon official told reporters Thursday that advance troops from 
Caribbean countries -- the first part of the multinational force -- will begin 
arriving this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 But Perry cautioned that American troops may be forced to remain in Haiti well 
past the end of the year, if the effort to overhaul the Haitian military and 
police forces does not go as well as hoped. "We never envisioned it as a piece 
of cake," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials said that from all indications, it appeared that the 
Haitian military was continuing to cooperate Thursday, after some tensions over 
the excessive use of force by the island's police squads on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department said Thursday that it had dispatched its first 
contingent to Haiti to locate sites where Haitian police found not to have 
taken part in human rights abuses can be trained under a department program. 
</P>
<P>
 The training, to be provided under the International Criminal Investigative 
Training Assistance Program, a Justice Department effort funded by the Agency 
for International Development, will cover two areas -- one in criminal 
investigation techniques, including forensics, fingerprinting and handling of 
criminal evidence, and the other in police ethics and civil rights.

U.S. RULES OF ENGAGEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. military's "rules of engagement" for its troops in Haiti, as 
published in the Haitian Herald, a U.S. military newsletter: Rules of 
Engagement: 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing in the ROE limits your right to use necessary force to defend 
yourself, your fellow service members, your unit, other JTF (joint task force) 
personnel, key facilities and property designated by your commander. 
</P>
<P>
 1.Repel hostile acts with necessary force, including deadly force. Use only 
the amount of force needed to protect lives/property and accomplish the 
mission. Engage targets with observed, direct, deliberately-aimed fire. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Do not hesitate to respond with force against hostile acts and signs of 
hostile intent. 
</P>
<P>
 3. You may use necessary force to stop, disarm, and detain members of the 
Haitian military, police, other armed persons, or other persons committing 
hostile acts or showing hostile intent. Stop and detain other persons who 
interfere with your mission. Evacuate detainees to a designated location for 
release to proper authorities. Treat all detainees humanely. 
</P>
<P>
 4. When a tactical situation permits, you should give a challenge before using 
deadly force. Challenge by 
</P>
<P>
 a. Shouting in English: "U.S. STOP OR I WILL FIRE!" 
</P>
<P>
 b. Shouting in Creole: "U.S. KANPE OUBIEN MAP TIRE!" (Phoenetic: "U.S.,kaHnpey 
oobeeEH(n)mahp tEErey!") 
</P>
<P>
 c. Fire warning shots into the air. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Treat all persons with dignity and respect. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Do not take private property without your commander's permission. 
</P>
<P>
 7. Remember: No force has been declared hostile, including the Haitian Army 
and police. Use of deadly force must be based on hostile acts or clear 
indications of hostile intent.

U.S. WON'T REVAMP NUCLEAR ARMS POLICIES; NATIONAL SECURITY: CLINTON AGREES NOT 
TO ACCELERATE REDUCTIONS IN FORCES, STOCKPILES DUE TO RUSSIA'S INSTABILITY. 
CRITICS CALL STANCE 'COLD WAR LITE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 President Clinton has decided to continue the nation's current nuclear weapons 
policies essentially unchanged, despite earlier suggestions by some officials 
that he might cut U.S. nuclear forces more sharply, the Pentagon said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision, which the President made last Friday at a meeting with his 
national security advisers, follows the recommendations of a yearlong Pentagon 
review aimed at hammering out a new role for nuclear weapons in the wake of the 
Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, senior Administration officials had suggested that the study, begun 
by former Defense Secretary Les Aspin, call on the Administration to radically 
revamp the nation's nuclear forces, reduce the number of nuclear weapons in the 
U.S. arsenal and possibly pledge not to be the first to launch a nuclear 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Aspin's successor, William J. Perry, argued that the current 
instability in Russia -- which raises the possibility that a totalitarian 
government might one day resume power -- still is too great to permit the 
United States to reduce its arsenal more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's decision essentially postpones indefinitely any new nuclear 
arms-reduction talks with Moscow beyond the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaties I 
and II, which already have been negotiated. START II still has not been 
ratified either by Russia or the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, however, the policy would provide a hedge against whatever 
transpires in Russia by allowing Washington either to speed up its 
arms-reduction efforts, or recall some warheads from reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials speeded up the study so that the decision would be 
completed in time for the summit meeting Clinton is to hold Tuesday and 
Wednesday with Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin. Arms-control issues are high 
on the agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Unclear for the moment was what impact the Administration's refusal to reduce 
the U.S. arsenal further would have in the push to win renewal of the 
international Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Third World countries have warned that they plan to insist that the current 
nuclear powers take additional steps to reduce their nuclear armaments before 
they will support a renewal. Extending -- and possibly strengthening -- the 
treaty is one of Clinton's key goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Arms-control advocates reacted sharply to the President's decision. The 
Natural Resources Defense Council issued a statement branding the policy "Cold 
War lite." If Clinton really fears Russian instability, it said, he should 
speed up weapons destruction, not slow it. 
</P>
<P>
 But Perry insisted that the policy is on target, asserting that it was only 
prudent to provide some hedges in the face of current uncertainties. He added 
that Moscow was visibly behind schedule in reducing its nuclear arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the major elements of Clinton's decision: 
</P>
<P>
 * Reduction of U.S. nuclear weapons will continue on its current schedule, 
with Washington cutting its 6,000-warhead arsenal to about 3,500 under the 
START II treaty -- enough to destroy some 2,500 Russian targets. 
</P>
<P>
 * The nation will continue its nuclear "triad," in which some nuclear warheads 
are carried by bombers, submarines and intercontinental ballistic missiles. 
Some analysts had suggested that the Administration destroy all its land-based 
missiles because they are so vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 * The strategic nuclear force will be reduced at the current pace. The study 
calls for retaining 14 Trident submarines, four fewer than present levels, 66 
B-52 bombers instead of the 94 planned, and 450 to 500 of the 600 Minuteman III 
missiles with single warheads now on hand. 
</P>
<P>
 * The United States will continue to refuse to pledge that it will not be the 
first to launch a nuclear strike, even though Moscow has announced a 
no-first-use policy. The Pentagon argued that the uncertainty serves as a 
deterrent to would-be aggressors. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said the proposals for more radical reductions, 
advocated by Aspin's staff and by some members of the National Security 
Council, were rejected by military leaders, who campaigned vigorously to head 
off any significant cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 And Pentagon officials said Perry himself moved to alter an earlier version of 
the plan in order to increase the number of warheads that the United States 
would retain. There were no immediate details on what the lower figure would 
have mandated.

AMES' WIFE SEEKS POSTPONEMENT OF SENTENCING ON LESSER SPY COUNTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From a Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
 The wife of convicted CIA spy Aldrich H. Ames asked Thursday that her 
sentencing this morning on lesser espionage charges be postponed for 30 days 
because she has hired a new defense lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal prosecutors did not object, and U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton 
granted her request.Rosario Ames, 41, who entered a guilty plea along with her 
husband in April, gave no reason for her change of attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources close to the case said no problems had arisen during interrogation 
sessions with Aldrich Ames, and that Rosario Ames simply got "cold feet" as she 
approached her sentencing and "wanted a second opinion from another lawyer." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the couple's negotiated plea agreement, Aldrich Ames, 52, received 
a sentence of life imprisonment without parole but Rosario Ames was scheduled 
to be sentenced today to a lenient term of about five years. Federal sources 
said the lighter term was virtually assured because Aldrich Ames had given 
"full cooperation" to the government in disclosing his activities in recent 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 John P. Hume, Rosario Ames' new lawyer, said his client has no intention of 
changing her guilty plea.

 Three Rottweilers killed a 900-pound elk at a zoo and then lunged at the 
curator before escaping through a hole they had dug under a fence. 
</P>
<P>
 The dogs, which did not injure the curator, went toward a road where children 
awaited a school bus but did not go near the youngsters, the curator said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dogs' owner picked them up near the zoo after hearing news reports. The 
owner probably won't face criminal charges, police said.

POPE CANCELS VISIT TO U.S., SPEECH TO U.N.; RELIGION: THE VATICAN SAYS JOHN 
PAUL NEEDS TO RECOVER FROM LAST SPRING'S SURGERY ON HIS LEG. THE ANNOUNCEMENT 
IS LIKELY TO FUEL MORE RUMORS OF ILL HEALTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak, and Pope John Paul II 
reluctantly heeded his doctors Thursday, scrapping a scheduled October trip to 
the United States and a speech to the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vatican called it a postponement and said the Pope needs more time to 
fully recover from surgery last spring to repair a broken right leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the cancellation can only serve to fuel rumors already rife at the 
Vatican that the 74-year-old pontiff is in failing health. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is exclusively because of his leg. It is a question of mobility, not 
health. There is no other reason," spokesman Joaquin Navarro said. "The Holy 
Father will continue his full activities at the Vatican in a busy month ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 While Vatican and American planners had begun pruning back the Pope's U.S. 
schedule, the cancellation came as a surprise. It underlined concerns for one 
of the most vigorous pontiffs -- and the most widely traveled -- in history. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doctors said it would be better not to tire him out too much, to give the leg 
a chance to fully heal," Navarro said. The trip is now at least nominally 
postponed until November, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Church sources say John Paul has been a fitful and impatient therapy patient. 
Over the summer he is said not to have worked as hard at rehabilitating leg 
muscles as therapists who visit him daily would have liked. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pope, who has been walking with obvious difficulty despite the aid of a 
cane, was to have flown to New York on Oct. 20 for an address to the U.N. 
General Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans called for him to meet President Clinton there and on successive days to 
preside at outdoor masses and celebrations at Shea Stadium and Yonkers Raceway 
in New York; at Giants Stadium in New Jersey, and at Camden Yards in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 John Paul, who tripped last Nov. 11 and broke his right shoulder, fell in his 
Vatican bathroom April 28, breaking his right leg at the hip. He appeared early 
in the summer to have made good progress from surgery in which a prosthesis was 
inserted to replace the shattered head of his thigh bone. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Pope returned from a mountain vacation at the end of August, 
however, he has walked with increasing difficulty, alarming aides and onlookers 
alike during a Sept. 10-11 visit to Croatia and on a 24-hour pastoral call last 
weekend in the southern Italian city of Lecce. 
</P>
<P>
 Navarro said the Pope had heeded with disappointment but good humor his 
doctors' urgings to abandon the U.S. trip. The doctors are confident that the 
Pope will fully recover within the six-month postoperative period they 
originally foresaw, Navarro said. 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond L. Flynn, U.S. ambassador to the Vatican, said the Clinton 
Administration regrets the cancellation. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would have been received warmly by Catholics and non-Catholics alike for 
his moral leadership," Flynn said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two broken bones in five months and John Paul's grim visage of late have 
contributed to rumors of his increasing ill health. In recent months, the 
Vatican has been forced to deny reports that the Polish pontiff has Parkinson's 
disease, that he has bone cancer, that he is prone to fainting spells. 
</P>
<P>
 John Paul was to have gone to Sicily on the day he broke his leg last spring. 
Subsequently, he was forced to cancel a trip to Belgium and, for security 
reasons, a hoped-for visit to Sarajevo, the capital of war-torn 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Navarro said, the Pope hopes to resume travels that have taken him to 
more than 100 countries with a weekend visit to Sicily in early November and a 
long trip to Asia in January.

NATO RETALIATES, BOMBS SERB TANK IN BOSNIA; BALKANS: AIR STRIKES ARE LAUNCHED 
AFTER A FRENCH SOLDIER IS SERIOUSLY WOUNDED IN A REBEL ATTACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 NATO warplanes on Thursday punished a Bosnian Serb attack on U.N. troops by 
bombing an unmanned tank near Sarajevo, increasing tension in the troubled 
peacekeeping mission and reminding a world distracted by other crises that war 
still rages in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
 The air strikes, carried out at dusk by American and British aircraft, were 
provoked by a Serbian attack on French troops earlier in the day, NATO 
officials said. In that incident, four rocket-propelled grenades were fired at 
a light-tank unit northeast of the Bosnian capital. One French soldier was 
seriously wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 The NATO action was called for by French Gen. Bertrand de Lapresle, the U.N. 
Protection Force commander, "to prove that he would not take the attack on the 
French tank lying down," said squadron leader Maj. Nigel Branston, a spokesman 
at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's headquarters for southern Europe in 
Naples, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 But the air strike threatened to widen a rift between NATO countries with 
peacekeeping forces deployed in Bosnia-Herzegovina and others -- chiefly the 
United States -- that have been pressing for tougher measures against the 
defiant Serbs without the same fear of consequences for troops on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 French and British soldiers serving with the U.N. mission in Bosnia have 
become the chief targets of angry Serbs as pressure builds in Western countries 
for an end to a U.N. arms embargo that has severely disadvantaged the 
Muslim-led Bosnian government. 
</P>
<P>
 British Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, commander of U.N. troops in Bosnia, opposes any 
moves the rebels would see as outside forces taking sides against them, such as 
air strikes or seeking to arm the government forces. Rose has repeatedly 
declined to use force to compel the Serbs to honor weapons-exclusion zones 
proclaimed around Sarajevo and the eastern town of Gorazde. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbian forces also routinely violate a "no-fly" zone declared over Bosnia. 
Paul Risley, a spokesman at U.N. headquarters in Zagreb, Croatia, said U.N. 
observers have reported "scores of sorties" by Bosnian Serb helicopters to 
battlefronts in the republic's northeast. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's air strike was carried out by NATO aircraft flying over Bosnia in 
what are usually symbolic patrols. 
</P>
<P>
 De Lapresle called on NATO to retaliate for the attack on the French unit, 
prompting alliance commanders in Naples to order pilots near Sarajevo to find 
and destroy a previously identified target, a T-55 tank deployed about two 
miles from the U.N.-controlled airport in violation of the weapons-exclusion 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. A-10 Warthog, the air combat workhorse dubbed the "tank-buster," 
located the tank and ran a strafing sortie at 6:25 p.m. The pilot reported back 
that he was unsure he had hit the target shrouded in shadows, Branston said. 
Two British Jaguars then swept the area near the Serbian base at Lukavica, each 
dropping a 1,000-pound bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no final report on damages," Branston said. "The (U.S.) cannon fire 
was thought to have missed, but the 1,000-pound bombs hit on or very near to 
the target." 
</P>
<P>
 He said no casualties were believed to have been incurred on the Serbian side 
because the tank was chosen by De Lapresle "on the basis that there would be no 
loss of life, because there had been no loss of life on the U.N. side." 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. commanders have become fearful of the precarious position in which the 
foreign troops deployed in Bosnia find themselves as pressure builds to end the 
lopsided arms embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has warned that it will press the U.N. Security 
Council to exempt the Bosnian government unless the Serbian rebels agree to an 
internationally mediated peace plan by Oct. 15. Washington has also suggested 
that it may act unilaterally to arm the outgunned government forces if Security 
Council allies refuse to go along. 
</P>
<P>
 There were indications that the latest air strike, at least in part, reflects 
the tougher stance in favor of NATO action in Bosnia reportedly being pressed 
by the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 According to NATO sources, the Administration wants to be able to point to a 
more aggressive alliance response to Serbian violations as a way to persuade 
Congress to give up its plan to vote for a unilateral lifting of the arms 
embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 Western diplomats in this Austrian capital say they detect serious resistance 
in the Pentagon and in some parts of the White House to any action that could 
sour relations with NATO allies. 
</P>
<P>
 Many fear that ending the embargo will intensify Bosnia's blood bath and force 
U.N. troops to pull out of the region to avoid being attacked or taken hostage 
by resentful Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Air power has been used only four times previously against the Serbs: once in 
February, when four aircraft violating the "no-fly" zone were shot down; twice 
in April to slow a rebel assault against Muslim civilians in Gorazde after 
hundreds had been killed in the purportedly U.N.-protected "safe area," and on 
Aug. 5, when U.S. warplanes shot up an antiquated mobile gun near Sarajevo 
after rebels had seized tanks and armored vehicles from a U.N.-guarded weapons 
containment site.

CANADIAN MINISTER BOOED AT PROTEST AGAINST GUN CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG TURNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a dramatic example of the increasing clout of the gun lobby in Canada, 
thousands rallied on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Thursday to protest proposed 
new firearm restrictions and to boo the federal justice minister as he tried to 
defend them. 
</P>
<P>
 The rally drew a crowd estimated by police at 10,000 and showed that while gun 
control opponents may be in retreat in the United States, they are on the 
advance here. 
</P>
<P>
 With a wave of organizing, public protests, lobbying and political activity 
this summer, they have forced the Liberal Party government into a public debate 
over its anti-gun campaign -- despite overwhelming support in the polls for 
tighter limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Canada already has much tougher gun laws and far lower crime rates than the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 But a series of highly publicized gun killings this spring and summer, 
including the first murder of a Toronto police officer in six years, prompted 
Justice Minister Allan Rock to announce plans for new gun control legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Drafting of the bill is not complete. But the proposed law likely would: 
extend national registration from handguns to all firearms; ban some assault 
weapons; increase penalties for using a gun in a crime. Rock has also not ruled 
out prohibition of handgun ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, a pro-gun lobby materialized in Canada's mountain, prairie and 
farm regions, barraging members of Parliament with mail and threatening to 
defeat those who vote for new gun laws. The advocates refuse to equate gun laws 
with crime control and argue that registration could lead to confiscation. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Thom, Canadian gold medalist in the pistol shoot at the 1984 Olympics in 
Los Angeles, told the rally Thursday, "We speak all kinds of languages, but our 
common language, Mr. Rock, is crime control, not gun control." 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Ouellette, a rally organizer from Toronto, said in an interview: 
"Government is constantly pushing more gun legislation, saying we need to 
control crime, but we've had gun legislation for years and we're not 
controlling crime. It's come to the point where we just don't trust the 
politicians anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 When Rock tried to address the rally Thursday, he was met with catcalls, boos 
and chants. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not out to take away your hunting rifles," Rock said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before Thursday's rally, gun control opponents had won the public backing 
of a handful of Liberal Party backbenchers in Parliament, who have threatened 
to break with the government over the bill. Further restrictions are also 
opposed by the conservative, Western-based Reform Party. 
</P>
<P>
 There does not appear to be enough opposition to kill the bill, but it might 
not go as far as it otherwise would have. 
</P>
<P>
 Wendy Cukier, president of the Toronto-based Coalition for Gun Control, sees 
the influence of the National Rifle Assn. in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tactics being employed now are very similar to the NRA's style," she said 
in an interview Thursday. "I'm sure the American gun lobby is very concerned 
that our example not be used to further controls there." 
</P>
<P>
 To legally buy a rifle or shotgun in Canada under current law, purchasers must 
be at least 18 years old, pass a government-approved safety course, obtain a 
$50 firearm acquisition certificate from police and undergo a background check. 
There is a 28-day waiting period between ordering guns and taking possession. 
</P>
<P>
 Buying a handgun is more difficult. Besides having a firearm acquisition 
certificate, buyers need a restricted-weapon permit. They are difficult to 
obtain and are registered with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

ACCUSED AMERICAN SAYS HE SPIED FOR U.S.; GERMANY: ONETIME CAMPUS RADICAL WAS 
ARRESTED ON SUSPICION HE PASSED SECRETS TO FORMER COMMUNIST EAST. HE ARGUES HE 
WAS DOUBLE AGENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An American social scientist arrested last spring on suspicion of spying for 
the Communist government of former East Germany claimed Thursday that he had 
indeed been a spy, but a double agent for the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Schevitz, a former campus radical from Berkeley and an employee of 
Germany's Nuclear Research Center in Karlsruhe since 1980, told reporters that 
he had passed information on both the East and West German governments to the 
United States for more than a decade through a former director of the Aspen 
Institute Berlin, an American think tank. 
</P>
<P>
 Schevitz, 53, said he went to work for the East German Ministry for State 
Security -- the Stasi -- after moving to Berlin in 1976 at the suggestion of 
his alleged handler, Aspen Institute Berlin's director, Shepard Stone. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Stone also sought intelligence on the West German government on such 
issues as the West's desire to acquire nuclear weapons, "Ostpolitik" (the 
West's policy of opening up to the East) and Stasi infiltration in Bonn. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone, director of the institute from 1974 to 1988, died in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Aspen Institute Berlin's current chief, David Anderson, said in a statement 
that it is "inconceivable that (Stone) was involved in espionage activities 
while director of Aspen Berlin." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Embassy officials in Bonn said they would not comment on Schevitz's case 
because it is a matter before the German courts. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, the Central Intelligence Agency followed its rule of refusing 
to confirm or deny Schevitz's allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department official Dan Hamilton, who worked at the Aspen Institute 
Berlin in the 1980s, said Schevitz had tried to contact him there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I referred his calls to the embassy's consular section," Hamilton said. "I 
had absolutely no contact with him." 
</P>
<P>
 He called Schevitz's allegations "a clear sign of a really desperate person." 
Of the entire list of allegations, he said: "It's just not true." 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of Germans have been arrested as Stasi spies since German 
reunification in 1990, but Schevitz is the first American. He was detained last 
May for allegedly passing information to the Stasi between 1977 and 1989, and 
released on about $65,000 bail on Sept. 6. He has not been formally charged -- 
a lengthy process in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not guilty of the accusation made against me that I was an espionage 
agent for the former East Germany, because from 1974 -- almost two years before 
I moved to Germany -- until May, 1990, I have worked exclusively for, and under 
the instructions from, a representative of United States intelligence, and I 
want that to be known," Schevitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was going public about his intelligence work because American 
intelligence officials had not intervened on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 Schevitz said he had received "expenses" from both Stone and the Stasi, but no 
salary or payment from either one for his espionage work. 
</P>
<P>
 Schevitz said he was approached by the CIA at Princeton University in 1962, 
but was unable to join because of serious diabetes. He said he met Stone in 
1974 and was recruited by him into intelligence work the following year before 
he moved to Berlin to take a job at the Free University. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Stone told him that they would pursue "a two-pronged strategy" of 
gathering information on East and West Germany in the interests of European 
stability. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is why it's difficult for U.S. authorities to admit I was working for 
them. We had some goals regarding West Germany," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone did not work directly for the CIA, Schevitz said, but "worked and sent 
information where it was appropriate to be sent." He said he believed that 
Stone passed the information he gathered on to the State Department for use by 
various intelligence agencies.  
</P>
<P>
 Schevitz said that he never had any contact with other case officers and that 
he is seeking access to "Stone's files" at the CIA to use in his defense. 
</P>
<P>
 In East Germany, Schevitz said, he was to gather information on the structure 
of the intelligence services, to develop a profile of the kind of recruits East 
Germany sought and to inform on the kind of information the East Germans sought 
from West Germany.

LOOTING REPORTED IN WAKE OF ERUPTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Against a backdrop of thick smoke pouring from two erupted volcanoes, police 
and soldiers fired warning shots Thursday to deter looters from the disaster 
zone in Rabaul. 
</P>
<P>
 The volcanoes belched millions of tons of rock and ash onto the lush, green 
port city on the Bismarck Sea, 500 miles northeast of Port Moresby, considered 
one of the most beautiful spots in the South Pacific.Two deaths were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Thursday, an Australian scientist cabled American colleagues that half of 
the massive Vulcan cone, one of the two erupting peaks, had collapsed into the 
sea, sending ash, smoke and debris directly over Rabaul and causing widespread 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 The scientist, Kevin Vang of Mark McQuarie University in Sydney, said it was 
the most spectacular explosion yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all of Rabaul's 30,000 residents and people from nearby villages fled 
Monday when Vulcan and Tavurvur volcanoes erupted.

TIMES BOOK PRIZES ANNOUNCED; MALOUF WINS FOR NOVEL; HONORS: GILMORE IS 
BIOGRAPHY WINNER FOR 'SHOT IN THE HEART.' CHAUNCEY TAKES HISTORY AWARD FOR HIS 
WORK ON GAY LIFESTYLE IN NEW YORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Authors writing on topics as diverse as Australia, genocide, gay New York, 
family pathology, diplomacy, evolution and life behind the Iron Curtain won the 
1994 Los Angeles Times Book Prizes, it was announced Thursday at a ceremony for 
publishers. 
</P>
<P>
 The award for fiction was given to David Malouf for "Remembering Babylon," a 
novel set in Australia in the 1840s. Malouf examines the reactions of English 
settlers to a 29-year-old Scottish castaway who had been wandering with the 
aborigines for 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The book was hailed by reviewers as a haunting, powerful work noteworthy for 
its exquisite use of language. Malouf, of Lebanese and British ancestry, has 
focused on issues of Australian identity during his 35-year literary career. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikal Gilmore was selected the biography winner for "Shot in the Heart," his 
painful and riveting story of family pathology. The author's brother, Gary, was 
executed by a firing squad in Utah for slaying two men. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikal Gilmore, a contributing editor of Rolling Stone magazine, looked at his 
family as an outsider, chronicling the physical violence and verbal abuse that 
his father wreaked upon his mother, three older brothers and the author 
himself. The dark tale was impossible to put down, according to a Los Angeles 
Times reviewer. 
</P>
<P>
 George Chauncey won the history prize for his work "Gay New York: Gender, 
Urban Culture and the Making of the Gay Male World 1890-1940." The book began 
as Chauncey's doctoral dissertation at Yale University and explores how gay men 
created a complex and sophisticated urban subculture complete with codes of 
manner, dress and speech. 
</P>
<P>
 It documents laws and conventions before World War I that affected homosexuals 
and depicts an era in which gays were the vogue and heterosexuals flocked to 
gay bars and costume balls. After Prohibition, backlash developed against gay 
life. Chauncey teaches American history at the University of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Winners of the 1994 book prizes, which were announced at a reception for 
publishers at the Mark Hotel on Manhattan's Upper East Side, receive a $1,000 
award. The winning authors will be honored at a ceremony in Los Angeles on Nov. 
11. 
</P>
<P>
 In the poetry category, Carolyn Forche won for "The Angel of History," her 
collection of four long poems which recreate personal and public nightmares of 
totalitarianism, abandonment, warfare and genocide from the Nazi concentration 
camps of World War II to "ethnic cleansing" in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Derek Walcott, who won the Nobel Prize for literature, called her poetry 
"suddenly important like the morning news" but with a "natural light that makes 
beauty political by its endurance." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Angel of History" is her fourth collection. Her first, "Gathering the 
Tribes" won the Yale Younger Poets Award and her second, "The Country Between 
Us," won the Lamont Poetry Prize, a major American literary award. 
</P>
<P>
 Forche, who has worked for National Public Radio and Amnesty International, 
lives in Maryland with her husband, who is a photojournalist. 
</P>
<P>
 In the category of current interest, former Secretary of State Henry A. 
Kissinger won for his 900-page analysis "Diplomacy," tracing the evolution of 
nations from the Thirty Years' War of the 17th Century to the present day. A 
major theme in the book is that in the post-Cold War world, the United States 
needs to balance the traditional idealism of its foreign policy with a healthy 
sense of national interest in the diplomatic tradition of European nations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Economist, in a review, called Kissinger's book "a massive, elegant and 
provocative tome." 
</P>
<P>
 The award in the science and technology category was given to Jonathan Weiner 
for "The Beak of the Finch: A Story of Evolution in Our Time." Weiner describes 
the work of Peter and Rosemary Grant, biologists who have spent more than two 
decades weighing, measuring and observing more than 20 generations of finches 
on a tiny island in the Galapagos. 
</P>
<P>
 The book, which reviewers said reads both like an adventure and a detective 
story, also looks at modern-day evolution among a wide assortment of living 
creatures. Weiner is a former magazine editor and the author of two earlier 
books. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last four years, The Times has recognized a promising young writer 
with the Art Seidenbaum Award, in memory of the newspaper's book editor from 
1978 to 1984 who founded the book prizes. The award for a first published work 
of fiction was given to Martin M. Simecka for "The Year of the Frog." 
</P>
<P>
 Drawing on his own life for the narrative, Simecka tells the story of Milan, a 
young Slovak who is denied access to a university education because his father 
is in jail for criticizing the Communist government. 
</P>
<P>
 The novel, first published in serial form in an underground journal, explores 
the sensitive youth's coming of age against the background of a repressive 
regime.

TAPES OF CISNEROS, EX-GIRLFRIEND PROBED; INVESTIGATION: JUSTICE DEPT. STUDYING 
ALLEGATIONS THAT HUD SECRETARY MAY HAVE MISLED FBI BEFORE HIS APPOINTMENT. 
INQUIRY MAY LEAD TO SPECIAL COUNSEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Justice Department is reviewing tape recordings made secretly by HUD 
Secretary Henry G. Cisneros' former lover to determine whether to open a formal 
inquiry that could lead to appointment of a special counsel to look into 
allegations she has raised against him, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said the investigation centers on accusations made by Linda Medlar 
that Cisneros may have misled the FBI before his appointment as secretary of 
Housing and Urban Development. The statements at issue dealt with the extent 
and nature of financial payments he made to her after their affair ended in a 
public scandal in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 If the inquiry leads to the appointment of a special counsel, it would become 
the third such special investigation now aimed at the Administration. Special 
prosecutors are currently conducting one probe directed at President Clinton's 
personal investment in the Whitewater resort development in Arkansas and 
another focusing on allegations that Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy took 
prohibited gratuities from businesses regulated by his department. 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros' attorney, Seagal Wheatly of San Antonio, said in an interview that 
the secretary welcomes the Justice Department inquiry and expects it will lay 
to rest the specter of wrongdoing that Medlar has generated by filing suit 
against Cisneros and by her sale of the taped conversations to the television 
show "Inside Edition." The Justice Department is reviewing copies of those 
tapes, which were made available to news organizations by "Inside Edition." 
</P>
<P>
 "We intend to fully cooperate as expeditiously as possible," Wheatly said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Cisneros has not yet been contacted by Justice or the FBI, Wheatly 
said, he and his client were questioned in detail last week about Medlar's 
allegations by White House counsel Lloyd N. Cutler. He said Cutler was 
primarily interested in Medlar's lawsuit alleging that Cisneros owes her money. 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros could not be reached by The Times for comment Thursday, but he was 
quoted by the Associated Press as saying his payments to Medlar were not 
improper. "I don't believe providing a person assistance can be called 
unethical, or that trying to help someone who said they needed work is 
unethical," Cisneros said. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news briefing on Thursday, Atty. Gen. Janet Reno declined to comment when 
asked if the taped conversations conflict with what Cisneros told the FBI about 
the payments to Medlar. But Carl Stern, Reno's chief spokesman, later issued a 
guarded, two-sentence statement acknowledging that Reno had directed her staff 
to look into the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Ethics in Government law directs the attorney general to determine 
whether information received about a covered person alleging a violation of 
federal criminal law is specific enough and from a sufficiently credible source 
to warrant a preliminary investigation," Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Justice Department has received information relating to material that was 
broadcast on the television show "Inside Edition" about Secretary Cisneros and 
is proceeding as the law provides." 
</P>
<P>
 If Justice officials decide that the allegations against Cisneros meet the 
criteria spelled out in the law, officials said, the department's public 
integrity section will conduct a full, 90-day preliminary investigation. Only 
after that investigation will Reno be required to decide whether to ask for the 
appointment of a special counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice is known to be focusing primarily on the credibility of statements 
that Cisneros made to the FBI during an investigation into his background 
before his appointment by Clinton in early 1993. But Wheatly acknowledged it is 
possible that investigators might also look into other allegations -- such as 
Medlar's claim that she also received money from prominent Texas Democrat 
Morris Jaffe, as a favor to Cisneros. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first time Cisneros' romance with Medlar has caused him 
trouble. In 1988, during his fourth term as mayor of San Antonio, the affair 
became a matter of public knowledge and Cisneros held a press conference to 
acknowledge it. 
</P>
<P>
 After later reconciling with his wife, Mary Alice, Cisneros has said, he 
agreed to assist Medlar financially because the publicity generated by the 
affair had apparently destroyed her ability to earn a living. Cisneros also has 
acknowledged that he enlisted the help of Jaffe to find Medlar a job, but he 
insists he had no role in persuading Jaffe to loan Medlar $5,000 -- an action 
that could be construed as soliciting an indirect bribe. 
</P>
<P>
 In the taped conversations, Cisneros calls Jaffe a "savior" for helping her. 
</P>
<P>
 In her suit, Medlar contends that Cisneros reneged on a contractual agreement 
with her that he would provide her payments of $4,000 a month through 1999. In 
his response to the suit, Cisneros has said there was no such agreement, even 
though he did provide her with some money. 
</P>
<P>
 Medlar claims that Cisneros paid her a total of about $200,000 between 1990 
and 1993, including about $50,000 after he became HUD secretary. Wheatly said 
Cisneros has no record of exactly how much he paid, but he does not quarrel 
with Medlar's accounting. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Cisneros said that none of the payments were made to Medlar 
after he assumed his position in the Cabinet. But Wheatly said Thursday that 
Cisneros misspoke on that occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 In the taped conversations, Cisneros said he told the FBI he did not know how 
much money he had paid her over the years.

ANDERSON SUES FOR U.S. FILES ON HOSTAGE ORDEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former hostage Terry Anderson filed suit against 13 government agencies 
Thursday, claiming all had withheld records covering the years he was held 
captive in the Middle East. Some bureaucrats, he says, won't release the papers 
without permission from his terrorist kidnapers. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson says the documents are his by right under the Freedom of Information 
Act. 
</P>
<P>
 "The files probably contain some secrets I shouldn't know and I don't want 
those," Anderson told a news conference in his lawyers' office. "But I can't 
believe that everything in those files is vital to national security, not two 
years after the whole episode has been over." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson was Middle East correspondent for the Associated Press when he was 
kidnaped in Beirut in 1985. He was released in 1991 and has since written a 
book that he says would have been far different had he had access to the 
official files. 
</P>
<P>
 The 13 agencies include the CIA, which, the lawsuit said, "would 'neither 
confirm nor deny the existence or nonexistence' of any responsive records." The 
State Department contended files on some terrorists would cause "a clearly 
unwarranted invasion of personal privacy," the suit said, noting that U.S. 
privacy law applies only to U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Phone calls seeking comment were not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Withholding the documents, the suit said, deprives Anderson of the ability to 
"fully understand his experience, to place it in the proper context, and to 
broadly disseminate that information to the general public." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson said his efforts have met with stubborn resistance by "a culture of 
secrecy" in the government. He said he received only copies of publicly 
available press releases, news stories and pages rendered unreadable by huge 
blocks of blacked-out material. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson contended that the Freedom of Information Act has been violated 
repeatedly in spirit and letter. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not peculiar to me," Anderson said. "I don't think they have anything 
against me. This is coming to everybody who attempts to gain information 
through the FOIA."

TEACHER LOSES JOB OVER FAILURE TO OBSERVE 'MOMENT OF SILENCE'

 A high school social studies teacher lost his job Thursday for opposing a 
Georgia law that requires a daily moment of silence in all public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gwinnett County School Board voted in this Atlanta suburb late Thursday to 
support its superintendent's recommendation that instructor Brian Bown be fired 
after spending the last month on paid suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 Bown defied a 40-second moment of silence Aug. 22, the first day of school at 
South Gwinnett High School, by continuing with a lecture on the Protestant 
Reformation. 
</P>
<P>
 He was ousted from school property a day later and has since filed a lawsuit 
against the school district and the state government in U.S. District Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the state law, which took effect in July, effectively allows for 
prayer in school by requiring students to spend a moment in quiet reflection. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled officially mandated school prayer contrary to 
the constitutional separation of church and state. Laws similar to Georgia's 
are on the books in South Carolina, Tennessee and Massachusetts, but are rarely 
enforced.

DENTIST SETTLES SUIT FOR AVOIDING MAN WITH HIV 
</P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the first settlement of its kind, a Texas man who tested positive for the 
AIDS virus will receive $100,000 in damages and penalties from a dentist who 
refused to continue to treat him, the Justice Department said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The department sued the Castle Dental Center in Houston last year, asserting 
that it violated the Americans with Disabilities Act when it told Harrison J. 
Totten that it would no longer treat him. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Jack Castle, owner of the dental center, must pay $80,000 in compensatory 
damages to Totten. Castle Dental Center and its management company, Family 
Dental Services of Texas Inc., each will pay $10,000 in civil damages. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit alleged that after getting braces, Totten was continuing in treatment 
at the center until it learned he had tested positive for HIV in the spring of 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal law prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in 
places that serve the public. Under the act, testing positive for HIV and 
having AIDS are considered disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, the American Dental Assn. said its policy obliges members to 
treat HIV-infected patients.

emphasizing individual attention and parental involvement.The new schools will 
serve about 50,000 of the city's 1.2 million pupils. The Annenberg gift is the 
first grant to a public school system from philanthropist Walter H. Annenberg, 
who pledged $500 million to improve public education last December. The $50 
million is to be matched by other donors.

 The government will accept no new applications for mining claims on public 
lands for a year under a breakthrough compromise reached by Senate-House 
negotiators.Critics of an 1872 federal mining law that lets people extract 
hard-rock minerals from public lands for little cost have been trying to change 
the statute for years. They say it allows a virtual giveaway of federal assets, 
but industry supporters say changing the law would cause bankruptcies and cost 
thousands of jobs. Under the law, federal mining claims to land with billions 
of dollars' worth of minerals can be bought for as little as $2.50 an acre.

FOOD PRESERVATIVES FOUND TO BOOST CANCER FIGHTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two widely used food preservatives boosted levels of a natural cancer fighter 
in laboratory animals and appear to do the same thing in humans, a researcher 
reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates of natural foods have long decried the use of preservatives, but Dr. 
Andrew Dannenberg of Cornell Medical College found that the preservatives BHA 
and BHT "revved up" the gene for an enzyme that helps destroy carcinogens 
before they trigger tumors. 
</P>
<P>
 When the genes are cranked up, they produce more of the enzyme, providing 
better protection against cancer-causing substances in the environment, 
Dannenberg reported at the International Conference on Cancer Prevention at 
Rockefeller University in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 BHA and BHT are synthetic additives used as preservatives in cookies, crackers 
and a wide variety of other foods. 
</P>
<P>
 The results do not mean that foods should be pumped up with even more 
preservatives, Dannenberg said. The findings are important because they uncover 
a cancer prevention mechanism that appears to be part of the explanation for 
the well-known anti-cancer properties of broccoli, cauliflower and brussels 
sprouts. 
</P>
<P>
 His research shows that at least part of the effect of those compounds comes 
from revving up the same gene affected by BHA and BHT. 
</P>
<P>
 The gene produces an enzyme with the long name UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, or 
UGT. The study found elevated levels of the enzyme in the liver, kidneys and 
small intestines of rats fed higher doses of BHA and BHT than are normally 
found in foods, Dannenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 He then found preliminary evidence that the substances do the same thing in 
humans. Dannenberg said he has also found that sulforaphane, an anti-cancer 
agent recently isolated in broccoli, exerts its action partly in the same way, 
by revving up the gene for UGT. 
</P>
<P>
 The results appear at a time when researchers have become widely convinced of 
the value of fruits and vegetables in preventing cancer but have made little 
headway at figuring out exactly why that's true. 
</P>
<P>
 One problem is that many people avoid the foods with the most potent 
anti-cancer effects, said Dr. Walter Willett of the Harvard School of Public 
Health.

 The NAACP has sued its former executive director, Benjamin F. Chavis Jr., for 
$82,400, saying the NAACP board never authorized him to commit the 
organization's funds to settle a onetime aide's claim of sexual harassment.The 
board fired Chavis Aug. 20 in the biggest internal upheaval in the 85-year 
history of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People. The firing 
came after it was learned that Chavis made a secret deal to pay Mary E. Stansel 
as much as $332,400 in NAACP funds. Stansel actually received $82,400 before 
the NAACP and Chavis parted ways.

boat people in the waters that separate Cuba and Florida. Coast Guard and U.S. 
Navy ships rescued more than 30,000 Cubans from mid-August to early September.

killing 37 of the 57 people on board. William Rickard of the 
aerodynamics-acoustics unit of Douglas Aircraft Co. said the flight crew may 
have been able to prevent the crash had they known of the deadly wind shear. 
They then could have followed normal flight procedures, Rickard told the 
National Transportation Safety Board.

PRIVATE TALKS COULD SCALE BACK DANA POINT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENT: A LOCAL 
CONSERVANCY SEEKS TO BUY ACREAGE TO PRESERVE HABITAT ON ONE OF THE LAST 
REMAINING COASTAL PARCELS IN ORANGE COUNTY. PLANNED HOTEL WOULD BE SCRAPPED, 
BUT 370 HOUSES WOULD STILL BE BUILT.

<P>
 Private discussions are taking place that could save part of the 121-acre Dana 
Point Headlands from development and perhaps affect a bitter environmental 
fight over one of the most controversial projects in south Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners of the property overlooking Dana Point Harbor and a local 
conservation group are discussing a plan to sell some of the land to the Dana 
Point Headlands Conservancy and scale back the $500-million development 
project, participants in the talks confirmed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservancy officials said a key element of the plan calls for their group to 
buy about nine acres of the most prominent, environmentally sensitive land at 
the tip of the peninsula -- including the habitat of the endangered Pacific 
pocket mouse. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the conservancy would also have a five-year option to buy an 
additional 12 acres, now the proposed location of a 400-room luxury hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 The landowner could then develop the residential portion of the project, 
currently proposed as 370 homes on property with sweeping views up and down the 
coast, conservancy officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two members of the fledgling Dana Point Headlands Conservancy said a 
representative of the landowners approached them to discuss the potential deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The property is for sale, all of it, in five sections . . . so it might as 
well be to the citizens of Dana Point," said Jacqueline Cain, a conservancy 
director. "That's the last remaining open space in Dana Point, and if it's 
built it's gone forever. It's irreplaceable." Another director, Ernest A. 
Nelson, said he's optimistic that the talks can lead to an agreement over the 
headlands. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started out not knowing what our chances would be to win an agreement with 
the landowners, but now (they're) talking," Nelson said. "It's still a long 
shot, but it can happen, it really can." 
</P>
<P>
 An appraisal for the nine acres at the tip of the peninsula is being obtained 
by the landowners, Newport Beach-based M.H. Sherman Co. and Pasadena-based 
Chandis Securities Co., a partnership that has owned the property since the 
1940s. (Chandis Securities, a firm that oversees the financial holdings of the 
Chandler family, is a major stockholder in Times Mirror Co., publisher of the 
Los Angeles Times.) 
</P>
<P>
 Dan T. Daniels, the president of M.H. Sherman Co., acknowledged the talks but 
stopped short of calling the discussions an effort toward compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had discussions with these folks, and that's all we've done," Daniels 
said. "The conservancy has asked us for an option on a lot of the property. We 
are having an appraisal done to see if they are serious." 
</P>
<P>
 Approved last April by the Dana Point City Council, the project has been the 
target of a protest by local residents who say the development is too extensive 
and will destroy one of the last major undeveloped coastal properties in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 The headlands peninsula was noted by New England author Richard Henry Dana in 
1835 in his book "Two Years Before the Mast." The city was named after Dana 
when it was subdivided in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
 The approved plan for the headlands is the subject of two heated citywide 
November ballot measures that could force the council to rescind its approval 
of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservancy official Nelson said he met this week with aides for south Orange 
County legislators Assemblyman William Morrow (R-Oceanside), state Sen. William 
Craven (R-Oceanside) and state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) to 
outline the group's effort to obtain the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson and Cain said that because the property contains habitat for endangered 
species such as the cactus wren and the California gnatcatcher, federal funds 
are available to help buy the land. A citywide bond issue could be another 
potential source of purchase money, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson said there are no exact figures for the purchase, and little money has 
been raised so far. But the conservancy believes it will need $40 million to 
$50 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Money aside, conservancy officials said there are two keys to achieving a 
compromise: The property must be affordable and the City Council must accept 
the plan even though the 400-room luxury hotel would not be built. Conservancy 
officials say the council, with its eyes on the potential $2 million in annual 
bed tax revenues the hotel would generate, is the driving force behind the 
hotel portion of the project, not the landowners.

<P>
 At a panel discussion of the O.J. Simpson case Thursday, defense attorney 
Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. said he wants the jury to reflect Los Angeles' racial 
and economic diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want all wealthy, retired people on the jury," Cochran told members 
of the Public Relations Society of America's Los Angeles chapter. "We want a 
cross-section of this community." 
</P>
<P>
 That is why the defense is so opposed to the prosecution's efforts to 
sequester the jurors, separating them from the rest of the population during 
the trial by forcing them to stay in hotel rooms at night and herding them to 
and from the courtroom as if they were prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who in this audience would like to spend six months away from their families, 
locked up with 11 other strangers?" asked Cochran. "Retired people who don't 
like their families." 
</P>
<P>
 Cochran's words were revealing. They explained the dynamics of what will 
happen in Judge Lance A. Ito's courtroom when jury selection begins Monday in 
the trial of O.J. Simpson in the murder of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, 
and her friend, Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>

 Jury selection is a lot like the last stages of a political campaign, when 
candidates and parties labor to get favorable voters to the polls.

 Think of the prosecution as the Republicans.

 Republicans hope for a small turnout, limited to the most dedicated voters, 
those who will brave rain and gridlock to vote -- or who are so well-organized 
and sophisticated that they go through the procedures required to vote by mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies show that this type of voter tends to be older, better educated and 
more affluent. In other words, more conservative, more likely to vote 
Republican, more white. And probably more likely to convict defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats joke that if Republicans had their way, there would be all kinds of 
barriers to voting. You'd be turned away from the polling booth unless you 
could produce a birth certificate, a deed to your house and a country club 
membership. 
</P>
<P>
 Picture the defense, on the other hand, as the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats want everybody to vote on the theory that a big electorate will 
include more ethnic minorities and poor people. These are the folks who tend to 
favor the liberal candidates and programs offered by the Democrats. That is why 
the Democratic Congress and the Clinton Administration pushed through the 
"motor voter" law requiring states to allow registration by mail as well as 
when citizens apply for or renew a driver's license, visit welfare and other 
government agencies or stop by a military recruiting office. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans say that if Democrats had their way, there would be no barriers to 
voting. Illegal immigrants could vote from their sickbeds -- by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 In effect, the prosecution tactic of asking for 24-hour sequestration of the 
jury would limit the the kinds of prospective jurors, just as Republicans try 
to limit the electorate. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some of those favored by the Democrats might jump at the chance to 
serve on the Simpson jury, most could not handle the disruption to their lives. 
First, most companies will pay for no more than 10 days of jury duty, at best. 
For those who are unemployed, when would they be able to hunt for jobs or go to 
the unemployment office? Who'd take care of the children? 
</P>
<P>
 So a jury pool capable of meeting the conditions of complete sequestration 
would tend to be older. You'd find more retired and affluent citizens. It would 
be a more conservative group, and one probably more likely to vote for 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 What Cochran wants is a jury with a broader economic range, with more 
low-income people, more African Americans, more citizens suspicious of law 
enforcement. He wants people more open to Simpson's plea of innocence and less 
likely to be prejudiced against a black man, especially one who married a white 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to know about you, we want to know everything about you," Cochran 
said, "what you read, how you feel about interracial marriage. The question is: 
'Are you in touch with your biases? Can you put them aside?' That's what we're 
really talking about." 
</P>
<P>
 The process begins Monday. Cochran said he expects it to take a month to find 
12 jurors and six alternates. 
</P>
<P>
 It should be a tough and hard-fought month. Jury selection may turn out to be 
the most important phase of the trial. That's why nobody disagreed when Cochran 
warned, "It's a painful process."

NEGOTIATORS BACK STIFFER CURBS ON LAWMAKER GIFTS

 Key congressional negotiators Thursday agreed to stringent new curbs on gifts 
to lawmakers from special interests, while Senate Republicans threatened to 
block other bills on President Clinton's agenda, starting with campaign-finance 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans were also threatening moves to repeal major provisions of the 
recently passed crime bill and to kill legislation to protect California 
deserts, prompting Democratic charges that they were seeking to deny Democrats 
any big legislative victories before the November congressional elections. 
</P>
<P>
 The gift legislation's chief sponsors said they expected formal approval of 
the compromise from a House-Senate conference as early as today. They said they 
also expected final approval by the House and Senate but could not rule out GOP 
stalling tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 The new gift rules would ban members of Congress or their staffs from 
accepting free meals, entertainment, travel or other gifts from lobbyists, put 
a $20 limit on such favors from other special interests and end free trips to 
corporate-sponsored charity sporting events.

A FAMILY'S PAINFUL PATH TO RESOLUTION; AFTER 30 YEARS, LAST DESIGNATED 
VIETNAM-ERA POW IS RECLASSIFIED BY THE AIR FORCE AS KILLED IN ACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly 30 years after their father's plane was shot down over Laos, the 
children of Air Force Col. Charles E. Shelton this week received the official 
word they sought as a symbolic finale to a double family tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all agree we need some closure. We need to put this behind us," explained 
Los Angeles resident John Shelton, son of the man who had been the last 
officially designated prisoner of war from the Vietnam era. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with Col. Shelton's formal status changed by the Pentagon to "killed in 
action," he can be given a memorial service at his wife's grave at Arlington 
National Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oct. 4 ceremony also will mark the fourth anniversary of the suicide of 
Dorothy Marian Shelton. A national leader in the movement to account for 
missing servicemen, she finally despaired over the lack of progress in her 
husband's case and shot herself at her San Diego home in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his body was never found, Col. Shelton's name will be inscribed on 
his wife's tombstone. His active-duty military paychecks, which had continued 
through this month, will stop. And Shelton's three sons and two daughters hope 
the family can back off from the anguished debates about whether the U.S. 
government has searched enough for servicemen captured or killed in Southeast 
Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Some activists may react bitterly to the family's request that the Air Force 
review Col. Shelton's status, conceded John Shelton, a 38-year-old actor. But 
their mother's death and officials' more recent, unsuccessful searches in Laos 
prompted the family's decision, he said. "I think it's the healthiest thing we 
can do," Shelton added. 
</P>
<P>
 Family attorney Tom Reeve, who filed their formal request, agreed. "The 
children weren't doing this as any kind of political statement," said Reeve, 
who practices in San Diego. "It was something they had to do on a personal 
level. It was time for resolution." 
</P>
<P>
 Amid much controversy, Dorothy Shelton had fought to keep Col. Shelton's 
status as the only Vietnam-era POW. The Air Force agreed to that as a symbolic 
gesture a decade ago, according to Defense Department spokeswoman Beverly 
Baker. 
</P>
<P>
 This week's change to "killed in action," approved by Air Force Secretary 
Sheila Widnall, does not signify a policy switch, Baker stressed. "We will 
continue to insist on an accounting for our missing in action to the fullest 
extent possible," the spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders in the POW/MIA movement said they respected the Shelton family's 
decision even though it means the government no longer lists any Vietnam War 
prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what the family wanted and we would be the last to interfere," said 
Ann Mills Griffiths, executive director of the National League of POW/MIA 
Families. Still, that organization and others will keep pressing their belief 
that American prisoners remain alive in Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sympathize with the Shelton family because they have suffered so much. But 
the issue should not be closed," said former POW Eugene (Red) McDaniel, 
president of the American Defense Institute, an organization that lobbies for 
more POW searches. 
</P>
<P>
 An American team in March extensively searched the area where Col. Shelton was 
taken captive in Laos and the area where he reportedly was buried, according to 
a Defense Department press release issued this week. The team "did not find his 
remains or any evidence he was alive," the statement reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelton was shot down on his 33rd birthday, April 29, 1965. U.S. rescuers 
contacted him by radio on the ground and he indicated he was in good condition. 
Villagers later said he was taken prisoner by communist Laotian forces. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife became a prominent crusader in the POW cause, appearing on TV talk 
shows, testifying in Washington and traveling to Asia. At the same time, she 
raised five children alone, the youngest of whom was only 18 months old when 
her husband was shot down. 
</P>
<P>
 Every new reported sighting of POWs raised her hopes and then crushed them. 
"This is what took our mother. The roller coaster ride every day," said John 
Shelton. He was 9 when his father was captured and remembers him as "a typical 
military dad who was kind of strict."  
</P>
<P>
 The family is expected to receive some life insurance payments as a result of 
the Air Force decision, Reeve said. But the family would have done better 
financially by keeping the POW status and the military paychecks, he explained. 
"Their best financial interest was to hunker down and hope nobody noticed this 
was coming in every month," the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Pentagon, a hearing board of three generals with combat 
experience in Southeast Asia recommended Shelton's status change to killed in 
action. With Widnall's agreement, "the change resolves the issue for his family 
and allows them to give Col. Shelton the proper memorial he deserves," the 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now scattered in Los Angeles, San Diego and Kentucky, the family will meet at 
Arlington Cemetery next month for a ceremony that will include a 21-gun salute 
to Shelton.  
</P>
<P>
 "It will be an era gone by for us," said John Shelton.

UP THE RIGHT STAIRCASE; LEARN SCHOOLS RANK HIGH IN SURVEY OF STUDENTS, TEACHERS 
AND PARENTS -- BUT THE BATHROOMS, THEY SAY, ARE THE PITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE CHAVEZ, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The parents, teachers and students at 81 Los Angeles schools who seized a 
chance to voice an opinion about their campuses generally say they are 
satisfied with the quality of instruction and give high marks to student 
discipline, attendance and safety. 
</P>
<P>
 But those bathrooms. Something has got to be done about those dirty campus 
bathrooms, everyone seems to agree. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first informal survey of campuses in the Los Angeles Unified School 
District's LEARN reform plan, it appears that few issues leave such a lasting 
impression as a foul-looking, smelly school bathroom, devoid of toilet paper, 
hand soap and paper towels. 
</P>
<P>
 And this was one opinion not even solicited in the survey questions. It was a 
write-in response.  
</P>
<P>
 Making bathrooms clean and usable "is the one thing that everyone unanimously 
agreed has to be done," said Dianne Dash Island, principal of Brockton Avenue 
School on the Westside, after reading her school's survey results. "It's now a 
question of how we are going to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Under LEARN -- Los Angeles Educational Alliance for Restructuring Now -- 
schools have more power to make decisions on issues such as instruction and 
overall school operations. The goal is to raise student achievement by allowing 
educators and parents to tailor-make reform plans free from the constraints of 
a central bureaucracy. While principals have ultimate decision-making 
authority, all groups must make decisions together. 
</P>
<P>
 The wide-ranging survey, while not a scientific poll, was intended to give 
school leaders base-line information to guide their overhaul plans and offered 
them much-needed information about what needs improving, principals and 
teachers said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In general, parents and students in elementary schools gave their campuses the 
highest marks, while those in secondary schools were more critical. And the 
older students were, the harder they said it was for them to learn, according 
to the district report, which summarized 44,636 responses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Learning should be fun and interesting," wrote one secondary school student. 
"We should want to come to school. I love to learn, but unfortunately, I have 
to start after school." 
</P>
<P>
 Students were asked questions such as whether they like being in school, 
whether learning is easy for them, if schoolwork is exciting and if campus 
safety measures are effective. Parents and school staff were queried on 
communication, quality of the instructional program and student welfare issues. 
</P>
<P>
 While most parents did not respond, district officials said they were able to 
generalize from the surveys that parents are most concerned about school 
safety, including campus plans to deal with natural disasters, and the number 
of "pupil-free days," in which student have the day off so teachers can take 
professional development courses. Typically, a school takes eight such days a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents who responded also said they are frustrated because they cannot attend 
school meetings during the working day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Future parents meetings should be scheduled from 5:30 to 8 p.m. because some 
parents do work," wrote one respondent. "It is impossible for us to come to 
meetings and show our interest in our child's progress when the meetings are 
scheduled before then." 
</P>
<P>
 School staff members also expressed strong satisfaction with their schools, 
although not quite as much as parents and students. One recurring theme among 
staff members was that they are still confused about what being a LEARN school 
means and better communication and teamwork are needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that one of the greatest problems is that staff doesn't always work 
together," wrote one staffer. "If the staff remains divided, then we will not 
be able to effectively accomplish LEARN goals." 
</P>
<P>
 For some schools the high overall ratings will provide a morale boost as they 
begin the school year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to copy this survey and pass it out to everyone," said Monica 
Studer, a teacher at Wilson High School on the Eastside, where most students 
said they feel safe and teachers are pleased with the level of learning in 
college prep courses. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, this validates what we are doing well and we are on the right path," 
said Principal Sue Di Julio of Overland Avenue Elementary on the Westside, 
which has focused on improving math and science instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we also need to improve communication with parents in our school who are 
not actively involved."

STATE ETHICS BOARD CUTS TIES WITH L.A. PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The head of the state agency that investigates political corruption has 
accused his counterpart at the Los Angeles Ethics Commission of a series of 
ethical lapses -- problems so severe that he said he has cut off interaction 
between the two agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethics Commission Executive Director Ben Bycel leaked confidential 
information, threatened attorneys and botched sensitive negotiations by 
shifting his positions, according to a letter by Wayne Ordos, executive 
director of the state Fair Political Practices Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Bycel called the letter -- delivered this week to state and city ethics 
commissioners -- a "vicious personal attack." He said he believed the 
complaints about him were rooted in the state agency's jealousy that the 
upstart city Ethics Commission helped launch a series of high-profile 
investigations into political money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
 At the regular city Ethics Commission meeting Thursday morning, members voiced 
support for Bycel. "It's a very unfair attack on Ben, and we have full 
confidence in him," Commissioner Ed Guthman said. Commission President Dennis 
Curtis said Bycel is doing a great job. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ethics Commission and Fair Political Practices Commission collaborated on 
several investigations, in large part because the city agency has a small staff 
and no in-house attorneys to investigate corruption. For example, city ethics 
officials uncovered a money laundering scheme by Evergreen America Corp., a 
giant shipping firm. State agency lawyers and investigators helped prove the 
allegations, resulting in a record $895,000 fine and Evergreen's admission that 
it funneled $172,000 in campaign contributions through third parties. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the public was being told of cooperative efforts to blot out 
corruption, tensions were quietly simmering between the state agency and Bycel, 
Ordos acknowledged in his letter. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-page letter depicts Bycel as a publicity-hungry zealot who could not 
keep private discussions about pending cases to himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordos accused Bycel of telling the press of the Evergreen settlement before it 
was to be announced at a public Ethics Commission meeting. He also accused 
Bycel of asking to time the announcement of another significant case to a major 
sporting event to get more publicity. (No further explanation was given in the 
letter.) And Ordos noted that a Superior Court judge ordered Bycel to drop out 
of another investigation earlier this year after the judge found that Bycel had 
shown bias toward the subjects of the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 The latter investigation involved relatives and associates of Arthur Snyder, a 
former city councilman and influential City Hall lobbyist. Snyder has not been 
accused of any campaign violations and denies wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ethics Commission and political practices commission have also been 
investigating political contributions by employees and associates of the Los 
Angeles Marathon. No one has been accused of wrongdoing in that case, and that 
investigation is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear how the rift between the two agencies will affect those 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have long been concerned about your apparent inability to disengage your 
personal feelings and biases from our cases," Ordos said in the letter. "My 
staff has reported a number of instances in which you have asked them to focus 
on 'getting' one person or another even though the facts were not yet in place 
to warrant such a prosecution." 
</P>
<P>
 Ordos also concluded that after an initial tip from the Ethics Commission, 
"virtually everything done" to settle the watershed Evergreen case was the 
result of the state agency's work. 
</P>
<P>
 Bycel hotly contested that assertion and most others in Ordos' letter, saying 
that the Ethics Commission had carried at least half the burden by exposing the 
money laundering by the shipping firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "The FPPC has existed for almost 25 years and never came close to the kind of 
fine that we helped them collect in the Evergreen case," Bycel said. "I think 
they as an institution feel threatened by the Ethics Commission." 
</P>
<P>
 Bycel also denied that he had leaked information to the news media or others. 
He declined to discuss most other specifics in Ordos' letter but said 
"philosophical differences about what the public expects from an enforcement 
agency" are at the heart of the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Bycel, a lawyer and former law school dean, has fought to win credibility for 
the Ethics Commission since he was hired 3 1/2 years ago as the agency's first 
administrator. His supporters say he has frequently run afoul of the city's 
political Establishment by questioning the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his first investigations put him at odds with City Atty. James K. Hahn, 
when the commission focused on allegations that members of Hahn's staff were 
engaged in political activity while on the public payroll. The district 
attorney's office declined to file charges in that case, but Bycel lambasted 
that office for releasing the name of the confidential informant whose tip 
initiated the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Bycel acknowledged that he recently applied for a position with the State Bar 
of California that would put him in charge of disciplinary actions against 
lawyers. He denied that the attempted move was influenced by tensions with the 
stage agency, saying he simply was ready for a new challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was ready to move on," Bycel said. "But now that there has been criticism 
of what I've done, I think I'm ready to dig in my heels and stay for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Ordos and other political practices commission officials declined to comment, 
but in his letter the state agency chief told Bycel that "this agency cannot 
continue working with the city Ethics Commission as long as you remain its 
executive director." 
</P>
<P>
 Bycel was appointed by and serves at the will of the Ethics Commission. The 
five-member panel is appointed by Mayor Richard Riordan, City Atty. Hahn, 
Controller Rick Tuttle and City Council President John Ferraro.

DAMAGES AGAINST KIM BASINGER IN FILM SUIT VOIDED; COURTS: APPELLATE JUSTICES 
FIND THE JUDGE GAVE AMBIGUOUS INSTRUCTIONS TO JURY IN 'BOXING HELENA' CASE. 
VERDICT OF $8.1 MILLION THREW FILM STAR INTO BANKRUPTCY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY BRENNAN and EDWARD J. BOYER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Citing "prejudicially ambiguous" options given to a jury, a unanimous appeals 
court panel overturned an $8.1-million verdict against actress Kim Basinger on 
Thursday for reneging on an agreement to appear in the film "Boxing Helena." 
</P>
<P>
 The judgment had forced Basinger into bankruptcy and threatened to undermine 
the Hollywood tradition of making deals on a handshake. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for both sides said the reversal was based on a technicality -- 
Superior Court Judge Judith Chirlin failed to separate Basinger from her 
personal services company, Mighty Wind Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Chirlin was reversed "on a technicality she created," said attorney Howard 
Weitzman, who represented Basinger during her trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Main Line Pictures, the small, independent company that produced "Boxing 
Helena," had argued that Basinger and Mighty Wind are one and the same, but 
Basinger's attorneys maintained that if there was an agreement, it was between 
Main Line and Mighty Wind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am extremely pleased with the court's decision," Basinger said in a 
prepared statement. "I continue to maintain that there was no contract, oral or 
otherwise, contrary to (Main Line's) assertions that I simply viewed an oral 
agreement as non-binding." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Patricia Glaser, who represents Main Line, was undaunted by the 
appellate court decision and said the film company will seek a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll whomp their rear-ends again," Glaser said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel vindicated because the court didn't touch the merits of this case," 
she said. "In fact, the court even stated during oral arguments that the record 
was replete with evidence of a contract." 
</P>
<P>
 The three-judge appeals court panel ruled that verdict forms prepared by Judge 
Chirlin allowed the jury to find that "Basinger and/or Mighty Wind" had entered 
a contract with Main Line and breached it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 'and/or' (verdict forms) are prejudicially ambiguous and require 
reversal," 2nd District Court of Appeal Justice Margaret Grignon wrote. Those 
verdict forms "prevented the jury from performing its obligation to determine 
the separate existence of Mighty Wind and Basinger," the opinion said. Justice 
Ramona Godoy Perez and Presiding Justice Paul Turner concurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Basinger's appellate lawyer Irving Greines called "and/or" verdict forms 
"hopelessly incomprehensible," saying they have been condemned in California 
for more than 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Chirlin "failed to follow the law and created something new with this 'and/or' 
clause to draw Kim into the contract," Weitzman said. "That confused the jury 
as to which party was actually responsible for the contract." 
</P>
<P>
 Greines said he feels "extremely confident that Kim would win this case on 
retrial. The case is fabricated out of thin air." 
</P>
<P>
 When the verdict against Basinger, 40, was handed down in March, 1993, it 
sparked a mixed reaction in Hollywood, where movie deals are often based on 
handshake agreements. Some are even signed on cocktail napkins or given the nod 
in casual conversations. Never before had any studio or independent producer 
pursued a star for reneging on an agreement with such determination. 
</P>
<P>
 The key dispute was over discussions involving Basinger, Main Line head Carl 
Mazzocone and "Boxing Helena" director Jennifer Lynch. Basinger was to play the 
role of a woman rescued from a car accident by a lovesick doctor who becomes 
obsessed with her and amputates her arms and legs before holding her hostage in 
a box. The movie, eventually made with Sherilyn Fenn in the lead role, bombed 
at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
 There were various drafts of a deal memo drawn up by the actress's lawyer that 
Main Line contended stood as a binding contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Basinger, following the advice of her agent Guy McElwaine, backed away from 
the role, particularly when it required her to pose nude. 
</P>
<P>
 Since her trial, there have been several instances in Hollywood where stars 
such as Michael Douglas, actor/director Robert Redford and actress/director 
Jodie Foster have bailed out of roles at the last minute -- sometimes days 
before shooting begins. All contend they had script approval before committing 
to their role -- a so-called "out" clause Basinger always maintained she 
retained.

 But none of the studios or producers, whose films relied on those actors, have 
taken any action to force them to star in their pictures. Redford and Foster 
were both expected to star in 20th Century Fox's "Crisis in the Hot Zone," and 
Douglas would have played a leading role in Carolco Pictures' pirate movie 
"Cutthroat Island."

CLASSIC CLASS NOTES; EDUCATION: PETER, PAUL & MARY TAKE THEIR FOLK SONGS TO 
IMMIGRANT STUDENTS AT BELMONT HIGH. 
</P>

<P>
 The voices of Peter, Paul & Mary have echoed through Belmont High School for 
weeks -- but on Thursday, the trio arrived in the flesh. 
</P>
<P>
 "You gotta check this out," said Paul Stookey, glancing at a poster on a wall 
of the school warning of clothing transgressions. "No hats." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a hat," said Mary Travers, patting her signature straight blond 
hair. 
</P>
<P>
 "No beepers, no baggy pants," said Stookey, pinching the fabric of his khaki 
suit, satisfied he was within the rules. "When I was in high school, they 
wouldn't let us wear Levi's." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the teachers or the gaggle of students who pressed them with 
cellophane-wrapped bouquets of flowers and escorted them to a classroom would 
have cared what the guitar-carrying trio wore.  
</P>
<P>
 For their audience of 50 immigrant students -- newly arrived in America and 
just beginning their journey through the English language -- the folk singers 
are something of a touchstone. As Peter, Paul & Mary arrived at the classroom, 
the students, who can barely answer simple questions in English, were lustily 
singing every verse of "Blowin' in the Wind." 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, bravo!" exclaimed Travers, immediately embracing a young girl in the 
front row. "Fabulous!" 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great compliment to us," said Peter Yarrow. "We've come to sing 
some songs and ask you some questions. . . . What's been your experience in 
America?" He paused for a moment. "Do you understand me?" 
</P>
<P>
 A sea of scrubbed young teen-age faces looked back at him eagerly but blankly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I . . . will . . . speak . . . much . . . slower," Yarrow said.  
</P>
<P>
 Actually the trio is used to international audiences filled with non-English 
speakers. Once, Peter, Paul & Mary were invited to a Philippines national 
celebration. At a Helsinki concert, the Finnish audience sang along. And their 
biggest fan club, according to their manager, is in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 But what was different here was that the internationally known icons of 
American popular culture are part of the curriculum at the Newcomer Center at 
Belmont High. The program, sponsored by the Los Angeles Unified School 
District, is devoted to giving a year's worth of academic and language 
orientation to immigrant youths ages 13 to 18. There is a similar program at 
another school for younger children. 
</P>
<P>
 Two teachers use the songs to help the students learn English. It was the 
lucky 50 students in their classes who knew the songs and were invited to hear 
the group in person. The idea, according to teacher Deanna Brantley, is to 
teach English as you might naturally learn it. Folk songs with their 
repetitions are perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 "You sing very clearly on tape -- that's important for the students to hear -- 
and you have wonderful stories," Brantley told the singers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only have we learned much from your songs, but they have encouraged us 
greatly," said Grace Chang, 16, from the Philippines, who read from an essay 
she had written. 
</P>
<P>
 Travers wiped away tears. "I cry today because you are my child," she said. 
"You are our future." 
</P>
<P>
 The class sang again -- "Lemon Tree" -- tentatively making their way through 
the lyrics but swelling more confidently with each refrain. 
</P>
<P>
 Lemon tree very pretty, and the lemon flower is sweet, but the fruit of the 
poor lemon is impossible to eat. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 While the students followed along on lyric sheets, Briyith Gonzalez sang along 
as if she knew the words by heart. "Not all the words," said the teen-ager from 
Colombia. "My favorite is 'Blowin' in the Wind.' When I listen to the words, I 
cry." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Peter, Paul, & Mary got to sing. They're in their mid-50s now, Yarrow 
and Stookey are graying and balding; Travers' face crinkles around the eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 But their voices were as strong and sonorous as ever as they roamed the rows 
of desks like wandering teachers instead of minstrels. They leaned over desks 
to encourage a soft voice to sing stronger, they clasped a hand here, squeezed 
a shoulder there. 
</P>
<P>
 Travers and Yarrow live in Manhattan; Stookey in Maine. In town for meetings 
on their new album, they had arranged to come to the school after an associate 
of their manager's told them about the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The specter of Proposition 187, which targets illegal immigrants, loomed over 
the room. "This is a statement against Proposition 187," said Gabriel Murillo, 
a counselor for the program. 
</P>
<P>
 And Yarrow didn't miss an opportunity to take a shot at the ballot initiative. 
"It's a travesty," he said and looked around the room. "These are flesh and 
blood, wonderful bright spirits."

ACTIVIST RABBI'S SYNAGOGUE DEFACED WITH SWASTIKAS; CRIME: POLICE DO NOT KNOW IF 
TEMPLE'S VANDALISM IS LINKED TO ITS LEADER'S WORK ON AN ANTI-BIGOTRY PLAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Six bright orange swastikas were found Thursday spray-painted outside a 
Glendale synagogue headed by a rabbi who has been a vocal opponent of hate 
crimes and helped draw up a plan for fighting bigotry that was publicized this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 The vandalism of Temple Sinai at 1212 N. Pacific Ave., the only synagogue in 
Glendale, was the city's fourth hate crime of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "To see the swastika is to be reminded that there are people who are filled 
with murderous hate," said Rabbi Carole Meyers, who is a member of the Mayor's 
Blue Ribbon Task Force on Community Relations. "My first reaction was of 
gut-wrenching horror." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities had no suspects in the case Thursday. Glendale police spokesman 
Chahe Keuroghelian said it had not been determined if the defacement of Meyers' 
temple was related to publicity over her work on the task force. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale Mayor Eileen Givens, Police Chief James Anthony and City Council 
members Larry Zarian, Sheldon Baker and Mary Ann Plumley appeared at the temple 
Thursday to denounce the vandalism and help clean up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't even imagine why somebody would do something like this," Givens said 
after using a roller to paint over a swastika. "This is not a rational act. . . 
. It's hard to make sense of it." 
</P>
<P>
 The 14-member task force, made up of city officials and community activists, 
was created in May after vandals spray-painted anti-Armenian slogans at the 
headquarters of Homenetmen Ararat, an Armenian youth scout organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The group has met three times, Meyers said, and next week plans to give the 
Glendale City Council a report outlining recommendations for controlling hate 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 One suggestion includes forming an emergency response team of volunteers that 
would go to crime scenes and publicly denounce the acts on behalf of the city. 
Meyers helped draft the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The vandalism occurred between 7 p.m. Wednesday and 7 a.m. Thursday, when a 
teacher at a nearby school noticed the 2 1/2-foot-long swastikas, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sad as a mayor and frustrating to see media attention focused on 
isolated bad things happening," Givens said. "It's important to keep this in 
the context of a city that is safe and successful." 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale is still struggling to overcome its history as a headquarters for 
Nazis during the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Glendale Police Department began compiling statistics on hate crimes 
in 1986, 59 have been reported, most committed against Armenians, Keuroghelian 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, an elderly Armenian man was attacked by a homeless man shouting 
racial slurs, and swastikas were painted on a parking space outside a shopping 
center and on a building belonging to the Homenetmen Armenian General Athletics 
Union and Scouts. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one member of the mayor's task force, Alice Petrossian, questioned 
whether the task force itself prompted the vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first reaction was that someone must have read (about the task force) in 
the paper and then done this," she said. "I usually equate reading the 
newspaper with some degree of intelligence, but whoever did this shows no 
intelligence." 
</P>
<P>
 Police were trying to establish a motive. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may be attributed to the task force or it may be in response to the rabbi 
or the recommendations by the task force, and it may not," Keuroghelian said. 
"It's just a remote possibility." 
</P>
<P>
 The incident did not seem to dampen the resolve of Meyers, who in 1986 became 
the first female rabbi to lead a Jewish congregation in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 Temple Sinai was also defaced by vandals in 1987, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't let an incident like this change anything about you and what you 
want to accomplish," Meyers said. "You heal, you move forward, but you never 
forget. 
</P>
<P>
 During a Sabbath service for her congregation of 250 families tonight, the 
rabbi said she will discuss the city's most recent hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll say that we have to be realistic about what happened. We have to stand 
tall." 
</P>
<P>
 While she decried the act, Meyers also noted the support expressed by 
municipal officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in the Jewish community who see swastikas on their spiritual home feel 
violated. They feel pain, fury and revulsion, knowing there is murderous hatred 
out there in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other side of that is wonder. When good people get together, they create 
something godly," she said. "The vast majority of good people stood together 
and spoke out -- the majority of the City Council, the chief of police, the 
city manager and many members of the community who came to be with us. They 
said that when this happens to anyone in our community, it happens to all of 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials' quick response was also applauded by people outside Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tragedy of this is that people willing to speak out and take initiative 
to deal with these issues are themselves targeted, or their institutions are," 
said Steven Windmueller, a spokesman for the Jewish Federation Council of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "The issue here is the community, in this case Glendale, must push 
to create an environment where crimes of hate are not accepted."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; BODY FOUND 
AT RENDERING PLANT MAY BE PRISON INMATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Workers preparing to dump the contents of a steel drum of kitchen wastes into 
a processing machine at a rendering plant in South-Central Los Angeles on 
Thursday discovered a corpse that may be the body of an inmate missing from a 
state prison in Norco, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, who police said appeared to be a Latino in his mid-30s, was found in 
a sealed drum Thursday morning at Darling Delaware Co., a plant that recycles 
meat fat, grease and bones for use in products such as pet food. 
</P>
<P>
 Drivers told police that the drum was picked up, along with several others, 
from the California Rehabilitation Center in Norco about 6:30 a.m. Thursday. 
The truck made about three or four more pickups before arriving at the plant at 
2626 E. 25th St., police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Annette Hissami, a public information officer at the prison, said a head 
count of prisoners indicated that a man was missing. Authorities declined to 
release the name of the missing inmate.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: DEPUTIES BREAK UP BRAWL 
OUTSIDE HOUSE OF BLUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ever since it opened earlier this year, the trendy House of Blues club on 
Sunset Boulevard has been an incongruous presence. Whoever heard of a blues 
club with valet parking and doormen with walkie-talkies? 
</P>
<P>
 But early Thursday morning, they finally got down in the alley. About 50 to 75 
patrons spilled into the parking lot as Tommy Lee, a drummer for the heavy 
metal band Motley Crue, scrapped with other patrons. In the end, a dozen 
sheriff's deputies and a helicopter were needed stop the brawl after almost 
half an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no arrests, although Lee was pepper-sprayed by a deputy after 
refusing to stop fighting, said sheriff's Sgt. Art Salas. Lee, 31, was treated 
at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and released. 
</P>
<P>
 House of Blues spokeswoman Hayley Sumnerboth said this was the first big brawl 
at any House of Blues (there are smaller ones in New Orleans and Cambridge, 
Mass.), though she said there had always been worries about the West Hollywood 
location, "given the club scene out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Sumner said the battle started near closing time, at 1:45 a.m., when Lee, a 
guest at the club, got into a heated conversation and shoving match with some 
patrons. Sumner said that Lee used racial epithets, and that friends of the 
drummer joined the scuffle. 
</P>
<P>
 A representative of Lee's manager said Thursday that she could not reach the 
drummer and had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Sumner said security guards isolated the combatants, but were boxed in by 
curious customers and the fight eventually moved outside. She said that the 50 
to 75 people massed around the combatants were just watching the battle, but 
the sheriff's report says they were pushing, flailing and shoving as more than 
300 other patrons watched the rumble. 
</P>
<P>
 Sumner said the House of Blues and its employees regret the incident, 
especially because racial epithets were used. 
</P>
<P>
 Salas said the nightspot is mainly a traffic headache rather than a magnet for 
brawls. He was also amused by interest in the incident. "If he wasn't there," 
Salas said, referring to Lee, "this would have been another disturbing the 
peace, crowd dispersed, goes home a little sadder but wiser." NICHOLAS RICCARDI

<P>
 For the best bargain in town on low-cost preschools, look no further than the 
Careers With Children program at Cleveland High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-agers take a two-period course there in which they learn teaching skills. 
After a month of training, the student instructors run a two-hour preschool 
session three days a week under the supervision of two adults. Cost to parents 
is $75 a semester for each child. 
</P>
<P>
 In the works since 1971, the program is designed to offer an opportunity for 
young adults interested in a career working with children to test their talents 
and patience.This year, more than 100 high school students enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, an open house was held in which the teen-age teachers, their 
supervisors, the preschoolers and their parents met for a demonstration by 
Wildlife on Wheels -- a roving story-telling and animal awareness group. A 
chance for the high schoolers to get acquainted with their new students through 
arts and crafts activities followed. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the beginning of this school year, the teen-agers have been receiving 
instruction on teaching, dealing with and presenting themselves to young 
children. "I've learned to be polite to kids, to take my time and not be so 
rushed," said 16-year-old Beatrice Pearson, who is anxious to begin teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the lessons Ruben Rivera, 17, has enjoyed was one on how to read a book 
to a small child. "You have to read the captions, and then show them the 
pictures," Ruben explained, demonstrating how he holds a storybook up to 
youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Rufus, 17, who is starting her second semester in the program, 
pointed out that she can include her experience working at the preschool on her 
resume when she is looking for other jobs. Michelle has learned how to prepare 
lessons and nutritional meals, as well as how to be a role model to her 
students. "They really look up to you," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Collins of Northridge said she chose Careers With Children for her 
4-year-old son because of its affordability. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (the teen-age teachers) have more energy than the usual preschool 
teachers," Collins said. MAKI BECKER

 After a year of scrimping and saving for their children, parents at Mark 
Keppel Elementary School in Glendale next week will celebrate the dedication of 
a new playground. 
</P>
<P>
 The parents' yearlong fund-raising drive netted more than $40,000 needed to 
open the playground at the campus on 730 Glenwood Road.The playground will be 
dedicated at 9:30 a.m. Wednesday. The public is invited to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 The playground equipment replaces asphalt as a play area. The fund-raising 
drive was spearheaded by Make Keppel Special, a nonprofit organization run by 
teachers, staff and parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Donations for the new playground came from parents, corporations such as Home 
Savings, and the Glendale Unified School District, according to Brian Ellis, 
chairman of Make Keppel Special. 
</P>
<P>
 During the last four years, Make Keppel Special has raised more than $50,000 
for projects that include science classes, library expansion and remodeling, 
art supplies and computers. JEFF SCHNAUFER

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: REDONDO BEACH; BALLOT 
MEASURE URGES EASED CONCEALED WEAPONS PERMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Concern about violence in Southern California has prompted the Redondo Beach 
City Council to draft a ballot measure making it easier to obtain a permit to 
carry concealed weapons in Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote will be only advisory.State law, which overrides local law, allows 
only a police chief to determine who gets a permit for a concealed weapon.  
</P>
<P>
 A group of residents asked for a change in the city's charter that would allow 
anyone from Redondo Beach who wants to carry a concealed weapon to do so, with 
some exceptions. About 30 members of the National Rifle Assn. attended a 
council meeting this week to boost the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council voted to place a proposed amendment to the city's charter on 
the March, 1995, ballot. Councilman Joseph Dawidziak said the vote will show 
politicians what people may do if they don't feel safe in their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Melvin Nichols has issued six permits, all to people who live 
outside the city but work in Redondo Beach, Dawidziak said.

earthquake, is scheduled to reopen for inpatient services Oct. 3 -- minus its 
north wing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica hospital's inpatient services have remained closed for the 
last nine months as the facility underwent $32 million in seismic repairs.Its 
main and south wings were reinforced from the foundation to the top floor with 
steel columns and horizontal beams and the main wing's foundation was excavated 
and replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 The east and west wings, only cosmetically damaged, have been repaired and 
repainted. The north wing was demolished. 
</P>
<P>
 Inpatient beds have been reduced from 501 to about 260 and the hospital's work 
force consists of 1,000 employees -- half as many as before the quake. Most of 
the 1,200 physicians who had privileges at the hospital before the Jan. 17 
temblor have retained them, said hospital spokesman Gary Miereanu. Of the 
hospital's health care units, only neonatal intensive care, which was housed in 
the north wing, has not been replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials have allowed St. John's administrators to develop a long-term 
plan to bring the hospital in line with current seismic codes. In the interim, 
the hospital's buildings have been reinforced to meet the codes that were in 
place the year they were built.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; COMEDIAN 
GEORGE BURNS RELEASED FROM HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 George Burns went home from the hospital Thursday to continue recuperation 11 
days after surgery to drain fluid from his brain, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was released this morning in good condition following surgery last week," 
said Ron Wise, spokesman for Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The 98-year-old, cigar-chomping comic was reported in good spirits. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns' longtime friend and business manager, Irving Fein, said earlier that 
the entertainer would recuperate at home for a week or two, "then he'll be 
playing bridge at Hillcrest (Country Club) as he does every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Burns underwent about two hours of surgery after being admitted to the 
hospital Sept. 12. The operation relieved pressure from fluid that had built up 
after Burns fell in his bathtub and hit his head at his Beverly Hills home July 
13, suffering a cut that required two stitches. He was hospitalized then for 
observation, Fein said.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; LAS VIRGENES ROAD PLAN DENIAL APPEALED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The developers of Ahmanson Ranch have asked the Calabasas City Council to 
overrule the Planning Commission and allow them to extend Las Virgenes Road 
about 15 feet to the Ventura County line. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council will vote on Ahmanson Land Co.'s request Oct. 5 after a 
public hearing at City Hall at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Planning Commission ruled Sept. 8 that the firm's application was 
incomplete because it did not contain an application for a conditional-use 
permit and a site plan review. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission was acting on the recommendation of the city Planning 
Department staff, which argued that the special permits were needed because the 
road would go through an area that is part of the Las Virgenes Road Scenic 
Corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 If the council sides with the Planning Commission, Ahmanson has three 
alternatives, according to Steve Quintanilla, the city's deputy city attorney. 
It can withdraw its application, submit the materials the Planning Department 
has requested or sue the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson Land Co. wants to build 3,050 homes, two golf courses and 400,000 
square feet of commercial space in a hilly area southeast of Simi Valley near 
the Los Angeles County border. Las Virgenes Road would be part of a major road 
system to the development. 
</P>
<P>
 Quintanilla said that all the hearings to date have centered on technical 
issues, not whether the development would be good for Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Planning Commission hearing and City Council hearing are not looking at 
the merits of the projects," he said. "We are just looking at whether the 
application is complete. Once the application is deemed complete, it will go 
through the regular review process." 
</P>
<P>
 The city, Quintanilla said, had originally insisted that Ahmanson Land Co. get 
a special permit to remove oak trees, but dropped the condition when it was 
deemed that none would be affected. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Bob Hill said this week that the city has "a fairly strict 
policy on how we review things." 
</P>
<P>
 "I can only speak for me, but if the facts are found to be accurate, according 
to the policies that we review applications on, it might well be that the 
Planning Commission's vote will stand," Hill said. FRANK MANNING

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: ARLETA; MAN SENTENCED FOR 'CLONING' PHONES

<P>
 An Arleta man who was arrested after Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies 
found "cloned" cellular telephones in his home has been sentenced to 30 days on 
a Caltrans work crew after pleading no contest to fraudulently obtaining 
telephone service. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Municipal Judge Alan Ellis handed down the sentence Wednesday to 
George Dana, 31, said Deputy City Atty.Kenneth Tso, who handled the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge also placed Dana on two years probation and ordered him to pay 
restitution to Air Touch Cellular and L.A. Cellular, the amount of which will 
be determined at a hearing Nov. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana was arrested June 14 at his home by sheriff's deputies who received a tip 
that the location was being used to store cloned cellular telephones, which had 
been illegally altered so that calls made on them were charged to the numbers 
of legitimate telephone users. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies found four cloned cellular telephones at Dana's residence, including 
one that had been reported stolen in Ventura County in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis ordered that the telephones seized at Dana's house be donated to the 
Sheriff's Department. JEFF SCHNAUFER

<TEXT>
<P>
 At a community meeting this week on a proposed landscape plan for Ventura 
Boulevard, architects struggled to get residents to address aesthetic ideas, 
but residents made it clear they were more interested in practical issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people did say . . . they felt comfortable with the direction that we 
are going toward, but they were much more concerned with who was going to pay 
for it, that parking be added, and they were determined that we not widen the 
streets," said Andrew Sussman, one of the volunteer architects who helped draw 
up the proposed plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were several people who remarked that it was all well and good to look 
at doing different things with trees and the intersections, but what were we 
going to do about parking?" said Sondra Frohlich, a member of the residents 
committee that worked with the architects on the proposal.  
</P>
<P>
 Neon palm sculptures, bougainvillea-covered shade canopies and a new movie 
theater were among the suggested improvements that architects proposed 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfredo Annino, who owns both property and businesses along the boulevard, 
said the evening provided the public with an introduction to some landscaping 
concepts, and he believed the architects and residents would eventually be able 
to agree on a plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the idea of more greenery and more shade. I love the idea of more 
parking," Annino said. KAY HWANGBO

MOLINA TO RECONSIDER VOTE FOR COUNTY LIBRARY TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just three weeks ago, Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina cast the 
swing vote approving a new library tax on one condition: that she be allowed to 
change her mind if county accountants turned up surplus funds from the last 
fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 Molina now says she plans to exercise her option. County officials have 
recently discovered they have additional funds, mostly from higher than 
expected property tax revenues. Although the exact amount will not be released 
until early next month, early estimates range from the tens of millions to $170 
million, more than enough to replace the $16 million the new library tax will 
raise this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Having endorsed the library tax reluctantly -- it will cost owners of 
single-family homes $28.50 a year -- Molina is determined to bring the matter 
back for reconsideration as soon as the final surplus amount is known. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gloria, above all, is thinking of the impact on taxpayers, especially on 
people who are already overtaxed," Molina spokesman Robert Alaniz said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Molina is intent on bringing the matter back to the Board of 
Supervisors, she has not decided whether to repeal her vote, Alaniz said. He 
refused to comment on whether she would support a compromise that would lower 
the tax rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Administrative Officer Sally R. Reed said she will recommend against 
repeal or reduction of the tax because the money is desperately needed to plug 
gaps in the $14.2-billion county budget. County Librarian Sandra Reuben said 
the tax is essential because it guarantees annual funding for the beleaguered 
county library system. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new tax plan, property owners in unincorporated areas and 16 cities 
will be assessed a special fee on their property tax bills to fund county 
libraries, which have had to drastically reduce hours and services because of 
state budget cutbacks. The new county fees will range from the $28.50 
assessment on single-family homes to bills of several hundred dollars for 
commercial properties. 
</P>
<P>
 The recently adopted library benefit assessment district is also under attack 
by two of the state's largest taxpayer organizations, which filed a lawsuit 
against the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors seeking to overturn it. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the Howard Jarvis Taxpayer's Assn. and the Los Angeles Taxpayers 
Assn. argued in court papers that the assessment fees are illegal under the 
state Constitution.

A MILESTONE FOR CANINE CATCHERS; PUBLICITY HOUND CELEBRATES THE 20TH 
ANNIVERSARY OF FRISBEE STUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Even a promoter as adept as Irv Lander could not have staged what he witnessed 
at Dodger Stadium on the evening of Aug. 5, 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the baseball crowd -- and a national television audience -- Alex Stein 
and his dog, Ashley Whippet, dashed onto the field and into a 
well-choreographed routine of long, hovering throws and running, leaping 
catches of a plastic flying disc. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd roared. Slack-jawed security guards watched for eight minutes before 
ending the unauthorized performance. NBC broadcaster Joe Garagiola, speaking 
for millions of home viewers, exclaimed that he had never seen anything like 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Lander, a self-employed Van Nuys advertising agent with a history of promoting 
kooky contests, wasn't about to let what he had witnessed slip from his grasp. 
He trailed after Stein, bailed him out of jail and paid his $250 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was dazzled by the dog," Lander recalled recently. "He could run 35 m.p.h. 
and catch a Frisbee in his jaws. I immediately had a vision for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Two decades of promotions and publicity stunts later, "canine Frisbee," as the 
sport is officially known, is celebrating a milestone. And Lander, founder and 
executive director of the Canine Frisbee Disc Championships, remains top dog of 
the far-fetched pastime that has a niche in pop culture. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20th world championships will take place Saturday on the grounds of the 
Washington Monument in the nation's capital. Six months of community and 
regional competitions involving more than 5,000 dogs will culminate with 14 
finalists vying for the Lander Cup, the trophy named after . . . Irv Lander. 
The winners also receive a $1,000 savings bond and a year's supply of dog food. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 10,000 spectators attended last year's event at the same venue. In 
previous years, Lander, who still lives in Van Nuys, has held his "world 
championships" at the Rose Bowl, Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla., the 
Astrodome in Houston, RFK Stadium in Washington and Wrigley Field in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever the publicity hound, Lander spends time between competitions coordinating 
exhibitions and soliciting the participation of celebrities, sports figures, 
politicians -- anyone whose persona might promote canine Frisbee. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1976, he presented organizers of the Democratic National Convention with 
1,000 Frisbees, each emblazoned with the names of Jimmy Carter and Walter 
Mondale. A year later, he and Alex Stein were guests at the White House, where 
Ashley Whippet retrieved Frisbees thrown by Amy Carter and posed for 
photographs with Grits, the nation's First Dog. 
</P>
<P>
 Lander corresponded with former National Football League Commissioner Pete 
Rozelle for more than a year before the league finally agreed to sponsor a 
halftime exhibition at Super Bowl XII in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always reach for the sky," said Lander, who declined to reveal his age 
beyond saying he is a senior citizen. "I'm not, by nature, a very pushy person 
or an extrovert. But I'm very persevering." 
</P>
<P>
 "Without Irv, there would be no (canine Frisbee). It's as simple as that," 
said Peter Bloeme, the 1984 world champion, who now serves as an organizer and 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Publicity was Lander's long suit before he met Stein. For years, he had served 
as a consultant to toy manufacturers, organizing and promoting contests 
involving everything from Hula-Hoops to yo-yos. As a consultant to Wham-O, 
Lander served as executive director of the International Frisbee Assn., which 
sanctioned competition between people but had never considered canines -- until 
Stein and his dog did their thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a year, Lander had secured sponsorship from major pet food companies 
and, with Stein, developed the sport's rules and staged its first competition: 
the Ashley Whippet Invitational. Ashley Whippet went on to win three world 
championships before dying in 1985, at age 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, the game of fling and fetch has become more than a contest in 
which daring young dogs "fly through the air with the greatest of fleas," as 
Lander likes to say. 
</P>
<P>
 After Ashley Whippet's demise, Sports Illustrated eulogized the first Frisbee 
dog as an American sports legend, "both a Naismith (basketball's inventor) and 
a (Babe) Ruth." 
</P>
<P>
 A bevy of books and instructional videocassettes were released by Frisbee-dog 
competitors, espousing the fundamentals of training. Almost overnight, dog 
owners across the nation began to shun the stick in favor of the Frisbee. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Lander leaves the contest judging to others. Although he used to 
spend as much as six months a year roving the country, he attended only three 
of seven regional finals this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Lander is ever watchful for the opportunity to capitalize. He plans to 
schedule the stunt at a San Fernando Valley park within the next month, with 
Wham-O officials and -- he hopes -- media representatives as witnesses. He owns 
the hound whose skills will be tested that day: Cheyenne Ashley Whippet, 
grand-dog of the late, great one. "He can run fast and leap high," Lander said. 
"He's a lot like Ashley."

UCLA ESTIMATES QUAKE WORK AT $650 MILLION; EDUCATION: CHANCELLOR YOUNG TELLS 
REGENTS MONEY IS NEEDED FOR RETROFITTING, FINISHING REPAIRS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. MICHAEL KENNEDY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 UCLA officials estimated Thursday that they will need $650 million to retrofit 
the campus for earthquake safety and finish repairs of damage from the Jan. 17 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA Chancellor Charles Young, in an oral report to the UC Board of Regents, 
said most of the retrofit work, about $500 million worth, is needed on the 
university's health sciences complex. The rest of the money would be used to 
repair and retrofit other campus buildings, including about $38 million to fix 
damage at historic Royce Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Young said the huge investment, mostly from federal funds, is needed in seven 
buildings in the medical complex because they are considered essential 
services. The goal, he said, is for the hospital to be functional in the event 
of another catastrophe like the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "The concern is to see to it that those facilities are usable following an 
incident like the one we were confronted with last January," he told the 
regents. If not, he said, "the buildings could be left unusable to meet the 
medical emergency." 
</P>
<P>
 Young also said that while the retrofitting was under way, he would favor 
spending another $500 million to upgrade the medical complex, including razing 
and rebuilding a number of the buildings. He said many of them were 40 to 50 
years old and in need of major improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 A more exact price tag on the project should be ready in November, after a 
team of engineers -- financed by the federal government -- completes a study of 
all 9,100 rooms in the health sciences complex. Dr. Raymond G. Schultze, 
director of the UCLA Medical Center, said that retrofitting the complex could 
take six to 12 years if it is done while the complex continues to function. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the buildings in the medical facility have been closed because of 
earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Thursday, UC Provost Walter E. Massey delivered bad news on the 
enrollment and budget fronts. In a report on future enrollment in the UC 
system, Massey said the universities may not be able to accommodate the 
expected rise in the number of students applying to colleges in California over 
the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "The University of California will be able to continue to admit all eligible 
students who wish to attend only if the lowest of all the enrollment estimates 
turns out to be true," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the inability to accommodate undergraduate enrollment demand will put 
additional pressure on the other California systems, including private colleges 
and universities. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they, too, are short of funds, some students who want to attend higher 
education may not have the opportunity to do so," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related development, the regents were also told the UC system anticipates 
the largest enrollment of freshmen in its history, about 22,000. The largest 
entering class before this year was 21,825 students in 1988.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; CHAMBER HOPES SHERMANOPOLY COLLECTS $3,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to come up with a unique idea for promoting Sherman Oaks 
businesses, the local Chamber of Commerce went back to the game board. 
</P>
<P>
 The business group has come up with Shermanopoly, a localized version of the 
popular board game Monopoly. Businesses who buy squares on the board will have 
their names appear in place of Park Place or Boardwalk. 
</P>
<P>
 The venture is a fund-raiser for the chamber, which hopes to net about $3,000. 
People may begin placing orders now for the game, which will be available by 
mid-November, said Julie Russell, the chamber's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell envisions a game board that will include such landmark community 
businesses as the Sherman Oaks Galleria and Tower Records. Just about any 
business, organization or professional with community ties can pay to have 
their name put on the board, a chance card or play money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even a family can be part of the game," said Dan Siegel, a project director 
for Hometown Games, which is manufacturing the games for the chamber. "The only 
people we would turn away is an X-rated business. This is a family game." 
</P>
<P>
 Spaces on the game board go for roughly $240 to $960. Not only do businesses 
get their names in the game, they also get their money's worth of the games, 
which sell for $19.95 a piece. 
</P>
<P>
 Hometown Games has made enough changes in the appearance of the game that 
Parker Bros., the maker of Monopoly, could not accuse it of trademark 
infringement, Siegel said. For example, unlike the original Monopoly, which 
used primary colors and a square playing area, Shermanopoly will sport pastel 
tones and a playing area with rounded corners. 
</P>
<P>
 said chamber President Nancy Schmidt. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the game rules are similar to those of Monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it's going to be a fun kind of thing, a unique piece for the Valley 
and a real positive way to get our name out," Some businesses have already 
expressed interest in buying "real estate" in Sherman Oaks. According to 
Siegel, the Sherman Oaks Galleria has said it will buy a space, and others who 
have made inquiries are Robinsons-May, Taco Bell, Sherman Oaks Castle and 
American Pacific State Bank.  
</P>
<P>
 Sherman Oaks is the third community in the San Fernando Valley to indulge in 
such fun and games, joining Chatsworth and Westlake Village. Other Southern 
California cities to come out with their own games are Beverly Hills, Moorpark, 
Malibu, El Segundo, Santa Barbara and Rancho Bernardo. KAY HWANGBO

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: SPEAKERS TO DISCUSS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Joyce Unsworth, 46, of Los Angeles, is one of the lucky ones. She lived to 
tell about her nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 It lasted two long months, until one night, after her new husband had given 
her a particularly brutal beating, she fled from the house in terror. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was Halloween, and I was running from house to house, and I was wearing 
white, and I was covered with blood," she said. "And people, when they opened 
their doors, they were laughing, they thought I was trick-or-treating." 
</P>
<P>
 She ended up in a battered women's shelter, where she put together a plan to 
leave her husband of two months. She never went back to him.  
</P>
<P>
 Unsworth, who suffers permanent nerve damage from the beatings four years ago, 
has this message for battering victims: Domestic violence is potentially fatal 
to the victim. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get the hell out, because he'll finish you off," she said. "The first time 
they hit you or threaten you, you should leave, because you might not make it 
if you don't." 
</P>
<P>
 She'll tell her story Monday night to about 200 people from private 
organizations and public agencies at a special meeting aimed at combatting 
domestic violence. The event, open free to the public, is sponsored by the Los 
Angeles City Commission on the Status of Women. It will be at 7 p.m. at Kaiser 
Permanente's Woodland Hills Medical Office Building, 5601 De Soto Ave., 
Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The program was organized in part by Los Angeles Councilwoman Laura Chick. 
Speakers will include Detective Mitch Robins of the Los Angeles Police 
Department, who will discuss the LAPD's new procedures for handling domestic 
violence calls, and a new special unit at the LAPD's Van Nuys Division 
specializing in domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Betty Fisher of Haven Hills Inc. Family Violence Center of the San Fernando 
Valley also will speak, as will Alana Bowman, a supervising deputy attorney 
with the city attorney's office. Bowman will discuss her office's role in 
prosecuting batterers. 
</P>
<P>
 Another scheduled speaker, Bonnie Lipton, a licensed clinical social worker at 
Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Panorama City, said her facility sees 
several battering cases each week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've identified it as a problem for years," Lipton said. "But I think 
society at large is really beginning to identify this as a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 One sign of that new awareness, she said, is that medical facilities in 
California are now mandated by law to report cases of suspected domestic 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 There are several signs medical workers can look for to spot abuse, Lipton 
said, including physical injuries -- especially when it appears that patients 
are lying about how they got hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Other less obvious signs are complaints about headaches, hyperventilation, 
gastrointestinal symptoms, insomnia, and back and pelvic pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, battering victims are often shy and embarrassed and may cry when being 
treated, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 And victims are sometimes accompanied by their partners, who stay very close 
and attempt to answer all questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Victims can call a hot line for help, Lipton said. The number is (800) 
548-2722. FRANK MANNING

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; RESIDENTS WANT SAY IN REDEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents here said at a community meeting this week that they want more local 
control over a proposed Sherman Oaks redevelopment project than it appears the 
city is willing to grant. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) said at a meeting of the Sherman Oaks 
Homeowners Assn. on Wednesday that he supports the residents' request. 
</P>
<P>
 "My bias is not for neighborhood input but neighborhood control," Hayden said. 
"The law is ambiguous. You bargain for what you can get." 
</P>
<P>
 The Community Redevelopment Agency has proposed that a community advisory body 
be established in Sherman Oaks so that the public will have an opportunity to 
comment as the plan is carried out. The City Council is expected to decide 
whether to approve the project in mid to late November.  
</P>
<P>
 The citizens committee could take the form of either a Community Advisory 
Committee, which would only have an advisory role, or a Project Area Committee, 
which would have more legal power. A Project Area Committee, for example, has 
the power to reject a redevelopment plan, a decision that can only be 
overridden by a two-thirds majority of the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Alisa Katz, chief of staff to City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, said Sherman 
Oaks will have a Community Advisory Committee because project area committee 
members must live, rent or own property in the project area. Yaroslavsky wants 
involvement by a broader segment of the community, Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky supports the idea of the committee having the power -- while 
Council District 5 is without a City Council member -- to reject individual 
projects that the CRA proposes within the redevelopment area. That decision 
could only be overturned by a two-thirds majority vote of the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Council District 5, which includes Sherman Oaks, will be without a council 
representative for about seven months beginning Dec. 4, when Yaroslavsky leaves 
office to become a Los Angeles County supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents want the committee to have the power to reject any individual 
project that the CRA proposes within the project area. 
</P>
<P>
 "What does Zev have against us having say-so in the area?" one woman asked 
Katz during the meeting. "The project is going to be here for 40 years. Zev is 
going to be gone in two months. . . . We're the only ones who are going to be 
here for 40 years." Yaroslavsky opposes granting the committee veto power 
because he believes the panel would have authority without being accountable to 
the people whose lives its decisions would affect. The only person who should 
have that power is the council member, he said. KAY HWANGBO

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: HEARINGS PLANNED ON WATER RATE CHANGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 San Fernando Valley residents concerned about a proposed change in water rates 
will have an opportunity to question Los Angeles Department of Water and Power 
commissioners about the issue at two upcoming hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 The first hearing will be held Wednesday at Valley College's Monarch Hall, 
5800 Fulton Ave., Van Nuys.The second will be held Oct. 11 at the DWP's Water 
and Power Aqueduct Filtration Plant, 13101 Sepulveda Blvd., Sylmar. Both 
meetings begin at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the hearings is to receive input on the proposal of Mayor 
Richard Riordan's Blue Ribbon Committee on Water Rates to revise the structure 
of the city's water rates for single-family residential customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Water rates were restructured in 1993 into a two-block structure to encourage 
water conservation among all customers. 
</P>
<P>
 But after conducting public hearings and reviewing the impact of the new water 
structure, the Blue Ribbon panel recommended that the existing two-block 
structure be retained, but that the method of establishing the amount of water 
at the lower block be modified. 
</P>
<P>
 The new structure takes into account varying lot size, temperature and 
household size among customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new proposal, which must be approved by water commissioners and the 
City Council, nearly 63% of DWP customers will have lower bills, while about 
32% will see their bills increased. JEFF SCHNAUFER

COUNTY DEDICATES ANTELOPE VALLEY'S 1ST AIDS CLINIC; HEALTH: THE HOPE CENTER 
INCLUDES FOUR EXAMINING ROOMS AND A NURSES STATION. ONE OF ITS FIRST PATIENTS 
HAS HIGH PRAISE FOR THE STAFF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Antelope Valley's first AIDS clinic was dedicated here Thursday by county 
officials who said it would provide specialized care for patients who might 
otherwise have to seek treatment in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The outpatient clinic, called the Antelope Valley Hope Center, includes a 
private waiting area, four examining rooms and a nurses station. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the clinic's first patients said the Hope Center staff is much more 
sympathetic than the personnel at a local private physician's office where he 
was told he had AIDS.  
</P>
<P>
 "They weren't able to deal with the situation," said David, 42, of Palmdale 
who asked that his last name not be printed. "They were very uncomfortable with 
it, and they made me feel very uncomfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, David said, the Hope Center staff was "very encouraging. They're 
very positive. I've gone all over the (Antelope) valley to other doctors and 
have gone to a specialist in Newhall. But I'm most comfortable here." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hope Center actually opened its doors to patients Aug. 12 in the county's 
High Desert Hospital complex at 60th Street West and Avenue I in Lancaster. 
Ribbon-cutting ceremonies were delayed until Thursday, when county and city 
dignitaries were able to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, doctors at the center have seen 15 patients. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to treating his medical problems, the clinic has also provided a 
social worker who meets each week with David and his wife to discuss other 
issues arising from the diagnosis of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. "It's 
been a great help," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I was well-informed, but I found out I wasn't. They're able to put 
you in contact with other agencies and support groups." 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to the opening of the clinic, the only medical office specializing in 
AIDS treatment in the Antelope Valley was that of physician Susan Lawrence. She 
also founded the area's only AIDS support and activist group, the 
Lancaster-based Catalyst Foundation for AIDS Awareness and Care. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence attended Thursday's dedication ceremony and praised the new facility, 
which is being largely funded by a $300,000 federal grant for its first year. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are services provided here that we were not able to provide at 
Catalyst," Lawrence said. "The treatment here is complementary with ours." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hope Center, for example, will be able to dispense free AIDS drug 
treatments to some of the patients who are not eligible to receive them through 
Lawrence's private practice, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence said her group can supplement the county clinic's operation by 
referring its patients to support groups and providing volunteers to drive them 
to medical appointments and help with household chores. 
</P>
<P>
 A key purpose of Thursday's ceremony was to spread the word about the new 
county clinic, said Ray Johnson, assistant administrator of High Desert 
Hospital. He said the clinic is open to AIDS patients with private insurance 
and Medi-Cal coverage, as well as to indigents. 
</P>
<P>
 According to county records, about 125 people with AIDS were living in the 
Antelope Valley as of last May, Johnson said. He estimated that another 400 
local residents have tested positive for the HIV virus that causes AIDS, but 
are not exhibiting symptoms of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Puentes, one of two physicians assigned to the clinic, said he wants 
to encourage people to begin treatment in the earliest stages of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "Early recognition and early management equates to lower overall health-care 
costs," he said. "We can prevent infections that could be life-threatening." 
</P>
<P>
 Just preceding the dedication of the clinic, High Desert Hospital 
administrators released an independent review panel's report that endorsed the 
county's plan to replace the hospital with a new medical center. 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor Mike Antonovich ordered the review after Antelope Valley 
Hospital officials complained that a proposed new county hospital would 
duplicate too many of its services, such as its emergency room and its 
childbirth facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The review panel determined that High Desert, which opened in 1961, should be 
replaced with a more modern and more efficient facility. It also urged that the 
new hospital not include an emergency room or childbirth facilities, but that 
it should provide 24-hour urgent care services and mental health care programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley Hospital officials said they were satisfied with the report's 
recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 Although construction funds have not yet been approved, county officials hope 
to break ground for the 165-bed hospital in late 1995 at 30th Street West and 
Avenue I in Lancaster. * MORE NEWS

COLLEGE OF CANYONS MARKS ANNIVERSARY; EDUCATION: THE SCHOOL, WHICH HELPED BRING 
CULTURE TO THE AGRICULTURAL REGION, LOOKS BACK ON 25 YEARS OF CHANGE AND 
GROWTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In recognition of its 25th anniversary, College of the Canyons was touted 
Thursday as a cooperative effort that brought culture to an area that was 
mostly farmland when the school was founded. 
</P>
<P>
 The college's first classes were offered after-hours at a local high school 
and its original site for a campus was changed because neighbors feared having 
college students in their midst. 
</P>
<P>
 "This day is an example of what College of the Canyons is all about -- people 
working together to accomplish a common goal," said Dianne Van Hook, college 
superintendent-president. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Hook spoke to about 250 students and faculty members scattered around an 
open area known as Honor Grove. Many in the crowd forwent rows of white chairs 
to sit on the sloped lawn or lean over balconies from surrounding classroom 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is definitely a different time, a changing time," Van Hook told the 
group. "I want you to think about where you were 25 years ago. Before you know 
it, the future you thought was so far off will greet you in the mirror in the 
morning." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Hook also said educational leaders must face the challenges of making 
community colleges more accessible and they must join the information age with 
computers and new technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Visiting officials included Santa Clarita Mayor George Pederson, who was one 
of the college's first instructors, and David Mertes, chancellor of the 
California Community Colleges system. 
</P>
<P>
 "Community colleges are a fundamental statement about California," Mertes 
said. "The four-year institutions, as fabulous as they are, are models of 
institutions that came from Europe. Community colleges essentially grew up with 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Newhall, a founding member of the Santa Clarita Valley Historical Society 
and former editor of Santa Clarita's Signal newspaper, spoke from a historical 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 "This college has done miracles," she said. "It has brought world culture to 
the valley, which didn't even have a bookstore." 
</P>
<P>
 The school was originally to be built near Camp Plenty Road in Canyon Country 
on a site previously designated for an elementary school. But residents' 
complaints forced a switch to an area that was then planted with onions. 
</P>
<P>
 The school's name also had to be chosen carefully, Newhall said, avoiding any 
reference to the surrounding communities. At the time, one group of residents 
wanted it named for Santa Clarita and another wanted Valencia in the title. 
</P>
<P>
 Although much of the event focused on the college's past, Mertes concluded his 
comments with a look at the future. "We are defining the kind of society we 
will live in 25 years from now," he said.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES: CHARTER SCHOOLS CAN PROVIDE THE ANSWERS TO HARD PROBLEMS; 
EDUCATION: BY WAIVING 6,000 PAGES OF EDUCATION CODE, THEY CAN CHANGE CURRICULUM 
AND SET THEIR OWN STANDARDS. THEY CAN SAVE MONEY BY CUTTING ADMINISTRATIVE 
BLOAT. THE TRICK IS WINNING SCHOOL BOARD APPROVAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By JOY ANTHONY, Joy Anthony is a field representative for state Assemblyman Gil 
Ferguson in Newport Beach.

<P>
 Junior high school principal Mary Ann Owsley has taken a path that 99.5% of 
all the public school principals in California have avoided. She has opened a 
charter public school in Orange, one of only 63 such schools in the state and 
the first charter school in Orange County. Until Owsley came along, charters 
were non-starters. 
</P>
<P>
 Charter schools are regular public schools that are allowed to waive 6,000 
pages of Education Code to do obvious things, like take charge of the 
curriculum. Charter schools can save a school money by cutting administrative 
bloat. They can offer early-morning or late-evening classes, by charging for 
them. They can bring in '50s-style discipline and uniforms. They can hire 
non-credentialed instructors to increase the teacher/student ratio. To take 
just one example, T. Jefferson Parker could teach creative writing, without 
having to prove his merits with a piece of paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally important, the charter concept allows a school to change teacher 
evaluation methods. Fountain Valley Supt. Rubin Ingram says his district spent 
$50,000 over a two-year period to rid a school of an incompetent second-grade 
teacher who "behaved bizarrely" and "couldn't keep her wig on straight." In a 
charter school, he could have said, "my way or the highway." 
</P>
<P>
 An L.A. charter school called Edutrain is a perfect case in point of what can 
be done away from the Education Code's mandated bureaucracy. Keith Turnage 
started the school as a nonprofit corporation, with the help of Pacific Mutual, 
Wells Fargo, Bank of America and a host of other corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 A home to juvenile delinquents, Edutrain employs about half of its 800 
students as clerical workers, gardeners and security aides -- something schools 
down the street can't do -- in addition to offering solid academics. Turnage 
says his school "saves" juveniles from the streets and from existing juvenile 
camps. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, an El Dorado County charter school run by Principal Marta Reyes and 
Supt. Ken Lowry takes a "Nordstrom's approach" to educating juvenile 
delinquents. The school pays teachers anywhere from $7 to $27 an hour, based on 
merit, not seniority or number of degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 The fly in the ointment in the charter approach is the approval process. State 
legislation passed in 1992 requires that 50% of the teachers in a school, or 
10% of the teachers in a district, sign a petition, which then must be approved 
by the school board and the Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is not with the teachers, whose support is a necessary but not a 
sufficient condition for success. The stumbling block is the school board. The 
charter petition gives a school the right to secede from the district, taking 
the power of the purse with it. Although a school board that approves a charter 
petition can revoke the entire charter contract, or deny renewal when the 
charter school's five-year contract is up, the school has five years with which 
to prove itself away from school board politics and interference. It's a rare 
school board that will allow that. 
</P>
<P>
 To get a charter approved, it helps a great deal if a school district is ripe 
for change. Orange Unified had suffered through seven different superintendents 
in four years, and at least one new principal every year in the same period. On 
top of that, one school board member had been charged with statutory rape, 
another was convicted of extreme anti-abortion activities in front of a clinic. 
A third public employee, back in the 1980s, was convicted of a major 
embezzlement. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation is similar in Los Angeles Unified, where charter applications 
have reached the maximum 10 schools per district. There is a feeling among 
parents and teachers that any change is better than no change. Both are tired 
of living in an area where 100 administrators make over $100,000 a year, yet 
children feel unsafe in school. 
</P>
<P>
 A bill that would have allowed L.A. and other districts to have more than 10 
charter schools died this year. So did a dozen others that would have 
encouraged more charter start-ups. On the plus side, the charter movement has 
allies on both sides of the political aisle. Ultraliberal Sen. Tom Hayden 
(D-Santa Monica) and staunch conservative Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport 
Beach) both introduced pro-charter legislation this year. Any movement that can 
unite those two can't be all bad.

 Are you ready for some football? 
</P>
<P>
 And some more football? 
</P>
<P>
 And some more football after that, as ESPN becomes the All-Gridiron Network, 
ESPN2 debuts "Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference Game of the Week" 
(up next: the perennial Hamline-Gustavus Adolphus grudge match), Fox airs 
"Arena Football: The First 75 Months" and The Hockey News becomes a one-page 
insert with Pro Football Weekly? 
</P>
<P>
 Just think -- all those delightfully entertaining Mighty Duck telecasts 
preempted and replaced with "Ram Rout In Review." 
</P>
<P>
 Let me be the first to welcome you to Pigskin Nation, on the assumption that 
Gary Bettman carries out Thursday's threat and postpones the regularly 
scheduled start of the NHL season, which was supposed to have been Oct. 1, to. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 Nov. 1? 
</P>
<P>
 Dec. 1? 
</P>
<P>
 2001? 
</P>
<P>
 You American sporting spectators had far too many choices as it was. Too much 
clutter on the airwaves, too many results to read in the newspaper. These 
distractions were no good for you, no good at all, because instead of getting 
to work early and greasing the wheels of American commerce, you were too busy 
fooling around at home with the directions to VCR Plus. 
</P>
<P>
 So Bettman, Bud Selig and the owners of 54 franchises in two major sports 
leagues have taken it upon themselves to act on your behalf and simplify life 
for you. "Streamline" things, to borrow a Bettman power-speak favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 Come October, there will be no baseball playoffs and no World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging from the sneering, we're taking-the-pucks-and-going-home tone of 
Bettman's Thursday conference call, there will be no hockey, either. 
</P>
<P>
 With basketball season more than a month away, Paul Tagliabue becomes Mr. 
October and wistful hockey fans click away aimlessly on their remote controls, 
hoping, maybe, to see some sleet in Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the ages, scientists have held that stupidity is not contagious, 
but what do they know? Bettman and his flock of BMW-owning sheep spent the last 
month-and-a-half watching baseball build a gallows, fasten the noose and yell 
"Geronimo!" Then they stared at each other, nodded in unison and declared, 
"Sounds like something for us." 
</P>
<P>
 In theory, the baseball shutdown was the best thing that could have happened 
to hockey. The sudden lack of a World Series would create a mass media void, 
and hockey, overdue for a break for decades, would be there to fill it. 
</P>
<P>
 On this side of the border, hockey has never looked healthier. A team from New 
York won the Stanley Cup. While the NBA playoffs degenerated into five-on-five 
goonery, the NHL postseason won legions of new fans with sudden-death, 
hit-the-post dramatics. Sports Illustrated, with a cover story Bettman couldn't 
have obtained had he sold his soul to Lucifer, proclaimed the NHL "hot" and the 
NBA "not." Fox, billing itself as the sports network of the 21st Century, 
hustled to sign the league to a five-year broadcasting contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The hockey revolution has stormed the beach -- you can tell by the 
roller-hockey pickup games at surfside -- and baseball has laid down its arms. 
Now is the time to strike. Gain a foothold now and it is instant entrenchment. 
</P>
<P>
 Where the NHL is today, the NBA was 15 years ago. October 1994 is pro hockey's 
Magic Johnson-Larry Bird moment. 
</P>
<P>
 And Bettman should know, because he was there at the time, the NBA never 
locked Magic and Bird out of the gym. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry. Did I say lockout? There will be no lockout of NHL players if no new 
collective bargaining agreement is in place by Oct. 1, Bettman has asserted. 
</P>
<P>
 No, there will only be a "postponement." 
</P>
<P>
 And that isn't a salary cap the owners are demanding, Bettman insists. Just a 
"luxury tax" on teams that happen to spend "above a certain level," thus 
"driving up the market for everybody else." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't you know your hockey jargon by now? 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman says he has stared into the abyss that is major league baseball '94 
and admits that "we have considered that there are a lot more positive reasons 
to be playing. The new TV contract. The new acceptance our sport has gained. 
</P>
<P>
 "But, you can't use a short-term fix to deal with the future of this or any 
other enterprise . . . Two or three weeks with no competition from baseball, 
while it might be nice, won't be the cure for what's ailing right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman says that if he has learned anything from baseball's brain seizure, 
it's that "you can turn your season into a disaster if you don't open it 
without a collective bargaining agreement in place." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the NHL did just that last year and enjoyed perhaps the most exciting and 
popular season in its history. Flushing that head of steam now, just to see if 
you can grind the players' noses into the ice, and Bettman should be assigned 
to the same padded cell as Selig, flipping to see who gets the bottom bunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball, even at its most self-destructive, still has a reservoir of goodwill 
from which to draw that hockey does not. For 120 years or so, baseball had been 
America's Game, something of a birthright in this country. Hockey, as flavorful 
as it might be, remains an acquired taste. An import. A foreign delicacy, but 
not a staple. 
</P>
<P>
 In a culture where sports fans are raised to appreciate their beer on ice and 
not much else, pulling the plate away at this point is risky business.

TITAN ASSISTANT HAWKING NAMED INTERIM COACH; BASKETBALL: FULLERTON WILL BE HIS 
FIRST COLLEGE HEAD COACHING JOB. HE SUCCEEDS BRAD HOLLAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Titan assistant coach Bob Hawking was named Thursday as Cal State Fullerton's 
interim basketball coach, fulfilling what he called a "lifelong dream to become 
a Division I head coach." 
</P>
<P>
 There wasn't a heavy emphasis on the word "interim," but it was evident. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletic Director John Easterbrook, in only his third day on the job, said he 
thought it was important to move "as quickly as possible for the stability of 
the program." He called the appointment "the best move for the university, for 
the basketball players and the department right now." He also said the job 
would be posted "toward the end of the season," and Hawking vowed to try to win 
it on a permanent basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Practice begins Oct. 15, and the Titans play their first regular season game 
Nov. 29 at home against Cal State Northridge, Hawking's alma mater. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking, 44, has been the top assistant for two years for Brad Holland, who 
resigned Monday to become coach at the University of San Diego. Hawking coached 
14 years at Simi Valley High, and was an assistant for two years at both 
Pepperdine and UC Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bob certainly has the background and training to be our basketball coach for 
this year," Easterbrook said at a monthly luncheon of basketball boosters, 
where Hawking's appointment was announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Holland, who had recommended Hawking for the job, made a brief appearance at 
the gathering, and said: "I'm pleased the university made this decision. His 
title was assistant, but he's always been a head coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking said he thought it would be a "smooth transition," and had no plans to 
change the the team's style of play, although he indicated the personnel 
available might dictate more occasions of three-guard offense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played for Denny Crum for two years at Pierce College, and we were doing 
the same things in Woodland Hills that John Wooden was doing over at Pauley 
Pavilion," he said. "Brad and I do have some of the same basketball 
background." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking joked about what he called "the main differences" between him and 
Holland. "I'm a little older, a little more portly, and I get my golf handicap 
from Golf 'n Stuff, rather than Riviera Country Club." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking said his "interim" status could be a handicap in this year's 
recruiting process, but he called it a "hurdle we'll have to get over." Hawking 
said he had "been dealing with some of that anyway," because of the uncertainty 
surrounding Holland's future at Fullerton. Holland had been interviewed for the 
Nevada job after his first season, and his name also was mentioned in 
connection with the vacancy at Pepperdine this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does give the university a little leeway to determine whether I'm good 
enough to assume this job on a permanent basis," he said. " . . . I'm the kind 
of person who likes to take a lemon and make it lemonade." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking said he had hoped for a quick decision. "I think the team's morale is 
good now, although they were really stunned on Monday when Brad talked to 
them," he said. "I've recruited most of the players, and I felt good that they 
went to John and told him they wanted me as their coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Several players attended the luncheon and said they were were pleased by the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach Hawking knows all the players, and it will be a much better transition 
this way," sophomore guard Chris St. Clair said. "I think this whole thing has 
brought us closer together, and maybe that will help us, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior guard Danny Robinson said he was pleased "that there won't be any big 
changes with Coach Hawking . . . I think all of us have a better outlook this 
season, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking agreed. "We're expecting to have a whole lot better team this season," 
he said. "Brad isn't leaving the cupboard bare, by any means. And we're not 
going to have to suit up assistant coaches this year to go five-on-five in 
practice the way we did at times last year." 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans were 8-19 last season, 6-12 in the Big West Conference, after 
losing three players to injuries and another to academic ineligibility before 
the season began. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking also announced the addition of two transfer players, 6-8 Dirk Rassloff 
from Fairleigh Dickinson and 6-6 Maurice Madison from Northeastern Illinois. 
Both enrolled for the start of fall classes and will be redshirts this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking said George Fuller, who recently was hired by Holland, will become his 
top assistant, and George Tuttle will move into a full-time position from the 
restricted earnings spot on the staff.

NHL SEASON WON'T START WITHOUT DEAL; HOCKEY: MANAGEMENT DOES NOT WANT TO PLAY 
UNLESS COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT IS REACHED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The NHL's 78th season will not start as scheduled on Oct. 1 unless the league 
and its players can come to a collective bargaining agreement, Commissioner 
Gary Bettman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Bettman repeatedly said his edict does not constitute a lockout, the 
effect is the same. It would delay -- and possibly taint if games are canceled 
-- a season in which the NHL is to get its widest television exposure and 
hockey's popularity promises to continue its recent surge. 
</P>
<P>
 "In light of the current status of negotiations, in light of the experience in 
major league baseball and in light of this league's experience two years ago 
(with a 10-day strike before the playoffs), the NHL is not prepared to open a 
season that is subject to the risk of being lost prior to its completion," 
Bettman said, referring to the strike that halted baseball in August and last 
week led to the cancellation of the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe the prudent course of action is to put things on hold and continue 
to try and make a deal. When one is reached, we will be in a position to put 
all this behind us and have a full season . . . with playoffs and without 
distraction and most importantly, without the risk of interruption." 
</P>
<P>
 Reaching an accord in the next eight days "would be difficult and arduous but 
not impossible," Bettman said. He added that he told players that benefits he 
took away from them before camp opened would be retroactively restored should 
they agree to a deal by Oct. 1. Those benefits include payment of medical 
premiums for players who earn less than $350,000 annually, expense money and 
transportation to training camp. Players will not be paid if the season is 
delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman and Bob Goodenow, executive director of the NHL Players Assn., met 
four times in the last week without making appreciable progress. They are not 
scheduled to talk again until Monday, after Goodenow completes a tour of camps. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're at the North Pole, they're at the South Pole," Mighty Duck forward Stu 
Grimson said. "Someone's going to have to be hurt financially before someone's 
willing to cave in on their position. That's how far apart we are. That's how 
far apart they are in baseball. Every day people are losing money, it's just a 
question of who's going to stop the bleeding." 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman's move was a preemptive strike against a walkout by players after the 
season began. 
</P>
<P>
 "All you have to do is read the tea leaves," Bettman said of the likelihood of 
a strike. "There's no question the players' leverage increases with each day of 
the season." 
</P>
<P>
 Goodenow called the announcement a pressure play that jeopardizes the start of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lockout or postponement will not affect players in negotiations," he said. 
"The league wants to exert a different sort of pressure and that certainly is 
within their prerogative, but we have to take a very measured approach." 
</P>
<P>
 Remaining exhibition games will be played as scheduled. However, should the 
dispute stretch more than a week into the season, games may be canceled and 
clubs would have to determine how to compensate fans who have bought tickets. 
Bettman said training camps would remain open after Oct. 1 for players to 
voluntarily report. 
</P>
<P>
 Issues such as arbitration, free agency and a salary scale for players in 
their first three seasons have been at the forefront throughout talks. The key 
difference, however, is how each side proposes to bring small-market clubs onto 
equal footing with clubs that have greater sources of revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The NHL's plan focuses on salaries by setting a limit on club payrolls and 
taxing clubs that exceed that limit. The "fines" would be redistributed to 
small-market clubs. A minimum payroll would be established to force teams that 
have spent little on player salaries to spend more freely, theoretically 
resulting in the acquisition of better players who would make them more 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 Players see that as a means of depressing salaries and restricting movement 
because the fines might be as much as 200% of the salary of the player a club 
signs. They also say it makes them pay for management's fiscal mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a salary cap; it's called an internal budget," said King defenseman 
Marty McSorley, a member of the NHLPA's negotiating committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "There certainly will not be a salary cap. I can emphatically say not. It's 
not good for the game. I look at baseball and it's really curious to me. You 
can't argue with the fact that a lot of teams are making a lot of money. Why go 
back to the players and say, 'There are teams not making money and you have to 
help us.' Why can't they fix that (internally)? Nobody held a gun to anybody's 
head to sign Bobby Bonilla." 
</P>
<P>
 The players' proposal called for a 5% tax on revenues of all clubs, with the 
proceeds being distributed to the less affluent clubs. League officials doubt 
that would raise enough money to serve its stated purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 Players have said that if talks continued, they would play under the last 
collective bargaining agreement, which expired a year ago. However, that was 
rejected by club executives, whom Bettman said unanimously backed his actions 
when he addressed them by conference call Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Duck President Tony Tavares said, "I think a postponement is saying to the 
players association specifically, 'Hey guys, we tried to get this thing done. 
We don't have any time left.' This impasse has placed us in a position where we 
can't start on time. So this is probably a step just before something more 
drastic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Gary's absolutely accurate in what he's said, (that) for every game 
that gets played, the leverage ends up going completely over into the players' 
favor. They've already said they'll play under the existing contract. I don't 
think the owners have any specific interest in doing that right now. There are 
deep problems in this league that have to be resolved." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Bettman: "This league needs a new system and a new foundation to go 
forward. Our objective is the stability and growth of this league for the 
benefit of everyone associated with it. Our goal is to make a deal. With the 
developments of the last year (a TV deal with Fox and sponsorship by Nike and 
Anheuser-Busch) the time couldn't be better for this sport to have a deal. And 
the time couldn't be worse not to."

A LOSS AND A GAIN; AFTER MARK SEAY LOST A KIDNEY, GEORGE ALLEN HELPED HIM 
RESUME PLAYING AT LONG BEACH STATE.; NOW SEAY IS CATCHING ON IN NFL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than the street thug who shot him, or the kidney he lost, or the niece's 
life he saved, or the reluctant hero he has become, Mark Seay thinks about the 
coach who rescued him:  
</P>
<P>
 George Allen. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of Seay's unexpected ascent to starting receiver for the San Diego 
Chargers, the media have returned to probe the particulars of Halloween night, 
1988, when the then-Cal State Long Beach receiver went from innocent gang 
target to national hero. 
</P>
<P>
 Seay should put out a press-release, saying: "I was not a gang member. Bullets 
rang into my sister Mary's Long Beach home. I dived to cover my 3-year-old 
niece, Tashawnda. Slug pierced my back, tore through kidney and lodged three 
inches from my heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tashawnda and I survived. My kidney did not." 
</P>
<P>
 Seay has rehashed the play-by-play so often that he politely refers to it as 
his "situation" and prefers to leave it at that. 
</P>
<P>
 No, he does not consider himself a hero. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never got used to it, never will, to be honest," he said. "But I'll go with 
the flow. It's a no-win situation for me." 
</P>
<P>
 No, he doesn't mind if others consider him one, even if one of those "others" 
includes Jerry Sullivan, the Chargers' receiver coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "America should love this guy," he said of Seay. "We've got people running 
around shooting each other. People are looking for role models. Here is a 
great, old, American success story." 
</P>
<P>
 No, Seay said, the bullet still lodged in his chest doesn't hurt; no, he does 
not feel the effects of playing with one kidney. 
</P>
<P>
 But yes, he does miss sharing all he has earned with the late George Allen, 
the legendary coach who went back to school in the twilight of life to save the 
Cal State Long Beach football program and a wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always felt everything happens for a reason in your life," Seay said. 
"There was a reason why Coach Allen came into my life. I used to tell Coach he 
was God-sent here for me. He's the only person who could have helped out the 
way he did." 
</P>
<P>
 He said Allen is the reason Seay (pronounced Say) of San Bernardino will make 
an emotional and triumphant return Sunday when the 3-0 Chargers play the 1-2 
Raiders at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Allen jumped in to cover Seay, so to speak, the wide receiver said he 
found the strength to pursue a pro football career against improbable odds. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 4, at 27, after years of toil and doubt, Seay caught the first pass 
of his NFL career against Denver, a 29-yard scoring strike from quarterback 
Stan Humphries. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Seay said private thank-yous to two men upstairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It tied up a lot of loose ends," Seay said of Allen and the catch. 
</P>
<P>
 The next week at San Deigo Jack Murphy Stadium, with his parents in the 
stands, Seay had eight receptions for 119 yards and two touchdowns against 
Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 Seay will start against the Raiders as the Chargers' second-leading receiver 
with nine catches for 148 yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Had he accepted conventional wisdom, Seay would be entering the Coliseum only 
as a paying customer. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (the doctors) would have convinced me, I would not have been here," Seay 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordeal of the Halloween shooting was difficult enough. After the shooting, 
Seay was hospitalized for 2 1/2 weeks. Then, it was another two months of soup 
and bed rest. 
</P>
<P>
 But another fight awaited. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, 1989, Seay returned to classes and rejoined the Long Beach 
football squad for spring practice, intending to play the 1989 season. 
</P>
<P>
 That June, though, he was declared medically ineligible by Long Beach 
officials. For the school, the memory of Todd Hart lingered. Hart, a former 
49er player, was awarded a $2-million settlement from the state after he was 
paralyzed in a 1984 game against UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Some medical experts were concerned that Seay risked serious injury, playing 
with one kidney. 
</P>
<P>
 Seay said it was his risk. He sued the university in an effort to keep 
playing, but in September of 1989, a U.S. District judge denied the request for 
an injunction that would have permitted his return. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in the winter of 1989, Seay's godsend arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach shocked most observers when it announced the hiring of George 
Allen, the former Ram and Washington Redskin coach. 
</P>
<P>
 The move temporarily saved the financially strapped football program, which 
has since been dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen was several years removed from the game, in his 70s, and a controversial 
figure; a stubborn and stern ruler who had alienated so many that he 
essentially was exiled to his own football Elba. 
</P>
<P>
 But Allen changed Mark Seay's fortunes. Soon after he was hired, Allen told 
Seay, "If they don't let you play here, I can get you a shot in the NFL . . . 
but I know they're going to let you play." 
</P>
<P>
 Seay said it was Allen's clout and behind-the-scenes maneuvering that led to 
the resolution of an ugly situation. In the spring of 1990, Seay settled his 
lawsuit with the school out of court and was allowed to rejoin the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "He cut through the red tape," Seay said of Allen. 
</P>
<P>
 Seay agreed to sign a waiver absolving the university from liability should he 
be injured. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the beginning of a short but beautiful friendship. 
</P>
<P>
 They were a curious pair, Seay and Allen. Allen was 50 years older. As an NFL 
coach, Allen had no patience with younger players and was legendary for trading 
upstarts and draft choices for grizzled veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 But Seay was different. 
</P>
<P>
 "He might have thought, 'Well this guy is a little tougher, he's lived through 
a little bit more,' " Seay said, trying to explain why Allen was so fond of 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen once said, "One of the highlights of my coaching career is having a guy 
like Mark Seay on my team." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Allen, the coach's son and Seay's agent, said his father's affection for 
Seay ran deep. 
</P>
<P>
 "With George, the persons who overcame adversity were the people he really 
respected," Bruce said. "George thought of himself that way. With Mark, he had 
never seen somebody who would do anything in his power to be a football 
player." 
</P>
<P>
 Seay won George Allen over early in the season, during a blowout loss to San 
Diego State in which Seay refused to quit. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce rode back to Los Angeles with his father after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dad said he'd never seen anybody like this guy," Bruce Allen said. "He said, 
'We have to win for Mark.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Allen's mother, Etty, cries every time Seay scores a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all watching Dad's last player play," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The feelings are mutual. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was so rare," Seay said of his college coach. "He was a people person, a 
player's coach. He didn't care what anybody said. Nobody could change his mind 
about how he felt about you. And he let you know that. He was the biggest thing 
that ever happened to us. He was going to turn that program around." 
</P>
<P>
 Seay returned for his junior season and earned second-team All-Big West 
honors. The 49er program was reborn under Allen. 
</P>
<P>
 The team posted its first winning season since 1986 with a dramatic victory 
over Nevada Las Vegas in the season finale. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach finished 6-5 and Allen avoided his first losing season as a coach 
since 1954, when he was at Whittier College. 
</P>
<P>
 Seay contributed three catches for 62 yards in the victory over UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, the team doused a jubilant Allen with Gatorade. 
</P>
<P>
 Six weeks later, on New Year's Eve day, while watching a football game, Allen 
died at home. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
 As Seay weighed the obstacles ahead, he vowed never to forget what Allen had 
done. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a solid senior season, and professional-level skills, Seay was not 
drafted. He is convinced teams were scared off by his medical history. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, it had a lot to do with me not getting drafted," Seay said. "It 
definitely has followed me." 
</P>
<P>
 The San Francisco 49ers took a chance and signed Seay as a free agent in 1992. 
He spent the season on the practice squad and learned his craft watching two of 
the game's best -- Jerry Rice and John Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw what it took to be the best to play this game," Seay said. "That's what 
really gave me more motivation to pursue my dream." 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers claimed Seay on waivers in 1993. He was inactive for all but one 
game last year, stuck in another receiving logjam behind Anthony Miller and 
Nate Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 But the skies cleared in the off-season. Miller signed with Denver. Lewis was 
traded.  
</P>
<P>
 Receiver coach Sullivan called Seay in the winter and said 1994 would make or 
break his career. Seay took the news to heart, went to camp and won a starting 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could tell people kept waiting for me to say, 'Oh, he's out of here,' but 
he kept getting better," Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seay understands that careers are week to week in the NFL and is taking 
nothing for granted. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers' medical staff refuses to discuss Seay's possible health risk. In 
both San Francisco and San Diego, Seay has had to sign liability waivers 
similar to the one he signed at Long Beach State. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the reality for the rest of my career," Seay said. 
</P>
<P>
 Keoki Kamau, the Chargers' trainer, said Seay's remaining kidney is 
functioning at a satisfactory level. Seay wears a specially-padded body suit 
and a shoulder pad extension to protect it. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Chargers may not be legally responsible for Seay, Kamau said 
there are human obligations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're always aware of it," he said. "The medical staff is in that mode. The 
responsibility is ours. We know it and Mark knows it." 
</P>
<P>
 Kamau said Seay has withstood a variety of hits to the kidney area. 
</P>
<P>
 "The toughest is when you have your back to the defensive back and he comes up 
from behind and you get hit on the back." 
</P>
<P>
 Seay took such a hit in the opener and emerged unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
 Seay said he was only worried once. While playing in a college game at Jack 
Murphy Stadium, an opposing player slammed into him while he lay on the hard 
infield dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Seay coughed up blood, but the injury turned out not to be kidney related. 
</P>
<P>
 Seay said he thinks of a kidney injury only when reporters broach the subject. 
But the risk is real. Should he loose the use of his remaining kidney, he faces 
life on a dialysis machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Kamau said that working with Seay has been inspirational. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a remarkable guy," he said. "He's taken some pops. He's really a 
tough individual. Extraordinary." 
</P>
<P>
 Kamau calls Seay "a modern-day folk hero." Like others, he wonders what he 
might have done in Seay's situation when the bullets started flying that night 
in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would hope all of us would have done what Mark did," Kamau said. "But we 
never know until we're tested." 
</P>
<P>
 Seay said he reacted instinctively in diving on top of Tashawnda, the way he 
dives instinctively after passes. Seay thinks he was allowed to live for a 
reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just lets you know how quickly your life can change," he said. "'You can 
be walking around one day, and be on your deathbed the next day. It just makes 
you appreciate life even more, you know, don't take it for granted. Take it one 
day at a time and make the best of it. When things seem hard, just try to make 
the best out of the hard days." 
</P>
<P>
 Tashawnda is almost 7 now. After the shooting, Seay's sister moved from Long 
Beach and the family lives in Rialto now. 
</P>
<P>
 Seay said he and his niece do not discuss the events of that night. All she 
knows is that Uncle Mark is a football star. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's beautiful," Seay said of his niece. "She's very fun, very outgoing, 
can't wait to get grown. I tell her to slow down. She reminds everybody of my 
mom. We just about know what my mom was like at her age, all we have to do is 
look at her. We see so much resemblance in her. She's a great kid. She's got a 
bright future ahead of her." 
</P>
<P>
 Seay can't wait for Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be sweet, man," he said. "I'm looking for a sweet outing and a 
sweet victory."  
</P>
<P>
 Maybe, afterward, he'll be able to raise another private toast to an old coach 
and absent friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Long Beach was special to Dad, but Mark absolutely stood out," Bruce Allen 
said. "Mark would have fit into the Over-the-Hill-Gang."

ALTERNATE LEAGUE IS A POSSIBILITY; BASEBALL: ONGOING LABOR DISPUTE HAS MADE THE 
FEASIBILITY EVEN GREATER BECAUSE OF DISENCHANTMENT AMONG THE PLAYERS WITH 
CURRENT OWNERSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly 80 years after the Federal League offered a brief challenge to the 
American and National leagues, baseball's continuing labor dispute has created 
new interest in a rival or alternative major league. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Moss, former general counsel of the players union and a longtime agent 
representing Nolan Ryan, Jack Morris and Andre Dawson, among others, has 
revived plans he brought to near fruition five years ago, only to have them 
collapse on the eve of his official announcement regarding creation of what he 
was calling "the Baseball League." 
</P>
<P>
 Moss says the window of opportunity is larger than it was five years ago, the 
viability even greater because of disenchantment among the players with the 
current ownership and the possibility that existing clubs will ask major league 
prices for a minor league brand of baseball in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "The owners had not declared war on the players as they now have," Moss said 
of his 1989 plans. "In my 25 years in the game, I've never seen it this bad, 
never seen the players this united. 
</P>
<P>
 "If my sampling of the players is representative, 98% are enthusiastic about a 
new league. They are very open to it. They want it very much." 
</P>
<P>
 The players, of course, see it for what it potentially represents: an 
alternative paycheck if the owners implement their salary-cap proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors? 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope to have something more specific to say in three to four weeks, but I 
can tell you there is a substantial group of well established and highly 
motivated people actively exploring the feasibility of having an alternative 
league ready to play by next April," Moss said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm receiving inquiries all the time, and I'm convinced there are a lot of 
capable people who would love to be part of a baseball league that is operated 
correctly and representative of a true partnership with the players. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm optimistic it can be done and done very well, and it would be easy enough 
if we had two or three years. The question is, can it be done quickly enough to 
be playing in April? It's a challenge under the circumstances, but I still 
think it's feasible. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot has to be done in the next few months, of course, and we'll be governed 
by the practicalities as we go along." 
</P>
<P>
 Practicalities? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's silly and unrealistic," owners' negotiator Richard Ravitch said of an 
alternative league. "It's all smoke. I mean, nobody is going to put revenue up 
without control over compensation, and that's just one of (many hurdles). 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's just meant to be leverage (in the labor negotiations), it has no 
leverage whatsoever because it's unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Donald Fehr, the union's executive director, "We'll look at any and all 
options (if the owners implement their proposal, as expected, before Nov. 1), 
but we haven't looked at any yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Moss said that the union isn't involved in planning because it would represent 
a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "The union's No. 1 goal is to negotiate an acceptable (bargaining) agreement," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the union chooses to use the threat of a rival league to achieve that, 
it's quite legitimate. I've had many talks with Don, and he understands what 
we're doing and I understand what he has to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Should the union reach a bargaining agreement, Moss said, it might delay the 
arrival of his league. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I still think a rival league is viable because the old structure cannot 
provide major league baseball as it should be," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that he does not know what role the union would play in the new 
league since players might be offered 50% equity, a 50% share of the profits 
and a 50% role in decision making as inducements. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to be able to pay $5-million and $6-million salaries to start 
with," he said. "In many cases we may not be able to match what they make now 
in salaries. But we can offer the type of partnership their current owners only 
give lip service to, and under those circumstances everyone is working toward 
the same goal." 
</P>
<P>
 With all of that, of course, the union has an inherent interest in any 
proposition that expands the job market and has a competitive impact on 
salaries, making it impossible to separate what Moss is doing from the union's 
objectives. 
</P>
<P>
 A union lawyer, in fact, suggested that it might be possible to use all or 
part of the $200-million licensing pool to help underwrite a new league, and it 
is obvious that the concept has been discussed with players, who are talking 
about it either as a wedge or the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
 During the recent meetings in New York, Brett Butler of the Dodgers said most 
players would rather jump to a new league than operate under a salary cap, and 
teammate Orel Hershiser said, "I don't think it's just an outside possibility. 
The players may even own the league. There may be bankers just to back a 100% 
player ownership. Then there's no argument about cutting up the piece of pie." 
</P>
<P>
 Players have jumped before over issues of salary, freedom and proposed caps, 
but the 1890 Players League, created in competition with the National League, 
lasted only one season, and the Federal League, challenging the National and 
American, quit after its second season, in 1915, although it made one 
significant contribution. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners of the Baltimore team sued the established owners over their 
monopolistic practices, and the Supreme Court ultimately ruled in 1922 that 
baseball was more sport than business and not a commonly accepted form of 
interstate commerce, creating the antitrust exemption that later courts have 
twice upheld. The union claims the exemption has been responsible for 
baseball's eight work stoppages. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), a leader in the Congressional attempt to 
remove the exemption, was quoted in a story appearing in Thursday's editions of 
The Times as saying no investor "in his right mind would put up money to 
compete against an unregulated monopoly which has an antitrust exemption." 
</P>
<P>
 Moss, however, thinks otherwise and sees the exemption as an additional 
inducement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if Congress doesn't change it, if the established owners try to block 
the new league, I'm confident this Supreme Court would uphold a large damage 
claim for violating antitrust laws," Moss said. "In my opinion, the attitude in 
both Congress and the courts is changing." 
</P>
<P>
 The exemption did not stop prospective owners from forming the eight team 
Continental League in the late '50s, which was so close to taking off that 
nervous owners warded off the threat by allowing the Dodgers and Giants to move 
West in 1958, and expanding the American and National leagues in 1961 and '62. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither did the exemption stop Moss from organizing his eight team Baseball 
League in association with New York lawyer David LeFevre in the mid-'80s. After 
a promising planning stage, the league became a victim of circumstances in 1989 
after delaying it's planned 1990 opening to 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were two factors," Moss said. "Collusion ended, and the clubs began to 
sign players to long-term contracts. And the economy went into serious decline. 
A lot of real estate people suffered significant losses, and many of our 
investors were in the real estate business." 
</P>
<P>
 The withdrawal of two in particular, Donald Trump and Meshulam Riklis, a 
friend of Trump, occurred on the eve of a New York meeting at which the new 
owners planned to announce creation of the new league. 
</P>
<P>
 Moss would not say which cities he planned to go into then or which cities he 
hopes to go into now. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that in some cases he will take on existing franchises head to head, 
including New York and Los Angeles, where he sees the San Bernardino area "as 
another Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 Stadiums, of course, represent a serious problem, Moss acknowledged. There are 
exclusivity clauses and priority commitments to current tenants in existing 
cities, and inadequate facilities in many potential new cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Moss said that current leases could be jeopardized if existing 
teams attempted to play with replacement players at a sub-major league level; 
that the building of new stadiums can be stimulated by offering communities 
equity in the teams, and that former Dodger owner Walter O'Malley proved a team 
can survive for the short term in a football facility, when the Dodgers played 
in the Coliseum after moving to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd like to have an ideal stadium in every city to start with, but I don't 
think that's possible," Moss said. "I also think it's a situation that can be 
corrected in a few years. The building of stadiums has become an art. It 
doesn't take nearly the time that it once did." 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves the broader question of who pays for the building, as well as 
several others. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 How does a new league establish minor league affiliations? Can it obtain the 
mandatory exposure and financing of a national TV contract considering ABC, 
NBC, ESPN, TBS and WGN have ties to the existing clubs and that CBS lost about 
$500 million in the four years of its baseball contract? Will enough players 
give up their existing pay level, service time and pension benefits? 
</P>
<P>
 "It may take some litigation, but the bottom line is that I think they would 
all be available," Moss said, referring to more than 700 players. "My view is 
that the reserve system is an internal system, holding them to a club so they 
can't go to another in the system. It has nothing to do with another system." 
</P>
<P>
 Can it fly? 
</P>
<P>
 At various times, Harry Ornest of Beverly Hills has owned the St. Louis Blues 
of the NHL, the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League and the 
Vancouver Canadians of the Pacific Coast League. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't think it's practical or logical, unless you had a ballpark 
available in every major city." Ornest said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Davidson, co-founder and first president of the American Basketball Assn. 
and the World Hockey Assn., and the founder of the World Football League, said, 
"There are legitimate opportunities throughout the country," and that a new 
baseball league can survive if it has: 
</P>
<P>
 Good management; a lot of capital (the WFL lost $20 million in its first 20 
weeks, he said); corporate ownership that can offset the initial costs and 
losses through advertising and merchandising; TV exposure to establish 
legitimacy; international franchises in Mexico City, Havana and other Caribbean 
locales; one or two all-stars per team ("You can't fill every roster with 25 
all-stars or you'll go under in the first year"), and an understanding that it 
may take four or five years to turn around financially. 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson said there is nothing wrong with players sharing in the equity, as 
long as the players are active. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't let that arrangement go on with a player forever, or sooner or 
later the equity becomes so diluted that it has no value," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moss is convinced that between the receptiveness of the players and the 
sub-major league product that existing clubs may field next year, a new league 
would get off to a running start. He said it would be irresponsible not to 
expect losses, but the potential profit would be greater if it's done 
correctly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a wonderful project, something I've always dreamed of," he said.

ROUTINE RACE ENDS TRAGICALLY; SAILING: PERCH COLLAPSES AND ENDS LIFE OF LARRY 
KLEIN, ONE OF AMERICA'S BRIGHTEST HOPES, DURING EVENT IN THE BAY AREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 There was no warning. One moment they were sailing upwind on windy San 
Francisco Bay, exhilarated on their way to their fourth consecutive victory in 
the annual Big Boat Series. Then suddenly seven of them were in the water, 
fighting for their lives. One -- the skipper, Larry Klein -- would die. 
</P>
<P>
 Klein was 42 -- tall, curly haired, intense. He lived in San Diego with his 
wife, Leslie, and their 20-month-old son, Alexander. He and his father, 
Charlie, were partners in J-World, where they taught sailing, drawing on the 
skills that had won Larry world championships in three classes and ranked him 
as the top U.S. prospect for the 1996 Olympic Games in the Soling class. In 
1989 he received U.S. sailing's highest honor, yachtsman of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 His esteem was documented by friends who spoke this week at a 
standing-room-only memorial service in the courtyard of the San Diego Yacht 
Club, his home club. Did Alexander understand? Did anyone? 
</P>
<P>
 The sailors said it had been a privilege to sail with him, which is why six 
others were hanging out over the water with him when their perch collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 The St. Francis Yacht Club's Big Boat Series is one of the West Coast's 
premier events for larger sailboats. A few days before the event last week, 
Klein was still short a couple of crew members, so he telephoned Ron Young of 
San Francisco and invited him to race. Klein didn't have to ask twice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Larry's a great sailor and I liked sailing with him," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 Young brought a friend and neighbor, Chuck Riley, the father of Dawn Riley, 
who skippered the all-woman crew in the recent Whitbread Round-the-World Race, 
her second. 
</P>
<P>
 They would sail Twin Flyer, a modified monohull sloop with a single mast, 
owned by Dyna Yacht, Inc., of San Diego. The company is headed by Alberto 
Calderon, whose innovative ideas for making sailboats go fast have been tried 
in the America's Cup with some promise and limited success. Calderon said Twin 
Flyer has been described accurately as an experimental boat. 
</P>
<P>
 Twin Flyer was tricky to sail but, Young said, in the hands of an expert like 
Klein and "when everything was right, the boat was a rocket ship." 
</P>
<P>
 Calderon said, "The boat had two purposes in going (to San Francisco). One was 
scientific. The other was racing." 
</P>
<P>
 And race it did. Twin Flyer was about the hottest thing on the bay. Klein and 
his crew finished fifth in the first race, twice sliding sideways into mark 
buoys. But once they got the boat under control, they ran off a string of three 
victories and were running away with their next race when the accident 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 About a year and a half ago, Calderon added what others have called "hiking 
racks" but what he calls "deck extensions." They were gull-wing platforms 
extending three feet outboard from the hull where the crew's body weight could 
provide more leverage to restrict the boat's heeling over in strong wind. The 
more upright a sailboat, the faster it will sail upwind. 
</P>
<P>
 The diagonal sections were fiberglass and the crew sat on the flat part where 
canvas was stretched inside a frame of aluminum tubing. Calderon said the 
extensions were meant to support five people, not seven. It was so crowded that 
some were sitting on the laps of others. 
</P>
<P>
 Calderon said he had understood that a crew of six would sail the boat at San 
Francisco, but apparently the extras were added for ballast. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may have been overloaded," Calderon said. "It was designed with a good 
safety margin. We tested the deck extension for five people at two Gs." 
</P>
<P>
 The two Gs were to allow for dynamic stress, such as slamming through the 
four-to-five-foot waves generated by the 18-22-knot winds blowing against a 
strong ebb tide in the bay last Saturday. Calderon said he had cautioned about 
overloading.  
</P>
<P>
 Klein sat farthest aft on the hiking rack, steering with a tiller extension. 
Young, handling the mainsail controls and calling tactics, was next, then 
Riley, one of the two headsail trimmers. The rest of the crew: trimmer Jorge 
Hegoilor, pitman Steve Enzensperger, grinder David (Huck) Tomason, bowman Jim 
(Jim Bob) Barton and Bill Burns, a research engineer who worked for Calderon. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns was the only one inside the boat, near the stern when the accident 
occurred. He also was the only one who didn't know how to sail.  
</P>
<P>
 Four days earlier, on the way out to the racecourse from Sausalito, the Coast 
Guard had stopped the boat to check for life jackets. Riley had brought some 
from his own boat, so they had nine -- one more than required. 
</P>
<P>
 The life jackets were securely stowed away. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley said, "When we were on starboard tack we heard two or three loud 
cracking noises to leeward. It sounded like fiberglass cracking. You could 
actually feel them in the boat. We asked Bill to kind of check around. We 
thought it might be a (genoa) winch, a halyard winch or delamination of the 
hull . . . something going on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mentioned the rack, but somebody said, 'There's no load on it,' because 
there was nobody on it. After we tacked to port and went on that rack, I leaned 
way out and looked under the rack just to look at the hull for any sign of a 
crack. I didn't suspect the rack that much. Just a few minutes after that, the 
rack collapsed." 
</P>
<P>
 Calderon, who had left the boat after sailing in the first race that day, said 
later that the aluminum tubing had failed at weld points. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley said, "The very first thing I remember, almost before hitting the water, 
was it seemed comical. I mean, here's seven guys sitting out on this rack, like 
when you go to a fair and you have those guys sitting over a tank of water and 
you throw a ball and they get dunked. That's what it was like, except not 
having one but seven people in a row just simultaneously dumped into the bay. 
It seemed almost funny, for an instant." 
</P>
<P>
 Less than a minute earlier, Young had noted the stiff wave action and 
commented, with dark humor, "Pray for the rack." 
</P>
<P>
 Klein had retorted, "Pray for the mast." 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, they were praying for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Young said, "The very first knowledge I had of anything wrong was I was going 
backward underwater, and bubbles and light were disappearing in front of my 
face." 
</P>
<P>
 When they all popped to the surface they counted heads, then Young said, 
"Let's catch the boat . . . we can get it and win this race." 
</P>
<P>
 Riley said later, "My thoughts were, 'Well, let's catch the boat.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Young was nearest the boat so he started to swim after it, yelling 
instructions to Burns. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley said, "I don't think there was any panic or any monumental concern. I 
started swimming toward the boat but found with all my gear on it was a big 
effort. There was a fairly steep chop, which made it difficult to swim . . . 
even difficult just to float." 
</P>
<P>
 All wore heavy foul-weather gear to stay dry from spray. Riley noticed that 
some of the others -- particularly Klein and Hegoilor -- were having trouble.  
</P>
<P>
 Young, 51, and Riley, 52, were the two oldest members of the crew but they 
also were the only two wearing tennis shoes instead of rubber sea boots, and 
were the only two able to swim effectively. Actually, Young had lost one shoe 
when he hit the water.  
</P>
<P>
 Riley kept telling the others to try to relax and float on their backs. After 
about five minutes he asked Klein, "Are you OK?" 
</P>
<P>
 Klein responded weakly, "I don't think I can make it." 
</P>
<P>
 Riley grabbed the collar of Klein's foul-weather jacket to hold him up, then 
put him in a life-saving arm hold on his hip, his left hand reaching around to 
support Klein's chin. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Hegoilor said, "I'm going to need help." 
</P>
<P>
 Riley told him, "Jorge, you can make it." 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I don't think I can." 
</P>
<P>
 So Riley swam to Hegoilor, dragging Klein, and was holding up one man with 
each arm when a sailboat that wasn't in the race came along. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were right there, less than 20 feet from me," Riley said. "I just 
assumed they were stopping and would pick us up. I could see all their faces 
and everything. They were all standing on the rail looking, and I think they 
just had no clue as to what to do. They sailed right through us and continued 
on." 
</P>
<P>
 Young, swimming after the Twin Flyer, yelled back in vain, 'Throw life jackets 
. . . throw anything.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he said, the boat sailed off a ways and wasted time methodically 
trying to get its sails down. He said he also saw a second boat nearby. 
Neither, he said, seemed to know how to execute a basic man-overboard recovery 
procedure.  
</P>
<P>
 "They could have saved everybody right then and there," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Riley, "At that point I think is when everybody really started to get 
panicky, because we couldn't see any other boats." 
</P>
<P>
 "Tomason, separated from the others, had been picked up by another boat but 
Young was still swimming after Twin Flyer. Once, he got close enough for Burns 
to throw him a line but missed it by 18 inches before the moving boat pulled it 
away.  
</P>
<P>
 About that time, X-Dream, trailing by seven or eight minutes in the race, 
noticed that Twin Flyer had stopped and altered course to check. X-Dream, 
skippered by Steen Moller of San Anselmo, arrived a few minutes later and 
started pulling people out of the water. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were phenomenal," Riley said. "They had the genny (genoa headsail) down 
by the time they passed through us and stopped the boat, and we all swam over 
to them. I swam 15 or 20 feet, pulling Larry and Jorge with me, using a leg 
kick, just getting there any way I could move." 
</P>
<P>
 Hegoilor, Riley said, "was about drowned -- almost lifeless -- at that point. 
And Larry was totally lifeless. I could just feel him slowly losing all fight. 
He just kind of passed out. A couple of waves went way over our heads. I held 
my breath and came up. With him, it was just his lifeless body." 
</P>
<P>
 Klein, 6 feet 5 and 203 pounds, was difficult to lift aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put one arm up on the rail and was pushing up on Larry's body with my other 
hand to try and get him somewhat out of the water," Riley said. "It took five 
or six crew to drag him up on deck through the lifelines. They started CPR 
right away. When I saw everybody was out of the water I swam around to the 
stern and climbed up the transom ladder." 
</P>
<P>
 By that time, Burns had gotten Twin Flyer under enough control that Young was 
able to get aboard and start sweeping the area for survivors. He saw the tennis 
shoe he had lost still floating and used it as a reference point. On X-Dream, 
Riley saw that Klein was getting maximum attention on deck and went below to 
check on the three others, who were heaving up saltwater. 
</P>
<P>
 "They looked terrible . . . absolutely horrible," he said. "I yelled at them 
to keep them awake and from going unconscious." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Riley went back on deck to help the X-Dream crew drop its main sail and 
account for everybody. Young sailed Twin Flyer back over the area several 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley yelled to Moller, "Let's go!" They motored flat-out toward the St. 
Francis Yacht Club. 
</P>
<P>
 A Coast Guard launch intercepted them and a crew member took over CPR on 
Klein, but it was too late. He was pronounced dead at the California Pacific 
Medical Center at 5:56 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Young figures he swam about a quarter-mile chasing Twin Flyer. He and Riley 
estimated they were all in the water about 15 minutes -- an eternity under the 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 A coroner's report on Klein said there was no evidence of trauma or drowning, 
which seemed surprising. Witnesses described foam around Klein's mouth. Cardiac 
arrest was suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think hypothermia was a factor (in Klein's death)," Riley said. 
"(The water) felt cold, but it didn't feel numbing to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Lou Marselli, a member of the Dolphin Swim and Boat Club in San Francisco, 
said, "The water's 60 degrees (now). We have people here swimming in it for 
over an hour. Fifteen minutes doesn't seem like a very long time." 
</P>
<P>
 But if a person is wearing rubber boots and isn't otherwise dressed for 
swimming, and other boats in the area fail to help, 15 minutes can be fatal.

TRIO GETTING SHOT TO BE KING MAKERS; HOCKEY: CLUB EXPECTS ONCE-EMBATTLED QUINN 
ALONG WITH CROWDER AND BROWN TO TURN FRUSTRATION TO WINNING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dan Quinn almost can anticipate the questions now, perhaps sensing a momentary 
hesitancy on the part of the interviewer. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe that's why Quinn doesn't wince or look away when the word Minnesota is 
mentioned. Minnesota might not have a hockey team anymore, but that's where the 
former 40-goal scorer's NHL career almost ended nearly two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Quinn signed as a free agent with the Kings shortly before training camp 
opened earlier this month, but his playing days seemed over in November of 
1992, when he was arrested for allegedly raping a Minnesota woman while he was 
with the North Stars. 
</P>
<P>
 Police in the Minneapolis suburb of Bloomington even took the somewhat unusual 
step of holding a news conference to announce that Quinn had been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 He was never charged with a crime but was released by his team for violating 
curfew the night of the alleged incident.  
</P>
<P>
 Almost two years later, Quinn shakes his head at the memory of the "media 
circus." He is candid about the incident and what has happened to him on and 
off the ice since then. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, it was devastating how one hour of your life can turn into something I 
consider to be wrong," he said. "(The police) held a press conference before 
they even talked to me about it. That's what disappointed me. The people they 
believed had police records. I had never been in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of (the women) had a record of lying to the police. You think they would 
inspect that before they buried me. Unfortunately, even though I was never 
charged, my name was never protected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying I didn't do anything wrong," he said. "I should have never 
been there in the first place. Obviously I broke curfew. But to have what 
happened to me was wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 His options were few afterward. The doors to the NHL were closed and there 
wasn't much money to be made in the minor leagues. He moved to Switzerland last 
season and scored 34 points in 25 games with Bern in the Swiss Elite League, 
then joined the Ottawa Senators for their final 13 games and scored seven 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were times I thought it was over," he said. "Then Europe presented 
itself and gave me a chance. And I just realized, if I was ever going to quit, 
that was the time." 
</P>
<P>
 His decision to seek a longer NHL commitment coincided with the Kings' desire 
to shake some complacency out of their veterans. A season after missing the 
playoffs, they are searching for a mood change, trying to replace fat and sassy 
with lean and desperate. 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, General Manager Sam McMaster and Coach Barry Melrose imported a 
trio fitting the desired description -- tough-guy forward Troy Crowder and 
goal-scoring forwards Rob Brown and Quinn. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want desperate people," Melrose said. "We need more of that around here. 
It might rub off on some of the other players." 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the three has at some point seemed finished in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowder, plagued by back problems, hadn't played a full season in the league 
since 1990-91. Brown, a former 49-goal scorer, spent parts of the last two 
seasons in the International Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
 Quinn, so far, has made the biggest impact, having scored three goals and two 
assists in five exhibition games. The 29-year-old is the kind of natural born 
goal-scorer the Kings crave after the Luc Robitaille trade. Those 40 goals have 
to come from somewhere, right? 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been very impressed with him," Melrose said. "He's played well and can 
go to the net with purpose. I'm a big believer in you getting what you deserve. 
But not everything has been his fault." 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, Quinn had agreed to an unusual contract that gave the North Stars 
the option of ending it at three points during the season. McMaster said that 
is not the case with the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dan Quinn, if he's not in his own mind helping the L.A. Kings, he will 
retire," McMaster said. "I've had many people tell me he was Ottawa's best 
player at the end of the season."  
</P>
<P>
 McMaster recognizes that he took chances on all three players. Crowder has not 
played in any exhibition games because of a neck injury. And Brown and Quinn 
have long been saddled with the "floater" tag. 
</P>
<P>
 "If float is the word, they'll both be floating back where they came from," 
McMaster said. "These are not favors. 
</P>
<P>
 Melrose helped check into the backgrounds of each player. He called Ottawa 
Coach Rick Bowness about Quinn and also spoke to Rick Tocchet, who had played 
with him in Philadelphia. Former goaltender and fellow ESPN analyst Darren Pang 
offered an endorsement, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Quinn never realized how much playing in the NHL meant to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I missed everything about it," he said. "I missed practicing. You miss the 
nice things, but you even miss the things you used to complain about when you 
were playing. Sometimes, there were tough days, tough travel. But when I was 
away from it, I'd give anything to be back." 
</P>
<P>
 He remains philosophical about Los Angeles being a last-chance stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think of it that way," he said. "If I can't play anymore, I can't 
play anymore. All I ask is for a fair shake. Obviously, I'd like to get a 
certain level, a certain point on the team. I don't think it's my last chance. 
Anybody's career could be over at any time."

U.S. TEAM SHOPPING FOR DAVIS CUP VICTORY; TENNIS: SEMIFINAL AGAINST SWEDEN 
STARTS TODAY. SAMPRAS WILL PLAY MAGNUS LARSSON, MARTIN WILL FACE EDBERG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With echoes of 1992 resounding from the Gap to Ikea, the Davis Cup draw -- all 
35 scintillating seconds of it -- was held Thursday at a sprawling shopping 
mall here to determine the order of play as the United States and Sweden begin 
semifinal matches today. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, the same teams met at the Target Center in Minneapolis -- the 
draw itself was held near the escalators -- with equally hollow fanfare. But 
identical opponents in an identical setting may bode well for the U.S. team, 
which well remembers its 4-1 victory over Sweden in the semifinal and eventual 
defeat of Switzerland for the 1992 Davis Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 The American players will make every effort to refer to its winning season in 
1992, if only to obscure the memory of last year's first-round loss. The Davis 
Cup draw is the ideal memory wagon, since it carries no meaningful freight of 
its own. 
</P>
<P>
 As was the case with the American version two years before, Thursday's draw 
ceremony was a triumph over both style and substance. After a warm-up period by 
a Swedish stand-up -- a rapid-fire monologue followed by tight smiles and 
polite applause -- the draw was conducted. The representative of an event 
sponsor was called forward to draw a name from a champagne bucket, to determine 
the order of play. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's two matches, in order, are Todd Martin against Stefan Edberg and Pete 
Sampras against Magnus Larsson. Saturday the U.S. doubles team of Jared Palmer 
and Jonathan Stark will play Jonas Bjorkman and Jan Apell. Sunday's matches are 
Sampras-Edberg and Martin-Larsson. 
</P>
<P>
 All matches are best-of-five sets and the team that wins three matches will go 
to the Davis Cup final. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. team will be tested by a dangerous but vulnerable Swedish team. U.S. 
Captain Tom Gullikson has nominated four players whose styles and temperaments 
are suited to the fast, high-bounce indoor carpet selected by the Swedes. Being 
the host carries with it the advantage of minimal travel, home crowds and the 
opportunity to choose the playing surface. 
</P>
<P>
 A captain can choose a surface that is awful for the opposing team, even if it 
may not be ideal for his own team. The United States did that when these teams 
played in the 1992 semifinal at Minneapolis. The Americans chose clay to negate 
the speed and aggressive net play of Edberg. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Swedish captain John-Anders Sjogren has opted to play to the 
strengths of his No. 1 player, serve-and-volley star Edberg. 
</P>
<P>
 It also happens to be perfect for Sampras, who confessed Thursday that as late 
as a week ago he had decided not to play here after losing in the round of 16 
at the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got done playing the Open, I went home and didn't pick up a racket for 
some time," Sampras said. "I called Tom and told him I was not available. 
Mentally, I was very discouraged and frustrated. Physically, my body went 
through a war playing (Jaime) Yzaga. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like I told Tom, I just didn't have it deep down to start practicing and 
playing again. I thought about it the next couple of days and talked to some 
people. Davis Cup gets you motivated. I thought about it for a couple of days 
and I really got the urge to play and try to finish the year off as strong as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I called (Gullikson) a few days later, maybe Friday night," Sampras 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "More like Saturday morning," Gullikson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It might have been late, I don't know," Sampras said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember looking at the digital clock and it was 2:40," Gullikson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I had been thinking about it," Sampras said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had been dreaming about it," Gullikson said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 It is every Davis Cup captain's dream to have the No. 1 player in the world 
available, even if he's not in his best shape. Sampras admitted as much at the 
Open and was quick to tell reporters that it was his fitness, not a sore left 
ankle, that had betrayed him against Yzaga. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been working hard for a couple of weeks and my form is a lot better," 
Sampras said. "I'm not going to get into a lot of long rallies here. I'm not in 
great shape. I've kind of lost my base." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Sampras gives the impression of a player willing to fight as long as he 
must to win. Davis Cup will do that to players. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a different type of pressure than playing in other matches," he said. 
"At the majors, you are just playing for yourself. Here, you are playing for 
your country. You really don't want to let anyone down. It's different. Playing 
in my first tie at Lyon (France), I didn't play well and I wasn't prepared for 
the situation. I think I'll be OK this weekend." 
</P>
<P>
 If the U.S. team follows its form of 1992, he'll be right.

FLYERS REACQUIRE GOALIE HEXTALL FROM ISLANDERS FOR SODERSTROM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ron Hextall, ineffective in goal when the New York Islanders were humiliated 
by the rival New York Rangers in last season's playoffs, was traded to the 
Philadelphia Flyers on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hextall was packaged with a sixth-round draft choice in 1995 for 25-year-old 
goalie Tommy Soderstrom. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anybody can work harder than Ron Hextall," said Islander 
General Manager Don Maloney in announcing the trade. "He had a slow start and a 
disastrous finish here, and New York's a tough town." 
</P>
<P>
 Hextall, 30, allowed 16 goals in three games against the eventual Stanley Cup 
champion Rangers, who swept the Islanders in four games of the first-round 
series. 
</P>
<P>
 Hextall had a career-high five shutouts, a 3.08 goals-against average and a 
27-26-6 record in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 As a rookie in 1986-87, he led the Flyers to the seventh game of the Stanley 
Cup finals against the Edmonton Oilers. The Oilers won, 3-1, but Hextall was 
chosen MVP of the playoffs and the league's top goaltender. After six seasons 
with the Flyers, he played with the Quebec Nordiques in 1992-93. 
</P>
<P>
 Soderstrom played in 34 games last season for the Flyers, with a 6-18-4 record 
and a 4.01 goals-against average.

PHALEN IMPROVES POUND FOR POUNDS; FOOTBALL: SOME SAID HEFTY USC OFFENSIVE 
LINEMAN HAD A FAT CHANCE AT MAKING IT, BUT DIET AND TRAINING CHANGED THAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This was the summer of '93, at one of John Robinson's first practices after 
returning as USC's football coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson was chatting with a couple of reporters when one of his first 
recruits, Phalen Pounds, walked by, temporarily blocking the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Pounds was 6 feet 7 and 355 pounds at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's Phalen Pounds from Pasadena," Robinson said. "We think somewhere in 
that massive body there's another Lincoln Kennedy, but it might take us a 
couple of years to find it." 
</P>
<P>
 Last season was a long one for the aptly named Pounds. In his redshirt 
freshman season, he was the butt of a lot of fat jokes.  
</P>
<P>
 "If he can't play, we can always use him for shade," quipped offensive line 
coach Mike Barry one day. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirteen months later, there are no more Phalen fat jokes.  
</P>
<P>
 There are no Phalen jokes of any kind. 
</P>
<P>
 Phalen did not fail. 
</P>
<P>
 Phalen is no joke. 
</P>
<P>
 After a winter of weaning himself from fast food, and doing some intensive 
weight training, the body of a year ago has been transformed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm down to about 315 now and I'm much stronger than I was a year ago," 
Pounds said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a combination of staying away from the refrigerator, eating a healthier 
diet, working out more and weight training." 
</P>
<P>
 Pounds was an offensive tackle last year. He was moved to guard last spring. 
He developed quickly in spring practice and training camp, and started USC's 
first two games.  
</P>
<P>
 "I have a feeling that if everything goes right for him, he'll be a star," 
Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's going to get much stronger, and he understands what he has to do to be a 
great player. Already, I can see he's flexible, that he adjusts to things 
quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 Barry, Pounds' position coach, is a blunt, tough-talking, tobacco-chewing type 
who demands much from a talented group that includes All-American senior Tony 
Boselli (6-8, 320), Kris Pollack (6-5, 290), Jeremy Hogue (6-4, 270), Norberto 
Garrido (6-7, 305) and Pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "A year ago we didn't know if Phalen could get that excess weight off, and he 
really had to do that," Barry said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Well, he got it off and he's done a great job. He can pull much better than 
he could a year ago. His stamina is better. He's risen to a level where he's 
assuming the responsibility a starter must take on.  
</P>
<P>
 "He improves at something in practice every day. In the Penn State game, he 
did some really good things." 
</P>
<P>
 Barry, who leads the coaching staff in both tirade frequency and volume, is 
Pounds' biggest fan . . . and his toughest critic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Man, coach Barry is always on my back about something," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day, it's something else. He's worse in the offensive line meetings 
than he is at practice. He's got a red face anyway, but he gets so mad 
sometimes his face gets really red.  
</P>
<P>
 "He's a good coach, though." 
</P>
<P>
 Pounds, who was also recruited by Washington, decided on USC after Robinson 
became coach in January of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was leaning toward Washington, but coach (Mike) Sanford (USC wide receiver 
coach) started recruiting me real hard," Pounds said. "And when Robinson came 
in, I saw a chance to start fresh with a new program." 
</P>
<P>
 Like a lot of football players who also play basketball in high school, Pounds 
is a late arrival to serious weight training.  
</P>
<P>
 "I never lifted much in high school because after football I went right into 
basketball," he said. "Guys my age here who played only football came in 
stronger than me because they lifted all winter. But I'll catch up. I came here 
with a bench press of 335 pounds and now I'm up to 390." 
</P>
<P>
 Basketball?  
</P>
<P>
 "He was a pretty good player," recalled Jack Loos, one of Pounds' football 
coaches at Pasadena High. 
</P>
<P>
 "He played at about 335 pounds. He wasn't so good at getting up and down the 
floor but he was a very physical player and he could score. 
</P>
<P>
 "In football, we all felt Phalen was a great natural talent but that he'd 
never achieve his potential if he didn't get his weight down."  
</P>
<P>
 So far, Pounds says major college football is toughest at USC's Howard Jones 
field, where the Trojans practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "The toughest guy I've played against so far is Matt Keneley, who lines up 
against me most of the time in practice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Keneley is a USC defensive line starter.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Washington and Penn State guys were big, but they weren't as good as 
Keneley," Pounds said. "And that's good, because he's making me a better 
player. Hopefully, maybe I'll make him better too." 
</P>
<P>
 The switch from tackle to guard was good news, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew last year if they kept me at tackle, I'd be playing behind Norberto 
(Garrido, the starting offensive right tackle), and I just wanted to play -- 
anyplace," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And instead of having to look inside Pounds for another Lincoln Kennedy, 
Robinson instead found the real Phalen Pounds.

HAWKING NAMED INTERIM COACH AT CS FULLERTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bob Hawking, Don MacLean's coach at Simi Valley High, was named Cal State 
Fullerton's interim basketball coach Thursday, fulfilling what he called a 
lifelong dream to run a Division I program. 
</P>
<P>
 John Easterbrook, in his third day as Fullerton athletic director, said he 
thought it was important to move quickly to replace former coach Brad Holland, 
who left Monday for the University of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Easterbrook said the job would be posted near the end of the season, and 
Hawking vowed to to try to win it. 
</P>
<P>
 Preseason practice begins Oct. 15, and the Titans play their first 
regular-season game Nov. 29 at home against Cal State Northridge, Hawking's 
alma mater. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking, 44, was Holland's top assistant for two years, and an assistant at 
Pepperdine and UC Davis before that. Hawking coached at Simi Valley for 14 
years, where he had a successful reign with MacLean, a former UCLA star who 
plays for the Washington Bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bob certainly has the background and training to be our basketball coach for 
this year," Easterbrook said. 
</P>
<P>
 Holland, who recommended Hawking for the job, said: "I'm pleased the 
university made this decision. His title was assistant, but he's always been a 
head coach."

 Hawking said the transition would be smooth and had no plans to change the 
team's style. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played for Denny Crum for two years at Pierce College, and we were doing 
the same things in Woodland Hills that John Wooden was doing over at Pauley 
Pavilion," he said. "Brad (a former Bruin star) and I do have some of the same 
basketball background." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking said George Fuller, who recently was hired by Holland, will be his top 
assistant.

LOS ALAMITOS PLAYER INJURES COACH; GRIFFINS WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 A Los Alamitos assistant football coach was taken by ambulance to a hospital 
Thursday night after being intentionally head-butted by one of his players 
during the Griffins' 23-16 victory over Carson in front of approximately 4,500 
at Long Beach Veterans Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Scully, the Griffins' first-year defensive backs coach, was struck in 
the face by starting junior cornerback Wayne Campbell late in the first 
quarter, Los Alamitos offensive line coach Gene Vollnogle said. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Campbell) hit him," Vollnogle said. "I don't really know" (what caused it). 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell was not allowed to return to the game and left the stadium.  
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said Scully criticized Campbell for a mistake he made in coverage 
and Campbell assaulted him. Scully lost several teeth and was bleeding 
extensively, several Los Alamitos parents said. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, senior running back Phil Cruz, who rushed for more than 100 yards 
in the first two games for No. 1 Los Alamitos (3-0), is feared to have suffered 
torn ligaments in one of his knees, Coach John Barnes said. Cruz managed only 
four yards in three carries and did not play after the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was also rough for sophomore quarterback Sean Stein. He completed 
only 11 of 28 passes for 214 yards with one interception, but did come through 
with two touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
 His second touchdown covered 16 yards and went to standout senior receiver 
Brad Melsby with 9 minutes 40 seconds to play in the game. That play and kicker 
Ben Hughes' point-after sealed the victory, running Los Alamitos' unbeaten 
streak to 38 games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Griffins struggled throughout the first half but managed to lead, 17-16, 
at halftime against the Colts (0-3).

<P>
 Angel Manager Marcel Lachemann hired his older brother, Bill Lachemann, and 
former Angel infielder Rick Burleson to be on his coaching staff next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Lachemann, who has been in the Angel organization for 10 years, will 
become the bullpen coach.Burleson, who played six years for the Angels, will 
coach at third base. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall of Famer Rod Carew was retained as hitting coach, as were bench coach 
Bobby Knoop, pitching coach Chuck Hernandez and Joe Maddon, who will move from 
the bullpen to first base.

<P>
 Third base coach Ken Macha and first base coach Max Oliveras were fired as

not kept Macha on in some capacity, he would have been ineligible to manage the 
Tempe Rafters in the Arizona Fall League, which includes 12 players from the 
Angels and Dodgers.

FEHR RECOMMENDS END OF STRIKE IF ANTITRUST EXEMPTION IS REPEALED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Appearing before a Congressional hearing in Washington, Donald Fehr, executive 
director of the players union, pledged again Thursday that he would recommend 
that baseball players end their strike if Congress repeals or limits the 
owners' exemption from federal antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, the union would be able to challenge the owners' unilateral 
implementation of a salary-cap system through the courts as a violation of the 
antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Jack Brooks (D-Tex.) concluded the hearing of the economic and commercial 
law subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee, of which he is chairman, by 
saying he would support repeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a result of the sorry spectacle the nation was forced to endure for the 
last few months, and my very grave concerns for the future of the institution, 
I have come to the conclusion that legislation is now needed to restore the 
principles of competition and fair play to the business of baseball," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Fehr, who was accompanied by Dodger pitcher Orel Hershiser, who addressed the 
committee on behalf of his striking colleagues, called the proclamation by 
Brooks a victory for the players. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee indicates action should 
take place, that is of no small significance," Fehr said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether it would have any impact upon negotiations with the owners, Fehr 
said, "To the extent the owners believe their antitrust exemption is in danger, 
perhaps." 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate action, the union filed grievances and default notices on behalf 
of 18 players who were recalled from the minors either shortly before the 
strike began on Aug. 12 or during it, resulting in termination of pay. The 
respective clubs have 10 days to cure the defaults by paying the players or 
risk having arbitrator George Nicolau declare them free agents. ROSS NEWHAN

RUPTURED WATER LINE FORCES GAME RELOCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE TERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A water line ruptured Thursday under the Huntington Beach High School football 
field, leaving the field unplayable, and forcing the relocation of tonight's 
game between Ocean View and Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Maintenance manager John Klungreseter said a "bubble of water" formed under 
the dirt, eventually creating a large, mushy hole at the 50-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's rare for the plastic pipes to give way like that; it's the first time in 
at least two years," Klungreseter said. The Ocean View-Century game has been 
relocated to Westminster High; kickoff is 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal John Staunton said there did not appear to be any vandalism 
involved. MIKE TERRY

PARK REALIZES GOAL OF PLAYING IN THE FORUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Center Richard Park, who was born in South Korea and grew up in Rancho Palos 
Verdes, once dreamed of playing for the Kings at the Forum. He wasn't drafted 
by them, but at least part of his dream will be realized tonight.Park, 18, is 
in Pittsburgh's lineup for an exhibition game at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 The Penguins selected him in the second round of the NHL's entry draft in 
June, and Park has surprised many observers by remaining with the team. He had 
76 points in 59 games last season with his junior team, the Belleville Bulls of 
the Ontario Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm definitely excited," Park said on Thursday from Vancouver, where the 
Penguins played the Canucks. "Five years ago I probably wouldn't have believed 
it."  
</P>
<P>
 He has one assist in two exhibition games -- against the Detroit Red Wings and 
New York Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been playing with Larry DePalma, but at times I've been out there with 
people like Tomas Sandstrom and Kevin Stevens," Park said. "When you're out 
there with them, your game picks up a notch. You've got to make sure you don't 
stop and watch." LISA DILLMAN

AGENTS: JACKSON, DAVIS WILL CONSIDER PLAYING IN JAPAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angel sluggers Bo Jackson and Chili Davis, each of whom could become free 
agents, will explore the possibility of playing in Japan next season, according 
to their agents. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a weird way, it may be advantageous to be a free agent this year," said 
Arn Tellem, Jackson's agent. "If you don't have a contract with one club, it 
gives you the opportunity to go overseas to make a living. We'll consider all 
options. 
</P>
<P>
 "In fact, I just hired an attorney who speaks Japanese in anticipation of that 
possibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Tellem also represents Rex Hudler of the Angels and Matt Nokes of the Yankees, 
who also are eligible for free agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, who earned $1 million last season with the Angels, is expected to 
file for free agency as soon as baseball stipulates a filing period. He would 
be an unrestricted free agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis is eligible for free agency under the old collective bargaining 
agreement only if the Angels do not offer salary arbitration. His negotiations 
with the Angels have stalled since the strike. He is seeking a three-year 
contract for about $4 million a year, while the Angels are countering with a 
two-year contract and an option. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly, Japan is a viable option," said Adam Katz, who along with Tom 
Reich represents Davis. "Everything is in such a state of disorganization here, 
it would be nice to be playing baseball somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 In other news, Angel Manager Marcel Lachemann hired his older brother, Bill 
Lachemann, 60, and former Angel infielder Rick Burleson, 43, to be on his 
coaching staff next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Lachemann, who has been in the organization for 10 years, will become the 
bullpen coach. Burleson, who played six years for the Angels and was their 
minor league base-running instructor last season, will coach third. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall of Famer Rod Carew was retained as hitting coach, along with bench coach 
Bobby Knoop, pitching coach Chuck Hernandez and bullpen coach Joe Maddon, who 
will move to first base. 
</P>
<P>
 Third base coach Ken Macha and first base coach Max Oliveras were fired, but 
were offered positions within the organization as minor league roving coaches. 
If the Angels had not provided Macha a job, he would have been ineligible to 
manage the Tempe Rafters in the Arizona Fall League, which includes 12 players 
from the Angels and Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 "That showed a lot of class on their part," Macha said. "At least I'll still 
get to manage in Arizona, and hopefully that will allow me to land on my feet."

MARYLAND GOVERNOR NOT OPTIMISTIC; PRO FOOTBALL: SCHAEFER SAYS WEEKEND MEETING 
WITH RAM OFFICIALS DID NOT ENCOURAGE HIM ABOUT TEAM'S POSSIBLE MOVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON MORGAN, THE BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maryland Gov. William Donald Schaefer said a recent meeting with Ram officials 
left him less optimistic that the team will move to Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't leave with any more encouragement than when I left here. I'm not as 
optimistic as when I left," Schaefer said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Schaefer, during remarks to reporters and in his weekly radio show, also said 
he's not giving up the effort. These were his first public comments since 
returning from a West Coast trip, which included a visit with Ram officials 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Oriole owner Peter Angelos, who is trying to buy a minority stake in the Rams 
and move them here, arranged and attended the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos said he did not come away from the meeting any less optimistic, but 
acknowledged the Rams have concerns about a Baltimore move. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there were certain concerns raised regarding litigation, but these 
are concerns raised whenever a franchise movement is contemplated. I think the 
economics we are offering will overcome those concerns," Angelos said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Angelos met with Raider owner Al Davis, who thwarted the league 
when he moved the team from Oakland over the objections of the other owners. 
Angelos said he was seeking the support and advice of Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, former Philadelphia Eagle owner Norman Braman, who sold his team 
this year, is a friend of Ram executive vice president John Shaw and called him 
in advance of the governor's meeting to encourage him to consider moving to 
Baltimore, Schaefer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a whole lot of obstacles," Schaefer said. Among the problems he 
cited: opposition to Baltimore from NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue and 
Washington Redskin owner Jack Kent Cooke. 
</P>
<P>
 Schaefer said Ram attorneys at Sunday's meeting cited a number of 
contingencies that could arise with a move to Baltimore -- some of which 
wouldn't be a factor in a move to St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 "St. Louis is our main rival, and Tagliabue supports them over us," Schaefer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 NFL spokesman Greg Aiello denied the commissioner has worked against 
Baltimore. "He doesn't have a preference," Aiello said.

DUAL BRANDS: DOUBLING UP ON FAST FOOD; RESTAURANTS: ARBY'S PURCHASE OF LONG 
JOHN SILVER'S IS THE LATEST EXAMPLE. SOME EXPERTS ARE WARY OF THE CONCEPT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The pending merger of the Arby's and Long John Silver's restaurant chains is 
the most visible example yet of a trend in the industry: serving two brands of 
food under a single roof. 
</P>
<P>
 Triarc Cos., corporate parent of Arby's, said Wednesday it has agreed to buy 
Long John Silver's Restaurants Inc. for $525 million in cash, a deal that would 
create the nation's sixth-largest fast-food chain, with $2.5 billion in annual 
revenue and 4,250 locations. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than operate the chains independently, New York-based Triarc will 
convert at least 600 locations to serve both Arby's roast beef sandwiches and 
Long John Silver's seafood dishes. "It's an absolute natural," said Triarc 
spokesman Martin Shea. 
</P>
<P>
 Triarc isn't the only restaurateur trying the dual-brand concept. Several 
other smaller chains, seeking some economy of scale to better compete against 
such international giants as McDonald's and Taco Bell, are pairing their 
products. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus El Pollo Loco is testing sales of Foster's Freeze desserts; Denny's is 
dishing up Baskin-Robbins ice cream; hot dog king Wienerschnitzel recently 
added Winchell's doughnuts to its menu, and, starting next month, some Carl's 
Jr. hamburger outlets will also serve Green Burrito Mexican-style food. 
</P>
<P>
 Doubling up "gives us an opportunity to increase the number of locations as 
well as company revenue without the extreme expenditure of adding new 
facilities," said Cliff Hiatt, president of Foster's Old-Fashioned Freeze. 
Foster's, based in Arroyo Grande, began testing soft ice cream stands during 
the summer inside a handful of El Pollo Loco restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Dual-brand proponents point to the popularity of shopping mall food courts as 
proof that consumers want a number of choices when they eat out. 
</P>
<P>
 For Triarc, combining Louisville, Ky.-based Long John Silver's with Arby's is 
not the first foray into dual brands. The company reports 50% sales increases 
resulting from earlier ventures -- two Arby's restaurants in Long Beach that 
also serve Green Burrito items, four Minneapolis restaurants that feature pasta 
from Sbarro's, and an Arby's-Long John Silver's combination in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Some restaurant industry observers, however, question whether doubling up can 
give smaller chains an actual advantage in the fierce competition with the 
fast-food giants. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Perry, chief operating officer of Irvine-based El Pollo Loco, said such 
combos are destined to fail unless customers see an obvious added attraction. 
Also, Perry cautioned, chains can tarnish hard-earned reputations if they link 
up with weak partners. 
</P>
<P>
 Other observers say that dual-brand restaurants may simply confuse the 
customer by offering too many choices. Nation's Restaurant News, a trade 
magazine based in New York, pleaded in a recent editorial: "Can't we pick 
somewhere to eat where we don't have to choose yet again after we get there?" 
</P>
<P>
 But matches continue to be made, driven by the hope of boosting revenue at a 
relatively low cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Denny's, for example, is betting that Baskin-Robbins shops, which will open 
inside its San Diego locations starting in November, will draw traffic in the 
afternoon and late at night, when the meal business slows. And 
Wienerschnitzel's test-marketing of Winchell's doughnuts is a bid to boost its 
breakfast business. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry of El Pollo Loco said that customers are, indeed, popping in for ice 
cream treats in the afternoon and late evening, which historically have been 
slow periods for the company's restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, cash register receipts will show how well burgers go with burritos 
and ice cream with chicken entrees. 
</P>
<P>
 For Carl's Jr., the Green Burrito will be a serious test of whether 
Mexican-style menu items can help revive the burger chain's dinner business, 
which historically has been slow. The marketing hook for the joint venture: 
"Two Great Tastes, One Great Place." 
</P>
<P>
 But some industry executives remain cautious, wondering if maybe it isn't too 
much of a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Late one night we wondered, if two locations under one roof was supposed to 
be good, why not three or four?" said William R. Espinosa, vice president of 
strategic planning at Anaheim-based CKE Restaurants, parent company of Carl's 
Jr. "Luckily," he said, "we decided it was time to go home."

BANK HELD EQUALLY AT FAULT IN MONEY ORDER FIRM'S COLLAPSE; FINANCE: WILSHIRE 
STATE BANK IMPROPERLY WITHHELD PAYMENT OF GENERAL MONEY ORDER DRAFTS, A JURY 
SAYS.

<P>
 When General Money Order Inc. went bust shortly before Christmas in 1991 -- 
leaving thousands of mostly poor customers holding nearly $20 million in 
worthless drafts -- blame quickly fell on company President Jay Sun Hwang. 
</P>
<P>
 However, jurors hearing a recent lawsuit filed by a court-appointed receiver 
for Los Angeles-based GMO found another equally liable culprit in the financial 
debacle that created myriad bounced money orders and unpaid household bills for 
GMO customers. 
</P>
<P>
 The verdict in Los Angeles County Superior Court is that tiny Wilshire State 
Bank of Los Angeles should pay $1.6 million to the receiver because bank 
executives improperly held up payment on $7-million worth of GMO money orders. 
The bank's action was improper, the jury found, because it was taken 
retroactively -- that is, after the bank had agreed to cover the money orders 
under a credit agreement with GMO. 
</P>
<P>
 The receiver alleged that the hold on the money orders was a significant 
contributing factor to the Department of Corporations' decision to shut down 
GMO. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilshire State is seeking a new trial. If the verdict stands, however, the 
$1.6 million will be added to about $12 million that the receiver -- the Los 
Angeles law firm of Saltzburg, Ray & Bergman -- has already recovered to be 
distributed to GMO customers whose money orders were not paid. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of GMO's customers were poor and working-class blacks and Latinos who 
could not afford bank checking accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilshire State attorney Richard H. Cooper, noting that the same jury decided 
that the bank was not guilty of breach of contract and negligence, said: "The . 
. . verdicts are internally inconsistent. It makes no sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Assigning some responsibility to Wilshire State "sends a message that banks 
have to be careful in dealing with customers," said Eric Edmunds, the attorney 
representing Saltzburg, Ray & Bergman. "The bank can't just look out for itself 
and throw its customers to the dogs." 
</P>
<P>
 The jury assigned 50% of the blame for GMO's collapse to the bank and 50% to 
Hwang. 
</P>
<P>
 Hwang, a 58-year-old Korean immigrant, nurtured GMO for eight years, building 
it into a company with 1,400 agents who sold about $60 million in money orders 
a month. At the time of its demise, GMO was the second-largest money order firm 
in California. 
</P>
<P>
 But attorneys for the receiver say Hwang apparently had continual problems 
collecting from his vast network of sales agents. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, 1991, Hwang reported to Wilshire State that he might be unable to 
cover about $3 million in outstanding money orders, a situation that put GMO 
"out of trust," or in violation of a state requirement that the firm always 
have sufficient cash on hand to cover all unpaid money orders in circulation. 
Kenneth Freedman, Hwang's attorney, said Wilshire State's response to Hwang's 
predicament was to put a three-to-five day hold on 45,000 money orders, 
although there were funds available to cover those drafts. 
</P>
<P>
 Bad money orders were starting to appear after Hwang went to the bank, and the 
number quickly escalated after the bank imposed its hold. The Department of 
Corporations then stepped in, closing the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank executives say they were forced to take the action given what they 
described as Hwang's history of financial dealings. After Wilshire State took 
on the GMO account, the bank's chief operating officer, Joel Ziskind, said an 
inquiry discovered that Hwang had knowingly overstated the worth of the company 
-- false information that he had also provided to the Department of 
Corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't believe we caused the demise of the company," Ziskind said. "It was 
because he was out of trust that caused him to go under." 
</P>
<P>
 Edmunds acknowledges that Hwang disseminated false financial data on GMO but 
says it was done solely to keep the company afloat. In its eight years of 
existence, GMO had filed at least 30 lawsuits against sales agents who 
allegedly did not turn over cash collected from money order sales. One agent, 
Edmunds said, stole $2 million from GMO before being caught and sent to prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Over several years, Hwang poured more than $1 million of his own money into 
company accounts and sold off commercial property he owned in the San Fernando 
Valley to offset losses, Edmunds said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hwang was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The past few years have not been rosy either for Wilshire State, a state 
chartered bank with $100 million in assets and three branches in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 The 14-year-old bank, whose customers are mostly retail establishments and 
other small businesses, reported a loss of more than $610,000 for 1993 and one 
of $1.9 million for 1992. For the first six months of this year, the bank 
reported a profit of 194,000. 
</P>
<P>
 If the $1.6-million verdict stands, the bank expects to report a loss for the 
year, President William Im said.

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON AND JOHN LIPPMAN: TURNER PUSHES FOR MERGER DEAL WITH NBC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Ted Turner refuses to be counted out of General Electric's NBC sweepstakes. 
Even as others appeared to be closing in on a deal for the network, sources say 
cable magnate John C. Malone pleaded Turner's case Thursday in a meeting with 
GE Chairman Jack Welch at NBC's Rockefeller Center offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Malone, whose Tele-Communications Inc. holds a minority stake in Turner 
Broadcasting System, apparently hopes to persuade Welch that Turner can still 
pull off a deal, despite significant obstacles. One source described Malone as 
a "facilitator" for Turner, though another said Malone might also have used the 
Welch meeting to promote TCI's own agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner and Malone declined comment on the meeting Thursday. But people close 
to the talks say Walt Disney Co. and Time Warner still appear to have the 
inside track. Sources say Disney and GE are only a few hundred million dollars 
apart on the price, with Disney trying to hold the line at $4.2 billion. Time 
Warner, negotiating to acquire 49% of NBC in a stock-swap deal that excludes 
the stations it owns, also remains in hot pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts assume Disney will prevail, due to its largely cash offer. 
Others say that Welch still prefers to sell just 49% of the network, which 
would seem to give Time Warner an edge if it can overcome regulatory hurdles 
that forbid cable operators from owning networks. 
</P>
<P>
 Welch's own ambivalence may be one explanation for why no one's rushing to the 
altar. But, whatever the outcome, sources credit the GE chairman with 
masterfully building interest in an asset that went begging only a year ago. 
"He's created a nice little auction," said one source. 
</P>
<P>
 The interest in NBC, which GE purchased from RCA eight years ago, is also due 
to the recent resurgence in the reputations of the major networks. Once 
regarded as relics, they have been rediscovered by advertisers and by studios 
seeking guaranteed outlets for their programs. 
</P>
<P>
 GE has hired the blue chip New York investment banking firm Allen & Co. to 
represent it in discussions with prospective buyers. Sources say that Disney 
Chairman Michael D. Eisner personally met with GE executives in New York 
earlier this week, before returning to the company's Burbank headquarters on 
Thursday. Sanford Litvack, who was recently named Disney's chief of corporate 
operations, is said to be one of its point men in the talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Disney and GE seem to be razor close on terms, sources cautioned 
that either side could still walk away, especially given Eisner's well-known 
aversion to big acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors may share that aversion. Disney shares were near their 1994 low 
Thursday. They closed down 50 cents, to $40.25, Thursday in New York Stock 
Exchange trading. The 1994 low is $39.625. The high is $48.625. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, NBC could be worth considerably more than the offer that Disney is 
apparently weighing. NBC's cash flow is expected to reach $550 million by next 
year. At a minimum multiple of 10 times cash flow, the price tag for 100% of 
NBC could exceed $6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Time Warner, meanwhile, seems to be stubbornly standing its ground in the NBC 
negotiations. One source close to the talks says Chairman Gerald M. Levin still 
"desperately" wants to acquire a piece of the network as a vehicle for 
programming. "Time Warner definitely hasn't given up, nor will they," the 
source said. "This is going to go right down to the wire." 
</P>
<P>
 Turner's best shot seems to be in filling the void left by Time Warner, when 
and if the entertainment conglomerate walks away from the table. Turner could 
grease the skids by trading one of his cable networks, such as TNT, for Time 
Warner's stake in Turner. He's resisted such a move in the past, but sources 
say Turner is more open to a deal now for the sake of NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 After lusting after a network to merge with his CNN for years, and previously 
falling short, Turner seems to feel that his moment has arrived. He has openly 
ruminated about his goals, and raised the issue again this week during a 
private get-together of cable TV executives at the Museum of Radio and 
Television. 
</P>
<P>
 "Time Warner has been a good partner," sources say Turner told the audience. 
"No," he added for dramatic emphasis, "they have been a great partner." Then, 
waiting a one-two beat for suspense, Turner added: "Let me tell you right now 
we're getting a divorce." 
</P>
<P>
 Turner next turned to Time Warner's HBO Chairman Michael Fuchs, sitting near 
him. "Michael, it's over," Turner told him. "Get your own damn network." 
</P>
<P>
 And Turner was just warming up. He next entertained questions from the 60 or 
so senior cable TV industry executives who had come to hear him speak "off the 
record." Kay Koplovitz, the longtime head of USA Network, asked the question 
that was on many people's minds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ted, if you fail again to buy a network, will you retire and, if so, what 
will you and Jane (Fonda, his wife) do?" Koplovitz asked. Turner looked up at 
the ceiling and then down at his feet, holding the crowd at bay, before 
answering, "Up yours, Kay." 
</P>

 Unplugging the cable: Southwestern Bell, which last year became the first 
telephone company to own cable systems, may now be looking to get out of the 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Cable TV industry sources report that Southwestern Bell has quietly approached 
a handful of cable TV operators, including Denver-based Jones Intercable, about 
buying the former Hauser Communications Inc. cable systems it bought only 10 
months ago for $650 million. The systems serve about 220,000 subscribers in 
suburban Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwestern Bell's historic deal last year set off a rush among regional Bell 
companies and cable TV operators to merge and form strategic ventures in 
anticipation of the vaunted 500-channel information superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwestern Bell's reasons for selling the cable systems less than a year 
after it acquired them remain unclear, but cable TV industry sources said it 
may be due to the telephone company's failed effort to merge the systems into a 
joint venture with Cox Communications. That venture, which aimed to become one 
of the largest cable operators in the country, fell apart after regulators 
ordered a further cutback of cable TV rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Southwestern Bell is now in the process of applying for regulatory 
clearance to offer phone service over the Hauser cable TV systems. However, 
most cable industry executives believe that only cable operators with a minimum 
of several million subscribers will be able to afford to offer the panoply of 
information superhighway services in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Southwestern Bell declined comment.

THE DOWNSIZING OF DEFENSE; NORTHROP GRUMMAN TO SLASH 8,650 JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Northrop Grumman Corp., in another stark illustration of the human cost of 
spending cutbacks in the defense industry, said Thursday it will slash 8,650 
jobs during the next 15 months, including 4,150 in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The job losses are "a painful but necessary step to reduce our costs" and to 
make the contractor "a leaner, streamlined company" in the face of the defense 
slowdown, Northrop Grumman Chairman Kent Kresa said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles-based aerospace company said it does not yet know how many of 
the cuts will involve actual layoffs. The number will depend on attrition and 
how many workers accept an early retirement program being offered to 5,000 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 If 60% of the eligible workers accept its early retirement offer, Northrop 
Grumman said it expects to incur a one-time, pretax charge against earnings of 
about $300 million in this year's fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're sorry to see this happen," said Tom Quintana, a spokesman for the city 
of Hawthorne, one of the sites hard hit by Northrop Grumman's move. "If there's 
a ray of good news, at least some of the employees will have the option of 
getting retirement (benefits) out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Some job losses were expected following Northrop's $2.2-billion purchase of 
Grumman Corp. in May and its acquisition last month of the 51% of Vought 
Aircraft Co. in Texas that it didn't already own. 
</P>
<P>
 But Northrop Grumman said only about 1,000 of the cuts -- which will also be 
concentrated in New York and Texas -- are directly related to those deals. The 
bulk of the lost jobs are due to the relentless slide in Pentagon spending, 
which continues to leave Northrop Grumman and other defense contractors with 
far more capacity than they need. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Northrop Grumman cuts were anticipated, the company had not 
previously indicated how big they would be. They turned out to be substantial 
-- about 18% of its current worldwide employment of 47,500. 
</P>
<P>
 The reductions include: 
</P>
<P>
 * 2,400 jobs at Palmdale and Pico Rivera, where the B-2 Stealth bomber is 
built. Northrop Grumman first disclosed these cuts last week. By 1996, the 
remaining 8,000 jobs at these sites will also be in jeopardy, because the B-2 
program is scheduled to be completed by the decade's end. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1,750 at Hawthorne and El Segundo, where Northrop Grumman makes fuselages 
for the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 fighter jet as well as an attack missile known 
as TSSAM, aircraft sensors and other defense electronics. The two sites 
currently employ about 10,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The F/A-18 work, which by itself employs about 4,000 in El Segundo, is one of 
Northrop Grumman's healthier programs, with a new E/F version of the jet 
expected to begin production in the late 1990s. But the company said it has 
completed much of the E/F's engineering and development, forcing job cuts in 
that program as well. 
</P>
<P>
 * 3,500 on New York's Long Island. Grumman's former headquarters, in Bethpage, 
is closing, and the cuts will extend to several other sites involved in defense 
electronics, data systems and administrative work. 
</P>
<P>
 * 600 at Dallas, where Vought makes a variety of aircraft subassemblies, 
including sections of the B-2 bomber and McDonnell Douglas' C-17 transport. 
</P>
<P>
 * 400 at smaller plants nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The layoff announcements in the aerospace industry have come with depressing 
regularity in recent years, and were a major reason why the early 1990s marked 
the worst economic downturn in Southern California since the Depression. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense contractors have been slashing employment since the late-1980s -- 
eliminating more than 300,000 aerospace-related jobs in California alone -- and 
some analysts have said the process is about two-thirds complete. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But that still means there's more pain to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Northrop Grumman's announcement came only 10 days after another aerospace 
giant, Hughes Aircraft Co., unveiled plans to shed 4,400 jobs in Southern 
California. And California workers are bracing for expected layoffs stemming 
from the proposed $10-billion merger of Calabasas-based Lockheed Corp. and 
Martin Marietta Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're definitely going to see continued rounds of layoffs in the industry," 
said Jon Kutler, president of Quarterdeck Investment Partners, a Los Angeles 
defense consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 When Northrop Grumman's job reductions are completed at the end of 1995, its 
California employment will total 17,850. That's less than half what the old 
Northrop Corp. employed in California seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 For the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, Pentagon procurement spending for arms 
and other goods will total about $43 billion, compared with $81 billion as 
recently as fiscal 1990, according to the Defense Budget Project, a research 
firm in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 With that stream of Pentagon dollars narrowing, many defense firms are merging 
to survive the leaner times. And those deals -- like most corporate marriages 
-- are resulting in even more layoffs as the merged companies eliminate 
duplication. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Bitzinger, an analyst with the Defense Budget Project, said the 
Northrop Grumman announcement serves as a precursor for what Lockheed and 
Martin Marietta are likely to do. Lockheed has about 20,000 employees in 
California, primarily in Palmdale and Sunnyvale. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said that merger, too, will probably account only for a minority of the 
layoffs -- mainly in the middle management and administrative ranks -- of the 
new Lockheed Martin Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the assembly line,," he said, "the layoffs are still generated by the 
overall downsizing of the defense budget." Job Cuts at Northrop Grumman 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the Northrop Grumman job cutbacks and the programs affected: 
</P>
<P>
 CALIFORNIA: 
</P>
<P>
 * 2,400 jobs at Palmdale and Pico Rivera (B-2 stealth bomber) 
</P>
<P>
 * 1,750 jobs at Hawthorne and El Segundo (F/A-18 fighter jet, TSSAM missile, 
aircraft sensors and other defense electronics) 
</P>
<P>
 NEW YORK: 
</P>
<P>
 * 3,500 jobs at Bethpage (former Grumman headquarters), Melville (business 
development and administration), Great River (radar and other defense 
electronics), Holtsville (data systems; research and development) 
</P>
<P>
 TEXAS: 
</P>
<P>
 * 600 jobs at Dallas (Aircraft subassemblies made by Vought unit) 
</P>
<P>
 OTHER STATES: 
</P>
<P>
 * 400 jobs at smaller sites nationwide, including Georgia, Florida, Illinois 
and Massachussetts. CALIFORNIA AEROSPACE EMPLOYMENT 
</P>
<P>
 The job cutbacks at Northrop Grumman are the latest in a long line of layoff 
announcements that have jolted California's aerospace industry since the late 
1980s. The jobs in aerospace include work in the aircraft industry, guided 
missiles and spacecraft, and search and navigation systems. California

LENDERS ARE CAUTIONED BY GREENSPAN; BANKING: FED CHIEF NOTES THAT THE INDUSTRY 
IS STRONGER THAN IT HAS BEEN IN DECADES, BUT HE ISSUES A REMINDER OF PAST 
MISTAKES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan voiced concern Thursday that the 
nation's banks may be relaxing loan standards too much in order to win new 
business, but analysts and lenders said they see little threat of a 1980s-style 
banking crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 While noting that American banks are the strongest they've been in decades, 
Greenspan told members of the Senate Banking Committee that some lenders are 
beginning to loosen their credit requirements and will have to be careful if 
they want to avoid another industry debacle. 
</P>
<P>
 "In recent months, I have begun to receive reports from examiners and from 
surveys that banks are competing more aggressively for loans, and they are 
relaxing their credit standards," the Fed chairman told a hearing on the health 
of the banking industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is too early to know if banks are easing excessively, but our examiners 
are sensitive to such concerns," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the danger nationally, banking analysts said there is little or no 
problem in California, where some borrowers have complained that just the 
opposite situation prevails. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big California banks are in very good shape, and they have been 
especially prudent about the loans they make because they've been worried about 
the (state's) recession," said Harry Gage of Gage & Co., a Pasadena-based 
bank-consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "If our economy here slowly gets better, our banks are only going to get 
stronger" because fewer loans will go sour, Gage said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank failures exceeded 200 a year in the late 1980s and early '90s after 
energy, agricultural and real estate loans went sour. The fund that insures 
bank deposits dipped into the red in 1992, raising fears of a thrift-style 
taxpayer bailout. 
</P>
<P>
 Banks subsequently tightened credit standards, triggering the "credit crunch" 
that strained businesses and consumers trying to get loans and contributed to 
the recession. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, some experts complain that California bankers' insistence on strict 
underwriting standards for both consumers and businesses is holding back the 
state's fledgling recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, many banks in the southern part of the state say most types of 
lending activity are on the upswing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen steady increases in loans to home builders, and manufacturers and 
retailers are also borrowing more money to expand," said Doug Stewart, 
executive vice president at Los Angeles-based Sanwa Bank California. "But I 
think every banker is being prudent about who we loan money to -- we want a 
repeat of the banking crisis even less than Greenspan does." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan made clear that for now, the Fed sees no "major problems looming" 
for the banking industry. 
</P>
<P>
 As he spoke, federal bank regulators were reporting an 8.7% jump in banking 
profits in the second quarter to $11.2 billion, the second-highest quarterly 
total ever. Earnings in the first half of 1994 hit $22.3 billion, the most ever 
for any six-month period. 
</P>
<P>
 "The banking system is stronger now than it has been in many years, and it 
seems well prepared to meet the nation's credit needs," the Fed chief said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Greenspan warned bankers that they cannot become complacent and allow 
reserves to fall so much that they might be inadequate to meet potential 
trouble down the road. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that some banks have sharply curtailed or even eliminated the amount 
they set aside for loans likely to go sour. Many banks took no loan-loss 
provisions in the first half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not questioning those decisions at this time," Greenspan said. 
"Nonetheless, I would urge the industry to guard against letting reserves 
decline too far." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Greenspan and other regulators also warned that the savings and 
loan industry could again get in hot water if, as expected, S&Ls soon end up 
paying higher fees for deposit insurance than banks. More S&Ls could fail as 
they lose out competitively to banks, straining the insurance fund that backs 
S&L deposits. 
</P>
<P>
 The premiums now are about the same, about 23 cents for every $100 of insured 
deposits. 
</P>
<P>
 But banks could be paying much less next year, assuming the Bank Insurance 
Fund is replenished to mandated levels ahead of the thrift fund, as expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan Fiechter, the top thrift regulator, said "there is no current 
crisis." But he warned that the higher the premiums thrifts must pay for 
deposit insurance, the more failed S&Ls the thrift insurance fund may have to 
handle.

 Sacramento Woos Packard Bell: Gov. Pete Wilson is expected to sign into law a 
bill created to attract the Chatsworth-based computer maker and 3,000 jobs to 
the state capital area. The legislation would convert the 400-acre Army Depot 
in Sacramento into an enterprise zone, giving Packard Bell an estimated $5 
million in tax breaks if it moves into the facility. Packard Bell is currently 
negotiating a lease with the city.

 Japanese Tax Cuts Approved: Matching the thrust of American demands, Prime 
Minister Tomiichi Murayama's coalition Cabinet approved another two years of 
income-tax cuts without increasing other taxes in a move designed to stimulate 
Japan's economy.The reform package, to be submitted to Parliament for approval, 
expected this fall, guarantees that Japanese citizens will pocket at least $104 
billion in tax savings in the next two years. That sum is more than a third of 
the value of pump-priming programs implemented since 1992. Two days ago, 
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen issued an unusual statement praising the 
measure, still being hammered out, as a likely spur to imports.

 Agriculture Department Ponders Charging Fees: The U.S. Department of 
Agriculture is considering charging biotechnology and other industries for some 
of their regulatory costs as a way to raise funds during tight fiscal times, 
said Terry Medley, director of biotechnology at USDA.The proposal is being 
considered as part of the Clinton Administration's proposals for the 1995 Farm 
Bill, currently being drafted at the agency. However, several attempts at 
raising funds through so-called user fees at USDA have failed in the past. The 
House and Senate agriculture committees repeatedly refused to adopt increased 
meat inspection fees for the Agriculture Department. Now the agency is looking 
at new areas, not limited to biotechnology, where it can impose user fees.

 Clinton Sets Japanese Trade Sanctions Deadline: Japanese Foreign Minister 
Yohei Kono was warned by President Clinton in an hourlong meeting that the 
United States stands ready to impose sanctions against Japan if Tokyo fails to 
make sufficient trade concessions by Sept. 30. Despite the tough talk, the U.S. 
dollar has not moved much in recent trading against the Japanese yen. The 
Administration set the deadline for Japan to change its government purchasing 
practices to end alleged discrimination against foreign suppliers of 
telecommunications and medical products.

BORDEN SEEMS CLOSE TO BUYOUT FOR RJR STOCK; ACQUISITION: DEAL WITH KOHLBERG 
KRAVIS ROBERTS IS PROCEEDING ON TRACK, SPOKESWOMAN SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Borden Inc. directors, turning aside a last-minute bid from investor Paul B. 
Kazarian, appeared close Thursday to a deal for Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. 
to acquire the food and consumer products company for $2 billion in RJR Nabisco 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
 KKR, the New York-based buyout specialist, had set a deadline of Friday for an 
agreement. KKR spokeswoman Ruth Pachman said Thursday, "It's proceeding on 
track." 
</P>
<P>
 A potential stumbling block to the deal emerged Wednesday, when Kazarian came 
up with a plan to buy up to 90% of Borden's stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Japonica Partners, Kazarian's investment firm, said in a letter to Borden 
Chairman Frank J. Tasco it was interested in a "significant transaction with 
Borden or its shareholders" to provide greater value than would be available 
under the KKR offer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kazarian proposal, which calls for Japonica to pay $16 to $18 a share for 
Borden stock, comes to $2.28 billion if the higher price were used to buy 90% 
of Borden's 141 million shares outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 KKR has offered to swap RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. stock worth $14.25 for each 
share of Borden stock. 
</P>
<P>
 But a source close to the negotiations said Thursday the Japonica letter fell 
far short of a credible offer. 
</P>
<P>
 In a two-hour meeting with three top Borden officials Wednesday night in New 
York, Kazarian refused to elaborate on financing options or the structure of 
the deal, said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said the letter speaks for itself," the source said of Kazarian. "But 
there's no proposal or offer in this letter." 
</P>
<P>
 Kazarian has a different view of the meeting, said spokesman Richard 
Nicolazzo. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's extremely disappointed that Borden's board was not willing to engage in 
constructive dialogue," Nicolazzo said. Japonica outlined its complaints in a 
letter to the board Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Japonica was not in a position to offer more answers, because Borden has 
refused to provide detailed information about the company's operations, he 
said. What was offered was a menu of options, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Kazarian's proposal, according to sources close to the negotiation, offers 
various transaction possibilities, including an equity infusion of $200 million 
to $500 million for a corresponding stake in Borden. 
</P>
<P>
 The KKR deal would allow the buyout firm to unload some of its shares in RJR 
Nabisco, which KKR took private in 1989 for $24.53 billion and then returned to 
partial public ownership two years later.

GM CHECKS OFF ON SALE OF NATIONAL CAR RENTAL; DEALS: AUTO MAKER REACHES 
PRELIMINARY AGREEMENT FOR PURCHASE OF FIRM BY INVESTMENT GROUP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 General Motors Corp. said Thursday it has reached a preliminary agreement to 
sell its National Car Rental System Inc. to an investment group led by Vestar 
Equity Partners for an undisclosed sum. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, National Car Rental President Lawrence Ramaekers told Reuters that 
the rental firm was expected to fetch more than $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 GM, the nation's largest auto maker, said it signed a letter of intent for the 
sale of National, which has more than 5,000 locations in 132 countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The move marks the second time this month that one of Detroit's Big Three auto 
makers has sold a stake in a rental car firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, Chrysler Corp. sold its stake in Snappy Rent-A-Car to a 
group of investors led by Jackson Partners in New York. Chrysler still owns a 
stake in Thrifty and Dollar Rent-A-Car. In April, Ford Motor Co. raised its 
stake in Hertz to 100%. 
</P>
<P>
 New York-based Vestar has organized 13 management buyouts during the last six 
years. The firm manages a $260-million equity fund dedicated to management 
buyouts. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed National sale agreement includes provisions for the company to 
keep its 6,400 employees and maintain its long-term fleet agreement with GM to 
purchase vehicles. Additional terms of the agreement, including the sale price, 
were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for GM declined to comment on the price, saying the deal is 
contingent on the signing of a definitive agreement and the approval of GM's 
board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 GM said the sale reflects the company's strategy to divest non-core assets. GM 
acquired a 45% stake in National in 1988 and since then has acquired full 
ownership of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, GM retained Jay Alix & Associates, turnaround specialists, to improve 
National's operating performance. In 1992, the car maker took a charge of 
$744.1 million, or $1.11 a share, related to losses at National. 
</P>
<P>
 "National Car Rental is an established franchise that we believe has real 
potential," John Howard, co-chief executive of Vestar, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been quite impressed with the efforts of GM and Jay Alix & Associates 
to improve National's operating performance," Howard said. "We will work 
closely with the management team to build on this progress."

 Six Baby Bells Form Alliance: In what may reflect a trend toward greater 
cooperation among the offspring of AT&T, six regional Bell telephone companies 
-- including Pacific Bell -- announced an arrangement to jointly market certain 
communications services. Called Unibridge, the service is targeted at companies 
that acquire personal communications systems (PCS) licenses in the upcoming 
Federal Communications Commission auction.Those companies may want to offer 
cellular phone-type PCS services but may not want immediately to invest huge 
sums in the communications infrastructure required to do so. The service would 
offer information about a set of compatible products provided by all the phone 
companies, such as billing, transport and connection to the public switched 
network. The members -- Ameritech, Bell Atlantic, BellSouth, Nynex, Pacific 
Bell and US West -- will cover 43 states.

 Ex-Broker for Prudential Settles SEC Charges: Peggy Jean Homuth, 35, a former 
broker who worked in Prudential Securities' Rochester, N.Y., office for 10 
years, has agreed to settle Securities and Exchange Commission charges that she 
forged clients' signatures and bilked them out of $3.2 million.She also could 
face a prison term of up to 41 months and fines of up to $75,000 after pleading 
guilty to related federal mail fraud charges. The settlement orders Homuth to 
pay $3.2 million, an amount the SEC said "she took from her customers," plus 
prejudgment interest. The payment was waived, however, because she lacks the 
funds.

earnings for the quarter ended Aug. 31 fell to $19.1 million, or 21 cents a 
share, from $46.1 million, or 51 cents, a year ago.Per-share figures reflect a 
3-for-2 common stock split in May. The fiscal second quarter results include a 
charge of $8 million from job cuts and other restructuring moves, and a charge 
of $26 million to write down the value of certain hedging strategies.

NEXTEL LAUNCHES NEW WIRELESS SERVICE IN STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY HARMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nextel Communications Inc. on Thursday launched a digital wireless 
communications service in California, a first step in the company's ambitious 
plan to create a nationwide system to compete with traditional cellular phones. 
</P>
<P>
 Aimed initially at businesses, Nextel's phone is larger than a typical 
cellular phone, but can be used for a range of communications including paging 
and two-way radio dispatch. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rutherford, N.J.-based firm, backed by Motorola Inc., has over the last 
several years stitched together a national network of the radio frequency 
licenses used by taxi dispatchers. But Nextel absorbed a big setback last month 
when MCI Communications pulled out of an agreement to invest $1.3 billion in 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
 The digital system allows far more traffic to flow over one channel than the 
analog system still used by most cellular phone firms. The two cellular 
carriers in Los Angeles, Air Touch Communications and L.A. Cellular, are moving 
to convert their networks to digital. 
</P>
<P>
 Nextel has invested about $300 million to build cell towers throughout 
California. Because the radio frequencies the firm uses are broken up into tiny 
pieces, 130 towers were necessary just to cover Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 At a press conference in downtown Los Angeles, Mayor Richard Riordan 
demonstrated the handset's digital cellular function to respond to a text 
message from Sacramento Mayor Joseph Serna. Serna and Oakland Mayor Elihu 
Harris spoke to each other via the digital dispatch function.

STATE FARM ACCUSED OF REDLINING IN L.A.; INSURANCE: COMPANY DENIES 
DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES. GARAMENDI CONCEDES LACK OF EVIDENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi Thursday accused State Farm Mutual 
Automobile Insurance Co., California's largest homeowners insurer, of 
redlining, or illegal sales discrimination, in inner-city neighborhoods of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on a new study of 1992 homeowners insurance sales in selected ZIP codes, 
Garamendi said the company "writes virtually no policies in South-Central and 
East Los Angeles" because it refuses to compete in poorer neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 State Farm denied redlining, saying it has a sales agent within 3 1/2 miles of 
every home in Los Angeles and paid out more money in claims from the city's 
1992 riots than all but one competitor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have heard these charges repeatedly but never had a complaint filed 
against us," State Farm spokesman Bill Sirola said Thursday. "It starts to get 
frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi acknowledged in an interview that he lacks the evidence to make a 
formal redlining charge stick against State Farm, but "we are building the 
case, map by map and line by line." 
</P>
<P>
 The accusation came in Garamendi's testimony in San Francisco Thursday at a 
public hearing on property insurance discrimination held by the U.S. Department 
of Housing and Urban Development. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi has previously accused State Farm and other carriers of auto 
insurance redlining, a charge the companies also deny. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's report was based on preliminary information from an ongoing 
Insurance Department study of insurance sales in California's 10 largest 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The preliminary study showed that No. 2 Allstate Insurance Co. was doing 
business throughout Los Angeles and had actually exceeded its statewide market 
share average in the inner city, for which Garamendi praised the company. 
</P>
<P>
 He criticized Farmers Insurance Group, the third-largest insurer, for selling 
more of its limited fire insurance policies than its full-fledged homeowners 
policies in inner-city neighborhoods.

FCC MAKES RULE CHANGES TO AID MINORITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Federal Communications Commission moved Thursday to give minorities and 
women a better shot at winning licenses in the government's next auction of the 
airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency said it adopted an installment payment plan for women- and 
minority-owned firms on certain licenses they win in the FCC's next auction.The 
plan also clarified its definition of businesses owned by women and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The FCC said last month that it would give women- and minority-owned firms a 
40% discount on their licenses. That was up from the 25% discount in the 
previous auctions. The 40% discounts apply to 10 of the 30 licenses that will 
be sold in the FCC's next sale. That auction, for regional licenses to offer 
advanced paging and messaging services, will begin Oct. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 When Congress instructed the agency last year to begin auctioning broadcast 
licenses, it told the FCC to ensure that minorities, women and small businesses 
could compete against existing industry giants. 
</P>
<P>
 In the agency's first auction in July, none of the 10 licenses to offer 
advanced paging and messaging services were captured by these special groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Several minority bidders at that auction complained that the FCC failed to 
satisfy its congressional mandate, even though the agency had said it would 
give them 25% discounts on certain licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The new rules are an attempt to do a better job at meeting Congress' aims. 
</P>
<P>
 The installment payment plan fixes interest charges at the time of licensing 
at the rate for 10-year U.S. Treasury obligations plus 2.5%. The agency will 
allow these groups to make interest-only payments for the first two years.

CONSUMER AFFAIRS / DENISE GELLENE: FEWER SHOPPERS SEEING CENTS IN COUPONS

 Coupon usage continues to plummet, a sign that consumers feel better about the 
economy, says NCH Promotional Services of Lincolnshire, Ill., a leading coupon 
processor. The company said redemptions fell 11% during the first half of 1994, 
deepening a decline that started last year. 
</P>
<P>
 NCH attributed the drop in part to an improved economy that is giving 
consumers less incentive to save. But the company also said that manufacturers 
have made changes that discourage redemption. 
</P>
<P>
 Coupons have shorter expiration dates and increasingly require multiple 
purchases, the company said. For instance, a shopper might have to buy chicken 
to redeem a coupon for barbecue sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more complex a coupon is, the shorter the expiration date is, the less 
likely it is to be redeemed," said Jane Perrin, NCH senior vice president of 
marketing.

 Phone service refunds: About 150,000 people who had touch-tone service 
disconnected between May 4, 1987, and May 3, 1990, may be due a refund from 
Pacific Bell, the California Public Utilities Commission said. 
</P>
<P>
 The PUC found that PacBell charged residents of certain communities for 
touch-tone service even though the company did not have equipment capable of 
providing the service. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the customers owed refunds have moved or disconnected their service. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the PUC, 13 exchanges in both the 619 and 805 area codes are 
affected. For more information, consumers can call (800) 749-7322.

 Letting down the guard: The makers of Antenna Guard Radiation Shield have 
agreed to withdraw a claim that it blocks 85% of electromagnetic radiation 
emitted by cellular phones, after an independent panel said the claim was 
unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Advertising Review Board, a self-regulatory panel administered by 
the Better Business Bureau, said Antenna Guard's manufacturer tested only 
magnetic radiation -- and that in those tests, the shield fell short of the 
percentage of radiation it claimed to block. 
</P>
<P>
 The product, sold through the Sharper Image catalogue, appealed to fears about 
radiation emitted by cellular phones. Recent studies have shown that radiation 
from cellular phones is within safe limits.

Problem is, of course, that the baseball season has been canceled, because of

 Odds and ends: A Fast Frame store in Arcadia is extending store hours and 
installing a TV during the O.J. Simpson murder trial so customers won't miss 
the court proceedings. . . . Acclaim Entertainment said sales of Mortal Kombat 
II, the sequel to the popular video game, hit a record $50 million during its 
first week, despite carrying the equivalent of an R movie rating. The violent 
game has been condemned by California Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren. . . . Mail-order 
companies are running out of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Halloween costumes, 
fashioned after the stars of the popular children's television show. At one 
mail order firm, Troll Learn & Play of Mahwah, N.J., customer service 
representatives are advising callers to try such competitors as J.C. Penney, 
which carries two Rangers -- pink and red -- in its catalogue. The New Phone

 The California Public Utilities Commission last week approved an average 39% 
reduction in toll rates, ushering competition in the so-called local 
long-distance market. How much of a break consumers will get depends on when a 
call is placed and the distance it travels. Here's a sampling of approved rate 
cuts that take effect on Jan. 1. The rates are the same for Pacific Bell and 
GTE customers. The PUC said most residential customers will end up with higher 
phone bills because the cost of basic service is increasing substantially.

FED SAYS ECONOMY IS SLOWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. economic growth is "clearly slowing" from its pace earlier in the year, 
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan said it's "still unclear" as to how much of a slowdown is in 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the Fed chairman said there are signs that product and labor 
markets are approaching capacity limits. The Fed is examining these signs for 
"evidences of pressures" that inflation is about to accelerate. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan's comments, at a hearing by the Senate Banking Committee, come as 
the Fed's Open Market Committee prepares to meet Tuesday to set interest rate 
policy for the weeks ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists are divided over whether the committee will vote to raise key 
lending rates next week or wait until after the November Congressional 
elections. In previous moves this year, the Fed pushed the federal funds rate 
on loans among banks to 4.75% from 3%, and the discount rate on direct loans to 
banks to 4% from 3%.

COMPANY TOWN; VAN DAMME GAINS 'FRANCHISE' STATUS; MOVIES: STAR OF UNIVERSAL 
PICTURES' 'TIMECOP' IS ABOUT TO BECOME THE FOCAL POINT OF A MERCHANDISING 
CAMPAIGN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Jean-Claude action figures. Jean-Claude trading cards. Jean-Claude's face in a 
video game. A burger, fries and cola with a Jean-Claude figurine to go. 
</P>
<P>
 All those items will soon be coming to a store and restaurant near you as 
Universal Pictures attempts to turn Belgian-born action star Jean-Claude Van 
Damme into its latest "franchise." 
</P>
<P>
 Buoyed by the $12-million opening last weekend of Van Damme's futuristic 
picture "Timecop," the MCA Inc. unit believes it is poised to reap even bigger 
dividends from the star in the future. After releasing three Van Damme films to 
date, the studio plans to release three more, with Van Damme merchandise on the 
shelf as early as Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't often that a studio gets the opportunity to build up an actor 
because they usually are pretty free-lance. We don't even have a deal with 
him," said Tom Pollock, MCA's motion picture chief. Indeed, Van Damme, 33, will 
be moving on eventually to projects at Columbia Pictures, where he has some 
previously negotiated commitments. 
</P>
<P>
 The meaning of a "franchise" star is open to interpretation, but a good part 
of it involves having the clout to get a film made, being a low-risk bet for a 
studio and opening revenue streams such as merchandising, like the kind that 
will proliferate with "Street Fighter" -- a Van Damme movie based on the hugely 
popular video arcade game -- that is set for release Dec. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 It's quite a leap for someone who not long ago was known mostly for the Van 
Damme-age he did with his fists and feet in B-level martial arts films. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also no accident but part of a long-range plan Van Damme, his advisers, 
agents at International Creative Management and studio executives devised to 
broaden his appeal and push him into the higher budget films with more 
mainstream appeal and better directors. As Van Damme puts it, the plan is "to 
go from simple cruddy movies to special effects and science fiction with a good 
story and a big cast." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Van Damme's Hollywood career started in the 1980s when he dropped by the 
office of independent producer Moshe Diamant. Diamant didn't see much star 
potential in the muscular actor until Diamant noticed his young son kept 
watching on videocassette a rough cut of a film Van Damme had just completed 
called "Bloodsport." 
</P>
<P>
 Diamant eventually became the former cab driver and bouncer's mentor, cleaning 
up his contract obligations by buying out a firm Van Damme had signed with when 
he needed money. Van Damme's relationship with Universal was formed when the 
studio picked up "Lionheart" and subsequently released another film, "Hard 
Target." 
</P>
<P>
 Both films performed modestly well in the United States, but Van Damme was 
primarily seen as a foreign star until "Timecop." Universal's immediate 
challenge with "Timecop" -- a $30 million film in which Van Damme plays a 
policeman in 2004 who is able to travel back in time -- was to broaden the 
previously narrow demographics for Van Damme movies domestically. 
</P>
<P>
 Research showed the audience for his films tended to be heavily skewed toward 
young males, typically from 15 to 24 years old, who make up the primary 
audience for action films. Perry Katz, Universal's marketing chief, said one 
key goal was to reach a potential audience of women aged 20 to 50 by playing up 
in ads the romantic angle of the story. (In the film, Van Damme is tempted to 
travel back in time to prevent his wife's murder a decade earlier.) 
</P>
<P>
 The next step involves putting Van Damme into his first PG-13 movie, which 
will be "Street Fighter." In other words, a lot of action without much blood. 
The goal: expand Van Damme's audience to take in kids from 8 to 15 who are 
probably familiar with the video game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's absolutely going to reach the young teen-agers and the video game 
audience," promises Pollock. 
</P>
<P>
 The film, being bankrolled by Japanese video game maker Capcom and distributed 
by Universal, is the biggest-budget Van Damme film to date at an estimated $40 
million. It's also his biggest paycheck, at an estimated $8 million. The PG-13 
rating opens up merchandising possibilities, since the target audience is 17 
and under. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the merchandising pegged to "Street Fighter," both Van Damme and 
Diamant say that they are sensitive to the risk of overexposure. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to be careful," Van Damme said. "There can be too much exposure 
with toy and video games. So many people in the past came to me with toys and 
video games, and I always refused."

JOB AX FALLS AT COLUMBIA, TRISTAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Marketing and distribution executives at Columbia Pictures and TriStar 
Pictures have been on edge since August, when it was announced that the two 
Sony Pictures Entertainment divisions would be merged. 
</P>
<P>
 The ax fell Thursday, with dozens of staff members, including some executives, 
losing their jobs. On the marketing side, Mark Gill, Columbia vice president of 
publicity, is being phased out in favor of his TriStar counterpart, Ed Russell, 
who will take over publicity and promotion for both studios. As previously 
reported, TriStar marketing heads Buffy Shutt and Kathy Jones are going to 
Universal Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Many industry observers see the layoffs as part an effort to pare costs at the 
studios, which have slowed production and had roughly half the combined market 
share they did last year. There are also reports that Sony is trying to make 
the studios more financially attractive to potential investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Sid Ganis, president of Worldwide Marketing for Columbia and TriStar, called 
the moves strategic and said they are part of an effort to focus the operation. 
"It was agreed upon by all of us who manage both companies and is not about 
pressure from above," Ganis said. "Though it's upsetting and painful for all of 
us, it's clearly what's best for the company." 
</P>
<P>
 On the distribution end, TriStar senior vice president Bob Capps is the most 
senior executive to be let go. Pat Notaro will continue to preside over 
TriStar's distribution wing, reporting to Jeff Blake, who oversees distribution 
for both studios. 
</P>
<P>
 In the field, Columbia and TriStar films will be handled by Triumph Releasing. 
The closure of the Atlanta and Chicago sales offices, which will be 
consolidated with the Dallas operation, will bring about reductions in the 
national sales staff. 
</P>
<P>
 An executive at a rival studio said the consolidation is long overdue. 
"Exhibitors are consolidating, so we need to as well," he said. "With fewer 
customers, you need fewer bodies in the sales force. And with both of those 
studios putting out so few movies, why does Sony continue to maintain two 
separate marketing and distribution divisions?"

 Power of the Press: Bank of Newport was supposed to be a tantalizing 
acquisition for some company, says the Findley Reports banking newsletter, but 
the bank's own news release, predicting a federal takeover if it couldn't raise 
funds or find a buyer, did it in. 
</P>
<P>
 The early August news release caused a run on deposits as customers pulled out 
$35 million, and federal regulators had to scurry to find a buyer for the bank, 
according to Findley's September newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 Regulators seized the bank on Aug. 12 and sold $150 million in deposits and 
the bank's five branches to Union Bank for $1.7 million, a price that Findley 
calls "much higher than expected." 
</P>
<P>
 Union Bank has since closed four branches and is trying to renegotiate a lease 
on the Laguna Niguel location, which it would like to keep open, said 
spokeswoman Joanne C. Curran. Union Bank has been able to keep about 85% of the 
deposits, she said, mainly because the four branches closed are within blocks 
of existing Union Bank branches. 
</P>
<P>
 One branch lease that Union Bank didn't want to be stuck with, though, was for 
the Bank of Newport's main office in Corona del Mar. The rent there, the 
Findley newsletter says, "could choke a horse."

<P>
 The stock of Tokos Medical Corp. jumped $1.375 Thursday to close at $7.25 in 
trading on the NASDAQ market. 
</P>
<P>
 The 23% price increase was triggered by news that a unit of Fountain 
Valley-based FHP Healthcare cut costs in its neonatal intensive care operation 
by 34% after implementing a maternity risk management program designed by 
Tokos. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana company's program, used by FHP's Comprecare subsidiary in 
Colorado, provides prenatal education, risk screening and preventive measures 
for women with high-risk pregnancies.

O.C. MAN JOINS KIA'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS; MANAGEMENT: THE KOREAN AUTO MAKER'S 
ELEVATION OF U.S. OPERATIONS CHIEF W. GREG WARNER IS A FIRST IN THE ASIAN CAR 
INDUSTRY. JAPANESE FIRMS LIKELY WON'T FOLLOW SUIT, ANALYSTS SAY. 
</P>

<P>
 In a show of faith in its fledgling North American operation, Korean car maker 
Kia Motors Corp. today will appoint its U.S. operations chief to its board of 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
 W. Greg Warner, 51, becomes the first American executive of an Asian car 
company to sit on the corporate board, although Ford, Chrysler and General 
Motors all have executives who are directors of Japanese auto companies in 
which the big U.S. car makers have invested. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kia -- Korea's No. 2 car maker -- is the first of the 10 Asian auto 
companies with U.S. import and distribution units to reach into those 
subsidiaries' operational ranks for new blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Elevating its U.S. subsidiary's top American executives to the board is a good 
move for Kia, analysts said, but is unlikely to set off a round of similar 
appointments by companies like Toyota, Honda and Nissan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It might make some sense for all of them to do something like that, but I 
just can't see it starting a trend," said Chris Cedargren, an industry analyst 
with Santa Ana-based Auto-Pacific Group. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the reasons, Cedargren and other international specialists said, is 
that Japanese companies in particular have their own traditions for doing 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack G. Lewis, a management professor and director of the USC International 
Business Education and Research Program, called Warner's appointment 
"symbolically tremendous. Kia is respected in Korea for its efforts to manage 
its international operations well." But he said he reserves judgment on the 
effect that a single appointment will have on Kia specifically and the Asian 
auto industry overall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot imagine a large Japanese auto firm looking to a small young entry 
from Korea as a model," he said. "Boards in Japan typically don't have outside 
members." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the large Japanese car companies' U.S. subsidiaries also have their 
own boards of directors. Toyota Motor Corp.'s Torrance-based Toyota Motor Sales 
USA Inc., for example, has a 10-member board. A spokeswoman for the company 
said that group includes nine Japanese executives and one American, Toyota 
Motor Sales Executive Vice President Yale Giesel. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the eight Japanese car companies in the United States, five have appointed 
the presidents of their U.S. import and distribution subsidiaries to their 
boards -- but all five of those executives are Japanese nationals. 
</P>
<P>
 Tai K. Oh, a Cal State Fullerton management professor specializing in Asian 
corporate behavior and personnel management practices, said it is not 
surprising that it was a Korean company that made the first move to bring one 
of its American executives into the top policy ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is characteristic of Korean business," Oh said, "to need to stand out. . . 
. Japanese companies are subtle and like to accumulate strength without making 
a big splash, but Koreans tend to make a big splash first." 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese companies are also more cautious than Korean businesses about 
bringing people into their inner circles, he said. "Japanese companies take a 
long, long time to make such an appointment. They want to have made a long 
examination and holistic evaluation of the person." 
</P>
<P>
 Warner's three years with Kia make him an infant by Japanese corporate 
standards, Oh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Warner, a Southern California native and 22-year resident of Huntington 
Harbor, said he speaks only a few words of Korean but has had little trouble 
communicating with Korean executives, most of whom speak at least some English. 
And he makes it a rule, he said, "always to use translators, just to make 
sure." 
</P>
<P>
 Warner is a single parent who meshes his business schedule with the task of 
raising a 15-year-old daughter and a 12-year-old son. One of his passions is 
golf, and that has helped him to bond with executives in Seoul, where the sport 
is immensely popular. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Warner said the director's job will require him to travel to Korea four or 
five times a year for meetings. Scheduling conflicts with events in Kia's North 
American market will keep him from attending every board session, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to adding a Southern California perspective to board 
deliberations, Warner said, he has been told that he will be involved in the 
company's long-range strategic planning and worldwide product planning. 
</P>
<P>
 Those efforts are directed by the Kia senior management group, which makes up 
a sizable portion of the company's board. Warner becomes the 55th director and 
third non-Korean on the board, whose membership includes one executive from 
Japanese car maker Mazda Motors Corp. and one from Ford Motor Co. in Detroit. 
The two companies own small stakes in Kia. 
</P>
<P>
 Warner, who was told of the appointment several weeks ago, said in an 
interview that it was initiated by Kia officials in Korea, and that he had not 
been lobbying for the position. "It came as a pleasant surprise," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As chief operating officer of Kia Motors America Inc., Warner is the 
top-ranking American executive of the Irvine-based Korean car importer. The 
company's president, Hong Rae Park, also serves on the Seoul-based parent 
corporation's board. 
</P>
<P>
 Warner previously held several positions at Hyundai Motor America, the 
Fountain Valley import arm of Korea's largest car maker. He was chief of 
operations there in late 1989 when management at Hyundai Motor Corp. in Seoul 
swept out all of the subsidiary's top American executives after sales fell 
sharply from the record-setting pace the company established in 1986 and 1987. 
Analysts have blamed the late '80s sales slump on quality problems with Hyundai 
cars of that era, along with heightened competition from Japanese and American 
car companies in the low-priced niche that Hyundai had dominated since its U.S. 
introduction in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Warner has not been openly critical of his experiences with Hyundai, he 
and others have blamed that company's early troubles on the Korean parent's 
reluctance to take marketing and product design advice from non-Korean officers 
in its U.S. operation. 
</P>
<P>
 At Hyundai Motor America in Fountain Valley, President Dai Ok Chung is also a 
member of the board of directors of Hyundai Motor Corp. in Seoul, but chief 
operating officer N. Doug Mazza -- Warner's counterpart -- is not. 
</P>
<P>
 Warner, who worked as an independent consultant for more than a year before 
signing on with Kia, said in an interview then that he discussed the need for 
close communication between U.S. and Korean officials at great length before 
accepting the job. 
</P>
<P>
 A veteran of the auto industry in the United States, Warner began as a 
marketing analyst with Ford Motor Co. in 1968 after graduating from UCLA and 
obtaining a graduate business administration degree at USC. He worked in 
several executive posts at Toyota Motor Sales from 1971 until joining Hyundai 
in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he sees his appointment to Kia's board "as a positive example of how 
Kia has committed itself to becoming a truly global business." 
</P>
<P>
 Since it launched U.S. sales in February, Kia has opened 85 dealerships and 
sold nearly 8,000 cars. The company so far markets only one model, the 
four-door Sephia sedan, in the United States. In December it will introduce a 
compact sports utility vehicle, the Sportage. 
</P>
<P>
 Kia officials said Warner's appointment to the corporate board was in part a 
reward for his intensive 18-month effort to create an entire U.S. operation 
from scratch.

BRIEFCASE: FINANCE; NEW DIRECTOR OF FIRST AMERICAN WAS BEING WOOED BY RIVAL 
FIDELITY NATIONAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by James S. Granelli, Times staff writer

<P>
 It seemed like a perfunctory announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran Orange County businessman Frank O'Bryan recently became a director of 
First American Financial Corp., a company that has a board heavily laden with 
big players in real estate and other businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Santa Ana company, the nation's second-largest title insurance 
company, picked up a director whose business was being wooed by rival Fidelity 
National Financial Corp., which operates the nation's fifth-largest title 
carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Bryan, whose heads Spring Mountain Escrow Corp. in Newport Beach, said it 
was just happenstance, something that evolved from his longtime friendship with 
First American's chairman, Donald P. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was talking with Don about three weeks ago, and he says that I ought to be 
on his board," O'Bryan said. Next thing he knew, O'Bryan said, he received a 
letter saying he was being nominated as a director and asking him to attend a 
board meeting the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity's chairman, William P. Foley II, had discussions earlier this year 
with O'Bryan about the possibility of forming a business alliance. Companies 
involved in real estate transactions, such as lenders, escrow companies and 
title insurers, sometimes feed business to each other. 
</P>
<P>
 But nothing came of the talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I dropped the ball on that," Foley said. "I never followed up with O'Bryan. 
First American got a good man." Or as Frank P. Willey, Fidelity's general 
counsel, said: "I wish we would have thought of it first." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Bryan became the 15th member of a board that includes such real estate 
moguls as George L. Argyros, head of Arnel & Affiliates in Costa Mesa, and 
Anthony R. Moiso, head of the Santa Margarita Co. in San Juan Capistrano. Also 
on the board are Virginia Ueberroth, president of the Ueberroth Family 
Foundation, and James L. Doti, president of Chapman University in Orange.

REGULATORS SEEK $1 MILLION EACH FROM 2 BANKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal regulators are seeking $1 million each from former Anaheim bankers 
Gerald and Joan Garner for actions the regulators say led to the April, 1993, 
failure of American Commerce National Bank, according to legal documents 
obtained Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The civil penalty sought by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is 
in addition to the agency's effort to ban the Garners and five other directors 
and officers from the financial industry for life. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal agency, in an amended notice of charges, accuses the Garners of 
using the bank as their private piggy bank to obtain loans, high salaries and 
bonuses, other unwarranted benefits and favored banking treatment for companies 
in which they had interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald Garner, the bank's former chairman, broke his long public silence 
Thursday to question the adequacy of the case against him, his wife, who was a 
director and treasurer, and his brother, Daniel Garner, who was the bank's 
executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've reduced the accusations in the new notice almost in half," Garner 
said. "They withdrew the charges against the entire operations end of the bank. 
They settled out of court with the loan department with no penalty or fine. And 
they made a nominal settlement with most of the directors." 
</P>
<P>
 Agency papers, however, contend that, except for settlements with three 
directors and two officers and the dismissal of one case against an officer, 
the charges not only remain the same but have been augmented. 
</P>
<P>
 The new accusations against Garner, a disbarred lawyer, involve allegedly 
improper dealings between the bank and a law firm in which he had an interest 
and a bank loan to a physician used to pay off Garner's liability in a private 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the Garners, others still facing agency action are former directors 
Duffern Helsing, a Santa Ana lawyer, and Dr. Galal Gough and Dr. Stanley 
Kaller, who live in Orange County and work in Norwalk, and William Kavanagh, a 
senior lending officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The comptroller is seeking civil penalties of $500,000 from Daniel Garner, 
$250,000 from Helsing and $150,000 each from Gough and Kaller. It has not yet 
sought a penalty from Kavanagh. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing on the charges is scheduled for Jan. 18 before one of the agency's 
administrative law judges. It is expected to be held in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal takeover of American Commerce was the first under recent laws that 
allow regulators to close banks that are still solvent if they believe the 
operations to be unsafe and unsound. The bank appeared to be financially 
healthy, but regulators now say it was in debt. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the comptroller's action, the FBI has begun a criminal bank 
fraud and embezzlement investigation, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., 
which insures deposits and acts as the receiver for American Commerce, is 
conducting its own probe.

AURORA STOCK DROPS ON EARNINGS NEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shares of Aurora Electronics Inc. plummeted 19% Thursday on news that the 
Irvine computer service provider's latest quarterly results will fall below 
analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Shares fell $1.375, closing at $6 each in heavy trading on the American Stock 
Exchange.Company officials declined to comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a statement issued Thursday morning, the company said earnings for its 
fiscal 1994 fourth quarter, which ends Sept. 30, will be hurt by 
lower-than-expected sales and profit margins for its memory products and 
subsystems. Aurora said the latest generation of memory chips is being 
installed in products more slowly than it anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 Aurora said its integrated circuit recycling and maintenance parts 
distribution operations continue to perform in line with expectations 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Matheson, an analyst at Crowell, Weedon & Co. in Los Angeles, said 
Aurora's lower earnings may reflect the vulnerability of companies dependent on 
larger computer firms suffering in an industrywide slump. "Some of these 
service piggybackers can get whipsawed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Cerplex Group Inc., an Anaheim provider of electronic repair 
services, reported lower-than-expected earnings for its third quarter because 
of reduced work from IBM.

GINSBURG: BENCH NEEDS MORE WOMEN; LAW: LEADERSHIP IS NOT A MATTER OF GENDER, 
SHE TELLS STATE BAR IN HER FIRST SPEECH SINCE BECOMING SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICIA DI RADO and NANCY HSU, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In her first public speech since becoming a justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Thursday told a state conference of lawyers that more 
needs to be done to advance women through the judicial ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are still those who insist men have an edge in power positions . . . 
because men are more aggressive than women," Ginsburg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than a "ruthless tough guy," a good judge is someone who can mediate 
between opposing factions, and that is not dependent on a person's gender, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ginsburg spoke on the first day of the weekend-long annual meeting of the 
State Bar of California at the Anaheim Convention Center and Anaheim Hilton and 
Towers. 
</P>
<P>
 About 4,000 lawyers, judges and others interested in legal affairs are 
expected to attend the four-day conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Thursday, Marilyn Tucker Quayle, lawyer, author and wife of former 
Vice President Dan Quayle, spoke at the conference on national health care 
issues and legal ethics. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday night, Ginsburg, 61, focused on women's rights and advances. A former 
federal appeals court judge, Ginsburg became the second woman appointed to the 
highest court in the nation when President Clinton selected her in June, 1993.  
</P>
<P>
 "Women today make up close to a third of Clinton's nominees to the federal 
bench," she said. "Is it a critical mass? Not yet." 
</P>
<P>
 While she said she believes neither men nor women have a lock on any 
particular personality traits, women can bring certain concerns, including 
family leave time for parents, to their jobs if more of them climb the judicial 
ladder. 
</P>
<P>
 "These issues must become human issues, not just women's issues," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1973 to 1976, Ginsburg strongly advocated women's interests on the 
opposite side of the bench, arguing six women's rights cases before the Supreme 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
 When she directed the Women's Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties 
Union, Ginsburg tried to persuade justices that laws discriminating between men 
and women were based on stereotypes and were usually unconstitutional. She 
often fought for men's rights and represented men as plaintiffs, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her record as a women's rights champion, Ginsburg also has criticized 
some aspects of Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that declared women 
had a constitutional right to an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thursday's morning session, Marilyn Quayle touched on health care issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Quayle said she believes Clinton's plan for national health care reform never 
will be enacted and that she favors other, smaller-scale reforms. She said she 
expects the federal government eventually to privatize Medicaid and Medicare 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of her comments had to do with legal ethics and honesty. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't reflect right or wrong, then we should not be surprised when our 
young people think they can get away with anything," said Quayle, an 
Indianapolis lawyer.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have to remember what is legal may not be responsible," she warned other 
attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 During the remaining days of the conference, about 500 delegates of the state 
bar will meet and issue resolutions on several legal issues. Some of the 
resolutions they are considering would advocate: 
</P>
<P>
 * Adding provisions to the civil code that would allow the terminally ill to 
request the means to kill themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 * Making manufacturers and dealers of handguns and assault weapons liable for 
damages in certain situations involving violence that is linked to those 
weapons.

YOUNG AMERICANS; 1,000 IMMIGRANTS FROM 61 COUNTRIES ARE SWORN IN AS U.S. 
CITIZENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 It took more than a century, but Isabel Melendez finally fulfilled her 
lifelong dream of becoming a U.S. citizen Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 During a festive ceremony at the Sequoia Club, the 102-year-old Melendez, who 
first came to the United States in 1918, was among 1,000 immigrants from 61 
countries who took oaths as new citizens before U.S. District Judge Gary L. 
Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm proud to be an American," Melendez, a native of Durango, Mexico, who 
speaks only Spanish, said through her grandson, Alonzo Cardenas, as she emerged 
from the half-hour ceremony clutching a tiny American flag. "But at my age, I'm 
just waiting (for) what the Lord would do." 
</P>
<P>
 The English-language requirement of the citizenship test is waived for elderly 
residents such as Melendez if they have been permanent residents for at least 
15 years. But they still must pass oral tests in their native languages. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's first mass naturalization ceremony in nearly three years came 
at a time of growing sentiment against illegal immigrants in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187, a statewide initiative on the November ballot, would deny 
illegal immigrants and their children public education, non-emergency health 
care and social services. Polls show the measure has widespread support. 
</P>
<P>
 But many of those interviewed after the ceremony said the unfriendly climate 
had nothing to do with their desire to become U.S. citizens. They also said 
they want to make their voices heard on Election Day. Citizenship confers the 
right to vote and to run for public office, except the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 Patty Piroska Banyai took the oath to have "a country to call home." 
</P>
<P>
 "I did not know who I was," said Banyai, a Romanian of Hungarian ancestry who 
said she was discriminated against in her homeland. She came to the United 
States with her family in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can talk more freely now," she said, adding that she will register to vote 
immediately in order to be able to participate in the November election. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Ruiz and his wife, Paulina, both 69, left Spain for Canada in 1951 but 
have lived in Garden Grove since the early 1970s. Both were naturalized 
Thursday, and now "we can live here forever," Juan Ruiz said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he will vote against Proposition 187. "It's not justified," Ruiz said. 
Illegal immigrants "are already here, and they need help. They pay taxes too. 
What we need is to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in." 
</P>
<P>
 But Sahar Imanabadi, who came to the United States from Iran with her family 
in 1981, said illegal immigrants should not receive public assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should be denied those services," said Imanabadi, 18, a student at 
Irvine Valley College. "Other people came to the U.S. the right way, the legal 
way. They worked for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard K. Rogers, director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service's 
district office in Los Angeles, said that a naturalization ceremony in Orange 
County will be held at least every three months, so applicants will not have to 
make the trip to Los Angeles in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "Naturalization has become one of our priorities," Rogers said, adding that 
the INS citizenship branch interviews applicants throughout the year and 
expects to approve about 90,000 citizenship applications this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigrants are eligible for citizenship after five years of legal residence, 
three years if they are spouses of U.S. citizens. Aspiring citizens must show 
good moral character, pass a basic U.S. history and civics test and demonstrate 
a knowledge of English. 
</P>
<P>
 For some of those on the receiving end of the department's services, Thursday 
brought pure joy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the best day of my life," said Anna Lisa Ranson Denardo, a native of 
England who came to the United States on a student visa in 1979 and became a 
legal resident in the early 1980s. "I've waited for this all these years." 
</P>

WOMAN'S HUSBAND HELD IN ABUSE CASE; CRIME: EDWARD MEDINA OF ORANGE IS ACCUSED 
OF KNOWINGLY STANDING BY AND ALLOWING HIS WIFE TO BEAT THEIR 10-YEAR-OLD NEPHEW 
AND 9-YEAR-OLD SON.

<P>
 The husband of a woman charged with torturing her 10-year-old nephew was 
arrested Thursday on charges that he allowed the abuse of the boy and the 
couple's own 9-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Medina, 45, was arrested about 2 p.m. in the 800 block of West Walnut 
Avenue at the apartment he shared with Cynthia Medina, according to Orange 
Police Lt. Timm Browne. 
</P>
<P>
 Medina is accused of knowingly standing by while his wife abused their nephew 
and son, according to Deputy Dist. Atty. Charles J. Middleton. The son, 
Middleton said, was beaten with a baseball bat by Cynthia Medina. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple each face three counts of felony child abuse, each carrying a 
sentence of two to six years in prison. Cynthia Medina also faces a charge of 
torture, which can result in a sentence of seven years to life in prison.  
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say Cynthia Medina, 31, seared her nephew's tongue with hot 
knives, beat him with an electrical cord and anally penetrated him with a 
souvenir baseball bat as punishment when she found the boy playing with her 
marijuana cigarettes. The boy's internal injuries were so severe that he had to 
undergo a colostomy, although the operation later may be reversed. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the time I've been in the district attorney's office, this is one of the 
most involved physical abuse cases I've seen," Middleton said. "It's shocking 
even to me, a shocking example of extreme child abuse." 
</P>
<P>
 The boy remains in good condition at Children's Hospital of Orange County and 
is likely to be released early next week. County social service officials say 
he probably will be placed in a foster home or in Orangewood, the county 
facility for abused or neglected children, with his young cousin. 
</P>
<P>
 Cynthia Medina was caring for the boy after his mother -- her sister -- could 
no longer do so.  
</P>
<P>
 "She was the active person in all the child abuse," Middleton said. "He does 
not do anything when all this is occurring." 
</P>
<P>
 Charging the passive abuser is not rare, Middleton said. If the abuse "is 
clear-cut, it's not uncommon at all," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Edward Medina "knew what was going on and he failed to do something about it," 
Middleton said. The extent of the abuse in this case "cries out for reporting 
and protecting the child." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cynthia Medina, a former elementary school playground supervisor, admits 
abusing her nephew but also disputes some of the allegations against her, 
according to her attorney, Richard C. Gilbert. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert said his client insists the sexual assault on Sept. 7 was the result 
of a "freak accident" that occurred while she was striking the boy with the 
bat. He also said she might plead not guilty by reason of insanity. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert has accused prosecutors of "overcharging" his client and said the 
torture law is so vague and broad that the serious felony count could be filed 
in almost any abuse case. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said he believes prosecutors are charging Edward Medina in an attempt 
to make him testify against his wife.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think Mr. Medina is guilty of anything," Gilbert said. "I do think 
the reason we are seeing these charges is because the district attorney is 
concerned about proving some of the allegations. It's a tactic to try to 
improve his case by seeing if he can get Mr. Medina to cooperate." 
</P>
<P>
 Middleton denied that Edward Medina's arrest was a ploy to get him to testify 
against his wife. The abused boy told authorities he repeatedly cried out 
during the attack, "Tio, help me," but his uncle remained in another room 
watching television, according to court records. The boy told authorities his 
aunt ordered her husband to remain there because she did not want him to 
interfere with the punishment, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 Charging the couple with child abuse, in addition to the charge of torture 
against Cynthia Medina, is appropriate for "the active abuser and the passive 
adult who should have done something about it," Middleton said. "That person 
has an obligation to do something about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Social service officials who notified police of the abuse said they fully 
expected charges to be filed against the boy's uncle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't surprise me at all," said Gene Howard, director of Children's 
Services for the Orange County Social Services Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The Medinas are held in Orange County Jail. Cynthia Medina's bail is set at 
$100,000 and Edward Medina's at $25,000. He is scheduled to be arraigned 
Monday, and Cynthia Medina's arraignment is scheduled for Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Children's advocates called the Medina case a grim testament to the 
increasingly violent nature of child abuse complaints being filed in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 "Children are coming into Orangewood much more damaged and in pain than 10 
years ago," said Barbara Oliver, executive director of the Child Abuse Council 
of Orange County. "I think cases like this underline the need to work with the 
caretakers of children and teach them to deal with them in a nonviolent way." 
</P>
<P>
 Prof. Myrna S. Raeder, an expert on child abuse issues at Southwestern 
University School of Law in Los Angeles, said the law holds "silent 
participants or accomplices" equally responsible for the child's welfare as the 
abuser. Such a law is critical because children are so powerless, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Raeder said most cases involve a male abuser and a female silent accomplice. 
The woman usually is also abused by the man and fears for her life if she acts 
to protect the child, she said.

TALKS UNDERWAY ON PLAN FOR HEADLANDS; DEVELOPMENT: DANA POINT CONSERVATION 
GROUP AND LANDOWNERS ARE DISCUSSING THE SALE OF 21 OF THE 121 ACRES AND SCALING 
BACK THE $500-MILLION PROJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Private discussions are taking place that could save part of the 121-acre Dana 
Point Headlands from development and perhaps affect a bitter environmental 
fight over one of the most controversial projects in South County. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners of the property overlooking Dana Point Harbor and a local 
conservation group are discussing a plan to sell some of the land to the Dana 
Point Headlands Conservancy and scale back the $500-million development 
project, participants in the talks confirmed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservancy officials said a key element of the plan calls for their group to 
buy about nine acres of the most prominent, environmentally sensitive land at 
the tip of the peninsula, including the habitat of the endangered Pacific 
pocket mouse. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the conservancy would have a five-year option to buy an 
additional 12 acres, which is now the proposed location of a 400-room luxury 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 The landowner could then develop the residential portion of the project, 
currently proposed as 370 homes on property with sweeping views up and down the 
coast, conservancy officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two members of the fledgling Dana Point Headlands Conservancy said a 
representative of the landowners approached them to discuss the potential deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The property is for sale, all of it, in five sections . . . so it might as 
well be to the citizens of Dana Point," said Jacqueline Cain, a conservancy 
director. "That's the last remaining open space in Dana Point and if it's 
built, it's gone forever. It's irreplaceable." Another director, Ernest A. 
Nelson, said he is "optimistic" that the talks can lead to an agreement over 
the headlands. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started out not knowing what our chances would be to win an agreement with 
the landowners, but now (they're) talking," Nelson said. "It's still a long 
shot, but it can happen, it really can." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An appraisal on the nine acres at the tip of the peninsula is being obtained 
by the landowners, the Newport Beach-based M.H. Sherman Co. and the 
Pasadena-based Chandis Securities Co., a partnership that has owned the 
property since the 1940s. (Chandis Securities, a firm that oversees the 
financial holdings of the Chandler family, is a major stockholder in Times 
Mirror Co., publisher of the Los Angeles Times.) 
</P>
<P>
 Dan T. Daniels, president of M.H. Sherman Co., acknowledged the talks but 
stopped short of calling the discussions an effort toward compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had discussions with these folks and that's all we've done," Daniels 
said. "The conservancy has asked us for an option on a lot of the property. We 
are having an appraisal done to see if they are serious." 
</P>
<P>
 Approved last April by the Dana Point City Council, the project has been the 
target of protests by residents who claim the development is too extensive and 
will destroy one of the last major undeveloped coastal properties in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 The headlands peninsula was noted by New England author Richard Henry Dana in 
1835 in his book "Two Years Before the Mast." The city was named after Dana 
when it was subdivided in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
 The approved plan for the Headlands is the subject of two heated citywide 
November ballot measures that could force the council to rescind its approval 
of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservancy official Nelson said he met this week with aides for three South 
County legislators -- Assemblyman William Morrow (R-Oceanside), state Sen. 
William Craven (R-Oceanside) and state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) 
-- to outline the group's effort to obtain the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson and Cain said that because the headlands property contains habitat for 
endangered species such as the cactus wren and California gnatcatcher, federal 
funds are available to help buy the land. A citywide bond issue could be 
another potential source of purchase money, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson said there are no exact figures for the purchase, and little money has 
been raised so far. But the conservancy believes "we need to be able to 
generate $40 million to $50 million," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Money aside, conservancy officials said there are two keys to achieving a 
compromise: The property must be affordable and the City Council must accept 
the plan even though the 400-room luxury hotel would not be built. Conservancy 
officials say the council, with its eyes on the potential $2-million annual bed 
tax revenue the hotel would generate, is the driving force behind the hotel 
portion of the project, not the landowners. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was something the council wanted and something the resident supporters 
of the project were touting as the main benefit of this project," said 
Councilman William L. Ossenmacher, an opponent of the proposed development. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Karen Lloreda, one of the project's supporters, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a council person, one of my concerns has always been and continues to be 
revenues to the city," Lloreda said. "I don't have a problem with a scaled-down 
version of the hotel, but I believe there is valuable revenue available to the 
city from this headlands project and I would hate to see that disappear." 
</P>
<P>
 Lloreda added that the California Coastal Commission has insisted in the past 
that coastal development projects include facilities -- such as hotels -- that 
can be used by the general public. Simply providing open space has not been 
enough, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lloreda also said she believes there is still plenty of room for 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are three issues here: the property owners' needs, the city's needs and 
the people's needs," she said. "Perhaps the developer is going to have to give 
up a little bit of the housing (element of the plan). There is room for 
everybody to compromise here." Headlands Talks The Dana Point Headlands 
Conservacy is exploring the purchase of a prime portion of the 121-acre 
headlands property-currently marked for a 400-room luxury hotel, residential 
and commercial development. The deal would include an initial nine-acre plot 
with an option for 12 more acres.

 Old Natural Gas Plant Won't Play Any Part in New Regional Park 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council has rejected a proposal to save a portion of a natural gas 
processing plant as part of Bolsa Chica Regional Park. 
</P>
<P>
 A majority of the council Tuesday was opposed to preserving a portion of the 
compressor building and related equipment, such as tanks and boiler structures. 
</P>
<P>
 In presenting its plan for the park, the harbors, beaches and parks division 
of the county's Environmental Management Agency suggested incorporating 
selected elements of the gas processing plant as an educational and historical 
feature of the park. The site, near Seapoint Street and Garfield Avenue, has 
been operated as an industrial plant by Shell Onshore Ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Thomas, a senior landscape architect for the county, told the council 
that it is "an incredible opportunity to save a little piece of Huntington 
Beach history. It tells the story of oil and gas production." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert G. Fisher, county director of harbors, beaches and parks, said that in 
light of the council's unfavorable reaction the idea will not be pursued. He 
said an interpretive center planned for the park will probably contain 
information about oil and gas exploration in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Demolition of the structures is expected by year's end, Fisher said. Cleanup 
of the site to remove soil contaminants is scheduled for next year, Fisher 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Ralph Bauer said he was against the proposal because there is 
strong community support for a passive use park. "This represents a fairly 
non-passive use," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Grace Winchell favored the concept as a way to educate children 
about the city's past. "It would be nice to have something like this in an oil 
town," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Barbara Marrs of the Seacliff Coalition said the gas plant is an eyesore. 
"I don't see anything worth preserving to make it into a museum," she said.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LA PALMA; CODE ENFORCEMENT WORKSHOP SCHEDULED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has unanimously voted to sponsor a community workshop aimed 
at helping residents understand code enforcement. The workshop, free and open 
to everyone, will be held at 7 p.m. Nov. 2 at the Community Center, 7821 Walker 
St. 
</P>
<P>
 Code enforcement means implementing city laws regarding homes and property. 
City Manager Pamela Gibson said there are complex state laws that become 
intertwined with city code enforcement, and the public often does not 
understand the legal process. 
</P>
<P>
 A common example, Gibson said, is a resident's complaint about unattended 
grass at a foreclosed residential property. The solution -- mowing the grass -- 
seems simple, but laws make it tough to get that accomplished, Gibson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes the house about which people are complaining is in the process of 
foreclosure," Gibson said. "The owner has gone, and the bank is in the process 
of acquiring the property, but does not yet own it." 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson said that in such cases, city government must launch a time-consuming 
process of putting out a legal weed-abatement notice. State law requires 
posting notices on the property and bringing the matter to the City Council for 
a vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frequently by the time we go through the process, a new owner has taken over 
the property, and it solves itself because the new owner mows the grass," 
Gibson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city manager said that residents often become frustrated with the code 
enforcement process. They do not know the legal restraints placed on the city, 
she said. The Nov. 2 workshop will help explain the process and also seek 
suggestions from residents about how the system might be improved, Gibson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson will conduct the workshop, assisted by the city attorney and the city's 
director of building and safety. BILL BILLITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 County property tax revenue is expected to increase by $16.9 million this 
year, according to the treasurer-tax collector's office, which this week mailed 
out 733,000 tax bills. 
</P>
<P>
 The projected revenue increase comes even though the county assessor's office 
recently decreased the value of properties in the county by a total of $16 
million, according to Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron estimated that his office will collect $1.9 billion in property taxes 
this fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 The expected revenue increase is attributed in part to the Santa Margarita 
Water District's decision to process its tax collections through the county.  
</P>
<P>
 Because of this change, the county will see a $22-million increase in revenue 
collections this year, Citron said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first installment of property taxes is due Dec. 12. The second installment 
is due April 10, 1995. If property owners do not receive a tax bill by Oct. 7, 
they should call the collector's office at (714) 834-4311. SHELBY GRAD

<P>
 The Placentia City Council has approved a $69,333 expenditure for Mobile Data 
Terminals for the city's 15 police patrol cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The dashboard-mounted computer keyboards and display screens are touted as a 
way to improve officer safety by keeping radio calls off the airwaves, where 
they can be intercepted by anyone monitoring the Police Department's radio 
frequencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The terminals also will let officers check for warrants and stolen car 
information before stopping a car, saving time and alerting the officer to 
potential criminal drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Police Chief Manuel Ortega, neighboring cities that have 
installed the terminals are able to recover more stolen autos and arrest more 
wanted suspects by avoiding the verbal broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
 The system will enable officers in the patrol cars to communicate with 
colleagues at other locations and with police dispatchers through computer 
messages similar to e-mail. They will also be able to write reports in the 
field, saving transcription time and keeping more officers on the street.HOLLY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; BID TO EVICT FAMILY FROM UNFINISHED HOME REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An Orange County Superior Court judge Thursday afternoon refused the city's 
request to evict Haym and Fern Ganish from their Kron Street home, saying the 
legal process begun by the city to demolish their three-story, castle-like 
house must run its course. 
</P>
<P>
 Haym Ganish, a 52-year-old retired engineer, and city officials have been at 
odds for a dozen years over the start-and-stop remodeling of his stone-covered 
home into what some neighbors have dubbed the "Kron Street Castle."Haym and 
Fern Ganish live in the home with their three children. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Nancy Wieben Stock said she was making a "liberal 
allowance" for the Ganish family because legal proceedings are still in the 
early stages.  
</P>
<P>
 They will return to court on Nov. 9 to set a trial date. Ganish has mounted a 
constitutional challenge against the city ordinance used to justify demolishing 
the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Patrick Munoz, representing the city Thursday, said the Ganish family 
should be evicted from the house for their own safety.  
</P>
<P>
 City officials allege numerous state safety-code violations at the house, 
including exposed wiring and structural deficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The place is incredibly dangerous," Munoz said. "If there's an earthquake, it 
is very likely to collapse. If there's a fire, it's likely to take out the 
entire neighborhood. We're simply trying to make sure the entire neighborhood 
is protected the best that we can." 
</P>
<P>
 But the family's attorney, Robert Sainburg, denied there are any safety-code 
violations. He said the motivation of city officials is to enforce the 
uniformity of the master-planned community. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is their dream house," Sainburg said of the Ganish family. "The city has 
been basically trampling over their rights because some of the neighbors have 
complained that the way it looks is not in conformity to the neighborhood."

icons of macho Americana and patriotism, keeping them wrapped in the original 
packaging. 
</P>
<P>
 Lane, 25, has a wall in his Westminster home adorned with unopened packages of 
G.I. Joe action figures from countries around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "You wouldn't want to open them," he said. "The packaging is unique and the 
investment value" is very high. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelves in the room are also adorned with more than 50 of Lane's favorite 
action figures, all unwrapped. 
</P>
<P>
 Lane has been fascinated by G.I. Joe, made by Hasbro Inc., since he was 12. He 
also collects the newer, 3 3/4-inch figures, which came on the market in 1982. 
The original, larger G.I. Joe -- the first action figure for boys -- was born 
in August, 1964. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Lane, a camera operator and college student, has collected 
more than 1,000 G.I. Joe action figures. Most are tucked away in storage. He 
favors the smaller figures because of their detail, individual identities and 
stylized accessories. 
</P>
<P>
 Lane said the newer figure has captured the attention of an army of men -- and 
women -- many of whom who grew up in the 1980s. "It was a whole different 
market. It's an '80s-generation toy line." 
</P>
<P>
 For those who want to share their appreciation for the toy, Lane founded the 
Steel Brigade Club in 1988. The club has more than 800 male and female members 
worldwide who share the passion and exchange G.I. Joe information. 
</P>
<P>
 Lane said this year may be the end of an era for 3 3/4-inch figures. The toy 
company plans to introduce a five-inch figure next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of sad," he said, adding that the club has been circulating a 
petition asking the company to re-enlist the 3 3/4-inch figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Lane said the discontinued line won't stop him from collecting the smaller 
figure. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's in my blood now," he said. "It's nostalgic. It's like being a part of 
history. G.I. Joe has been one of the most popular-selling boys' toys, and 
having a collection makes you be a part of that." DEBRA CANO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; 2 SCHOOL CANDIDATES QUIT, SUPPORT OTHERS

<P>
 Two candidates among a crowded field vying for seats on the Saddleback Valley 
Unified School District Board have decided not to run and have pitched their 
support behind a pair of other hopefuls. 
</P>
<P>
 Arleen Brown and Kathy Kirlin announced Wednesday that they will pull out of 
the race and campaign for Sandie Gonzales and Pamela S. Rush. 
</P>
<P>
 The move trims to eight the number of candidates seeking two seats in the 
district of 29,000 students. It serves Lake Forest, Laguna Hills, Trabuco 
Canyon, Portola Hills and parts of Mission Viejo and Rancho Santa Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
 Two incumbents, Dore J. Gilbert and Bobbee Cline, are running for reelection, 
and announced a joint campaign in late July. 
</P>
<P>
 The November election could turn into a potential three-way battle of tandem 
candidacies seeking to control the balance of power on the fractured board. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other candidates, with a more conservative agenda, are considering whether 
to campaign as a team.  
</P>
<P>
 Dave Schultz said Thursday that he and Pat Soriano have talked about running 
together as a way to capture more votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Schultz and Soriano have been labeled by opponents as advocates for positions 
favored by the religious right. But Schultz downplayed religious beliefs and 
said that such labels are misleading. 
</P>
<P>
 The two remaining candidates in the race, Williams (Bill) J. Goodwin and Susan 
Krumpotich, also have been labeled conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Schultz said he and Soriano would probably benefit by running in tandem if 
Goodwin and Krumpotich pulled out of the race but said he didn't see the field 
shrinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Krumpotich said Thursday that she is not quitting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bill and I are the best candidates out there," Krumpotich said. Goodwin could 
not be reached for comment. JEFF BEAN

<P>
 The City Council has endorsed Proposition 187, the statewide initiative on the 
November ballot that would deny illegal immigrants public education, 
non-emergency health care and other services. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tuesday's 3-0 vote included two abstentions, as council members debated 
whether to take a position right away or study the initiative further before 
taking a stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Ho Chung and Robert F. Dinsen abstained. 
</P>
<P>
 Chung said he was uncomfortable with denying health care to anybody, and 
Dinsen wanted to know how the Police Department would be affected if the the 
measure passed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have waited too long for (something like) Proposition 187," said 
Councilman Mark Leyes, who joined Mayor Frank Kessler and Councilman Bruce A. 
Broadwater in supporting the ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that, if the measure passes, it would deter illegal immigrants from 
coming to the city and prevent Third World diseases, such as the recent 
outbreak of tuberculosis in one of the city's high schools. BERT ELJERA

<P>
 Councilman Bruce A. Broadwater sat stoically during this week's City Council 
meeting as speaker after speaker demanded that he resign. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayoral candidate Al Snook led the call for Broadwater's resignation over an 
incident this week in which one of Broadwater's children was accused of taking 
down Snook's campaign signs near the Broadwater home on Brookhaven Park.Police 
are investigating the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't condone this much longer," said Snook, who is going up against 
Broadwater and three other candidates for mayor in the Nov. 8 election. "This 
is a blemish on the city." 
</P>
<P>
 But while publicly apologizing, Broadwater said he wouldn't resign and charged 
that Snook and his supporters are blowing the incident out of proportion. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a political put-on," he said of the calls for him to resign. "Snook 
can't deal with real issues, such as the budget and labor negotiations. He has 
manufactured an issue, that's what he has done." 
</P>
<P>
 Police Lt. Stu Finkelstein said Wednesday that the investigation into the 
incident is being completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Vandalizing campaign signs is considered malicious mischief, which is a 
misdemeanor, Finkelstein said.BERT ELJERA

<P>
 It will soon be illegal for panhandlers, vendors and other people to loiter on 
street medians in the city. But police will not be issuing citations right 
away, Police Chief James E. Oman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, officers will distribute leaflets explaining the new law in hope that 
violators will be persuaded to get out of the street. If they don't, a $100 
fine can be imposed for the first violation. A second offense within a year is 
punishable by a $200 fine, and a $500 fine could be levied for the third and 
subsequent violations. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law received final approval on a 4-0 vote by the City Council on 
Tuesday and goes into effect 30 days later. Councilwoman Kathryn E. Wiser was 
absent when the vote was taken. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Frank Benest said the measure was drafted in response to a 
"proliferation of vendors and panhandlers" occupying center medians and 
creating safety hazards for pedestrians and motorists. ALAN EYERLY

POLICE FOIL BREAK-IN AT STORAGE FACILITY; 3 MEN ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three Huntington Beach men were arrested and $10,000 in stolen goods recovered 
after authorities foiled a break-in at a Fountain Valley storage facility, 
police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said the goods -- stereo equipment, videocassette recorders, 
tools, cameras and cellular telephones -- were stolen during break-ins in 
Fountain Valley and Huntington Beach since last December. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley Police Sgt. Dann Bean said police on Monday caught two men 
breaking into lockers at a Newhope Street storage facility and putting the 
stolen items into their own rented locker there. Bean said the men were cutting 
the locks on the storage lockers. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested Scott Anderson, 21, and Martin Calloway, 19, at the facility, 
Bean said. The pair shared their rented locker with Matthew Maynard, 22, who 
was arrested later at his home, where police found other stolen property, Bean 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 All three have been booked into Orange County Jail on suspicion of burglary 
and held on $25,000 bail, Bean said.

MAN HELD ON SUSPICION OF MOLESTING GIRL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The operator of an after-school day-care center was arrested Thursday on 
suspicion of sexually fondling an 11-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Le Darrel Lane Martin, 41, who operates "Larry's Camp" on Esplanade, was 
arrested by members of the Orange County Sheriff's Department Sex Crimes 
Unit.He is being held in County Jail on $25,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, sheriff's investigators were notified by the Orange County 
Social Services Agency that one incident involving the girl may have taken 
place at the day-care center at Martin's residence in February or March, 
according to Lt. Dan Martini. 
</P>
<P>
 A second incident, involving the same girl, may have taken place in Oceanside, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After interviewing the girl, police arrested Martin and contacted Oceanside 
police. The investigation is continuing, Martini said, and anyone with 
information regarding additional victims is asked to contact the Sheriff's 
Department.

DESTINATION: DISCOVERY; TRADITIONAL TOURS SHOW YOU ALL THAT GLITTERS. BUT NEW 
SIGHTSEEING VENTURES LET YOU SEE -- AND TASTE -- OTHER PARTS OF L.A. IN HOPES 
OF ERASING BORDERS AND EASING FEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNELL GEORGE, LOS ANGELES TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles is a city of borders, of hard-drawn boundaries. It is a city whose 
expanse both daunts and amazes longtime residents and first-time visitors 
alike. 
</P>
<P>
 Although one of the most photographed, discussed and eagerly glimpsed 
destinations, L.A. is probably one of the most misunderstood. 
</P>
<P>
 It's just part of why, at the twilight of summer vacation, Jan Lebow has 
assembled a couple dozen students and curious others in an alley behind UCLA's 
International Student Center on Galey Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Reading off a roll call studded with names from distant, disparate places -- 
Israel, Spain, Iran, Japan, Thailand -- Lebow then shepherds her crew away from 
the familiar Westwood campus. They pile into a bus painted Bruin blue and gold, 
and head off toward the concrete mesh of freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our first stop," Lebow shouts over the roar of the engine, "is First A.M.E. . 
. . Now read your notes." She waves the red-and-green photocopied handouts 
above her head for illustration. 
</P>
<P>
 Lebow's project, Discover L.A.! is just one strategy the International Student 
Center uses to help acclimate students to their new environs by alleviating 
deeply entrenched fears, often the product of myth and misinformation. 
</P>
<P>
 Although glitz-and-glamour city tours abound, disgruntled Angelenos who have 
grown weary of over-the-top media depictions of their neighborhoods have taken 
to explicating the city on their own terms. Lebow and others see tours as a way 
to create bridges and blur borders. 
</P>
<P>
 As the bus pushes southward, Lebow jumps up from her seat, her body swaying in 
rhythm with the pitching vehicle. Without the aid of a microphone, her strong 
voice shades the picture. 
</P>
<P>
 "OK, you guys, this is Western Avenue. . . . It reflects the diversity of Los 
Angeles. It's a stopping-off point for newly arriving immigrants to Los 
Angeles. So it changes every year." 
</P>
<P>
 "Is this the heart?" asks one student taking in the stretch of beauty shops, 
storefront churches and boarded-up facades. 
</P>
<P>
 But before Lebow can answer, the bus takes the curve of Harvard Boulevard. The 
street opens up onto sprays of flowers, strips of green, rambling California 
Craftsman homes, trees, birds -- no danger, no nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 What they will learn by tour's end, Lebow hopes, is that what people call 
"South-Central" is made up of many hearts, many essential organs, all 
interconnected and alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Lebow, the center's community relations director, says she was inspired to 
launch the project last year after reviewing concerns voiced by newly arrived 
students during focus groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was upset by the stereotypes. Particularly those about Latinos and African 
Americans," Lebow says. "They were not based on personal experience, but what 
they saw in the media. Particularly after the (1992) uprising." 
</P>
<P>
 The all-too-familiar media image loop of L.A.'s violent, drug-dealing youth 
has cast a long, menacing shadow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not every black and/or Latino teen-ager is a gang-banger, not everyone is a 
drug abuser," says Lebow, who endeavors to project a more complete picture. "It 
would be really nice to have a firsthand experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Not your typical air-conditioned coach tour gliding along the strand or 
looping around the wooded cul-de-sacs of the city's tonier foothills. Instead, 
these tours are the center's attempt to reveal the substance of a city that to 
outsiders is often mostly mirage. 
</P>
<P>
 Bypassed segments of the city -- neighborhoods too often thought to be 
blemishes -- are the focus of Lebow's journey. She throws some sunlight on the 
"secrets" of East L.A., breaks down the mythic monolith of South-Central and, 
for an eye-opening look at the quickly altering terrain, takes a leisurely 
sweep down the entire length of Sunset Boulevard -- from the sea to the 
red-tiled spire of Downtown's Union Station. 
</P>
<P>
 The hope is to move students out of Westwood and Westside environs and into 
awareness. Sometimes there is resistance, Lebow admits: "People accusing us of 
social engineering." But in these still-tense and awkward times of 
polarization, sometimes only the non-organic approach can truly break down the 
barriers. 
</P>
<P>
 For every step forward, however, something seems to happen to set the efforts 
two steps back. The recent murders of two Japanese students in a supermarket 
parking lot in San Pedro ignited fiery headlines across Japan, fanning already 
acute fears about the United States, and Los Angeles in particular. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of late, touring L.A. to glimpse not just its much-touted surface glamour but 
its rich cultural mix has become a way to break through negative perceptions 
about communities of color. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, the economic-development group Operation HOPE hosted its second 
annual Banker's Bus Tour of the Compton, Crenshaw, Lynwood and 
Watts-Willowbrook areas to encourage investment in these neglected 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 During the World Cup soccer tournament, the L.A. Tourism Industry Development 
Council sponsored tours of South-Central, East L.A., Koreatown/Pico-Union and 
the easterly reaches of Hollywood for international journalists, consulate 
officials and even curious locals. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were a big success," says project coordinator Billi Romain, noting that 
103 people took part. "One of the things we didn't want to say is that these 
communities were great and had no problems. But we wanted to introduce them to 
people in those communities who are organized to empower themselves and improve 
their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Not to stray too far from its main mission of developing an equitable citywide 
tourism policy, the Development Council is encouraging residents to create 
their own community tours. Among the potential benefits: tourist dollars for 
the host neighborhoods and increased understanding for those who come. 
</P>
<P>
 These non-traditional tours are a constructive way to rebut the intense media 
magnification of L.A.'s problems over the past few years. They are less trend 
than long-awaited antidote. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's International Student Center, which has served the student body for 40 
years, sees the tours as just another way to stitch together the vibrant 
swatches that represent this city. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 150 volunteers -- students, families and "international advisers" -- 
share everything from their homes to conversational English skills. The only 
prerequisite, center director Larry Gower says: "Just an interest in the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 More important than seeing the sights is face-to-face interaction. And the 
larger goal, Gower says, is to inspire twofold enrichment. "The students 
saying: 'I really do have a good feel for Leimert Park' or Glendale or wherever 
it happens to be. And participants saying: 'I really understand India in a way 
that I would have never understood.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At First African Methodist Episcopal Church, the Rev. Leonard Jackson welcomes 
the assembly underneath a vibrant mural that depicts a timeline of the African 
American experience in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fine to quote Scripture," says Jackson, explaining the role of the 
modern black church, "but you have to be able to put flesh on that word." 
</P>
<P>
 From First A.M.E., Lebow moves her brood through black Los Angeles' 
residential and business districts. After the stucco homes painted in pastels 
pass by in a blur, one student admits: "When we were driving through 
South-Central, I thought, 'Wow, this looks like anywhere.' " 
</P>
<P>
 There is a stop at the Los Angeles Sentinel, the largest black-owned newspaper 
in the West, and lunch of shared histories over fried chicken, collard greens, 
candied yams and corn bread at Dulan's Restaurant. The afternoon segment begins 
with a stop at the Community Youth Sports & Arts Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a small little place," explains its director, Chilton Alphonse, as he 
takes them through the classrooms, living quarters and weight-training space 
out back. "So we can't help the world." Still, neighborhood kids come here to 
sit in on parenting classes, learn entrepreneurial skills and work toward high 
school equivalency degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 And the day concludes with a pause at Leimert Park -- to stroll around the 
galleries and gift shops, and to learn, from shop owner Brian Breye and his 
Museum in Black, a little bit about the African and then the African's American 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 The pause over lunch provides the space for discussion, comparison. A Thai 
woman picks up a bottle of Southern pepper sauce and smiles at the familiarity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very fortunate to be able to be here for this," says Nava 
Sornenschein, a therapist from Israel, cutting through her fried chicken with a 
fork and knife. "We knew about the violence. Before I got here I thought we 
would have to be more careful. When we saw this movie, 'Boyz N the Hood,' you 
get the impression that (the black community) was just slums. We expected to 
see horrible slums," she recalls, "but when I got here I was surprised." 
</P>
<P>
 Sornenschein believes there is a desperate need for many more tours like this. 
"Not just for students . . . but for people who live right here. People should 
have more encounters. It is something that you can't get from reading." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's Lebow's way of taking a chisel to walls. She was lucky, because her 
borders dissolved quite early. A native, Lebow, 34, spent her formative years 
in public schools, taking advantage of L.A.'s mix. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been involved with the black community since junior high," says Lebow, 
who is white, with glinting green eyes and curly close-cropped hair. "And I've 
always felt comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 In seventh grade, Lebow made a friend named Kim. "She came over my house and I 
had on KHJ (radio) -- what all the white kids were listening to. So she changed 
the station to KGFJ," Lebow recalls with a raspy laugh, "what the black kids 
were listening to." 
</P>
<P>
 From there her circle shifted. "She introduced me to her friends, the parties. 
Pretty soon," she recalls, "it was all KGFJ after awhile. It was a complete 
immersion." 
</P>
<P>
 Lebow is a realist. She knows it isn't that easy for everyone. Nor can you 
dismiss the fears. She uses an example of a young South Korean man who sat 
silent and trembling as the group made its way to last year's African 
Marketplace street festival. But by trip's end, Lebow remembers, "His head was 
bobbing to the rhythms and he was smiling." 
</P>
<P>
 Direct contact is the antidote for fear. Says Lebow: "Fears are not based on 
reality, (but) based on not knowing." But she also knows that one trip will not 
eclipse years of potent media images or vivid rumor. "One day is not going to 
do it. It is a starting point." 
</P>
<P>
 Although there has been talk of including other excursions through other 
cultures, "I'm most interested in the black and Latino communities," Lebow 
says. "That's what we are fighting tooth and nail. . . . These are the 
communities that are maligned and libeled and slandered -- mostly, and I'm sick 
of it. It's kind of a personal crusade." 
</P>
<P>
 The International Student Center's Gower sees the program as a way to do some 
twofold good. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year in Italy, the most-watched program was a soap called the 'Bold and 
the Beautiful.' And students came expecting that," he explains. 
</P>

THE POSITIVELY WONDERFUL LIFE AND TIMES OF BARBARA BUSH; BOOKS: WHAT, YOU 
EXPECTED THE FORMER FIRST LADY TO REVEAL FAMILY SECRETS? THAT'S JUST NOT HER 
STYLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Wonderful, wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
 To hear Barbara Bush tell it, Rye, N.Y., was a wonderful place to grow up. Her 
mother was a wonderful gardener. Her family took all their meals together, a 
wonderful tradition. Until she met George Bush, she had never met anyone quite 
as wonderful as her own father. 
</P>
<P>
 Their courtship was wonderful, especially the visit to Walker's Point in 
Maine, where one day she would bring her own wonderful family. Her future 
mother-in-law was wonderful. Their first dog as newlyweds, a poodle named 
Turbo, was wonderful. Their adventures as young marrieds in Odessa, Tex., were 
wonderful. Christmas was wonderful. The teachers who helped her son Neil with 
his reading problems were wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctors who delivered her children were wonderful. So were the kids' 
baby-sitters. The house they settled into when George Bush came to Washington 
as a congressman was wonderful. The house they moved into when he became 
President was even more wonderful. In fact, life has been so . . . well . . . 
wonderful that Lisa Drew, editor of "Barbara Bush: A Memoir" (Scribner's, 
1994), restricted her to one wonderful per page. 
</P>
<P>
 Bush managed to work around this constraint by dousing her readers in a 
532-page waterfall of pure sugar. Life for Barbara Bush is not only wonderful, 
it turns out, it is also precious, lovely, charming, delightful, marvelous, 
extraordinary, heavenly and -- if you happen to be among her seemingly infinite 
circle of friends -- dear, darling, precious, delightful, lovely, marvelous, 
charming and often adorable. 
</P>
<P>
 None of which seems faintly hyperbolic, the former First Lady said in an 
interview here to promote her latest literary undertaking. Writing the book, 
poring through a lifetime of diaries that devote equal depth to diplomacy and 
to daily domestic details "made me think," she said. "It reminded me that I 
really have been the world's luckiest woman." 
</P>
<P>
 Lucky, she said, throwing a nod to the fates who sent her -- at a Christmas 
vacation dance in Greenwich, Conn., when she was 16 -- a "wonderful-looking 
young boy" with the endearing nickname of "Poppy" Bush. Lucky, definitely -- 
but also privileged. "Privilege of every kind," she writes, right from Day One, 
right from the very earliest moments of a childhood that saw her surrounded by 
chums named Posy and Wease, Prissy and Pen. 
</P>
<P>
 But life was not entirely white gloves and debutante balls. The summer between 
Ashley Hall -- the boarding school the young Barbara Pierce attended in 
Charleston, S.C. -- and Smith College, she appalled her mother by taking a job 
in a nuts-and-bolts factory. At Smith, already besotted with love for Poppy 
Bush, she rebuffed blind dates and was pegged as a lesbian. As a new bride, her 
landlady laughed when she shrank all her silk underwear. Tired of playing 
bridge and hanging out with "some of George's more frivolous friends" while her 
husband was at Yale, she signed up to take a course. It was known as Pots & 
Pans. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came genuine adversity. Pauline Robinson Bush was 3 when what her mother 
thought was spring fever turned out to be leukemia. Numb with grief, Mrs. Bush 
played golf the day after little Robin's death -- and failed to mention the 
event to a friend she encountered in the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with her undyed white hair and her triple strand of unmistakably fake 
pearls -- "Can you imagine what real ones would cost?" she asked, aghast -- 
that kind of buttoned-up quality came to be associated with Barbara Bush, 
fearsomely perfect political wife. She raised children, she bred dogs, she 
embraced safe causes and -- in public, at least -- she almost never 
contradicted her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 But this description makes Mrs. Bush bristle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never felt buttoned-up. I never was told what to say," she said, 
indignation creeping into her voice. "Sometimes I wish I had been." 
</P>
<P>
 She flared briefly to point out that Americans do expect more of a First Lady 
than a woman who stands by her man -- and keeps her mouth shut. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess you don't remember Eleanor Roosevelt," she said, too refined to sound 
snappish. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the ideal public servant's spouse, in Mrs. Bush's view, is Denis 
Thatcher, who stood by quietly in the shadow of his wife's position and 
legendary head-wear. 
</P>
<P>
 "If your husband or wife runs for office, you would expect to show them the 
courtesy that you hope they would show to you if you ran. If I ran for office 
and George and I disagreed on something" -- an unlikely possibility, she 
conceded -- "I would think, 'What's he doing, speaking up?' 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just the exact same way you raise your children," she said. "You might 
not agree on something, but we always tried to show a united front for the 
children. We might talk about it in the bedroom, and then come out and be Mom 
and Pop. Otherwise, you're just confusing the world. Who cares what the 
unelected person thinks?" 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, she added, "I wouldn't have any big disagreements with George 
Bush" -- when she refers to her husband, it sounds like one name, Georgebush -- 
"but boy, do people try to find you sort of disagreeing and all that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In that context, the notion that Barbara Bush might have opinions that 
deviated from her husband's -- the suggestion that maybe she had some sort of 
closet emotional life -- sent wags spinning when her "Memoir" came out. Whoops 
-- there it was, proof Mrs. Bush thinks that -- in most cases -- abortion is a 
matter of personal choice. (George Bush, it will be remembered, campaigned as a 
defender of fetal rights.) And for the first time, she revealed that in the mid 
1970s, while in the midst of menopause, she battled depression. 
</P>
<P>
 "Night after night, George held me, weeping in his arms while I tried to 
explain my feelings," she writes, noting that she never sought professional 
help for her problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "I almost wonder why he didn't leave me. I knew it was wrong, but couldn't 
seem to pull out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 To her legion of close, dear, darling friends, such vulnerability came as no 
surprise. Nor did the arch politeness that colors Mrs. Bush's recollections of 
many political opponents -- and even some confreres. Richard Nixon, for 
example, may have been a great President, but "he did not make it easy to like 
him." And Bill Clinton delivered a perfectly decent inaugural speech. It 
sounded just like John F. Kennedy's, "but not quite as eloquent." 
</P>
<P>
 When someone earns her enmity or her annoyance, she takes digs that leave no 
visible wounds -- but afterward, smart sharply. Often, she veils her harsh 
judgments in an icy kind of whimsy. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the Barbara Bush humor that occasionally shows through," said Sheila 
Tate, a press adviser in the Reagan and Bush White Houses. "She can be a little 
on the wicked side." 
</P>
<P>
 But she is not above turning that mischievous streak on herself. Her book 
teems with examples of her well-intentioned -- if often misplaced -- naivete. 
Far from being too embarrassed to admit it, she laughs at the fact that during 
her husband's ambassadorship to China, her command of the language consisted 
mainly of persuading the inhabitants of a dogless country that C. Fred, the 
family pooch, was not a cat. 
</P>
<P>
 And since neither she nor her husband could read Chinese characters, they were 
unconcerned by propaganda posters with messages like "Beware of the Imperialist 
dogs who invaded Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
 With their calligraphy, "the signs looked rather pretty to us," she 
remembered. 
</P>
<P>
 She can also be blunt. Sifting through applications for her White House press 
secretary, she came upon the name of Anna Perez. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hurrah," cheered Mrs. Bush. "A Hispanic." 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that Perez is actually African American; she got the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see," said Perez, who now works for the Creative Artists Agency in Los 
Angeles, "she's always so direct." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 These days, her straight talk is often directed at her 13 grandchildren. Giant 
family lunches are a ritual of the Bush clan, both in Houston and at the 
compound on the coast of Maine. Recently, she recounted with a certain clear 
delight, "I did shock my children by talking to some of the sub-teen-agers and 
teen-agers about sex." When the subject was broached, the 69-year-old, 
white-haired grandmother jumped right in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard one of my children say, 'Mother' " -- and she mimicked the most 
mortified tone she could muster -- " 'they don't know about that!' " Bush 
looked her offspring straight in the eye. "I said, 'they do too.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Now had that same conversation dared to take place in her own childhood, "my 
mother would have left the room," she said. "And I would never have talked to 
my kids like that." 
</P>
<P>
 But when it comes to handing out advice, she observed, grandparents often have 
a license that lets them skip a generation. The grandkids actually listen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyway," Mrs. Bush reflected, "times have changed." 
</P>
<P>
 That quiet understatement might be as much of a reason as any to commit her 
own experiences to the printed page. In steady succession, the First Ladies of 
recent decades have penned their autobiographies, offering their own personal 
views of American public life. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Nancy Reagan, Bush's immediate predecessor, went so far as to title her 
book "My Turn" and to spout venom like a geyser, Barbara Bush had little 
interest in venting. There wasn't much record to set straight, after all, since 
she and her husband agreed on just about everything. 
</P>
<P>
 So why on Earth would she hammer out all those adjectives? Why dwell on her 
depression, or the sadness of her daughter's death? Why suffer through 
promotional interviews in 12 cities -- and signings in some of America's 
lesser-known shopping malls? 
</P>
<P>
 Surely it could not have been the money that motivated her? 
</P>
<P>
 Here comes her well-honed candor: 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes." 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that days after her husband lost the election, their attorney sat her 
down for a tough talk about finances. She'd given away all the money from her 
earlier books, "C. Fred's Story" and "Millie's Book." (Now it can be told: She 
did not act solely as secretary to her pets. She actually wrote both 
best-selling books, then donated the proceeds to charity.) 
</P>
<P>
 Her lawyer warned that because of her work in the literacy movement, and 
because of her popularity, she would continue to be besieged with 
correspondence when the family left Washington. Fine, she shrugged. She'd let 
her husband's office handle it. No dice, said the lawyer. The office of the 
former President cannot touch one piece of paper pertaining to the former First 
Lady. 
</P>
<P>
 "So we got to figuring out how we would pay for all this," Mrs. Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
 She fulfilled every writer's ongoing fantasy of pulling in a gigantic advance 
with no sample chapter, no outline and no literary agent. 
</P>
<P>
 "The offers were so grand, I just couldn't say no," she explained. She smiled 
broadly, revealing once again that she is much prettier in person than in the 
pictures that make her look so crinkly. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I'm grateful I did." 
</P>
<P>
 Writing the book helped her, she said. It enabled her to process so many of 
the experiences she has had in nearly 50 years of life with George Bush. It 
permitted her to sort through her diaries, and to ship some off to the Bush 
library with instructions that they be opened 50 years from now. 
</P>
<P>
 "It kept me busy," she said, during a time when the transition out of public 
life might have been bumpy. 
</P>
<P>
 And it reminded her anew that for Barbara Bush, life has been -- could there 
be another word -- wonderful .

AROUND TOWN: THEY'RE STILL SURFING AFTER ALL THESE YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEVERLY BEYETTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For some, it seems, there is an endless summer. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an overcast Sunday morning at Surfrider Beach in Malibu and surf's up -- 
sort of. This is junk, slop, two-footers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbit Kekai is not happy. Back home in Waikiki on a day like this, "You pass 
the beach, you look, you keep going." 
</P>
<P>
 But, waves or no waves, the games will go on. Beach marshal Chuck Asbaugh 
reviews the rules with Kekai and his group: Two preliminary heats of 15 
minutes. Best three of six waves count. Top three scorers in each heat make the 
final. No snaking (dropping down on another guy's wave). 
</P>
<P>
 "Good luck, gentlemen. . . . Two minutes before you hit the water." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Moore, a retired lumber executive from Brentwood, is about to paddle out. 
"The last time I was in one these (contests) was in 1936," he says. "I tied for 
fourth." Moore is 76. 
</P>
<P>
 This is "Team Geritol," as the announcer would have it -- nine men competing 
in the 60-and-over division of the Malibu Surfing Assn.'s two-day event. 
</P>
<P>
 There's Kekai, 73. Like Moore, he's been surfing since 1925. 1925? That was 34 
years before "Gidget" hit the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There's Jack Cantrell, 66, of Ventura, a retired oil distributor. Still 
surfing after 40-plus years, he's trimmer and fitter than on Jan. 4, 1992, when 
he had a heart attack while riding a wave. "I'd been partying a lot," he 
explains. 
</P>
<P>
 Just turned 60, Gary Stellern, a Pasadena high school teacher and co-president 
of the sponsoring surfing club, is the baby of his group. "These guys are 
national treasures," he says. "Maybe they don't shred anymore, but they ride." 
</P>
<P>
 Take Frayne Higgason, 60, from Santa Barbara, still surfing three times a week 
after 44 years. "You do it for your ego," he says. "It keeps you healthy -- and 
it keeps your sinuses cleaned out." 
</P>
<P>
 It's still flat out there, very flat. The surfers bide their time between 
sets, hoping for action. From shore, it's about as exciting as watching 
wallpaper peel. 
</P>
<P>
 When they do pick up a wave, it's just a smooth, gentle ride. No aerials, 
roller coasters, spinners today. And nobody yelling, "Cowabunga!" 
</P>
<P>
 Bringing his board in, Cantrell says, "I got one wave worth riding." He 
watches the 50-to-59 age group paddle out. "A whole different breed. They're 
pros, amateur pros." 
</P>
<P>
 At 60-plus, Stellern adds, you're less aggressive. You still want to beat the 
other guys, "but you want to see them do well, maybe give them a good wave." 
</P>
<P>
 This is long-board competition, which suits them just fine. They were riding 
long boards before anyone had ever heard of a short board. Wood boards, 
100-pounders that you had to drag end-over-end to the water. 
</P>
<P>
 Kekai, who learned to surf when he was 5 from the legendary Duke Kahanamoku, 
used to make his redwood boards, one of which is now in the Bishop Museum in 
Honolulu. He's won so many trophies, he says, "My wife says 'you bring one 
home, you take one away.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Short and compact, with mahogany skin and a white goatee, he's a fixture on 
the beach at Waikiki, which he calls "Rabbit's playland." Who do you think got 
Peter Jennings, Kirk Douglas and Gregory Peck up on a board? 
</P>
<P>
 Riding a wave, Stellern says, "We forget how old we are. I'm about 30, 32 
maybe." Old enough to remember when surfing was synonymous with rowdiness, when 
"guys who'd never been in the ocean would drive around town with surfboards on 
their cars." 
</P>
<P>
 Blame it on Gidget: "Even in Ohio, everyone wanted to be a surfer." 
</P>
<P>
 Those were the days of knee-paddling. Nobody wore booties; their surfers' 
bumps were their medals. And territorialism was vicious. At Ventura Beach, 
Stellern recalls, "They'd beat up your car while you were in the water." 
</P>
<P>
 The man with the white ponytail is Gabby Makalena, 62, from Oahu. He's a 
born-again surfer, who started as a kid, took time out to raise a family and 
took up serious surfing again in 1989. (His daughter and grandson are also 
competing here.) 
</P>
<P>
 At day's end, when they hand out the trophies, Makalena takes first. The old 
guys get a big hand. "An awesome division," says the announcer. 
</P>
<P>
 Says judge Paul Nielsen, "It's an older style, but they looked great. They've 
got legs like 15-year-olds. The young kids, they move a little faster maybe, 
but they don't move any better." 
</P>
<P>
 Zack Howard, 15, the day's youngest winner, says: "I have a lot of respect for 
those guys." Does he expect to be out there 45 years from now? "Yep." 
</P>
<P>
 Kekai, finishing seventh, takes it in stride: "When the waves are big, I can 
handle it as good as the kids can. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't call me Rabbit for nothing. I just keep on going, and going and. . 
. ." Looking for Mr. or Ms. Right 
</P>
<P>
 At the Westwood Singles Growth Center, some SWMs and SWFs between 30 and 60 -- 
and those ISO the same -- are talking about those ads.  
</P>
<P>
 Facilitator Maxine Geller gets things going: How would you describe yourself 
in a four-liner? 
</P>
<P>
 "Tall, intellectually inclined . . . very wide range of interests," says Bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Annette isn't buying. "I'd want to know some specifics, like hobbies." Well, 
Bill says, he likes walks on the beach, movies, travel, candlelight dinners. 
</P>
<P>
 Laughter all around. Anyone who's ever read the "Women Seeking Men" or "Men 
Seeking Women" columns knows the cliches. 
</P>
<P>
 They also know the code: D for divorced, S for single, W for white, B for 
black, J for Jewish, N/S for nonsmoker, ISO for in search of. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 And they know it's hard to find Ms. or Mr. Right in L.A., where people are 
afraid -- of crime, commitment, AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Another man tries this out: "I play chess. The next move is yours." Someone 
retorts, "What if a computer answers?" 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie defines herself by her interests -- travel, tennis, bridge. How about 
"blond and beautiful?" Bill asks. No, she says: "If that's what's important to 
him, his value system wouldn't be in sync with mine." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Byron: "I've answered ads where the woman put 'pretty' and it wasn't even 
close." 
</P>
<P>
 Mel has "no intention of ever (placing) an ad because I don't think there's 
any correlation between what I am and what I'd write." For starters, he adds 
wryly, he'd put "mentally healthy." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, suggests Bill, "That's a good point in California." 
</P>
<P>
 Where, Geller asks, have they actually met interesting people? 
</P>
<P>
 Two women say where they haven't : at singles dances, where they're expected 
to make the first move. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, says Bill. "Men who can approach women -- and do -- are all paired off." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe so, says Marge, but the others are all looking for Miss America. At the 
door, "They wait for 10s" to come along before deciding whether to go in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Geographically desirable" is high among priorities. Other phrases keep 
resurfacing: Trim and fit, financially independent, stable, fun-loving. 
</P>
<P>
 Tall orders, maybe. But, says Geller, "There is a needle if you look in enough 
haystacks."FO, Bill Moore has been surfing since 1925. The last time he 
competed -- 1936 -- he finished fourth.

CYBURBIA: THE GOODS; IS THERE A CYBER DOCTOR IN THE HOUSE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID COLKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 ACD-ROM is no substitute for a medical doctor, but then again, when was the 
last time your doctor made a house call? 
</P>
<P>
 Several medical-advice CD-ROMs are now available for home computers, the most 
prominent being the "Mayo Clinic Family Health Book." 
</P>
<P>
 Adapted from a 1990 book with the same title, this CD-ROM contains information 
on more than 1,000 diseases and disorders, and it includes 500 color 
photographs, 45 animation clips and about 90 minutes of narration and other 
sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The pictures and little cartoons are all very educational, but when you're 
sick and looking for some medical tips, you probably don't want to view 
animation sequences on gastrointestinal endoscopy. 
</P>
<P>
 No, you're looking for relief, so let's see what this CD-ROM has to say about 
a few common ailments. And for comparison's sake, we'll look up those same 
ailments on a competing CD-ROM, "The Doctors Book of Home Remedies," by the 
editors of Prevention magazine, a publication that leans toward natural 
remedies. 
</P>
<P>
 * Athlete's foot: The "Mayo" disc includes a graphic, full-color photograph 
that could probably be used to cure anyone who has a foot fetish. 
</P>
<P>
 This unpleasant condition, directly related to jock itch (yes, the "Mayo" disc 
has a picture of that, too), is caused by a fungus and results in nasty 
itching, stinging, burning, cracking and peeling of skin on the feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Mayo" CD-ROM dismisses as unproven the long-held belief that wearing 
sandals in public shower areas can help prevent athlete's foot. It suggests 
instead the wearing of natural-fiber socks that absorb moisture and making sure 
that feet are dry after bathing or swimming. If you do get athlete's foot, it 
advises the use of over-the-counter anti-fungal powders and creams.

<P>
 The Prevention docs advise covering up in areas where people go barefoot. They 
suggest the use of the anti-fungals for the afflicted, but they also list some 
folk remedies, including soaking your feet in a wine-herb mixture. 
</P>
<P>
 * Headaches: For the common, occasional tension headache, the "Mayo" disc 
suggests moderate use of over-the-counter analgesics. 
</P>
<P>
 The Prevention CD-ROM also says that occasionally popping an aspirin is OK, 
but it goes on to list about 30 other -- often contradictory -- ways to get 
relief, including hot showers, cold compresses, sleeping it off, avoiding naps, 
exercise, the avoidance of exercise, biofeedback and Vitamin C (which shows up 
a lot on this CD-ROM). 
</P>
<P>
 * Warts: Of course, the "Mayo" disc just has to show them to us. It also 
includes the news that warts are harmless and many "disappear by themselves 
within two years." If you don't want your hands to look like the "Mayo" picture 
for that long, you can opt for getting a doctor to remove warts through 
electrical burning, freezing or laser surgery, or you can take your chances 
with one of several over-the-counter remedies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Prevention program warns that techniques used by doctors to get rid of 
warts "may or may not be effective. Many of them are painful and may leave 
scars. To add insult to injury, warts often reappear . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 It lists 26 alternatives, one of which is letting warts disappear on their 
own. Then there is the ubiquitous Vitamin C, castor oil, a prescription patch 
that applies an acid directly onto the wart, and even hypnosis. 
</P>
<P>
 The final diagnosis: Medical advice CD-ROMs are nifty items, but probably 
won't provide any more insight into an ailment than one of several books now on 
the market. Also, the content of these CD-ROMs is especially text heavy, and I 
find that prolonged reading of the text on a computer screen gives me a 
headache. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Mayo Clinic Family Health Book" is distributed by IVI Publishing and is 
available for about $45. "The Doctors Book of Home Remedies" is from Compton's 
NewMedia and sells for about $40. Both discs are available on Macintosh and 
Windows platforms. A new version of "The Doctors Book of Home Remedies" will be 
available later this year.

YOUR WHEELS: THE GOODS; PAY HEED IF YOUR CAR IS SENDING A SMOKE SIGNAL 
</P>

 Question: I get heavy white smoke coming out of the exhaust pipe of my 1989 
Mazda 626. Various mechanics have said my carburetor, crankcase ventilation 
valve or other things are to blame. It doesn't seem to be affecting the car. Do 
you have an answer? 
</P>
<P>
 -- M.F. 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Engines smoke because something is wrong. So even though you don't 
recognize it yet in the performance of the car, the smoke signals that a 
serious problem could be starting. White smoke typically occurs when either 
water or oil is entering the combustion chamber, which has rings, gaskets and 
seals to keep oil and water out of the cylinders. 
</P>
<P>
 The more serious problem would be oil getting in, most likely through worn 
piston rings, leaking valve guide seals or a bad head gasket. The valve guide 
seals are the cheapest to fix, followed by the head gasket. Worn rings mean the 
engine needs to be torn apart and remanufactured. 
</P>
<P>
 When oil is burned, it fouls the spark plugs with a tar-like substance. Your 
mechanic can easily check for fouled plugs. You might also keep track of your 
engine's oil consumption, although it takes only a small quantity to produce a 
lot of smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Water is less serious. Water usually enters the combustion chamber through a 
blown head gasket. When the water hits the hot gases, it forms clouds of steam. 
It is more obvious in cold weather and almost always dissipates quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 You should also carefully monitor your coolant level. If your radiator is 
mysteriously losing antifreeze and water, it may be going into your engine via 
a leaky gasket. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Q: I recently had the brake shoes replaced and the drums turned on my VW 
Beetle. When I picked the car up from the repair shop, it required a lot more 
force on the brakes to stop the car. The mechanic said this was because the 
shoes had to shape themselves to the drum. This is nerve-racking. Is that 
right? 
</P>
<P>
 -- D.B. 
</P>
<P>
 A: The shoes should have been contoured to correctly fit the drum by the 
mechanic. A drum is circular and the shoes must have the same arc. If the shoes 
are too big, they will touch the drum at each end and if they are too small 
they will touch in only one spot in the center. 
</P>
<P>
 The right shoes should fit correctly without any adjustment, but in some cases 
the arc may not properly match up and the mechanic must make modest changes in 
the shoe. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem may be that your mechanic is more familiar with modern 
disc brake pads, which are flat and always match the contour of the disc. But 
ignorance is no excuse for an unsafe brake job.

THE GOODS; SOME SOUND ADVICE; BE IT BARKING DOGS OR ROARING AIRPLANES, THERE 
ARE WAYS YOU CAN SILENCE NEIGHBORHOOD NOISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY LIBMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's 7 a.m. and a dog in a Los Angeles yard sprints to a fence and barks at a 
pedestrian. 
</P>
<P>
 The aroused schnauzer stops after five minutes, but repeats the pattern. Ev 
ery hour. All day. 
</P>
<P>
 This sort of persistent annoyance leads to most noise complaints against man's 
best friend, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not so much that the one time bothers anyone," says Linda Gordon, 
management analyst for the Department of Animal Regulation. "But in your 
typical neighborhood, there's going to be four to five people passing in a 
morning. If the dog barks at each person, that adds up." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes these distractions become overwhelming. A Fullerton man was 
sentenced last March to 60 days confinement for killing a neighbor's dog by 
taping its mouth shut. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, there are better ways to combat noise, whether the source is 
outside your home -- car alarms, airplanes, parties or construction -- or a 
dishwasher or shrieking child within. 
</P>
<P>
 You can defend yourself against neighborhood noise on three fronts: 
</P>
<P>
 * At the source, by politely asking the offenders to quiet down or, if that 
doesn't work, by filing complaints with city or county agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 * At your doorstep, by retrofitting your windows, doors and walls with sealers 
and insulation to keep the racket outside. 
</P>
<P>
 * At your ears, by wearing earplugs or by turning on music, air conditioners 
or other sounds to mask the noise. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're planning to move to a new home, start by visiting it at various 
times of day and night and listening carefully. Too much traffic noise? Sirens? 
Lively neighbors? Better to find that out before you sign a lease or a purchase 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask your future neighbors whether their quarters are quiet. Sit in your 
bedroom-to-be and listen for noise in early evening "when people will be 
getting home from work and when traffic or aircraft noise will be greatest," 
says a recent article in the trade journal Sound and Vibration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't try to convince yourself that you can get used to the noise ," the 
article recommends, "because it is just as probable that you may develop a 
sensitivity and the noise will get more intolerable." Turning Noise Down 
</P>
<P>
 If you're already settled, the easiest strategy may be to appeal to noisy 
neighbors to tone things down. If that fails, myriad government agencies may be 
able to help, including airports about airplanes, Caltrans about freeways and 
the Los Angeles Department of Animal Regulation for written complaints against 
animals. Police and sheriffs handle phone complaints about animals and other 
disturbances, aided by a special Los Angeles Police Department noise 
enforcement team for long-term grievances. 
</P>
<P>
 These agencies administer city and county codes that forbid construction and 
garbage collection between certain hours and limit noise levels for tools, 
traffic and animals. 
</P>
<P>
 No statistics are available on the total number of complaints about noise, but 
the animal regulation department logs about 2,100 a year and Los Angeles 
International Airport receives about 1,200. 
</P>
<P>
 When a citizen complains that someone has violated city ordinances, the 
suspect would ordinarily be told at a hearing on the matter, says Maria Reyes, 
deputy city attorney. If the conduct persists, the city might file a case 
seeking a $150 fine and 12 months summary probation. The maximum penalty is a 
$1,000 fine and/or six months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 The same rules would apply to most cases involving animal noise, but the 
Department of Animal Regulation can hold hearings to determine if a barking dog 
is a nuisance and take steps to revoke the dog's license. Blocking Noise Out 
</P>
<P>
 If you can't silence your particular problem, your best strategy may be to 
keep the noise out of your home: Residents can weatherstrip doors and windows 
or install thicker or double-pane windows. 
</P>
<P>
 "More than anything else in your house, tightening up those openings will give 
you the most bang for your buck," says architect Clifton Allen, president of 
Meyer & Allen Associates in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Householders can also rebuff noise by insulating walls or ceilings or building 
a wall around the yard. The wall can protect against the din of streets or 
freeways or even a barking dog. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the neighbor's house is too close to the property line, however, a wall 
may not be the best thing," Allen says. "The sound may bounce off the wall, 
back to the neighbor's house and back to yours." 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the home, you can dampen noise by installing sound-absorbers such as 
carpets, draperies and upholstered furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 Some programs help pay for such retrofitting. Homeowners in specific areas 
around several Southern California airports can get 80% of retrofitting paid by 
the federal government and 20% through the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The program pays for secondary or replacement windows, solid-core doors and 
attic insulation. In severe cases, the Airport Improvement Program also makes 
changes in walls and roofs, says Dave Brown, an engineer who manages the 
acoustics department at Wyle Laboratories in El Segundo. For details about the 
program, contact your city or county government. 
</P>
<P>
 "The program can be five or six times more expensive than normal windows or 
doors," Brown says. "Costs vary from $16,000 to $25,000. This is why I hesitate 
to tell people to do it themselves." Covering Noise Up 
</P>
<P>
 If fighting back isn't your style and fortifying your home is beyond your 
budget, your best bet may be earplugs, which can cut about 30 decibels of sound 
-- enough to bring many situations to a comfortable level, says Dr. John House, 
president of the House Ear Institute in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The same effect can be provided by turning on a fan or air conditioner, which 
can mask "the annoying noise of a barking dog or the thump, thump, thump of a 
loud band," House says. 
</P>
<P>
 The aim of all these procedures is to return sound in the home to a safe, 
comfortable level. Neighborhood noise can be more than annoying. If it's too 
loud and too persistent, it can contribute to permanent hearing damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rule of thumb is if you have to raise your voice above the noise to be 
heard, it's too loud," House says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything over 90 decibels is potentially dangerous. Quiet conversation in a 
quiet room would probably be about 60 decibels. Heavy traffic noise is about 
80. A power lawn mower is about 100 or 105; a helicopter about 105. Rock music 
concerts get to about 115 or 120. A jet airplane at takeoff 100 feet away would 
be about 130." 
</P>
<P>
 The higher the decibel level, the shorter the exposure needed to reach a 
dangerous level. 
</P>
<P>
 The danger begins at "eight hours at 90 decibels, four hours at 95, and two 
hours at 100 and so on," House says. "As soon as you get to 110, you're talking 
about a half hour's exposure. Anyone exposed to that type of noise level should 
wear ear protection." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, noise is in the ear of the beholder. One person's tumult may be 
another's sweet inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 "We love to say noise is unwanted sound," House says. "The neighbor's party is 
music to them, but not to you." NOISES OFF 
</P>
<P>
 Annoying sounds from traffic, airplanes and other outdoor sources can be kept 
outside the home with a variety of techniques, such as insulation and 
double-pane windows. To quiet outdoor noises, sound-absorbing carpets, 
draperies and upholstered furniture can help. REMEDIES 
</P>
<P>
 Keep sound outside * Insulation in walls * Double-pane windows * Build a wall 
* Masking -- turn on a steady sound, such as a fan or air conditioner, to drown 
out an irregular noise. * Weather stripping (doors and windows) 
</P>
<P>
 Absorb sound inside * Carpeting * Cloth materials such as sofas with padding * 
Draperies * Neoprene pads -- put washers and dryers on pads so they don't 
directly touch the floor (not shown).

INK: CELEBRATING THE BLACK EXPERIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL D. COLFORD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES. Paul D. Colford is a columnist for 
Newsday. His column is published Fridays. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a fall publishing season unusually crowded with books by celebrity authors, 
the media attention given to Marlon Brando, Robert Evans, Paul Reiser, Tim 
Allen, Barbara Bush and others can easily eclipse the merits of quieter titles. 
</P>
<P>
 However, one unheralded area of publishing -- historical reference books and 
literary anthologies about the African American experience -- continues to 
burgeon with little fanfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the latest notable releases are two with a common search: "In Search of 
Color Everywhere," a handsome collection of African American poetry edited by 
E. Ethelbert Miller, and "Feeling the Spirit: Searching the World for People of 
Africa," a coffee-table volume of striking images taken by photographer Chester 
Higgins Jr. in his decades of travel around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Search of Color Everywhere" gathers 210 signature poems and lesser-known 
efforts in thematic categories. The section of healing verses includes staples 
such as Thomas A. Dorsey's "Take My Hand, Precious Lord." Among the poems 
celebrating blackness are the words to James Brown's seminal hit recording, 
"Say It Loud -- I'm Black and I'm Proud." 
</P>
<P>
 The publisher, Stewart Tabori & Chang, which is better known for producing 
coffee-table books, had put out the word that it wished to anthologize black 
poetry in an elegantly designed edition. Terrance Cummings got the nod to 
illustrate the text with woodcut-style drawings. Miller, a poet and director of 
the African American Resource Center at Howard University, was chosen to 
assemble the collection after proposing that the book be accessible even to 
readers who did not like poetry. 
</P>
<P>
 The hardest part, Miller said, was making his final selections, particularly 
when he had several poems about one topic. "For example, I had eight different 
ones about getting hair cut in a barber shop," he said, choosing "Barbershop 
Ritual" by Sharan Strange: 
</P>
<P>
 Head-bowed, church-solemn/he sheds hair like motherlove & virginity.  
</P>
<P>
 To spread the word, Miller is being joined in public readings by other poets 
represented in the anthology, including Ntozake Shange and Jayne Cortez, who 
were with him at Monday's launch party at the Rizzoli bookstore in Soho in 
Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, just as Stewart Tabori & Chang does not come swiftly to mind for 
poetry, Bantam Books, publisher of Reiser's comic bestseller, "Couplehood," 
would not make a short list of houses known for doing coffee-table volumes. But 
Bantam's six-figure bid two years ago won a spirited auction among publishers 
for Higgins' "Feeling the Spirit," which shows the people of Africa in settings 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are dramatic portraits from back roads Alabama, exotic Haiti (far from 
the CNN cameras), the Sahara sands and other far-flung locales, interspersed 
with essays by Higgins, who is also a staff photographer with the New York 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Bantam, which markets its releases aggressively, has enlisted the Terrie 
Williams Agency, a well-connected public relations firm that represents a 
variety of black-oriented projects, to help introduce "Feeling the Spirit." The 
publisher also has been targeting black media and displaying blown-up images 
from the book in stores. Like Miller, Higgins also will head out on tour to 
tell his story. On the Racks: Food & Wine has thinned its logo and shaved about 
three-quarters of an inch off its width, starting with October's issue 
showcasing dishes and vintages of Italy. The aim is to make the magazine more 
user-friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the menu of high-tone culinary mags has grown to include Saveur, 
which aims to "dive deep into the world of food" by dwelling not only on 
completed recipes but also on the origins of ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
 The September/October premiere (not to be confused with a spring preview issue 
designed to gauge reader and advertiser interest) represents the second 
start-up this year by the new Meigher Communications, based in New York. Garden 
Design was its first.

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; A MOVING, HUMOROUS LOOK AT 3 GENERATIONS; GUPPIES FOR TEA 
BY MARIKA COBBOLD ; ST. MARTIN'S/THOMAS DUNNE $20.95, 287 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE KENDALL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Though the title suggests a memoir of life among a family of merry English 
eccentrics, "Guppies for Tea" is anything but flippant. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the novel is a perceptive examination of three generations of women 
and the difficult relationship among Selma Merryman, a once-vibrant matriarch 
now an unwilling resident in a nursing home; her self-involved and 
pathologically obsessive daughter, Dagmar, and the 31-year-old granddaughter, 
Amelia, a winsome but feckless young woman deeply moved by her grandmother's 
misery. 
</P>
<P>
 When the novel opens, Amelia is living in a rural English village with her 
lover, Gerald Forbes, a sometime painter-turned-country lawyer. He had fallen 
in love with Amelia during his artistic phase, but now that he's settled down 
in a family legal practice, her fey humor and charming impulsiveness have 
ceased to delight him. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald now wants someone solid, efficient and unencumbered by other 
responsibilities. Though aware that Gerald's feelings toward her have changed, 
Amelia has no idea that her successor is Gerald's sexy, uninhibited secretary, 
Clarissa, or that she's already in place. 
</P>
<P>
 In telling this story, Marika Cobbold manages to temper irony with compassion. 
Cherryfield nursing home and its brusque, patronizing staff offer splendid 
opportunities for the writer's tart humor. 
</P>
<P>
 Unflinching in her descriptions of the indignities endured by the aged and 
infirm in all such places, the author makes Amelia sympathetic, but also 
permits her to show impatience, exasperation and even revulsion. 
</P>
<P>
 Amelia is good, but never too good to be true. Expecting to be looked after by 
the faithless Gerald, she is thrust by default into the unnatural position of 
being a caretaker herself, a role for which she's totally unprepared. 
</P>
<P>
 Selma Merryman's son, Robert, has summarily sold his mother's house and 
decamped to Brazil; her daughter, Dagmar, is too mentally unbalanced to be of 
any use. All this leaves Amelia to shoulder the entire burden of consoling her 
grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
 At first the task is not too onerous -- a matter of frequent visits and 
optimistic promises that Selma will be out of the nursing home and with her 
family for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Still believing in the permanence of her relationship with Gerald, Amelia 
assures Selma that she will be able to bring her to the house she shares with 
him. So far, Amelia has been unable to tell her grandmother that her own 
beloved home has been sold and already is occupied by the new owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Amelia has gone along with the fiction that Selma is in Cherryfield only 
because of an infected foot, though that illusion becomes increasingly hard to 
maintain. In fact, Selma has deteriorated mentally as well as physically, a 
tragic alteration that Amelia cannot bear to admit. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, on one of her visits to Cherryfield, she meets a pleasant young 
naval chaplain, the son of another resident. Mature beyond his years, he not 
only offers Amelia sensible advice, but a friendship that quickly deepens into 
love. 
</P>
<P>
 No one ever needed romance more. Amelia has caught Gerald in flagrante delicto 
with Clarissa, and he has coldly informed her that he expects her to move out 
of their house in short order. While she still has a roof over her head, she 
bravely takes her grandmother out of Cherryfield for a visit that becomes a 
tragi-comic ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Selma is returned to Cherryfield, matters quickly go from bad to worse. 
Her physical condition worsens while her periods of lucidity grow briefer and 
further apart. Now thoroughly aware that her grandmother is terminally ill, 
Amelia embarks upon an outrageous and desperate scheme to give her the promised 
Christmas at home. 
</P>
<P>
 The emotional ordeals of the past few months have turned her from a 
scatterbrained girl into a resourceful and competent woman, though not many 
people would voluntarily choose Amelia's road to self-realization. 
</P>
<P>
 Enlivened by quirky and original observations, her arduous journey is 
affecting, enlightening and often wryly humorous.

A SILENT KILLER COULD BE IN YOUR HOME; POISONS: VITAS GERULAITIS' DEATH SHOWED 
THE UBIQUITY OF CARBON MONOXIDE -- AND THE NEED TO TAKE PRECAUTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It is odorless, colorless and quietly lethal. 
</P>
<P>
 It is carbon monoxide, the deadly byproduct of incomplete combustion and poor 
ventilation, and it is the leading cause of poisoning death in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 When the so-called killer gas took the life of former tennis star Vitas 
Gerulaitis, 40, in New York last week, public awareness of the threat got a 
tragic but timely boost. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a ubiquitous toxin, recognized since man first brought fire into the 
home for cooking," says Dr. Greg Thompson, co-director of the Los Angeles 
Regional Drug and Poison Information Center.  
</P>
<P>
 Recent statistics from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
show that the gas claims about 5,000 lives per year. Many of those deaths are 
from fires, experts say, and some from suicides, but an estimated one-third are 
accidental -- and in many cases, preventable. 
</P>
<P>
 Carbon monoxide is all around us, but only rarely in dangerous concentrations. 
It can be present around water heaters, stoves, fireplaces, lawn mowers and 
space heaters, as well as car exhaust. 
</P>
<P>
 The gas kills by replacing the oxygen in body organs and blood, silently 
suffocating its victims from within. Because the poison zeros in where oxygen 
is most desperately needed -- the brain and then the heart -- its victims first 
lose consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened to Vitas is a common scenario," Thompson says. "He went to bed 
and just didn't wake up. You don't even know you are breathing it in." Symptoms 
include headache, nausea, lethargy and fatigue.  
</P>
<P>
 To minimize the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning in the home, experts 
recommend these steps: 
</P>
<P>
 * Never cook indoors with a hibachi or other barbecue device. 
</P>
<P>
 * Do not use kerosene heaters until they have been thoroughly checked for 
leaks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be certain that water heaters are properly ventilated. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep fireplaces clean and be sure that smoke from fires is drawn up the 
chimney and out of the house. 
</P>
<P>
 * Immediately report any gas "smell" to the gas company. 
</P>
<P>
 * Consider installing a carbon monoxide monitor in your home.  
</P>
<P>
 * If you tend to feel perpetually fluish at home but notice you feel better 
when you leave the house, call the gas company for a free home inspection.

O.C. CONFIDENCE IN ECONOMY HITS HIGHEST IN '90S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County consumers are regaining their faith in the economy and now boast 
the highest confidence levels of the 1990s, according to a UC Irvine report 
released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest Orange County Annual Survey pegged the local Consumer Confidence 
Index at 89, a level just below the national average and a whopping 16 points 
higher than last year. The local index is now at its highest in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one important indication that Orange County has come out of 
recession," said Esmael Adibi, an economist at Chapman University in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1994 survey, conducted by Prof. Mark Baldassare at the UC Irvine School of 
Social Ecology, found a sharp increase in the number of adults who said that 
they are better off now than a year ago. Consumers also generally believe the 
nation has a prosperous year ahead and that now is a good time to buy 
big-ticket items such as cars and refrigerators. 
</P>
<P>
 Those results are significant, Adibi and other analysts said, because they 
suggest that consumers will start making big purchases that they had put off 
during the recession. And that buying spree, in turn, will create jobs in 
manufacturing and retail. 
</P>
<P>
 "Consumer spending looks like it's ready to take off," said UCI research 
associate Cheryl Katz, who conducted the survey with Baldassare. "We will see 
more spending across the board, more home buying, perhaps." Also, she said, 
people will be "generally more at ease with their finances." 
</P>
<P>
 Some retailers say they are already seeing signs of freer spending. Auto 
dealers, for example, report that their business has picked up, with some 
having sold out their entire inventories. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a single '94 Jeep on the lot," said Gary Gray, owner of Orange 
Coast Jeep Eagle in Coast Mesa. "Last year at this time, I had 150 '93 Jeeps 
that I couldn't sell." 
</P>
<P>
 The consumer confidence report also bodes well for the holidays, retailers' 
busiest season and thus a crucial part of their fiscal year. Yet it does not 
mean that the local economy, hampered by continued layoffs in the aerospace 
industry, has shaken off all of its lingering ills. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County consumers "are not as confident in the local scene as the 
national scene," pollster Katz said. The local confidence rating of 89 compared 
to a national rating of 92, a reverse of the late 1980s, when Orange County 
consistently scored higher than the rest of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest poll found that median annual household income was unchanged from 
last year at $47,000. That is a sharp contrast with the 1980s, when the median 
income rose 25% during the decade, compared to 6% nationally, said Baldassare, 
UCI's chairman of urban and regional planning in its School of Social Ecology. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why our consumer confidence ratings were so high during that period," 
he said Thursday. "Until we start to see income grow again, we'll probably lag 
behind or stay on par with the national average." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the report showed that 40% of the Orange County residents surveyed said 
they are better off now than they were a year earlier. That compared to just 
30% in the 1993 poll. 
</P>
<P>
 The pollsters, who interviewed 1,000 adults between Aug. 19 and 29, say the 
results have an error margin of plus or minus 3%. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent economic indicators also encourage optimism. In August, for instance, 
the county's jobless rate fell a full percentage point to 5.9% compared to 
July. And TRW Redi Property Data recently reported that sales of new and 
existing homes were up 26.2% for the first eight months of 1994, compared to 
the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all know hard economic numbers have been moving up for a few months now, 
and non-agricultural employment has been going up," said Cal State Fullerton 
economist Anil Puri. "But a big factor in any recovery has to be consumer 
spending." 
</P>
<P>
 During the recession, spending fell faster than personal income, meaning that 
people had dollars but were afraid to use them on consumer purchases. Now, Puri 
said, they are poised for a buying spree. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey found that the optimism is spread across all age groups and through 
every sector of the county. It found that 49% of Orange County consumers 
believe good times are ahead for the country over the next 12 months, compared 
to 29% in last year's survey. 
</P>
<P>
 They also believe the good times will be long-lasting, with 43% saying that 
the economy will remain healthy over five years. Last year, only 31% were so 
optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 Times correspondent Hope Hamashige contributed to this report. Optimism 
Returns to O.C. Consumers 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County residents are more upbeat about the economy than they have been 
in five years. The Confidence Index is calculated by computing scores from a 
national and local survey and adjusting from the base year, 1966, when the 
national index was 100. Here's how the United States and Orange County compare: 
Big-Ticket Buys 
</P>
<P>
 The outlook for consumer spending has also improved, with the percentage 
saying this is a good time to make a major purchase highest since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 About the big things that people buy for their homes, such as furniture, a 
refrigerator, a stove, television and things like that -- generally speaking, 
do you think now is a good time or a bad time for people to buy major household 
items? 
</P>

 1994: 60% More Confident, but Cautious 
</P>
<P>
 County consumers are decidedly more confident about their financial situation 
than they were a year ago. And while they remain basically optimistic about the 
future, their view of the next 12 months is unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 Would you say you (and your family) are financially better off or worse off 
than you were a year ago?

<P>
 Optimism regarding the national economy has turned upward in Orange County. 
About half say business conditions will be good during the next year. Although 
residents are split on the longer term outlook, the current four in 10 who 
think good times will last is a significant increase from 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Turning to business conditions in the country as a whole, do you think that 
during the next 12 months we will have good times financially or bad times?

BODY FOUND AT L.A. PLANT MAY BE INMATE; CRIME: CORPSE IS FOUND IN STEEL DRUM 
PICKED UP FROM NORCO PRISON. OFFICIALS SAY ONE PRISONER IS MISSING.

 Workers preparing to dump the contents of a steel drum of kitchen wastes into 
a processing machine at a rendering plant in South-Central Los Angeles on 
Thursday discovered a corpse that may be the body of an inmate missing from a 
state prison in Norco, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The unidentified man, who police said appeared to be a Latino in his mid-30s, 
was found in a sealed drum Thursday morning at Darling Delaware Co., a plant 
that recycles meat fat, grease and bones for use in products such as pet food. 
</P>
<P>
 The contents of the drum were about to be emptied into a pit where a blade 
separates the tallow and bone, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Drivers told police that the drum was picked up, along with several others, 
from the California Rehabilitation Center in Norco about 6:30 a.m. Thursday. 
The truck made about three or four more pickups before arriving at the plant at 
2626 E. 25th St., police said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Lt. Annette Hissami, a public information officer at the prison, 
the facility houses 3,935 male inmates and 826 female inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Hissami said personnel had been alerted to a possible escape earlier Thursday, 
and a head count of prisoners indicated that a man was missing. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this time it has not been confirmed (that the dead man was a prisoner), 
but we are missing one male inmate," Hissami said. She said she could not 
speculate on how the body got into the drum, which contained wastes from the 
prison kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities declined to release the name of the missing inmate pending an 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The prison is classified as a Level 2 security facility with open dormitories, 
secured perimeter fences and armed guards, said Gerri Loser, spokeswoman for 
the state Department of Corrections in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 The Riverside County coroner's office is attempting to determine how the man 
died.

AS O.C.'S CONFIDENCE SOARS, SO DO SALES; ECONOMY: CONSUMERS ARE SNATCHING UP 
HOMES AND AUTOS, FURNITURE AND APPLIANCES. MERCHANTS SAY THE SPENDING PACE, 
THOUGH NOT AS FRANTIC AS THE '80S BOOM, IS NONETHELESS BRISK.

 In the hills overlooking San Clemente, Del Cabo Properties last week sold 
three of its luxury homes -- the same number it used to sell in a good month. 
</P>
<P>
 At Patterson Dodge in Garden Grove, Ram trucks and new Neon subcompacts are 
snapped up as soon as they arrive on the lot. "They can't make them fast 
enough," general manager Jeff Patterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 And at Pacific Coast Furniture in Fountain Valley, August's sales were 22% 
higher than for the same month in 1993. One customer bought enough beds, 
dressers and side chairs to fill three bedrooms. "Real estate must be selling," 
general manager Tom Zimmerman said. "People are buying furniture." 
</P>
<P>
 Soaring consumer confidence in Orange County, revealed in the latest Orange 
County Annual Survey from UC Irvine, is clearly in evidence at retail stores 
and real estate brokerages. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the sales pace is nowhere near as fast as during the booming 1980s, 
merchants are quick to point out, it is a certainly a welcome change after the 
sluggish days of the recession. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pleased with what we're seeing in Orange County," said Bill Ihle, vice 
president of communications for Broadway Stores Inc. in Los Angeles. "We see 
the sales trend moving in the right direction for us." 
</P>
<P>
 The survey found that, while household incomes in Orange County remain the 
same as last year, 60% of consumers say the time is right to make major 
purchases such as furniture, cars and appliances. In the 1993 poll, only 52% 
expressed such optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 The real test of the consumer confidence will come next month, when the 
holiday shopping season begins. Retailers generally ring up more sales in the 
final two months of the year than during the other 10, and for 1994 they voice 
high hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are having a good year," said Pete Nordstrom, a regional manager for 
Nordstrom department stores. "Orange County stores are doing well," he said, 
and are exceeding sales projections. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the biggest beneficiaries of the economic rebound, though, has been the 
auto industry. Dealers say they are seeing a big increase in customers just as 
they are getting shipments of new models that have won rave reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 The hottest of those new models -- from Chrysler Corp.'s new LX midsize cars 
to Ford's sport utility vehicles -- are selling as soon as they arrive, dealers 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year is a heck of a lot better" than 1993, said Gary Gray, owner of 
Orange Coast Jeep Eagle. "1991 and 1992 were definitely the pits. Definitely, 
it's better than it was." 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate brokers, too, have noticed a quickening pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Martin, marketing director for the Coto de Caza planned community in South 
County, said sales are way up. The company has sold 99 homes so far this year, 
he said -- more than during all of 1993.

DAMAGES AGAINST KIM BASINGER VOIDED; COURTS: APPELLATE JUSTICES FIND JUDGE GAVE 
AMBIGUOUS INSTRUCTIONS TO JURY IN 'BOXING HELENA' CASE. VERDICT OF $8.1 MILLION 
THREW FILM STAR INTO BANKRUPTCY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Citing "prejudicially ambiguous" options given to a jury, a unanimous appeals 
court panel overturned an $8.1-million verdict against actress Kim Basinger on 
Thursday for reneging on an agreement to appear in the film "Boxing Helena." 
</P>
<P>
 The judgment had forced Basinger into bankruptcy and threatened to undermine 
the Hollywood tradition of making deals on a handshake. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for both sides said the reversal was based on a technicality -- 
Superior Court Judge Judith Chirlin failed to separate Basinger from her 
personal services company, Mighty Wind Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Chirlin was reversed "on a technicality she created," said attorney Howard 
Weitzman, who represented Basinger during her trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Main Line Pictures, the small, independent company that produced "Boxing 
Helena," had argued that Basinger and Mighty Wind are one and the same, but 
Basinger's attorneys maintained that if there was an agreement, it was between 
Main Line and Mighty Wind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am extremely pleased with the court's decision," Basinger said in a 
prepared statement. "I continue to maintain that there was no contract, oral or 
otherwise, contrary to (Main Line's) assertions that I simply viewed an oral 
agreement as non-binding." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Patricia Glaser, who represents Main Line, was undaunted by the 
appellate court decision and said the film company will seek a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll whomp their rear ends again," Glaser said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel vindicated because the court didn't touch the merits of this case," 
she said. "In fact, the court even stated during oral arguments that the record 
was replete with evidence of a contract." 
</P>
<P>
 The three-judge appeals court panel ruled that verdict forms prepared by Judge 
Chirlin allowed the jury to find that "Basinger and/or Mighty Wind" had entered 
a contract with Main Line and breached it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 'and/or' (verdict forms) are prejudicially ambiguous and require 
reversal," 2nd District Court of Appeal Justice Margaret Grignon wrote. Those 
verdict forms "prevented the jury from performing its obligation to determine 
the separate existence of Mighty Wind and Basinger," the opinion said. Justice 
Ramona Godoy Perez and Presiding Justice Paul Turner concurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Basinger's appellate lawyer Irving Greines called "and/or" verdict forms 
"hopelessly incomprehensible," saying they have been condemned in California 
for more than 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Chirlin "failed to follow the law and created something new with this 'and/or' 
clause to draw Kim into the contract," Weitzman said. "That confused the jury 
as to which party was actually responsible for the contract." 
</P>
<P>
 Greines said he feels "extremely confident that Kim would win this case on 
retrial. The case is fabricated out of thin air." 
</P>
<P>
 When the verdict against Basinger, 40, was handed down in March, 1993, it 
sparked a mixed reaction in Hollywood, where movie deals are often based on 
handshake agreements. Some are even signed on cocktail napkins or given the nod 
in casual conversations. Never before had any studio or independent producer 
pursued a star for reneging on an agreement with such determination. 
</P>
<P>
 The key dispute was over discussions involving Basinger, Main Line head Carl 
Mazzocone and "Boxing Helena" director Jennifer Lynch. Basinger was to play the 
role of a woman rescued from a car accident by a lovesick doctor who becomes 
obsessed with her and amputates her arms and legs before holding her hostage in 
a box. The movie, eventually made with Sherilyn Fenn in the lead role, bombed 
at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
 There were various drafts of a deal memo drawn up by the actress's lawyer that 
Main Line contended stood as a binding contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Basinger, following the advice of her agent Guy McElwaine, backed away from 
the role, particularly when it required her to pose nude. 
</P>
<P>
 Since her trial, there have been several instances in Hollywood where stars 
such as Michael Douglas, actor/director Robert Redford and actress/director 
Jodie Foster have bailed out of roles at the last minute -- sometimes days 
before shooting begins. All contend they had script approval before committing 
to their role -- a so-called "out" clause Basinger always maintained she 
retained. 
</P>
<P>
 But none of the studios or producers, whose films relied on those actors, have 
taken any action to force them to star in their pictures. Redford and Foster 
were both expected to star in 20th Century Fox's "Crisis in the Hot Zone," and 
Douglas would have played a leading role in Carolco Pictures' pirate movie 
"Cutthroat Island." 
</P>
<P>
 Basinger's bankruptcy is still unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Thursday, a tiny Georgia bank owned by Basinger brought $1,541,000 at 
a bankruptcy sale. 
</P>

 A partnership including Basinger paid a reported $20 million in 1989 for 1,700 
acres of Braselton, Ga., near her hometown of Athens. The partnership took on 
heavy debt to buy the property, where she had planned to build a film and 
recording studio.

KING'S LAWYER URGES SIMPSON GAG ORDER; MEDIA: ATTORNEY FOR MOTORIST BEATEN BY 
POLICE SAYS THE RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL IN A CAPITAL CASE TAKES PRECEDENCE OVER 
THE FREE SPEECH OF LAWYERS AND THE PRESS.

 Attorney Milton Grimes, one of the lawyers who represented Rodney G. King, 
said Thursday that he thinks there should be a gag order on the media covering 
the O.J. Simpson murder case, telling a symposium of journalism students that 
Simpson's right to a fair trial has already been eroded. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe the right to a fair trial, when a person's life is on the line, 
takes precedence over the right to free speech of the media and the lawyers," 
Grimes told a Cal State Fullerton symposium on media coverage of Simpson's 
case. "O.J.'s rights to a fair trial have been severely eroded" partly because 
the media have been used and manipulated, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Grimes said the release of a recorded 911 call in which Nicole Simpson cried 
for help and told an operator her husband had repeatedly abused her was harmful 
to Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of you can tell me that . . . it did not affect your feelings toward 
O.J.," he said. "I don't care who leaked it. It should never have been 
broadcasted." 
</P>
<P>
 But a fellow panelist, Dennis Schatzman, a reporter for the Los Angeles 
Sentinel, the leading Southland newspaper covering African American affairs, 
defended the media's coverage, saying the case has all the elements that 
readers want: controversy, a celebrity, conflict and violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We say we don't like it but we'll read every paragraph," Schatzman said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are racial implications in the case, despite protestations from 
prosecutors and others to the contrary, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've all heard that race is not the issue. Now come on. A black man accused 
of killing beautiful, blond Nicole and her friend Ronald Goldman and slicing 
them to pieces" does bring out the race issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes, whose law practice is in Santa Ana, told about 75 journalism students 
that his experience with a high-profile, emotionally charged case soured him on 
the press. He represented Rodney King through the state and federal trials of 
Los Angeles Police Department officers first charged with beating him and later 
of violating his civil rights, as well as during King's civil lawsuit for 
damages against Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "In dealing with the media my first reaction to your profession is one that is 
not quotable at this moment. I hated you with a passion. But then I learned how 
to deal with you and . . . sometimes to manipulate you," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes said he worked to change the public's perception of King as a "monster 
PCP user" by bringing him to high schools to encourage students to stay in 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Journalism students in the audience, asked if they thought the media are 
covering the Simpson case properly, said they felt torn between privacy issues 
and their thirst for a good story. "If you took the ethical stance, you 
probably would lose your job," said Lisa Willard, 25, a communications major. 
"I would go and get whatever angle I could."

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; DREAMS OF BRINGING 'SURF CHAIR' TO CITY 
KEPT ALIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pat DeMar's dream of rolling along the water's edge in Laguna Beach in a 
specially designed "surf chair" evaporated this summer. But her dream may 
eventually come true after all. 
</P>
<P>
 DeMar, a former Laguna Beach resident who used to run on city beaches at 
sunset, is wheelchair-bound after being struck with Lou Gehrig's disease, a 
degenerative nerve disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, DeMar and boyfriend Michael Laux, now Laguna Niguel 
residents, tried to get Laguna Beach to accept a donation of a surf chair -- a 
balloon-wheeled creation that would allow her access to the beach again. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials said they had no place to store the chair, so the $900 
vehicle went to Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, the city has decided to erect a shelter for a surf chair on Main 
Beach, says Deputy City Manager Cindy King. And fitness buffs from a city 
exercise class have been pitching in money to buy one. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan DuBois, whose husband, Langdon, teaches the class, said they should have 
$900 by the end of the week. And they won't stop there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm expecting the donations are going to keep coming and we'll be able to 
move on to (buy) a second chair," DuBois said. 
</P>
<P>
 While King said the storage shed may not be complete until winter, Laux said 
this week that he hopes it is ready sooner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Better late than never," he said. "We're anxious to put it in place."LESLIE

LEISURE WORLD ACTIVISTS RALLY AGAINST AIRPORT PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN FRANEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Age doesn't dampen some folks' enthusiasm for politics. 
</P>
<P>
 That was evident at a rally in a plush Leisure World auditorium Thursday 
morning as 450 senior citizens raised their voices against the siting of a 
commercial airport at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearty "No's" echoed through the Clubhouse 3 auditorium as the senior 
citizens, some relying on walkers and hearing aids, responded to a speaker's 
questions: "Do you want an airport?" and "How will we vote on Nov. 8?" 
</P>
<P>
 Other cities, such as Laguna Niguel, have held meetings with presentations by 
both airport supporters and opponents. But Thursday's 1 1/2-hour gathering, 
sponsored by the Leisure World Community Assn., was a wholeheartedly one-sided 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
 Three speakers -- Laguna Hills Councilwoman Melody Carruth, UC Irvine 
political science professor Mark Petracca and retired Marine Lt. Col. George 
Parker -- all offered reasons to oppose Measure A, which requires the building 
of a civilian airport at the base site when the Marines abandon it in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The speakers pointed to the initiative's failure to allow more creative uses 
of the base, 9increased noise and traffic they believe would accompany an 
airport, and the potential for costly problems, such as those associated with 
Denver's new airport, which is plagued by cost overruns and mechanical problems 
that have delayed the opening several times. 
</P>
<P>
 They were preaching to the converted. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Marines were here long before Leisure World," said Belle Charleton, 75. 
"We can tolerate them. But we certainly don't want the noise from a commercial 
airport."  
</P>
<P>
 And, she added, with a knowing nod of her head, "We get out and vote." 
</P>
<P>
 Local political observers have seen the clout the 20,000 residents of Leisure 
World can wield. 
</P>
<P>
 The first effort in 1989 to incorporate the city of Laguna Hills failed by 284 
votes. People on both sides of that debate credited the high voter turnout at 
Leisure World as a main cause for its defeat. Leisure World residents had 
argued against cityhood, expressing fears of higher taxes and loss of community 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, when Laguna Hills again sought incorporation -- this time without 
including the Leisure World area -- the measure won easily, 86% to 14%. 
</P>
<P>
 Petracca encouraged the audience to use word of mouth, letters to elected 
officials and the media, as well as organized campaigning, to create opposition 
in North County and Newport Beach, whose residents hope an El Toro airport 
could alleviate some of the noise problems they suffer because of nearby John 
Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of Thursday's rally said they hope 70% of Leisure World residents 
will vote on Nov. 8. The community association plans to send volunteers 
door-to-door to hand out voter registration forms and absentee ballots.

EL TORO AIRPORT FINANCING PLAN OUTLINED; DEVELOPMENT: $4 BILLION IN 
CONSTRUCTION COSTS CAN BE FINANCED BY SELLING BONDS TO INVESTORS, PROPONENTS 
SAY. OPPONENTS SAY TAXPAYERS BE AFFECTED NONETHELESS. 
</P>

<P>
 The debate about the plan to build a commercial airport at El Toro Marine 
Corps Air Station continued Thursday at a forum where experts discussed the 
issue in detail for the first time, including ways to finance the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The experts' reports were followed by a spirited panel debate. They fielded 
questions from a group of reporters and about 450 people who filled a hotel 
meeting room. The morning session, held across the street from John Wayne 
Airport, was organized by a consortium of Orange County business groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Billed as an "unbiased, factual examination of the issues," the forum did 
little to change the minds of most attendees, who apparently had already staked 
out positions on Measure A, an initiative on the November ballot that would 
require a commercial airport at El Toro when the Marines vacate the base in 
1999. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the initiative pointed out that three of the seven business 
groups sponsoring the discussion have already endorsed the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, those present heard for the first time an explanation of how proponents 
of the civilian airport expect to pay the estimated $4-billion construction 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Patrick George, western regional director of P. Morgan & Co., said the 
airport can be financed by selling bonds to private investors. One of the 
experts who spoke at the outset of the forum, he said local taxpayers would not 
be obligated to bail out bondholders if the airport fails. 
</P>
<P>
 "The risk of development falls on those who invest in the bonds used to 
finance the airport. There clearly is enough demand in Orange County to service 
the debt," George said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like supporters of Measure A, George said a new airport would generate a 
"significant growth in business and jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 However, David Celestin, a consultant and former vice president of planning 
and governmental relations for the Mission Viejo Co., challenged George, saying 
the multibillion-dollar project is too costly to be funded through the sale of 
bonds alone. He argued that county officials would have to help fund the 
project by raising developer fees and property taxes, which ultimately would be 
paid by homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the surface, the proponents' arguments make sense: new jobs, more 
revenues," said Celestin, one of the panelists, who answered questions from 
reporters and the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 But Celestin said the trade-off would be "higher taxes, lower property values, 
noise pollution and unsafe skies," because a civilian airport at El Toro would 
be eight miles from John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who's to say an alternative use (other than an airport) wouldn't provide more 
opportunity for more jobs and more revenues," Celestin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The El Toro Reuse Planning Authority, the county agency studying how the 
4,700-acre base should be developed once the Marines depart, is considering 
several alternatives, including a commercial airport. The study will not be 
completed until June, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, a coalition of business and political leaders placed on the 
ballot an initiative that would require the county to build a commercial 
airport on 2,000 acres at El Toro. Supporters say a new airport would create 
21,645 jobs in Orange County and generate $170 million annually for local 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of Measure A have complained that the county's special planning 
authority for El Toro is the only one recognized by the Defense Department and 
have attacked sponsors of the initiative for "planning through the ballot box." 
The Defense Department is not obligated to give up the property to the county 
under the base closure law. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon will have to endorse any development plan drawn up by the 
planning authority, and there are questions about whether the Defense 
Department would even recognize Measure A's mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 The bickering over the initiative versus the conventional planning process 
continued at Thursday's forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Vardoulis, a former Irvine mayor and member of the planning authority, 
said the county agency is "attempting to build a consensus" in Orange County on 
the development of the Marine base. 
</P>
<P>
 "We (opponents and supporters of Measure A) all have the same goal in mind, to 
maximize the use of that property," Vardoulis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman University President James L. Doti, who supports a commercial airport 
at El Toro, responded that the nine-member county agency -- composed of the 
supervisors, three Irvine council members, including Vardoulis, and a Lake 
Forest council member -- is biased because five members oppose the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not afraid of democracy, but a better approach would be to let the market 
decide," Doti said. "If we fail to capture El Toro, we will be placing a cap" 
on Orange County's economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, he said that if an airport were built at El Toro, the undeveloped 
land around it could be used for other enterprises, including low-cost housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Celestin scoffed at Doti's comment, arguing that zoning laws would then 
require the surrounding development to be compatible with the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Janice M. Mittermeier, director of John Wayne Airport, said a consulting firm 
hired by the county planning agency will study whether the Marine base can and 
should be converted to a commercial airport. 
</P>
<P>
 If the county authority chooses an airport for the site, then officials will 
have to decide whether it should be used primarily to handle passengers, 
international cargo, long hauls or short hauls, or some combination of cargo 
and passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will also look at the cost analysis and how much revenue an airport would 
generate," Mittermeier said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Vardoulis warned that the federal government can still throw the county's 
plans for El Toro into a tizzy if the Irvine Co. and the U.S. Department of the 
Interior go ahead with a proposed land swap. Under a plan that is being 
discussed by both sides, the Irvine Co. would gain control of El Toro in 
exchange for thousands of acres it owns in northern Orange County, bordering 
the Cleveland National Forest, which the company would deed to the Interior 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Vardoulis said federal agencies have first claim on military bases that are 
being closed. He said the Interior Department would have to submit a request to 
the Pentagon for El Toro by Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Department of Interior request is approved, everything will go away," 
Vardoulis said.

CUT IN FEDERAL FUNDS COULD DELAY WORK ON COURTHOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Construction of Orange County's first federal courthouse may be delayed by a 
surprise move Thursday in Congress, which cut $25 million for the project out 
of next year's budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The $25 million, the last of $128 million budgeted for the courthouse, was 
eliminated from an appropriations bill Thursday night by a conference committee 
after the House of Representatives voted to cut the Senate version of the bill 
by $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who voted to send the bill to the committee for cuts included Reps. 
Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), in whose district the courthouse would be 
built, and Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), as well as Republican Senate 
candidate and Rep. Mike Huffington (R-Santa Barbara). 
</P>
<P>
 In a news release issued Thursday night after the committee action, Democratic 
Sen. Dianne Feinstein blamed Dornan and Huffington, who is running for her 
seat, for the loss of the $25 million. The money, in addition to $103 million 
that Congress appropriated last year, is required to complete the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is unbelievable is that Congressman Bob Dornan, who represents the 
district and the man who aspires to be a senator from California, Michael 
Huffington, stood at the doors of the House floor actively lobbying for this 
cut," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan and Huffington denied they had been instrumental in the House action. 
Dornan said he had been busy in other meetings all day and only appeared in the 
House to cast his vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Dornan and Huffington said they were unaware that the Orange County 
project was in any jeopardy, and they blamed the Democrats in the conference 
committee for the upset. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the first time I knew there was $25 million in it (the bill) for the 
courthouse," Huffington said. "As I often do, I voted for cuts in spending." 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan said he realized that the courthouse project was in the larger budget 
appropriation. But he said he thought that it would be protected from any trims 
because it was a high-priority item and had been contained in the original bill 
that was approved by the House before the Senate added projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "I fought on the House floor to protect the courthouse and won just six weeks 
ago," Dornan said. "It was a resolved issue. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I did not expect them to play cheap partisan politics and go back into the 
meat to punish Republicans by cutting projects in Republican districts." 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan, Huffington and Cox said they believe that the $25 million for the 
courthouse still can be saved, if Feinstein wields her influence with 
Democratic members of the conference committee before the bill goes back to the 
Senate and House for final confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is in the perfect position to fix this, and it can be fixed," Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Bob Maynes, press secretary for Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), who 
co-chaired the conference committee, was skeptical that the courthouse 
appropriation can be salvaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Maynes said "Huffington and Dornan have shot themselves in the foot." He said 
both had energetically lobbied for the $200-million cut. "I suspect that the 
conference committee may well have given them the opportunity to put up or shut 
up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question," he added, "is whether they will view this cut as a laudable 
cut in pork-barrel spending or scream foul because the cuts have come in their 
own state. It would appear they have been just a little too cute for their own 
good and, unfortunately, for the good of their constituents." 
</P>
<P>
 If the cut was not restored, Dornan said, construction would be delayed by 
about four months. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is considered vital to a growing caseload in Orange County. The 
city of Santa Ana has worked more than 20 years to bring a federal courthouse 
to the Civic Center, said City Manager David N. Ream. A federal court now 
operates out of temporary space in a modular building.  
</P>
<P>
 The new courthouse will be built on a 3.9-acre parcel of city-owned land 
bounded by 4th, 5th and Ross streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Ream said that even with Thursday's action in Congress, officials expect site 
work to begin in October and construction to begin in February or March.

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 40-year-old Tustin man died Thursday of injuries sustained in a Sept. 2 bar 
fight in Santa Ana, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Eucario Osorio, who died at Chapman General Hospital in Orange, was 
kicked in the head during the fight at Broadway Billiards Parlor, in the 200 
block of North Broadway, by a man who is still at large, Lt. Robert Helton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Osorio did not regain consciousness long enough to be interviewed by police, 
Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect is described as a 37- to 40-year-old Latino, about 5-foot-7 and 
weighing 180 pounds, Helton said. He said homicide investigators are working on 
the case.

SMOKE APLENTY BLOWING BEFORE THE FIRE; HART: MIKE HERRINGTON IS 2-0 AGAINST 
WARRIORS BUT SAYS HE FEARS A ROUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When Hart High football Coach Mike Herrington considers tonight's showdown 
against Westlake at Newbury Park High, he can't help but recall the last time 
his Indians played on the road against a high-scoring opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was a 44-42 loss to Dominguez in the quarterfinals of last season's 
Southern Section Division II playoffs. Neither team could stop the other in a 
game that saw six lead changes. Hart took a 42-38 lead with 2 minutes 54 
seconds left. That was too much time. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominguez marched 53 yards in five plays and put up six more points with 1:29 
left. Too much time? Almost. Hart was at the Dons' five-yard line when time ran 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could end up like the Dominguez game," Herrington said before his team's 
first road game since. "I hope it's close. I hope we don't get blown out." 
</P>
<P>
 Hart and Westlake, ranked third and fourth in The Times' area poll, have both 
forged 2-0 records on the strength of outstanding offenses. Westlake averages 
45 points, Hart 41.5. Considering the fact that there are only 48 minutes in a 
high school game, fans might be advised to keep one eye on the field, the other 
on the scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got our heads spinning," Herrington said. "I don't know if we can stop 
them. We might be putting pressure on our offense just to keep scoring. 
(Westlake) is one of the best offensive teams in the (Southern Section) right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake's top player is receiver Billy Miller, a preseason All-American who 
has 10 receptions for 192 yards and four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors are so deep at quarterback that Scott Spruill will not start 
though he is the area leader among Southern Section passers with 375 yards. 
Brian Shubin, who has completed nine of 14 for 153 yards and three touchdowns, 
is the starter, and third-stringer Steve Aylsworth could start for many area 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've got (several) guys that can beat you," said Rick Herrington, Hart's 
defensive coordinator. "Because of that, it's almost impossible to double up on 
Miller." 
</P>
<P>
 Or to key on the pass. Westlake, with the area's leading offense, has 526 
yards passing and 472 rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors average 8.9 yards per carry, led by Jamal Harris (18.1) and Jason 
Victor (10.7). 
</P>
<P>
 "We know Miller will get four or five balls," Rick Herrington said. "We hope 
it's not 10 or 11." 
</P>
<P>
 Hart linebacker Jeremy Seipel, who started at safety last season, was 
impressed with Miller in last year's game, a 31-14 Hart victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember (Miller) catching a deep fade in the end zone," he said. "It was a 
corner route and he made a good catch on it. I will cover (Miller) on slants 
and short stuff. But he's basically a long-ball and fade receiver." 
</P>
<P>
 Those assignments will be shared by junior cornerbacks Todd Renfro and Tim 
Waddell. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Herrington worries about the inexperience in his unit (only three 
starters are seniors), the 16 pounds per man the Indians give away on the line 
and the fact that Hart has allowed 746 yards, second-highest in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 However, three of four touchdowns allowed in Hart's victories over San 
Fernando (41-18) and Thousand Oaks (42-14) were given up by the second-team 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart's starting offense, as usual, has been impressive. The Indians have 
scored on 12 of 63 plays, a touchdown every 5.25 plays. Hart might need to 
maintain that pace to beat Westlake.

SMOKE APLENTY BLOWING BEFORE THE FIRE; WESTLAKE: DEFENSE MAY HAVE VANILLA, OR 
PERHAPS ROCKY ROAD, AWAITING THE INDIANS. 
</P>

 Someone is playing mind games. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Westlake High defense prepared for tonight's matchup against Hart, one 
of the area's highest-scoring teams, the Warriors differed on just what they 
have in store. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just boils down to execution," said Bill Culpepper, Westlake defensive 
coordinator. "We don't have any real special things planned." 
</P>
<P>
 But linebacker Eric Guenther said: "I don't think I can give it away, but we 
have some new stuff. We're putting in some new things this week." 
</P>
<P>
 If so, that's news to defensive lineman Robbie Valance. "Actually, we are just 
running the same defense," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe that's Westlake's goal. Confuse the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 Not much else has worked against Hart, which scored 83 points in routing its 
first two opponents, San Fernando and Thousand Oaks. In preparation for 
tonight's 7:30 game at Newbury Park High, Westlake coaches attended last week's 
Hart-Thousand Oaks contest in which the Indians romped, 42-14. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're impressive," Culpepper said. "They've got a very talented offensive 
line. Their back, (Ted) Iacenda, is one of the best backs around. He does a 
great job running the ball and he is effective catching the ball out of the 
backfield. Their quarterback (Steve McKeon) is good. He throws a nice ball. And 
their receivers are excellent." 
</P>
<P>
 What concerns Culpepper most is Hart's balance. Although the Indians often use 
a no-huddle, pass-oriented attack, Iacenda has been a dangerous runner, gaining 
204 yards in only 16 carries and scoring eight touchdowns. He also leads the 
team with nine receptions for 177 yards. McKeon has completed 18 of 35 (51.4%) 
for 326 yards and four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see that there's any one facet of (Hart's) game that is dominant over 
the other one," Culpepper said. "We see their offense as a complete package. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you talk about Westlake, you talk about (receiver) Billy Miller and the 
quarterback and throwing the ball. I don't see Hart as a team that has only one 
player. When I look at their offense I see 11 guys that are good football 
players." 
</P>
<P>
 The key players for Westlake on defense will be the linebackers -- Guenther, 
Craig Walendy and Ryan Dritz -- entrusted with stopping the run and the pass.  
</P>
<P>
 "They all will have to play great games," Culpepper said. "They have to do a 
good job in covers." 
</P>
<P>
 The Westlake defense has been spotty in the first two games. The Warriors have 
allowed 556 yards in two games to rank near the bottom in the area, but only 33 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 But the matchup that seems to give Hart an edge is on the line of scrimmage. 
Hart's five offensive linemen average 6-foot-2 1/2, 244 pounds, while 
Westlake's four defensive linemen average 6-0 1/2, 204. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, they've got some pretty big guys," said Valance, an end, "but we have 
speed, so we are not really too worried." 
</P>
<P>
 When reminded of the differences between the teams on the line of scrimmage, 
Guenther just chuckled, paused and said: "We've got some new stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Wait until tonight to see what that means. 
</P>
<P>
 Or if it means nothing at all.

TOUGH SETUP; SHAPING A YOUNG VENTURA VOLLEYBALL TEAM THE CHALLENGE FOR 
EX-OLYMPIAN MCFADDEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Miki McFadden hopped off the exercise bicycle, lay on her back on the floor 
and lifted her legs straight up against a wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "A bodybuilder told me a long time ago that this is good to get the 
circulation flowing back to the head," said McFadden, her shirt drenched with 
perspiration. "I didn't believe him at first, but it works." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, McFadden must find the way to unravel another mystery, like how to mold a 
young and inexperienced women's volleyball team at Ventura College into a 
competitive unit. 
</P>
<P>
 It won't be an easy assignment for the former setter on the U.S. Olympic team 
in her first season at Ventura. The Pirates have only two returning players 
from a team that was 13-8 (13-5 in Western State Conference play) in 1993, and 
the freshmen need considerable refinement. Still, McFadden says she is up to 
the task. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be tough but I'm pretty patient," McFadden said. "I really 
enjoy seeing (the players) get better." 
</P>
<P>
 Once, when women's volleyball was taking its first serious steps in the United 
States, it was McFadden who captured the looks of coaches and peers alike. 
</P>
<P>
 She was born and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii, and became an outstanding outside 
hitter at Punahu High in her hometown. Later, McFadden played at USC, although 
college volleyball was only a club sport then. But Southern California was 
already the volleyball mecca in this country and a breeding ground for the 
national team, and McFadden wanted a shot at playing in the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 McFadden got her wish and made the American team in 1966 after a U.S. 
Volleyball Assn. tournament that doubled as a tryout. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, playing in college was fun but it was real low-keyed," McFadden said. 
"But the national team was serious." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1967, the United States won the gold medal at the Pan American Games in 
Winnipeg, Canada, but McFadden skipped the competition to marry Dan McFadden, a 
former basketball player at Yale. They later divorced but have two sons, Danny, 
a freshman infielder at El Camino College, and Kevin, a high school soccer 
player who lives with his father in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1968, McFadden was a setter on the U.S. squad that finished eighth at the 
politically charged Olympics in Mexico City. That was the year Mexican troops 
opened fire on several thousand unarmed students who were staging a rally at a 
plaza 10 days before the Games started. It was also the year American sprinters 
Tommie Smith and John Carlos created an uproar with their Black Power salute at 
the medal ceremonies for the men's 200 meters. McFadden remembers the events 
distinctly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got to be very good friends with those guys, especially John Carlos," 
McFadden said. "A group of us went out to dinner the night before (the 
incident). They were in a lot of turmoil and had a lot of feelings. They said 
they were going to do something but didn't say what. 
</P>
<P>
 "I watched them from the stands and I remember thinking, 'What are they 
doing?' We never thought of it being a real big deal." 
</P>
<P>
 McFadden remained with the American team through a sixth-place finish at the 
1971 Pan American Games in Cali, Colombia, but retired before the 1972 Olympics 
in Munich because of tendinitis in the knees. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, McFadden spent several days in Munich, where 11 Israeli athletes were 
murdered -- two in the Olympic Village -- by Palestinian terrorists. Those were 
also the Olympics of glory for Mark Spitz and his seven gold medals in swimming 
and of despair for American sprinters Eddie Hart and Rey Robinson, who missed 
their quarterfinal heats in the 100 meters because of a schedule snafu. 
</P>
<P>
 "John Carlos got me a pass to the Olympic Village and I was there the day 
before the shootings. I was at the airport the day it happened," McFadden said. 
"Later, when I got home, I opened LIFE magazine and saw myself in a picture, 
sitting behind Eddie Hart and Rey Robinson in the stands. Those were a lot of 
exciting times." 
</P>
<P>
 After a hiatus to have her sons, McFadden became a teacher and volleyball 
coach at Punahu in the early '80s and then at El Segundo High from 1986 until 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 She was given the Ventura job when Sharon McAlexander, a friend and former foe 
from UCLA, resigned after last season and recommended McFadden. The Pirates 
were successful under McAlexander -- two WSC titles in four seasons -- and 
McFadden is hoping to keep that tradition alive.

CSUN REACHES SPONSORSHIP AGREEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pepsi-Cola and Cal State Northridge have reached a working agreement that will 
be worth $500,000 to the Matador athletic program over the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement will make Pepsi the official soft drink of Northridge's athletic 
program and award $50,000 a year for the next 10 years to the school's sports 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of the funds will be used to replace the scoreboards at Northridge's 
football-soccer, baseball and softball facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors' football-soccer scoreboard is 23 years old and the scoreboards 
for baseball and softball have been in use for more than 10 years. Pepsi-Cola 
will receive major signage on all Northridge scoreboards. 
</P>
<P>
 "This sponsorship will allow us to begin improving our athletic facilities to 
the standards expected at the NCAA Division I level," Northridge Athletic 
Director Bob Hiegert said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sponsorship went into effect Sept. 14.

WESTLAKE ON LAST LEG OF A LONG ROAD TRIP; HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL: WARRIORS' $1.7 
MILLION ON-CAMPUS STADIUM ON TARGET TO OPEN NEXT SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the Westlake High football team and hundreds of its fans travel to Newbury 
Park tonight for a matchup against Hart in the most-anticipated "home" game of 
the season, they can only hope their $1.7 million on-campus stadium will be 
ready to open next season as planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction crews have been working since Sept. 7 on a hill that overlooks 
the north side of the Westlake practice field. They will build concrete 
bleachers, similar to those at Ventura and Camarillo highs, that will seat 
about 4,000 in a lighted stadium. Since its first varsity season in 1978, 
Westlake has played its home games off campus, primarily at Thousand Oaks High. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Bruno, president of Community Action for the Westlake Stadium (CAWS), said 
the construction should be completed by June. 
</P>
<P>
 Subsequent phases of the construction will include a concession stand, 
restrooms and bleachers on the visitors' side of the field, Bruno said. Plans 
also include a locker room and weight room. Currently, the locker room is on 
the other side of the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to see everything done in the next three years," Bruno said, "but 
it's going to depend on the availability of funds." 
</P>
<P>
 The first phase of construction, which includes concrete bleachers on the 
north side of the field and lights, will cost about $1.7 million -- about 
$300,000 more than the original estimate, said Sarah Hart, Conejo Valley 
Unified School District assistant superintendent of business services. 
</P>
<P>
 The district will pay the additional $300,000 over the next two or three 
years, Hart said, by using a portion of its annual funding from the city of 
Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the initial $1.4 million, $1 million came from the city of Thousand Oaks in 
the form of redevelopment funds, Bruno said. The district donated an initial 
$250,000 and the rest -- about $170,000 -- came from private donations to CAWS, 
donations by booster clubs and money from Westlake High student-body funds, 
Bruno said. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake football Coach Jim Benkert said it will be a welcome change when his 
team is able to play at Westlake next year. Still, he has tried to downplay the 
lack of a stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "There hasn't been a home game here, so it's not like we're missing anything," 
Benkert said. "These kids come in now and they know it's always been this way. 
We're tying to teach them it doesn't matter where we play." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruno said efforts to build a stadium have been in the works since the 1980s, 
but funding was always a stumbling block. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people have agreed that the need was justified in the community," he 
said. "We've been traveling without a stadium since the school opened. Nobody's 
ever had a sense of identity or community pride."

THE SCENE / ORANGE COUNTY: FEEDING THEIR INDEPENDENCE; AT ORANGE COUNTY HIGH 
SCHOOLS, THE RITUAL OF OFF-CAMPUS LUNCHING SATISFIES A HUNGER FOR MORE THAN 
FAST FOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA JONES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Clothing styles, slang and teaching methods might change over the years but, 
in high school, little else does.  
</P>
<P>
 Consider the urge to escape campus at midday -- even for just a short while. 
Students count the final minutes of fourth period until they can dart past the 
lockers, the administrators and the parking lot to the nearest fast-food joint. 
</P>
<P>
 We're talking freedom, pure and unsupervised, with the chance to chow on 
anything the taste buds and budget allow. 
</P>
<P>
 Hit any such restaurant around the noon hour, and the place is thick with 
teens. The excuses for leaving never differ: unappetizing victuals from the 
school kitchen and overcrowding in the cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the student body seems to show up, turning the entire scene into one 
as noisy, pushy and crowded as the school cafeteria. But, hey, it is a scene 
nonetheless, filled with all the buzz and gossip that comes with the privilege 
of leaving school for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 A fast-food eatery on a campus doesn't necessarily ensure students will stay. 
Even with a Taco Bell at San Clemente High School, several hundred students 
venture off campus daily to lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who don't hit the deli at Lucky's market or the neighboring pizza, 
frozen yogurt or doughnut shops head over to the other side of the campus to 
McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
 The freshman football team, dressed in white and red jerseys, storms into the 
golden arches at 12:05. Minutes later, another slew of students, mostly 
freshmen and sophomores, cruise in. Some walk away with a brown bag in hand; 
quite a few find sustenance in a soft vanilla cone; still others fast and just 
accompany their friends who are eating. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Robert Volga just came along with the team because he was supposed to 
meet someone. He can't eat because of a big breakfast he had four hours ago and 
the nerves he's already experiencing four hours before a game.  
</P>
<P>
 The 15-year-old says he's avoided the cafeteria because he's heard "the food 
is not really good." 
</P>
<P>
 "And it's too expensive," adds teammate Brandon Reed, 14. "We need the meat 
and the buns for energy for the games. The food's tasty. I know it's not good 
for you. So I have water and no french fries. Just a regular burger -- no 
fattening cheese." 
</P>
<P>
 No one sits down inside McDonald's. The surrounding green belt and back brick 
wall serve as a dining area, with the football players gathering at one end in 
view of the playing field. At the other sit a dozen stringy-haired "partying" 
kids who take their burgers with a side of nicotine.  
</P>
<P>
 In between wander sophomores Courtney Bloom and Kathy Allen. The duo assumes 
the visible '90s consciousness: they recycle, read, shop at Urban Outfitters 
and eat french fries. But after too many days of fries, they have been known to 
crunch on an apple from Lucky's. 
</P>
<P>
 Courtney, 15, explains that there is no single type of person who leaves 
campus for lunch: popular or loser, artsy or athletic, hungry or not. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who drive like to go off," she says. Seniors and juniors head 10 
minutes down the road to Denny's or Ricardo's Mexican restaurant, she notes. A 
driver license and upperclassman status apparently earn some the right to sit 
down and be waited on. "Some people who smoke go away. We just go so we can 
walk. There's not really any big reason to leave." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, actually, there is, according to Kathy, also 15. "We come here to yell 
at them to pick up their trash," she says, pointing to the football players. 
The area where the team once stood appears tidy. But then she takes me behind 
the wall, where the players have unceremoniously tossed their wrappers and 
waxed cups.  
</P>
<P>
 "When I'm a senior," says Kathy, "I'm going to 'trash can' everyone I see 
littering." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like most rights earned before we're 18, doing lunch off-campus generally 
needs parental approval. Not that everyone who goes off-campus has a pass; its 
common knowledge that no one really ever checks. But if you get caught, it 
could mean detention.  
</P>
<P>
 So Mom or Dad sign a form. That official in turn hands down that precious pass 
to the student. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena Park High junior Serena Orrosquieta's dad did it for her two years ago. 
She heads to Taco Bell almost daily for the burritos and Coke she hankers for 
("I love them," she says). Once in a great while, she visits Pizza Shack across 
the street in a vintage strip mall or neighboring Burger Town, a holdover from 
the era of roller-skating car hops. 
</P>
<P>
 Serena and dozens of other Buena Park High students walk a distance that most 
office-bound folk would only consider by car. Besides the burrito supremes, the 
16-year-old enjoys the "fresh, air-conditioned" atmosphere of her favorite 
eatery to the stuffiness of her school cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, she adds, "It's packed over there. We have too many students this 
year. It's boring over there too." 
</P>
<P>
 Serena saves a table while her sister, Rosio, 14, orders, along with friends 
Imelda Esqueda, 14, Misti Gardner, 16, and Patty Naranjo, 14. Misti maximizes 
her time in line to glide on another coat of red lipstick. Rosio yells out to 
her older sister, repeating her request as if after dozens of burritos this 
would be the day Serena suddenly changes her mind and wants something 
different.  
</P>
<P>
 It isn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a week into ninth grade, Rosio enjoys being included in her sister's 
lunch plans. Their dad agreed to sign a pass for her as he did for Serena in 
her freshman year. She shyly admits that some of her friends find her lucky to 
be able to leave campus. On the days she stayed with her classmates, lunch 
consisted of chips and Coke, sometimes a slice of pizza. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get full fast so I don't have to eat very much," says Rosio. 
</P>
<P>
 Calories and nutritional debates over eating fast food don't bother Misti. 
"I'm an athlete," she declares, confident that fat will never touch her thighs. 
"I'm in cross-country and swimming, so i burn it off real fast." The sophomore 
just started going off-campus for lunch after spending a year trying to 
persuade her parents that it was necessary.  
</P>
<P>
 "I begged and begged and begged my mom," recalls Misti. "She's just scared 
that something could happen off-campus, you know, normal parent stuff."  
</P>
<P>
 So how did Mom finally agree? 
</P>
<P>
 "I told her I'm grown up and the lines at school are too long. (The cafeteria) 
always runs out of stuff before I get there." 
</P>
<P>
 The fun breaks. "We got 14 minutes!" yells out Imelda, a freshman, as she 
reaches the table with a tray. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversation ceases. In fact, much of the place silences as the diners inhale 
their food. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven minutes later, the whole lot of them start dashing out the doors. Rosio 
mechanically chews her last bite standing up and throwing away her trash. 
Serena gives Rosio her wrappers. And they're off. 
</P>

MY TURN: OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; WORKING AT CAMP FOR BLIND A TIME OF 
LEARNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KRISTEN VIEIRA and REPLACEMENT  
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When I accepted a summer job in New York working at a camp for the blind, I 
didn't know what to expect. 
</P>
<P>
 I arrived jet-lagged and tired from traveling all day, but I felt ready for 
whatever was ahead. I met the other helpers at Vacation Camp for the Blind in a 
large room where we gathered in a circle to introduce ourselves. As I observed 
the faces of all these smiling strangers around me, I felt welcomed. They were 
people who had traveled from around the world to work at the camp. I knew it 
was a special place. 
</P>
<P>
 The staff training began. It was a difficult week, but I can't remember 
another time when I learned so much and got to know so many wonderful people. 
We came from different backgrounds, but we all learned to depend on one another 
during the strenuous summer ahead. By the end of camp, we had crossed all race 
and class boundaries and became lifelong friends.  
</P>
<P>
 To help us learn what it is like to be a camper, we ate our meals blindfolded 
and did all of the activities blindfolded. I really learned to appreciate my 
sight, yet I realized that there are many things you can do without it. 
</P>
<P>
 The first week of training flew by and it was time for the campers to arrive. 
I was so scared. Suddenly, I had forgotten everything I had learned and thought 
for sure I would mess up everything. But I surprised myself and did fine. 
</P>
<P>
 The first camp session seemed to race by, but it was hard not to notice the 
campers' excitement. This was their paradise, a place where they could be free 
of the crowded city and staring strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the campers were visually impaired, but some also were mentally or 
physically impaired. I learned that these campers were capable of swimming, 
bowling and much more. Lack of sight didn't stop them from anything at this 
camp.  
</P>
<P>
 I worked frequently with the children. Some of them had visually impaired 
parents or siblings. The children were very accepting and understanding of each 
others' needs. Working with children was the most rewarding part of camp 
because of the "blindness" they had to each other's differences. 
</P>
<P>
 Toward the end of the summer, it was obvious that I was being taught more than 
I could ever teach. My ignorance of people with handicaps was shattered. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sense, I felt like I had come to a place where people can't see so that I 
could learn to see. Vacation Camp for the Blind taught me more about 
understanding and giving myself than anyone or any place ever has. 
</P>
<P>
 I will never forget the memories of VCB or lose sight of how fortunate I am in 
life. I hope that everyone can some day have such a life-changing experience as 
mine. 
</P>
<P>
 * Vacation Camp for the Blind, located in Spring Valley, N.Y., is sponsored by 
Manhattan-based Vision Services for the Blind.

OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; THE VIEW FROM BELOW; YOUNGER KIDS TELL HOW 
THEY SPOT TEEN-AGERS -- AND WHAT THEY THINK OF THEM ('COOL' AND 'YUCKY') 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You probably have a pretty good idea of how teens are perceived by adults. But 
have you ever wondered how teens appear to those younger than you?  
</P>
<P>
 To find out, OC High asked children: What is a teen-ager? What do they do? 
</P>
<P>
 Some sing your praises. Others scoff at your bad habits. Some look up to you 
with envy. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's what kids in South Orange County told OC High correspondent Joslin 
Gemsch, a senior at Capistrano Valley High School, when she asked their opinion 
of teens: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "A teen-ager is 13 or 14, or something with a teen after it. Some are nice and 
some are mean. They drive cars. Some smoke cigarettes, but they shouldn't 
because it is a drug. I don't want to be a teen-ager because when you are 
young, your mom pays for things, and when you are a teen-ager you have to pay 
for them." 
</P>
<P>
 J.D. Silva, 9 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth grade, St. John's Elementary 
</P>
<P>
 "A teen-ager is a smoker. I can't think of one that doesn't. Some are dumb and 
some are good. They listen to rude things on CDs, like "Beavis and Butt-head." 
Those are real bad! I want to be a teen-ager if I don't smoke." 
</P>
<P>
 Kit Mann, 11 
</P>
<P>
 Fifth grade, De Portola Elementary 
</P>
<P>
 "A teen-ager is a young adult finding out who they are. Teen-agers look cool. 
They almost always have a cute outfit on. Some of them look yucky, because they 
probably drank alcohol or beer." 
</P>
<P>
 Alexis Chadburn, 11 
</P>
<P>
 Sixth grade, Newhart Elementary 
</P>
<P>
 "Teen-agers can drink wine and we can't. They drive. They can light matches 
and use candles." 
</P>
<P>
 Devon, 9 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth grade, St. Catherine Elementary 
</P>
<P>
 "Teen-agers are nice. They can't do much more than we can. I want to be a 
teen-ager so I can drive a turquoise convertible." 
</P>
<P>
 Danielle, 6 
</P>
<P>
 Kindergarten, Moulton Elementary 
</P>
<P>
 "I know a teen-ager. She is nice. She does fun stuff with us. She swings us 
around and plays games with us. She gets to go out places without her mom and 
dad. I want to do that. She climbs trees with me. I can't climb them without 
her. Sometimes she baby-sits us. I want to baby-sit. I want to go out without 
my mom and dad. I want to drive a white Jeep." 
</P>
<P>
 Tyler Grigg, 6 
</P>
<P>
 First grade, Castille Elementary 
</P>
<P>
 "Teen-agers like to go to dances. They stay up late. For the worst part, they 
like boys! They wear all kinds of funky clothes, which I like. I'll be a 
teen-ager when I'm 16. I don't want to be a teen-ager because I don't want to 
start dating boys and I don't want to go to high school or college." 
</P>
<P>
 Giana Moloian, 9 
</P>
<P>
 Fifth grade, O'Neil Elementary 
</P>
<P>
 "Teen-agers are nice and really big. I want to be a teen-ager so I can wash 
dishes, drive a car and baby-sit." 
</P>
<P>
 Allison Littman, 5 
</P>
<P>
 Kindergarten, O'Neil Elementary 
</P>
<P>
 "A teen-ager is someone who's older than me. They can drive a car and they can 
stay up 'til midnight. I don't want to be a teen-ager." 
</P>
<P>
 Dalla Malek, 10 
</P>
<P>
 Fifth grade, Mission Hills Elementary 
</P>
<P>
 "I know two teen-agers in Atlanta. They are nice. One gets to drive a car. 
They get to stay up late. When I get older I'll go to bed at something sensible 
-- around 10. I want to play tennis in high school. Teen-agers are advantaged 
and bigger. I don't really know what a teen-ager is." 
</P>
<P>
 Austin Grigg, 9 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth grade, Castille Elementary 
</P>
<P>
 "A teen-ager is a person who sells drugs. Some are bad and some are good. They 
listen to bad music. They do parties with their older friends. I want to be a 
teen-ager so I can get a college degree and learn more." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Bieksha, 10 
</P>
<P>
 Fifth grade, De Portola Elementary 
</P>
<P>
 "A teen-ager is someone who is a young adult. Someone is a teen-ager when they 
are 13 to 19 years old. A teen-ager looks like a kid, but taller. Teen-agers 
are allowed to drive, go places alone, leave home and go to college and get a 
job. When I'm a teen-ager I want to travel to really far places and do really 
fun things." 
</P>
<P>
 Whitney Wintemute, 11 
</P>
<P>
 Sixth grade, Bathgate Elementary 
</P>
<P>
 "A teen-ager is a person who is dumb and does bad stuff. They are weird and 
hang out with friends and have parties. They smoke. Some teen-agers wear a 
chain around their pants. I don't want to be a teen-ager. I don't want to grow 
up. I want to stay a kid." 
</P>
<P>
 Brittany Mann, 8 
</P>
<P>
 Third grade, DePortola Elementary 
</P>
<P>
 "Teen-agers have jobs. They can drive. They go to a school. When I'm a 
teen-ager, I want to go on rides at Disneyland by myself. I like teen-agers a 
lot!" 
</P>
<P>
 Caitlin Bedsworth, 6 
</P>
<P>
 First grade, Reilly Elementary 
</P>
<P>
 "A teen-ager is a big girl. They are nice. Big girls get to play with their 
friends without their mommy. They can spend the night. I want to do those 
things when I get older." 
</P>
<P>
 Tatiana Rose Moloian, 3 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo Christian preschool 
</P>
<P>
 "A teen-ager is someone who's older and 13. Sometimes they are mean and bossy. 
They go to the mall and hang out and they stay up later. I don't know if I want 
to be a teen-ager. When I am a teen-ager, I want to stay up later and 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy Eckard, 10 
</P>
<P>
 Fifth grade, Rancho Elementary 
</P>
<P>
 "They are nice. They dance and hold hands with me. I want to be a big person 
so I can Roller-blade and play soccer." 
</P>
<P>
 Courtney Hall, 5 
</P>
<P>
 Kindergarten, Reilly Elementary 
</P>
<P>
 "A teen-ager is someone in high school. They are big, tall, nice and they eat 
a lot. A teen-ager plays Nerf Force with us. They drive. I sort of want to be a 
teen-ager so I can get closer to driving." 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan Soloman, 9 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth grade, Castille Elementary 
</P>
<P>
 "A teen-ager is someone who's older and can do more things. They are sometimes 
bossy and sometimes nice. Teen-agers can drive cars. I'm not really looking 
forward to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Austin Eckard, 7 
</P>
<P>
 Second grade, Rancho Elementary 
</P>
<P>
 "Teen-agers are stronger. They come to my house and go to the lake and play 
water balloons. I want to be a big girl because I like it."

MUSIC REVIEW; ROYAL NORTHERN COLLEGE SHOWS A WIDE RANGE AT USC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Why do things the usual way? 
</P>
<P>
 That is the question the composers, performers and producers involved in the 
Royal Northern College of Music's music theater/instrumental program Thursday 
night must have asked themselves. It certainly wasn't business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
 A wide-ranging 20th-Century agenda featured unusual combinations and 
imaginative presentations as key elements in the Manchester musicians' second 
offering in Bing Theatre at USC, part of the UK/LA Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 That the music itself and the performances didn't consistently live up to the 
high concept seemed of secondary importance -- though hardly negligible. 
</P>
<P>
 Most satisfying from all aspects was Judith Weir's opera in three acts and 12 
minutes, "King Harald's Saga," for unaccompanied soprano. Based on an Icelandic 
saga that tells the story of the Norwegian's invasion of Britain and subsequent 
defeat and death at Stamford Bridge just 19 days before the Battle of Hastings, 
Weir's opera effectively conjures a feeling of time and place, the singer 
taking all roles and mellifluous music slipping quickly high and low: The 
soprano is both bard and siren.  
</P>
<P>
 Camilla Johansen gave an engrossingly dramatic, liquid-voiced performance, 
roving over the stark setting of platforms and the ribs of a ship. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Oliver's "The Waiter's Revenge," cleverly conveys the vicissitudes of 
a restaurateur with wordless music -- rhythmic anxieties, whining complaints, 
lyrical flights -- for six unaccompanied vocalists, and the RNCM performers 
strutted vitally through it. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuel Barber's short opera, "A Hand of Bridge," for voices and chamber 
orchestra, proved an amusing melange of the thoughts of its four card players, 
who, of course, aren't thinking about the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon Holt's purely instrumental "Kites," for quintets of woodwinds and 
strings, seemed a run-of-the-mill catalogue of contemporary twitterings, 
squiggles, shrieks and snaps, but the dispersal of the performers across the 
stage on different levels, and the projection, in changing colors, of 
developing cloud formations on a rear scrim, gave the work a spacious, lacy, 
almost hypnotic quality. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Bliss' lively, neoclassical "Conversations" (1920), for mixed 
instrumental quintet, suffered from a merely orderly run-through and the lack 
of its descriptive movement titles in the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert, repeating tonight, opened with a crouching, quite naked Mary 
Hitch attempting, as Lady Macbeth, to wash off the blood, in Alison's Bauld's 
"Banquo's Buried," for soprano and piano. But even that startling opening and 
Shakespeare's words couldn't focus the composer's improvisatory noodlings.

DANA PARSONS: A TREASURED MEMENTO OF THE TIMELESS GIFT OF FRIENDSHIP 
</P>

 I suppose Alan Menkes' story could be dismissed as nothing more than that of a 
guy who wants his stolen watch back. Even Menkes concedes it's a cheap watch, 
one that he doesn't wear and that probably costs no more than 10 or 20 bucks, 
tops. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, why would he go to the trouble to tell the tale in a diary he was 
keeping for his unborn daughter? Why, in the midst of momentous entries about 
world events and her parents' exultant anticipation of her birth, would he 
digress and tell her a story about an ordinary watch with a brown leather 
strap? 
</P>
<P>
 It's best to let the diary speak for itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Menkes, a 51-year-old physician who retired in 1990 as the result of injuries 
from a car accident and now lives in Laguna Beach, writes in his diary that the 
story starts in 1983 at George Air Force Base in Victorville, shortly after 
Menkes joined the reserves. One Saturday afternoon, Menkes was at the base 
tailor shop for alterations to his ill-fitting uniform. The tailor, he 
explains, was a man named Mark Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
 The sergeant accompanying Menkes bluntly told the tailor the uniform was 
needed the next day. Pushing it back across the counter, the tailor said that 
was impossible. Two weeks, maybe. 
</P>
<P>
 "As he was pushing my uniform back to the sergeant, I noticed not only his 
foreign accent but a tattoo of several numbers burned into his left forearm, a 
pale blue coloring of the digits," Menkes writes. "I stepped up to the counter 
and spoke in Yiddish. His little dark eyes sparkled and moistened as he said 
back to me in Yiddish, 'Please follow me.' "He stopped all his other work, took 
me into the fitting room and pinned my new uniform. When we came out from 
behind the dressing room curtains, he said loudly enough for all, including the 
pushy sergeant, to hear, 'Colonel, please come back in an hour and I will have 
the uniform pressed and waiting.' " 
</P>
<P>
 From there, the doctor and the tailor of limited financial resources struck up 
a friendship that continued after Menkes' reserve stint. Although Menkes' 
practice was 80 miles away, Alexander became his patient. "I never charged him 
a fee for my services," he writes. "His wife would cook special meals for him 
to take to my office, since I wouldn't take money and they were very proud 
people. I knew he couldn't afford the gas and wear-and-tear on his car to drive 
160 miles each monthly visit, but he insisted. He would alter clothes for me in 
the office. He also told me about his life in the Nazi concentration camp 
during the Holocaust of World War II." 
</P>
<P>
 The tailor told Menkes of being taken away as a young teen. He had been at the 
camp for 90 days, Menkes relates in his diary, when the commandant told him he 
would personally shoot him the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alexander said he was still able to sleep that night because his whole family 
was already murdered and he had nothing to live for that he could see," Menkes 
writes. The next day, according to the tailor's story, his "execution" was 
thwarted when Allied forces reached the camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, yes, the watch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyway, back to the issue of the watch," Menkes writes in the diary. 
"Alexander bought it for me for my retirement, even though I knew he couldn't 
afford it. He said it was to always remember him. It was not very expensive but 
obviously very priceless." 
</P>
<P>
 Eight days ago, the watch was stolen from a shelf next to Menkes' exercise 
machine. Menkes used the watch to time his workouts, and he told police he 
suspects it was taken by one of the men doing temporary work at his home. 
Police later confronted the man, but he denied knowledge of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Menkes hopes the word about the watch's sentimental value somehow gets to 
whoever is the thief. He said he'll offer the watch's value in cash if it's 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
 In the diary, Menkes ended the story this way: "There is no way to replace the 
watch. The only other treasure of his memory I will also always have is you, my 
darling. Your first birth name is Alexandra, in honor of Mark. I hope you are 
as proud of that as I."

 A week ago today -- the day after that entry -- Menkes and his wife, Laura, 
welcomed 7-pound, 6-ounce Alexandra Holden Menkes into the world. Alexandra had 
been the name Laura favored, not realizing why her husband so willingly agreed 
to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Why did you tell the story of the watch, I asked Menkes this week. Partly, he 
said, as a way for his daughter to learn someday about her Jewish heritage. 
Mostly, he said, it was because Alexander "was the sweetest, kindest man I ever 
met and who never had a bad word to say about anybody. That's the kind of 
person I'd like her to be." 
</P>
<P>
 I asked Menkes if he has any hope of seeing the watch again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I'm going to get it back," he said Thursday morning, holding his 
week-old daughter. "I really have that feeling."
