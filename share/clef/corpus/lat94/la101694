 CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
<P>
 * LOW-INCOME HOUSING PROJECT: Authorized the Housing Department to issue a 
$196,000 loan to Esperanza Community Housing Corp., a nonprofit organization 
that recently renovated the four-unit Maple Mae low-income housing project at 
2902 S. Maple Ave. The money will be used to pay off a loan that Esperanza used 
to pay for the renovation, much of which was done by youths from the Los 
Angeles Conservation Corps. The work included landscaping, painting and 
installation of new carpeting. 
</P>
<P>
 * LAS PALOMAS HOTEL: Authorized the city's Housing Department to issue a 
$2.1-million loan to a nonprofit group, A Community of Friends, for 
rehabilitation of the Las Palomas Hotel at 2203 E. 1st St. The hotel, built in 
1925, is vacant and severely dilapidated. A Community of Friends, created to 
provide housing for homeless and mentally disabled people, plans to renovate 
the hotel. Work will include seismic reinforcement, lead and asbestos 
abatement, upgrading plumbing and adding bathrooms to each room. 
</P>
<P>
 * TEMPORARY CLOSURE OF ALLEY: Initiated proceedings to have the alley next to 
the 1600 block of South St. Andrews Place temporarily closed to deter a variety 
of problems, including drug trafficking, prostitution, loitering and dumping of 
trash. Residents in the area have submitted a petition to Councilman Nate 
Holden's office requesting that the alley be closed with gates. As a formality, 
the motion first has to have the approval of the Board of Public Works, which 
is expected soon. HOW THEY VOTED 
</P>
<P>
 How South-Central and Eastside City Council representatives voted on selected 
issues.  
</P>
<P>
 * FEDERAL GRANT FOR BUSINESS STUDY: Authorized the city's director of planning 
to accept a $1.2-million grant from the federal government to fund a study of 
ways to create incentives for businesses to locate near bus and subway stops. 
Increasing business traffic around those stops presumably would increase public 
transit ridership. Passed 12-0. Voting yes: Richard Alatorre, Jackie Goldberg, 
Mike Hernandez, Nate Holden, Mark Ridley-Thomas, Rudy Svorinich Jr. Absent: 
Rita Walters. 
</P>
<P>
 * FUNDS FOR CHILD-CARE CENTER: Authorized the Community Development Department 
to issue $167,751 to Children's Collective Inc. for the formation of a 
child-care center at the Youth Opportunities Unlimited Alternative High School 
at 943 W. 85th St. The center is to serve 16 children. Passed 12-0. Voting yes: 
Alatorre, Goldberg, Hernandez, Holden, Ridley-Thomas. Absent: Svorinich, 
Walters. MICHAEL KRIKORIAN

FIGURES IN THE NIGHT; REMBRANDT'S DEAD WIFE AND TWO DEAD CHILDREN ARE 
IMMORTALIZED IN THE "NIGHT WATCH"; REMBRANDT'S NIGHT WATCH: THE MYSTERY 
REVEALED, BY GEORGES BOKA IN COLLABORATION WITH BERNARD COURTEAU (LES EDITIONS 
EMILE-NELLIGAN, MONTREAL: $22; 117 PP.)  
</P>

<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robertson Davies, Robertson Davies is the author, most recently, of The 
Cunning Man (forthcoming from Viking).

<TEXT>
<P>
 There are a few pictures that seize the public fancy and are known far beyond 
the world of art appreciation and criticism. Such are the "Mona Lisa," the 
"Birth of Venus," "Guernica" and Rembrandt's "Night Watch," which is the 
subject of this monograph by the Montreal portrait painter, Georges Boka. It is 
a handsome little book, and its title promises great things -- nothing less 
than the revelation of a mystery. What is the mystery? 
</P>
<P>
 First, however, what is the picture? Called the "Night Watch," its proper 
title is "The Corporalship of Captain Banning Coq's Civic Guard"; corporalship 
is a word no longer used, meaning a body of soldiers under the command of a 
corporal of the field, who was a much greater person in the armies of the 16th 
and 17th centuries than the name now implies. In 1638 Banning Coq commissioned 
this picture as one of six that were to decorate the new hall in the 
Klovenieisdoelen Armoury; the finest Amsterdam painters were to do the work, 
and of these Rembrandt was not the most admired; that was Govert Flinck, a 
pupil of Rembrandt, who was asked for two pictures. When Rembrandt's picture 
was completed it caused some dissatisfaction, for several members of the Civic 
Guard had contributed to its cost and they complained that they were not 
commensurately prominent in the picture; some were in profile, and several were 
in shadow. The picture as we now have it is incomplete, for in 1715 it was 
heavily trimmed on its left side and three characters were thus lost. 
Consequently the picture we see now is not in the proportions Rembrandt 
planned, and this is important to Georges Boka's argument. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-three people, however, are to be seen, and when first we look at it we 
can understand the dissatisfaction of some of them with the way in which they 
are presented. It is a magnificent picture, filled with action and high 
spirits, but it does not look much like a military assembly. People are rushing 
about, people are talking to one another apparently unheeding of the orders of 
Captain Banning Coq who stands dead in the middle of the front, like the star 
in an opera. Their costumes are not military uniform in any modern sense; 
everyone is dressed differently, and a student of costume will observe that 
some of the outfits are of a time far earlier than 1638. These men are supposed 
to be harquebusiers (gunners) but not many have brought their weapons. They 
seem to be bursting out of an arch in an old building, but it is not a building 
anybody in Amsterdam could identify. To the artistic eye, the picture is an 
undoubted masterpiece, but to the military eye it is inexcusable confusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Banning Coq's division of the Civic Guard, we know, was not in the strictest 
sense a military assembly. These were citizens of Amsterdam, who had joined 
this militia group much as one might join a distinguished club; it conferred 
prestige. Members devised their own military dress, which might incorporate 
armor from an ancestor, and fanciful headdress. They were not, we may suppose, 
the best drilled of military men, but could they have been in such a tumble as 
this picture presents? On the other hand, would a more orderly assemblage have 
made such a fine picture? Which of the other five have survived, and how do 
they compare with this? 
</P>
<P>
 Now for the mystery, which Georges Boka tells us he has revealed. There are 
figures in the picture who are so finely involved in the composition that we do 
not notice at once how incongruous they are. There is a dog, but a dog among a 
group of soldiers is not a reason for astonishment. But what about the figure 
that seems to be the real focus of attention, and draws our eyes from the 
resplendent captain? A small woman, almost a dwarf, or a fairy, radiant with 
light and dressed in golden garments; behind her head we see two children, one 
somewhat vaguely depicted. At the woman's girdle hang a number of objects, one 
of which is a chicken. Children might very well crowd to see soldiers 
assembling, but surely they would be street urchins, and not finely dressed, 
radiant creatures such as these. What are they doing in the picture at all? 
That is the mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 Georges Boka's explanation is that they are Rembrandt's dead wife, Saskia, and 
their two dead children, and that thus, by a bold stroke, the painter has 
immortalized them. It was not a day when painters and other artists were 
allowed the freedom they have now. Rembrandt and his Dutch contemporaries 
regarded themselves as first and foremost superior tradesmen; they kept shops 
in which their pictures were offered for sale. That a painter should so fly in 
the face of a distinguished client as to include extraneous portraits in a 
group picture like this would have been unheard of. But Rembrandt, if Boka is 
right, got away with it. Did no one ask at the time who these unlikely figures 
were? We do not know. 
</P>
<P>
 With several diagrams dividing the picture and explaining its relationships, 
Georges Boka has supported his argument. There are two figures in the "Night 
Watch" that may be portraits of Rembrandt himself; it was the custom of the day 
for painters to include themselves in groups, rather as Alfred Hitchcock liked 
to be seen fleetingly in his own movies. Both of these possible Rembrandts has 
only one eye showing, but that eye can be connected by a direct line with the 
eye of the fairy-figure of the woman, who may be Saskia. Boka has also a 
complex argument to the effect that several cabalistic symbols are contained in 
the picture, and that these relate to Rembrandt's known intimacy with the 
Amsterdam Jews, and his interest in their mysticism -- an interest plainly to 
be seen in his familiar picture of Dr. Faust. How strong this line of argument 
is I cannot determine, and must leave it to those to whom the cabala is 
familiar. But it is at this point, it seems to me, that Boka carries his 
argument rather beyond its strength. 
</P>
<P>
 The interpretation of pictures can lead to extraordinary conclusions. In 1983 
an art critic named Jack Leslau interpreted a picture by Holbein of the family 
of Sir Thomas More and with immense ingenuity and elaboration showed that 
Richard III did not murder the little princes in the Tower, and that instead 
they grew to manhood, the one disguised as Sir Edward Guildford, and the other 
as Dr. John Clement, a distinguished physician who married Thomas More's 
adopted daughter Margaret. This interpretation, to put it mildly, has not been 
widely accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 In his consideration of the "Night Watch" Boka has worked on the picture as it 
was before it was radically cleaned in 1985, and was revealed to have been a 
day scene; as the Connoisseur tartly remarked, in March, 1986, "neither a Watch 
nor Golden." 
</P>
<P>
 How much mystery disappeared with the grime of the years? Yet the golden woman 
and the children remain, and what Boka says must be weighed carefully.

MIND OVER MADNESS; HAUNTING THINGS THAT INSINUATE THEMSELVES INTO REAL LIVES; 
THE ZOO WHERE YOU'RE FED TO GOD, BY MICHAEL VENTURA (SIMON & SCHUSTER: $21; 255 
PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ron Carlson, Ron Carlson's most recent book is the story collection Plan B 
for the Middle Class. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nervous breakdown is a term famous and useful for its imprecision; it 
encompasses a multitude of maladies, some slight, some grim. It can be a weekly 
problem brought on by the laundry or an extended season of mental anguish 
brought on by forces never fully understood. In Michael Ventura's engaging new 
novel "The Zoo Where You're Fed to God," he explores something closer to the 
latter, but with idiosyncratic permutations that make it at times feel like a 
clinical ailment that might have a five-syllable name and at times like an 
intense visionary madness. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the book is James Abbey, a 50-year-old surgeon, who has come 
into a dark time in his life. Ventura's choice here, of a doctor incapable of 
healing himself, a stoic pragmatist, who begins confronting impractical 
vexations, is a significant part of the novel's depth. As the good doctor moves 
through the many passages of his dread, he understands fully the physiological 
responses in his every activity, but not what is really happening. Seasoned by 
his medical work "one big mangled body," which he must operate on endlessly, 
he's begun to see all of life "through the knife." 
</P>
<P>
 As the novel opens he's living alone in the Echo Park section of Los Angeles, 
separated from his wife, Elizabeth, and Eddie, his 11-year-old son. His divorce 
is explained as having resulted from the doctor's "sensitivities" -- another 
euphemism for his "condition" -- and the first thrilling paragraph sets out his 
paradox: 
</P>
<P>
 "He became a surgeon because he was afraid of knives. He got married because 
he was afraid of women. He had a child because he was afraid of responsibility. 
Now, his marriage over and his child no longer speaking to him, he turned off 
the lights in the house because he was afraid of the dark." 
</P>
<P>
 The book locks on and sustains an intense interior tone almost all of it from 
inside the doctor's mind. He dwells on things, words, rotating them slowly like 
objects removed during surgery, scrutinizing, wondering, evaluating. It is a 
highly effective point of view because Ventura stays uncannily close. It gains 
credibility simply because the doctor sounds not like a character in a book but 
like a free agent trying to think his way to a foothold. Even when Dr. Abbey 
goes to the zoo and begins hearing voices, instructions from his dear tigers, 
the kind of beat that has unmoored other narratives, we stay in, because the 
thinking is neither grand nor deft, but true and painful. 
</P>
<P>
 The plot that is the skeleton of linked events in this cerebral book involves 
the doctor's estrangement from his son, Eddie, a child who is written with a 
delicacy and accuracy that makes him matter. At 11 he knows everything and 
nothing by turns, but he is aware of his emotional life and his place between 
these two confused adults. A standout player in this drama is the therapist, 
Dr. Benjamin, who breaks the stereotype with more panache and verve than we've 
seen for a while; he takes over his sections of the book and even his last 
phone message is a treasure. What a pleasure to encounter a secondary player in 
a novel who has enough heat to create a place and amplify everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 At the zoo, in the midst of his descent, as confused and consumed as he's 
been, the doctor meets -- and this may be the right term here -- a kindred 
spirit, the equally intense Lee, a woman about 22 or 23, who has some troubles 
of her own. She kind of knows what's going on with him, she loves things deeply 
too, and they form, no surprise, a stunning kinship that becomes -- in a 
surprising way -- key to the novel. Their dialogue about what's going on and 
what's OK is the deep center of this book; they meet on a wavelength that feels 
dangerous and fragile and what they make of it and take from it opens the 
ending of this story. 
</P>
<P>
 A novel like this can be frustrating as it ventures onto the thin ice of the 
abstract ways the mind works. Are the doctor's troubles the result of his 
religious mother? Are his new revelations the result of the old? Is he just 
another modern man who has seen -- through his knife -- into the abyss? In the 
end here, its ambiguities don't harm the book. At one point Lee tells the 
doctor, whom she calls "Doc": "There aren't any bad guys here, that's the 
trouble. That's why our stories aren't in the movies." And he responds, "As 
many bad guys as there are in the world, there still aren't enough to make life 
as simple as we want it to be." This novel's greatest strength, in fact results 
from Ventura's not being afraid of things without easy names, haunting things 
that insinuate themselves into real lives, complicated things. 
</P>
<P>
 The nervous doctor in this powerful book faces dread by connecting with the 
animal world and he begins to break down the membrane between terror and 
paradise.

RICHARD EDER: WHERE THE CHARIOTS WERE ENGULFED; NEAR-MISSES IN THE VIETNAM WAR; 
IN PHARAOH'S ARMY: MEMORIES OF THE LOST WAR, BY TOBIAS WOLFF (ALFRED A. KNOPF: 
$23; 221 PP.)

<P>
 Imagine the button; the notorious and apocryphal button -- it is a set of 
keys, I believe -- that was available through the Cold War, and since, for 
unleashing Armageddon. Would it be black plastic like a doorbell buzzer? Or 
brushed steel like the on-off in an expensive sound system? Might it squeak 
when pressed? Would it bear the faint sheen of mayonnaise from a sandwich lunch 
at the desk -- the President touching it lightly while thinking large and 
lonely thoughts? 
</P>
<P>
 It is the button or its equivalent that Tobias Wolff considers in these 13 
pieces from the Vietnam War. He approaches its horror somewhat as Hannah Arendt 
approached the horror of an Adolf Eichmann: through the banality, the small 
things, the casual human expedients which, hitched to a mighty killing 
technology and a distant and abstract purpose, caused such wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
 He does not deal with a My Lai massacre, as Tim O'Brien has just done in "In 
the Lake of the Woods," but with the near-misses. There are civilians killed, 
as well as soldiers from both sides, but Wolff writes less of the bullets 
tearing flesh than of the long demoralization, dirt and moral carelessness that 
wield a high-powered weapon and corrode its safety catch. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Pharaoh's Army" is one of the genuine literary works produced by a war 
that, perhaps without our quite noticing, has given us several: Michael Herr's 
"Dispatches," Tim O'Brien's "Going After Cacciato" and, only two years ago, his 
"The Things They Carried." "Things" came 18 years after the war ended; Wolff's 
book comes 20 years after. If this seems belated or out of date, it is not. 
Wars can take as long to mature as the olive trees -- a quarter of a century -- 
that they destroy. "The Red Badge of Courage" came 30 years after the Civil 
War. It was 50 years after Napoleon's invasion of Russia that Tolstoy wrote 
"War and Peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Where Herr and O'Brien write with passionate immediacy, Wolff's style is 
finely distilled, ironic, apparently distant. It is the difference between the 
romantic and the classical. But out of Wolff's distances come an unexpected 
tremor, a phrase that rips like lightning, an elusive design that completes 
itself in sudden revelation. 
</P>
<P>
 The 13 sketches are drawn from Wolff's service in Vietnam and narrated in the 
first person. They have a fictional finish to them, but only one -- an 
elaborate vignette about a bloodthirsty Ivy League spook who is also an 
aesthete of war -- seems excessively contrived. Wolff's narrative has a 
crystalline transparency; his stories hold us, relinquish us to engaging 
side-trips, and bring us back as we begin to need to get back. They draw a 
picture and undermine it just enough to set up tension without destroying it. 
At the end, a sequence or a phrase will frequently appear that make it evident 
how much more we were seeing than we were aware of. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolff got away from a torturous childhood -- he wrote magnificently in "This 
Boy's Life" of his mother and his estranged con-man father -- by joining the 
army. It would make him, perhaps, a "man of honor" and provide nutrients for 
budding as a writer. 
</P>
<P>
 He gung-ho'd his way through basic training, parachute school and the Special 
Forces program. The warrior self-image died there -- "I simply ceased to 
inhabit my pose" -- but he went on to officer candidate school, graduating 49th 
out of the 49 who didn't wash out. One reason he was retained, he suspects, was 
because he was in charge of writing the traditional graduation skit. "They kept 
me on to produce a farce," he writes. "That is how I became an officer in the 
U.S. Army." Wolff can do the easy line; he is enough of an artist not to 
disdain it, because we will need it for the harder lines to come. 
</P>
<P>
 In Vietnam, having studied Vietnamese, he was seconded from the Special Forces 
to act as liaison with a South Vietnamese artillery battalion in the Delta, 
instead of going north where the heavy fighting took place. The assignment 
provided him with his vision: the war not as dramatic destruction but as a 
terrible erosion. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for the Tet offensive -- of which he gives a wonderfully effective 
account -- there was little frontal confrontation. The Americans had to contend 
with snipers, ambushes and mines; with a hidden enemy whose depredations were 
too frequent to allow anything but constant tension, and too sporadic to keep 
them at any kind of fighting pitch. Visiting the big U.S. base at Dong Tam, he 
finds mud, dilapidation, purposelessness and the pervading stench of badly kept 
latrines. 
</P>
<P>
 "At Dong Tam I saw something that wasn't allowed for in the national myth -- 
our capacity for collective despair. People here seemed in the grip of 
unshakable petulance. It was in the slump of their shoulders and the plodding 
way they moved. A sourness had settled over the base, spoiling and coarsening 
the men. The resolute imperial will was all played out here at empire's fringe, 
lost in rancor and mud. Here were pharaoh's chariots engulfed; his horsemen 
confused; and all his magnificence dismayed." 
</P>
<P>
 This comes in the book's first chapter, but there is much more at work. Wolff 
and Sgt. Benet, a seasoned black veteran of Korea, are stationed with their 
Vietnamese battalion, miles away. They lack the base's security and its PX 
comforts. They visit it to scrounge; what they have to offer by way of trade 
are Viet Cong trophies: battle-flags, belt-buckles, Chinese rifles. They get 
them from the Vietnamese troops and provide them with PX cognac, cigarettes and 
watches. Whether the trophies are authentic is another matter; however, Wolff 
reasons, they are manufactured by the same artisans who furnish them to the 
Viet Cong. It is a question, if you will, of bypassing the middleman. 
</P>
<P>
 So much for squalor and irony. But there is more. Before we get to Dong Tam we 
see Wolff and Benet barreling along a jungle road, the floor of their vehicle 
padded with sandbags as illusory protection against mines. They come to a knot 
of Vietnamese standing in the road; conceivably it could be an ambush, and they 
don't slow down. At the last moment the Vietnamese jump out of the way, but 
their bicycles are crushed. A little slower and they would have been crushed. 
</P>
<P>
 A massacre, a tiny My Lai if you like, that didn't happen but could have. 
Somehow, because there was no actual horror, we see more clearly what underlay 
the horror. And finally, to hammer in the theme of banality: The reason that 
Wolff and Benet were speeding down the road was to trade for a color TV at Dong 
Tam. It is Thanksgiving and they wanted to watch the "Bonanza" special on 
something better than their black-and-white set. 
</P>
<P>
 Irony often; the tailings from an iron story. It is wrought-iron, bent with a 
skill and sometimes a beauty that allows it to reflect light, as well as bear 
weight. Many passages that begin with a sardonic chill end in ghostly 
compassion. A fellow officer buys seven suits plus sports coats from a Hong 
Kong tailor. His sartorial future is set, except that he is killed. Wolff tries 
to imagine friends or relatives in America wearing the suits, "but what I see 
instead is a dark closet with all his clothes hanging in a row. Someone opens 
the closet door, looks at them for a time, and closes the door again."

YOSSARIAN, 30 YEARS LATER; 'CATCH 22' DEFINED A GENERATION'S VIEW OF WAR. NOW 
HELLER REACHES BEYOND WAR TO TACKLE DEATH; CLOSING TIME, BY JOSEPH HELLER 
(SIMON & SCHUSTER: $24; 464 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bill Broyles, William Broyles Jr. is the author of Brothers in Arms and the 
co-creator of China Beach. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1962, Joseph Heller took war to the surreal limits of its twisted, 
death-obsessed logic. "Catch-22's" hero, the bombardier Yossarian, wanted only 
to get back home, back to where he would be safe; he wanted the war to end, he 
wanted out. 
</P>
<P>
 After surviving his own near-fatal illness and now past 70, Joseph Heller 
doesn't find home so safe anymore, and he can't let the war end. It's the only 
thing that makes sense. The war isn't absurd any more, it's the world that has 
gone mad. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Closing Time," Yossarian's contemporary journey through "normal" life gets 
the full Heller comic treatment, which has by now worn thin. But what redeems 
this novel is Heller's retelling of "Catch 22" (and, for good measure, that 
other darkly comic World War II classic, Kurt Vonnegut's 
"Slaughterhouse-Five"). This time Heller tells the war straight. When he isn't 
trying to be funny he renders it with piteous, realistic, at times stunning, 
power. 
</P>
<P>
 Having once decided that realism was inadequate to convey the absurdity of 
war, Heller has now, as death comes in its normal, quotidian way, realized that 
the final absurdity is life itself. "Nowhere in his lifetime, Yossarian was 
bound often to remember, not in wartime Rome or Pianosa or even in blasted 
Naples or Sicily, had he been spectator to such atrocious squalor as he saw 
mounting up all around him." 
</P>
<P>
 The main characters of "Closing Time" all survived the war, so it has become a 
strangely comforting refuge for them: the moment they defeated death. But 
"Closing Time" smells more like death than "Catch 22" ever did. It's not the 
smell of cordite, but of urine-soaked sidewalks and the disinfectant of 
hospital corridors. Like "Death in Venice," "Closing Time" is an old man's 
story. 
</P>
<P>
 The characters keep giving parting advice to their wives and children: Read 
Camus, buy real estate. But it's not clear that anyone listens. Their children 
are clueless, the world is a wasteland. Everything is less now. Coney Island is 
a hellacious slum. The towers of Rockefeller Center seem smaller. The heroes of 
the past, the kids who went off to defeat Hitler, are shriveling away. Their 
era is coming to an end. As old men often do, Heller makes his own impending 
end synonymous with the end of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Closing Time" interweaves two journeys. Yossarian is obsessed with dying. He 
happens to be in perfect health, which is the bad news, since that means he can 
only get worse. He becomes a wisecracking, priapic, hypochondriac Siegfried on 
a mythic/comic descent -- 'my Rhine journey" -- into hell, which is located 
both in and beneath the Port Authority Bus Terminal (the PABT). Compared to the 
PABT, with its crack-heads promising vile acts for cash, the hell underground 
is a pretty nice place, complete with rides from the Coney Island of Heller's 
youth. 
</P>
<P>
 The plot of this journey is loosely constructed around Yossarian organizing a 
society wedding at the PABT for Milo Minderbinder's daughter and helping Milo 
sell the "M&ME&A Sub-Supersonic Invisible and Noiseless Defensive Second-Strike 
Offensive Attack Bomber." "It won't work. Right M2?" Yossarian asks Milo's son. 
"We guarantee it." Well, it doesn't quite turn out that way. 
</P>
<P>
 His journey takes Yossarian across the River Styx (the old Coney Island Tunnel 
of Love) into the Land of the Dead, where he meets everyone from Gen. Leslie 
Groves of the Manhattan Project to Sylvia Plath. From time to time he wonders 
whatever happened to Little Sammy Singer, the unnamed tail gunner from "Catch 
22" who kept passing out over Avignon while Yossarian was trying in vain to 
save the life of Snowden, the mortally wounded waist gunner. As it happens, 
Singer thinks about Yossarian all the time. They haven't seen each other since 
the war, and in "Closing Time" their lives finally converge. 
</P>
<P>
 The second journey in the book is that of Little Sammy and his boyhood friend 
Lew Rabinowitz, who was in the infantry in Europe. For Lew, the war meant being 
a POW in Dresden, a tough Jew confronting his Nazi guards in German. Here he is 
coming out of the bunker after the bombing of Dresden: 
</P>
<P>
 "In the morning when they led us up outside into the rain, everyone else was 
dead. They were dead in the street, burned black into stubs and turned brown by 
the ash still dropping from the layers of smoke going up everywhere. They were 
dead in the blackened houses in which the wood had all burned and dead in the 
cellars. The churches were gone and the opera house had tilted over and fallen 
in the square . . . all around us, as far as we could see, everyone was dead, 
men, women, and children, every parrot, cat, dog and canary." 
</P>
<P>
 Sammy and Lew talk of putting their lives together after the war and their 
battles with age and sickness with simple, moving elegance. Sammy went to work 
for Time and led a careful, circumscribed life. Lew, the tough guy, made the 
junk business work but can't fight the cancer eating away at his strong body. 
Sammy's wife has died and he has lost his job, so he visits Lew in the hospital 
and talks about old times, about Coney Island and the war. Lew thinks to 
himself, "I'm beginning to feel, like my father felt when he got old, and his 
brother too, that this time things are beginning to come to an end." 
</P>
<P>
 Yossarian and Singer are reunited at Lew's bedside. The meeting is a classic 
of two old veterans trying to sort through the fog of the past to return to the 
crystalline moments that united them forever. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's funny about Snowden," Singer hesitated. "I didn't know him that well." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd never noticed him." 
</P>
<P>
 "But now I feel like he was one of my closest friends." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have that feeling too." 
</P>
<P>
 The recollections of the war play beneath the operatic, absurdist contemporary 
story like subtitles. Memory works its way to the surface like bits of shrapnel 
from old wounds. These stories are told with power, wisdom, directness and 
great strength. When it simply tells these stories, this book is disturbingly 
real and smart. When it tries to be funny, it is too often contrived and dumb. 
</P>
<P>
 The virtuoso wordplay, the hidden erudition, the inside jokes (Joseph Kaye, "a 
good soldier named Schweik," Kurt Vonnegut and even Joey Heller himself appear, 
among others) wear thin. Yes, the Thomas Mann references are interesting, yes, 
the operatic themes pay off, and yes, it is fun to follow all the references to 
other novels and movies, from Kafka to "Doctor Strangelove" and even including 
this one: "Then it's just like Catch 22, isn't it?"' the Vice President blurted 
out. . . . "I can't appoint a chief justice until I'm the president, and he 
can't swear me in until I appoint him. Isn't that a Catch 22?" 
</P>
<P>
 The reader often wishes for an editor, just to keep the story going and to cut 
out the bad jokes, the repetitions and the tedious explanations of what we have 
just read. But for all that, the mythic dimensions of what Heller is trying to 
accomplish commands respect. In "Catch 22" Heller made us look at war in a new 
way. In "Closing Time" he does the same with death. It's an even harder job, 
because the people we send on missions to find out about it don't come back. 
</P>
<P>
 Heller is determined to get beneath the surface: of New York, of our memories, 
of life itself. He fails. But not from lack of trying. Heller has taken on the 
big stuff, gone into the ring, as Norman Mailer might have said, with the big 
heavyweights: Homer, Joyce, Dante, Goethe, Mann. You do that, you're going to 
take a few hits. 
</P>
<P>
 The great irony is that the war here stands for life, for what is worth 
clinging to. And all around him, in the wreckage of our civilization, Yossarian 
and his generation see only death. No matter how much he works at it, Heller 
just can't make that funny. 
</P>
<P>
 It is, truly, "Closing Time." Lights out.

BEEING THERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kevin Cook's sensitive article about the killer bees ("Here They Come," Sept. 
18) is the best thing from the media I've seen lately. I've been thoroughly 
disgusted by too many well-dressed announcers trumpeting the arrival of the 
bees without really offering any intelligent perspective.As a professional 
designer and avid gardener, I've been enjoying handing out appropriate flyers 
from the Cooperative Extension Department of UC San Diego and thus diffusing 
some panic. 
</P>
<P>
 On a personal note, I've worked side by side with bees in the garden for years 
and feel saddened that there will be an end to a satisfying relationship.

 There is a consensus among ethologists that eye contact between two animals of 
like or different species is paramount to establishing a position of dominant 
behavior. Primates do it. Birds do it. And even the family dog, in its 
perpetually recessive mental state, thrives on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Try it on the tabby, though, and all you are likely to get is one big 
kiss-off. However, such is not the case for all felines; a primary rule of the 
mountain trail is to avoid "interoculuscontactus" with a cougar in its own 
domain. The consequences could be fatal. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of important questions that perhaps Cook could answer: Should there 
be an attempt to make eye contact with a killer bee? And if so, which one?

COVER STORY: SURVIVAL OF THE SPIRIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am Mary Brave Bird. After I had my baby during the siege of Wounded Knee 
they gave me a special name -- Ohitika Win, Brave Woman -- and fastened an 
eagle plume in my hair, singing brave-heart songs for me. I am a woman of the 
Red Nation, a Sioux woman. That is not easy.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Mary Crow Dog, "Lakota Woman" 
</P>
<P>
 "Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would be watching my life on 
screen," says Mary Crow Dog, who wrote the 1990 bestseller "Lakota Woman" with 
Richard Erdoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Crow Dog, who was born Mary Brave Bird, was on the set nearly every day last 
fall for the filming of "Lakota Woman: Siege at Wounded Knee." The drama, which 
premieres Sunday on TNT, was shot in and around the Black Hills of South 
Dakota. "It brought back a lot of memories," Crow Dog says softly. "It was 
pretty powerful." 
</P>
<P>
 Born on the Rosebud Sioux Reservation in South Dakota, Crow Dog, 41, grew up, 
fatherless, in a one-room cabin. Like most Native American children at that 
time, she was sent to Catholic missionary school, where students were forced to 
assimilate into the white culture. Their hair was cut. They were taught English 
and Catholicism. 
</P>
<P>
 "The boys were mistreated," Crow Dog says. "We got whipped too, but the boys 
got their heads shaved and they got whipped really hard. It was hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Crow Dog rebelled and joined the then-fledgling American Indian 
Movement, the controversial organization that seeks to restore pride in Native 
American ways. In 1973, Crow Dog was one of 2,000 Native Americans who occupied 
the sacred Wounded Knee burial ground for 71 days to protest alleged violations 
of Native American rights and demand a U.S. Senate investigation. The 
occupation ended after two AIM members were killed and two federal agents 
wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the protest unity and turmoil at Wounded Knee, Crow Dog gave birth to a 
son, Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lakota Woman," produced by Jane Fonda's Fonda Films, features virtually an 
all-Native American cast. The crew is 44% Native American -- the highest 
proportion of Native Americans ever to work behind the camera on a major film. 
"Lakota Woman" also is part of Turner Broadcasting Inc.'s company-wide Native 
American initiative this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Frank Pierson, whose previous films have included the controversial 
TV movies "Citizen Cohn" and "Somebody Has to Shoot the Picture," did not want 
to impose his own point of view. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt very much I was trying to express a feeling that relates to what it 
feels like to live in that Indian culture within the language, the tradition, 
the habits and the way daily life is lived there," he explains. "It was very 
important that I listen, hear and see as much as I could that was there and put 
it faithfully on screen." 
</P>
<P>
 Making the film proved to be a learning experience for Pierson. "There's a 
sequence (in the film) in which little Mary is being sent to a boarding school 
in which she is not allowed to speak her language," he says. "She lost contact 
with her family, her traditions and her tribe. They supplied her with nothing 
to take their place. That's the case with many Indian children. That's one of 
the reasons why there's a very high rate of alienation and alcoholism. They 
descend into this kind of abyss. They become lost generations. The survivors 
are like Mary. She is a survivor and she found the solution through the 
American Indian Movement and especially her experience at Wounded Knee." 
</P>
<P>
 Crow Dog, who is the mother of six and grandmother of two, still lives on the 
Rosebud reservation. "I just got electricity and a bath," she says. "I have 
lived in cities. I have lived in Phoenix for a while. I live on the reservation 
by choice. We have clean water and our own self-government. We are the majority 
-- you know what I mean." 
</P>
<P>
 She would never live in nearby Rapid City. "There is a lot of prejudice," she 
says firmly. "It's really bad. It's like the Deep South. You couldn't pay me to 
live in that town. There is no justice." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Crow Dog says Native Americans are still oppressed, she believes that 
life for Native Americans has gotten better and points to missionary schools 
being a thing of the past as an example. 
</P>
<P>
 "The school I was in, now it's an Indian school," Crow Dog says. "They have 
Indian people on the board and parents are involved with their children and 
have a say-so. Before, our hair was cut, and now you can still be in athletics 
and have long hair. We had to fight to have long hair. We grow our hair for 
religious reasons." 
</P>
<P>
 Her grandparents, she says, thought it was in her own best interest to 
assimilate, "so I would be better off in this society. A lot of my mom's 
generation are assimilated." 
</P>
<P>
 And they don't appreciate the American Indian Movement. "A lot of my people, 
they should be thankful for AIM, because before AIM came, people didn't have 
their long hair, people didn't have their Indian pride," Crow Dog says. 
"Everybody was assimilated. These people still put AIM people down, but now 
they are having sun dances. Before, nobody did it because everybody was 
Catholic and nobody knew about the Indian ways until the AIM people came. Now 
they are a lot better off, but they still don't recognize the movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being an AIM-ster is a hard jacket to wear," Crog Dog says. "You are always 
criticized and put down for being against the system that's suppressing you." 
</P>
<P>
 Crow Dog is worried about today's Native American youth. "There aren't any 
federal programs," Crow Dog says. "There's nothing. A lot of young people are 
dying of drinking, stabbings, drugs and suicides. There's nothing for them. I'd 
like to have some programs for our young people. That's our future. I had to 
send my 15-year-old son away because he was getting involved in gangs." 
</P>
<P>
 Pedro, her son who was born during the siege, has a drum group. "I think we 
overdid it with him in the movement," Crow Dog says with a smile. "He's totally 
pro-movement. He doesn't want to be any part of the system. He knows his 
culture. He knows his ceremonies. He knows all the songs. To him that is more 
important than living in this other society." 
</P>
<P>
 "Lakota Woman: Siege at Wounded Knee" premieres Sunday at 5, 8 and 11 p.m. on 
TNT; it repeats Wednesday at 5 p.m., Friday at 7 p.m., Oct. 23 at 9 a.m., Oct. 
25 at 5 p.m. and Oct. 29 at noon .

'I GUESS PEOPLE DON'T KNOW HOW TO PLACE ME' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Irene Bedard, who plays Mary Crow Dog in "Lakota Woman: Seige at Wounded 
Knee," grew up in a small village in Alaska. The actress of Cree and Inupiat 
Eskimo heritage now lives in New York City, where she runs her own Native 
American theater company. 
</P>
<P>
 In that metropolitan melting pot, Bedard rarely encounters racism. "People ask 
me (in my work), 'I know you are something.' Usually I ask them to guess 
because nobody ever guesses Native American. They go 'Asian? Hispanic?' I play 
a lot of offbeat people. I guess people don't know how to place me." 
</P>
<P>
 But she found racism first-hand last fall in Rapid City, S.D., while there on 
location to make the TNT film airing this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stayed at a hotel," Bedard recounts. "A couple of times they sent cops to 
people's rooms. They would send bell people to check on us. I'm doing this 
movie, so obviously I have the money to pay my incidental bills, but after the 
third time I ordered something in, they said, 'The manager thought it would be 
better if you paid for your dinner now.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd go to shopping malls and be followed around wherever I went. I said, 
'Look, I have a whole shopping cart full of things, I am not going to walk 
through the front door with it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Bedard, who also appears in Disney's upcoming film "Squanto: A Warrior's 
Tale," fell in love with Crow Dog's autobiography "Lakota Woman" four years ago 
and wanted to adapt it for a one-woman show. But Jane Fonda had already 
optioned the bestseller. "It was something I love and had my heart in it," she 
says. "And then here I was auditioning for the film. I couldn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the real Mary Crow Dog, Bedard was never sent to a Catholic missionary 
school and be forced to assimilate. But her mother was. 
</P>
<P>
 "She grew up in a little village and then she tried to fit into a world where 
Elvis is king and airplanes land," she says. "I understand the concept (of 
assimilation). They didn't build schools anywhere near (the village). They sent 
children to Oregon. Basically you are uprooting someone and not letting them 
speak your language. If you get the image of someone who sits around the fire 
and tells stories and sings songs and then goes to a place where it is barren. 
... It's a completely different way of thinking and it confused a lot of 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an odd thing," Bedard reflects. "When I was up on Nova Scotia shooting 
'Squanto,' I was just sitting out there on the beach. I just looked at the 
ocean and it just sort of struck me that all of these people, these smiling, 
loving people who really have a beautiful way of speaking and thinking about 
the world, are gone. I just started to cry." SUSAN KING

LETTER FROM A FRIEND; MASTER FOOD WRITER JAMES BEARD, FINALLY REVEALED; LOVE 
AND KISSES AND A HALO OF TRUFFLES: LETTERS TO HELEN EVANS BROWN, EDITED BY JOHN 
FERRONE (ARCADE PUBLISHING: $25.95; 418 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Russ Parsons, Russ Parsons is managing editor of the Los Angeles Times food 
section and writes the weekly column, In the Kitchen. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 James Beard -- along with Julia Child, his opposite in so many ways -- has to 
be regarded as the most important American cookbook writer of this, or possibly 
any, century. But while Child is thought of -- not without justification -- as 
something of a kitchen saint, Beard's reputation is messier, and in many ways 
more interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 Gossipy, contentious, money-grubbing . . . he seems to have been all of those, 
as well as a cook of some refinement, a prodigious collector of recipes and -- 
most important -- an outspoken champion of American food at a time when that 
was decidedly counter to the popular flow. 
</P>
<P>
 Since his death in January, 1985, Beard has been the subject of two recent 
biographies, but neither succeeded in solving the contradictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Evan Jones, a certified New York food mafia insider (he's married to Alfred A. 
Knopf's formidable cookbook editor Judith Jones, who has worked with Beard, 
Child, Marion Cunningham, Marcella Hazan and Dianne Kennedy, among many others) 
got to the plate first. But his "Epicurean Delight: The Life and Times of James 
Beard" treats the big man as an icon, spelling out in painstaking, mind-numbing 
detail what Beard did, who he saw and what he wrote (while remaining remarkably 
reticent about his personal life). The book has about as much personality as a 
desk calendar, though it may not be quite as stylishly written. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, last year, Robert Clark published "James Beard, A Life," and the 
reaction has been mixed. Clark, an admirable historian, uses his subject as a 
prism through which to view the changing world. Agriculture and homosexuality, 
cooking and commercialism . . . each gets its turn. The history is good, but I 
find it telling that everyone I know who is mentioned in the book -- 
theoretically, at least, the people who were closest to Beard -- hates it. The 
problem is, again, the missing Beard. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, along comes "Love and Kisses and a Halo of Truffles," a collection of 
letters Beard wrote between May, 1952, and August, 1964, to noted Los Angeles 
cookbook writer Helen Evans Brown (though somewhat forgotten today, her "West 
Coast Cookbook" has yet to be equaled as far as defining the particular mix of 
ingredients, personalities and ethnicities that makes California cooking). 
</P>
<P>
 Now, finally, we can begin to understand who James Beard was. 
</P>
<P>
 A compulsive gossip whose marathon telephone sessions are legend, Beard's 
letters to Brown took the place of long-distance telephone calls -- not only 
were they cheaper, but in those good old days of mail service, a letter from 
New York to Pasadena generally arrived in only one or two days. Thus, the notes 
have the immediacy of conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 In his cookbooks -- with the arguable exception of "Delights and Prejudices" 
-- Beard's writing could be pretty stiff. He inhabited each book as if in 
masquerade, at turns all he-man bravado (one of his first big books was on 
outdoor cooking, and he wrote a monthly column for the mostly hunting and 
fishing magazine Argosy) and omniscient pedant. 
</P>
<P>
 But as this book shows, in private he was quite a witty writer, capable of 
conjuring up a place or a person with just a couple of strokes. As befitting a 
casual (if remarkably frequent) correspondence, the tone is conversational and 
intimate -- from Beard's pen to your ear. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last night's party was a whirling success," he wrote in 1954, "except that 
Barbara A. had had no lunch, drank three double martinis and almost crawled out 
of the place, leaving her small Dior hat here." 
</P>
<P>
 A little later he writes: "Try to get to a television set and see the new 
program 'Home,' which I heard is pretty awful. Poppy Cannon is the food person, 
and she did a vichyssoise with frozen mashed potatoes, one leek sauteed in 
butter and a cream of chicken soup from Campbell's." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that he didn't dabble in such commercial shenanigans himself. The product 
sponsorships mentioned in this book -- and, mind you, these are just the ones 
he writes about -- include dried spices, aluminum foil grills, various wines 
and spirits, even something called "charcoal sauce." 
</P>
<P>
 This uneasy alliance between educator and shill is something Robert Clark 
agonized about in his biography. To what extent does a writer owe it to his 
public to remain untainted by endorsements of commercial products? It's one of 
the central questions of Beard's career: If James Beard says you should fry 
breakfast cereal in Spice Islands dried celery, can you believe anything else 
he might say? 
</P>
<P>
 Beard was constantly concerned about money -- what free-lance writer isn't? -- 
and the book is filled with letters spinning ideas for restaurants, cookshops 
and books that never materialized. 
</P>
<P>
 But he did have his standards. In a letter relating the success of a luncheon 
he put on for O'Quinn's charcoal sauce, he also talks of turning down something 
called Whirl, apparently a butter substitute: "I cannot see myself selling it. 
It looks like something for artificial insemination when it comes out of the 
can, and I am sure it is going to have that effect on most who see it." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, one of the effects of reading this book is a lingering awe at the 
amount of work Beard was able to do. Between sponsorships, radio shows, 
television, books, magazine articles, the social whirl and travel, it seems he 
rarely stopped moving.

 "This is the last gasp," he writes. "I am pooped, bitched, bushed . . . and 
completely at sea. But off we go. I have to take six people to luncheon today 
at the new Chinese place I found, then back to work for another hour or two, 
and off to Paul Bernard, who is having a party for me, the nice guy. Then a 
week of hell to face, including a dinner I am doing, which I trust ends the 
entertaining season. It's going to be simple -- asparagus with grated cheese as 
a hot hors d'oeuvre, jambon a la creme, polenta with spinach and a Turinois -- 
one hour's work." 
</P>
<P>
 Wherever Beard went, whatever he did, it seems his mind was aswirl with food 
(though he weighed more than 300 pounds for most of his adult life, he lived 
past 80). No mere glutton, everything he cooked was carefully considered. 
"Friday night we did mutton steaks -- real Canadian mutton, which was absolute 
heaven," he writes. "They were about 1 1/2 inches thick. Ron Callvert likes his 
well done, and I did that one for 30 minutes. Isabel and I like ours rare, and 
they were on for 20 minutes, browned to a turn, lusciously pink and juicy 
inside." 
</P>
<P>
 When Brown writes asking for background on American bean dishes, Beard at 
first demurs ("This is not something on which I have the great store of 
knowledge that you have") and then proceeds to detail more than a dozen 
American bean dishes, ranging from his mother's baked beans ("with the same 
loathing for molasses for (sweetness) that I have") to the bollas from "The Key 
West Cook Book" ("little balls of fire made with black-eyed beans"). 
</P>
<P>
 Even in the depths of one of his sporadic diets, he never lost his enthusiasm 
for eating: "For lunch yesterday I had a little filet. I ate it slowly and 
realized that here in America we have the finest beef in the world. It was well 
aged and had flavor and texture. Never have I eaten such a piece of beef 
anywhere in Europe. And with it, were broiled mushrooms, tasting of the earth, 
and a little asparagus. . . . It can be a glorious, fresh, tasting experience, 
this dieting." 
</P>
<P>
 There are problems with the book. While John Ferrone has done an admirable job 
of collecting the letters, his editing is basically limited to thumbnail 
descriptions of people. The index could be improved and his chapter 
introductions are essentially pointless, since they merely tell you what you're 
going to read in the letters. What the book really cries out for is context. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's a problem easily solved by reading Clark's biography at the same 
time. The Clark book will tell you what Beard meant. The letters, who he was.

 It was gratifying to read Jonathan Gold's commemorative essay about his mother 
("A Good Teacher Passes," On the Town, Sept. 18). I knew Judy Gold when I 
taught at Dorsey High School. She was the best librarian I ever worked with in 
my 20-plus years of teaching English. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't uncommon to visit Dorsey's library at any time during the school 
day, especially at lunch time, and see a cluster of her students, from all 
cultural groups, magnetized by her special talent for finding the right book, 
knowing the small details of a puzzling assignment or just being there to 
listen. 
</P>
<P>
 And it wasn't just the children whom she touched. She offered teachers 
tremendous professional support and maintained an ongoing collection of new 
arrivals in books that served all tastes. 
</P>
<P>
 Her memory and influence will never be forgotten by those of us who felt that, 
for too long, her efforts and value went unnoticed.

 I have been a special-education teacher at Dorsey High for eight years and was 
so touched to read about my favorite person there, our late librarian, Judy 
Gold. Ms. Gold, who influenced the lives of many more people than just her 
family, friends and students, was also there for me -- the tired, worn-out 
instructor who works in too big a school district, in too dangerous a city, 
often with too little support and encouragement to continue. But she was always 
there to suggest a new book of fiction with which I could escape reality for a 
few minutes a day, asking how my graduate classes at USC were coming along, 
suggesting books for my students who had never read an entire book before. 
</P>
<P>
 Her presence was important to all of us committed to improving the quality of 
education for all the students in Los Angeles.

 Gold's column about his mother was a loving tribute to the overworked, 
over-involved, under-recognized and undervalued inner-city schoolteacher. There 
are many who work hard to motivate and inspire without parental support and 
little administrative encouragement. We hear about so few -- only those whose 
stories are so dramatic -- one wonders who's writing the press releases.

 What a shame that Jonathan Gold felt it necessary to stealth-bomb the Crenshaw 
neighborhood where his mother spent 25 years as a multicultural educator. She, 
of all people, would have roundly condemned his talk of "the apathy of the 
district and the contempt of most of the students." Moreover, it's beyond 
belief that a woman of her integrity would trot out the old yarn about the 
football players reading "Black Beauty." 
</P>
<P>
 While the area endures the problems shared by all but the wealthiest L.A.-area 
neighborhoods, it's also one of the warmest and most vibrant. Living here, it's 
easy to understand why Gold's mother never applied for that transfer.

least four times a year.

A HEARTFELT MOVIE FOR JANE FONDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jane Fonda wanted to make a movie about the siege at Wounded Knee ever since 
it took place in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt it was a dramatic way to show what is happening today," says Fonda. 
"The problem was at the time I couldn't get a studio interested. I couldn't 
find a vehicle to tell a story." 
</P>
<P>
 Until she read Mary Crow Dog's autobiography, "Lakota Woman," four years ago, 
around the same time she met her future husband, Ted Turner. "He told me he was 
doing this series on Native Americans, both films and documentary, and so we 
thought 'Lakota Woman' would be great. 
</P>
<P>
 "The movie would be the contemporary view (of Native Americans). I said I 
would like my company (Fonda Films) to do it because I know a lot about what 
happened and about the people who are involved. I think with my company and 
(executive producer) Lois Bonfiglio, we could do a good job." 
</P>
<P>
 It was imperative for Fonda that the film be done just right. "The people are 
still alive and the issues are still very much alive," she explains. "So you 
don't want to blow it out of proportion or trivialize it or make it 
superficial. You want to do it as accurately as possible. We put a lot of 
effort in to make it as real as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of the people involved in the film were part of the real Wounded Knee 
siege. "They were advisers to it, consultants to it," Fonda says. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a very lengthy chronicle that was written, 'Eyewitness at Wounded 
Knee,' a day-by-day, blow-by-blow description. We relied a lot on that and on 
Mary and Richard Erdoes, who wrote the book with her." 
</P>
<P>
 Fonda believes "Lakota Woman" will be a learning experience for viewers. "I 
already know that it will be, because I have shown it to friends of mine, 
younger women and men, and they are just shocked that (Wounded Knee) happened 
during their lifetime. They never knew about it. I remember around the time of 
Alcatraz, there was an article in a magazine by a man named Peter Collier, and 
he told the story of what had been done to Native Americans. I'm ashamed to say 
I had not realized that. It rocked me." 
</P>
<P>
 And changed her life. "That is when I went to Alcatraz and really became an 
activist." SUSAN KING

PRIME-TIME FLICKS 
</P>

By Kevin Thomas

<TEXT>
<P>
 The notion behind the 1988 Elvira, Mistress of the Dark (KTLA Sunday at 6 
p.m.) seems to have been to introduce TV's erstwhile horror-picture hostess to 
the big screen in a movie as rotten as the worst flick she ever introduced. 
It's a shame because Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) is a dynamite personality -- 
albeit a rip-off of Maila Nurmi's Vampira of the '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense industry seems an unlikely setting for comedy, and the 1984 Best 
Defense (KCOP Sunday at 6 p.m.) goes out of its way to prove how uncongenial it 
can be. Worse yet, producer-writer Gloria Katz and director-writer Willard 
Huyck gingerly sidestep all the looming implications of weapons manufacturing. 
Caught up in this dud are Dudley Moore and Eddie Murphy, who never even meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Necessary Roughness (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.) offers Scott Bakula a nifty 
starring role as a 34-year-od farmer lured back to college to play football in 
this slight but friendly 1991 comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Big Easy (KTLA Monday at 8 p.m.), a 1987 release, is more memorable for 
the sizzling chemistry between Dennis Quaid's New Orleans police lieutenant and 
Ellen Barkin's East Coast assistant district attorney than its police 
corruption plot. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blues Brothers (KTLA Tuesday at 7:30 p.m.) turns loose Dan Aykroyd and 
John Belushi as that weird musical duo they created on "Saturday Night Live." 
This overblown 1980 John Landis production has them trying to reassemble their 
old band to raise money to save an orphanage in Chicago; lots of great musical 
guest stars. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1992 Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot (KTTV Tuesday at 8 p.m.), Sylvester 
Stallone and Estelle Getty, as an LAPD officer and his bossy mother, have a lot 
of chemistry, but it's a slick, shiny 100% predictable movie. 
</P>
<P>
 The Quick and the Dead (KCOP Tuesday at 8 p.m.), a splendid 1987 cable 
production, is a Louis L'Amour story about a homesteading couple (Sam Elliott 
and Kate Capshaw) with a small son and a stranger who appears when they're 
facing a threat. 
</P>
<P>
 The Principal (KTLA Wednesday at 8 p.m.), a 1987 release with Jim Belushi in 
the title role, deals with the tensions and conflicts at an inner-city high 
school only to turn it into one more cliche-ridden revenge movie. 
</P>
<P>
 KCET's Saturday-night double feature pairs two of the best American 
documentaries of recent years: the wrenching 1993 Silverlake Life: The View 
From Here (KCET Saturday at 9 p.m.) about two longtime lovers coping with the 
devastation of AIDS, and Errol Morris' stylistically venturesome 1988 The Thin 
Blue Line (KCET Saturday at 11 p.m.), which actually succeeded in freeing a man 
wrongly convicted of murder.

'BASEBALL'S' MEMORABLE LESSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Over the past several years my interest in baseball has been declining with 
the exception of the playoffs and World Series. The past weeks I have been 
watching the PBS series "Baseball" on KCET and it brought back a flood of good 
memories of when I played in my youth. I hope today's baseball players were 
watching so they can witness firsthand what they well might ruin.

IN BRIEF: NONFICTION

 OLYMPIA by Leni Riefenstahl (St. Martin's Press: $50; 288 pp.) German artist 
Leni Riefenstahl created two extraordinary films, "Triumph of the Will" (1934) 
and "Olympia" (1936). However, her real contribution to culture lies elsewhere; 
Riefenstahl brings the complex relationship between art and morality into focus 
as few artists of this century have done. Riefenstahl worked for Hitler, you 
see, and though the films she made for him are indisputably brilliant, they 
raise troubling questions. Can great art be created in a moral vacuum? Do we 
throw out all of Ezra Pound's work because he was smitten with Mussolini for a 
spell? Should an artist, however gifted, be blackballed from the culture if he 
fails to abide by certain basic humanitarian principles? 
</P>
<P>
 You won't find answers to any of those questions in this marginally 
interesting book. For those unfamiliar with her work, Riefenstahl blueprinted a 
visual style that's been borrowed almost whole-cloth in recent years by fashion 
photographer Bruce Weber. It boils down to this; burnished, glowing images of 
perfect physical specimens. That's essentially all there is to this book, which 
opens with images of classical Greece -- the Parthenon, etc., just in case the 
readerdoesn't get where she's coming from -- then goes on to document various 
events at the Olympic Games of 1936. Actual photos Riefenstahl shot (as opposed 
to stills from her film), the pictures are erotic yet oddly antiseptic and 
quickly become predictable in their perfection. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 92 and still working (she does a lot of underwater photography these 
days), Riefenstahl was the subject of a fascinating documentary released this 
year, "The Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl," which found her 
expending quite a bit of energy proclaiming the innocence of her relationship 
with the Third Reich and with Hitler (many historians believe she was his 
mistress). She insists she just didn't know what was going on, that she was out 
of town when the Holocaust happened, and the woman is so afflicted with tunnel 
vision shemay well be telling the truth. Too preoccupied with finding the 
perfect light to notice the burning bodies, Riefenstahl comments in her 
autobiography published last year that when German troops marched into Austria 
in 1938 "I realized these events would have an bearing on the premiere date of 
'Olympia' but I wouldn't hear of delaying it." In 1948 a Baden denazification 
court adjudged Riefenstahl to have been merely a "follower" of the Nazi party, 
rather than an activist; nonetheless, an ugly stain continues to disfigure her 
work and probably always will. Kristine McKenna

 KOLYMSKY HEIGHTS by Lionel Davidson (St. Martin's: $22.95; 368 pp.) Sibir is 
tall, blond, comely, with gray eyes, finely set features.She is eight months 
pregnant. She is also 40,000 years old. Sibir -- the name means "sleeper" -- 
whose body was discovered in a crevasse, is being held by the Russians deep in 
an underground lab hacked out of permafrost. A lot more is going on in the 
Siberian station, a posting so secret that those who work there must agree 
never to leave. Biological-warfare research, possibly. Anti-missile 
experiments. And something of such monumental import that Rogachev, the 
scientist in charge, is determined to share it with the world. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Here is intelligent, irresistible storytelling, the kind of tale that demands 
you turn to the back at once to measure the pleasure ahead, hoping for 1,000 
pages, disappointed with 360. The writing is meticulous and detailed, the 
plotting credible, the pace rigorous, the setting exotic, the suspense 
excruciating. Lionel Davidson -- "the best thriller writer around," says the 
Spectator -- is back after 16 years, cementing his credentials. An Oxford 
professor gets an envelope with no letter, only a cigarette paper inside, a 
palimpsest, really, with a coded message. From this scrap, the CIA, in a tour 
de force, is able to establish writer, provenance, courier. Rogachev is asking 
for a visit -- to his virtually hermetic lab -- from one Porter, a Canadian 
Indian of vast skepticism and preturnatural resourcefulness. The grail, it 
develops, is a discovery of incalculable benefit to mankind; not a cure for 
cancer, but comparable. It is simultaneously of immensely important military 
application. Rather than share the former, the Russians guard the latter. "Many 
tricky dicks walk the trail," says Porter, "have a drink." Do, and post a sign: 
"Do not disturb."

A CASE OF DIFFERENT STROKES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 I was surprised by S. Irene Virbila's review of Eclipse (Sept. 18). Its tone 
suggests that when a restaurant has such an impressive lineage (the former 
owner of Spago, the space formerly that of Morton's), it is merely a bigger and 
better target for the clever quips of the critic.Also, Virbila treats the 
success of the "A-list" patrons as a source of embarrassment or a subject of 
ridicule. Call me crazy, but I still get a thrill when some of the most 
accomplished people in town are shoulder to shoulder with me at dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the food, it's as thought the reviewer and I have dined at different 
restaurants. My seafood dishes have never been overcooked but have been 
prepared in perfect accord with my instructions. The appetizers are so good I 
have trouble deciding which one to order. Occasionally, I'm even enticed to 
break my vow not to eat desserts. And I've never had to wait for a reserved 
table. 
</P>
<P>
 At Eclipse, I get the service that I appreciate and have come to expect, even 
though I arrive minus bodyguards with "telltale ear cords."

 After having returned to TV viewing last season because of enjoyable sitcoms 
such as "Wings," "Home Improvement," "Frasier," "John Larroquette" and "Grace 
Under Fire," I am totally dismayed by this season's lineup. It places these 
shows right on top of each other and there is no way I can enjoy all of my 
favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 Is the schedule engraved in stone for the season? If this is true, I will 
become a frustrated viewer or succumb to being a non-viewer once again.

<P>
 TOO EASY by Bruce Deitrick Price (Simon & Schuster: $21; 256 pp.) On the 
Brooklyn Bridge. Standing up. In broad daylight. In a taxi cruising Central 
Park.In a phone booth in Queens. But the middle of the Brooklyn Bridge? As 
Kathy says, post-coitus, "They ought to put up a plaque." That they ought; it's 
the only thing anyone will ever remember this book for. That and the dithering. 
. . .

<P>
 Now, stop me if you've heard this one before: Robert falls for Kathy but he's 
married to Anne. Kathy persuades Robert to leave Anne. Then they'll get 
married. What a plot! Want details? Sure. Robert's a newspaper editor. Kathy's 
in marketing, marketing mostly herself. Anne's an accountant. She and Robert 
live in Westchester. Kathy comes from Jersey, which, author, Bruce Deitrick 
Price implies, explains everything. She is sexy, though, give her that. Robert 
is "obsessed," of course. With her body. It has to be her body; she's got 
nothing else going for her. Neither does Robert. Nor Anne. Especially nor Anne, 
one of those women who, when she gets wind of her husband's affair, blames 
herself. Has "mousy" hair. They all do. Dithers a lot over what to do. So does 
Robert, for page after page. Dither, dither, dither. Oh, and somebody gets 
killed. Either Robert or Anne or callipygian Kathy. Which? You're kidding. 
Don't think for a minute we're going to spoil this book for you. Still . . . 
the Brooklyn Bridge?

 SHE FLEW THE COOP by Michael Lee (HarperCollins: $22; 431 pp.) Melancholy is 
the measure of a storyteller's gift, the regret that attends the close of his 
book.Some have it, some don't. Michael Lee West has it. We're sad to leave 
Limoges, Louisiana (pop. 905, give or take), nostalgic for a town that existed 
initially only in the author's imagination, now in ours, too. West has 
surrounded us with neighbors -- people we've grown to like, or pity, or despise 
-- then set in motion events that will change them, slowly at first, then 
precipitously. By then we're hooked. Will sweet-tempered Vangie Nepper come to 
terms with husband Henry, who's diddling DeeDee Robichaux, the clerk at his 
pharmacy (whose own husband is no less feral for being paraplegic)? Will 
boozing Burr succeed in beating the hell out of Sophie, town 
domestic-cum-confessor who has no hell in her at all? Who'll finally tie down 
bachelor Cab Beaulieu? It sounds like a soap opera but it's far from it. Only a 
book conceived and executed as well as this one can carry the rhythms and 
pauses, the smells and tastes and languor and the very continuity of a Southern 
town and its people, at once flawed and gracious. Well worth a detour.

 THE SCARIEST PLACE ON EARTH: Eye to Eye With Hurricanes by David E. Fisher 
(Random House: $23; 250 pp.) It is the most destructive force on earth, 
arguably the most terrifying. In terms of material damage, the 1992 Miami 
hurricane tops the charts of history. In the human dimension, the Bangladesh 
typhoon (same phenomenon, different name) crushed to death more than a million 
people, many of them awe-struck, virtually hypnotized, as they watched "a 
luminous cloud in the darkness" approach with a roar from hell, "the crest of a 
wave that towered over them and then came crashing down -- and that was the 
last sight they ever saw." In the 1935 Florida Keys storm, people caught out in 
the open "were sandblasted, quite literally," their clothes, then their skin 
flayed off, down to muscle and bone. It packs a wallop of half a million 
A-bombs, releases enough energy in a day to supply America with electricity for 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
 It's probably more than you wanted to know, but it's compelling reading. David 
E. Fisher brings to his work a rare mix of science and story: With a doctorate 
in nuclear physics, he teaches cosmo-chemistry at Miami U. and moonlights as 
playwright, actor, novelist -- and survivor, of the '92 blow. His aim is "to 
tell you about hurricanes -- what they are, how they form, what damage they can 
do, and how we might modify or avoid them." He succeeds. While probing a big 
wind's almost unfathomable causes -- "A hurricane over the Atlantic can begin 
with a butterfly's beating wings in Vietnam" -- Fisher felicitously blends lore 
with expertise: Columbus, Mayan human sacrifices to the god Yuracan, Balaclava, 
Adm. Bull Halsey (who steered the U.S. fleet into a hurricane -- twice!), 
Egyptian high priests and why the sky is blue. Even a word for Californians: 
"Of course, if you live on the West Coast, you have nothing to worry about. 
Except earthquakes."

 WARRIORS WHO RIDE THE WIND by William F.X. Band (Castle Books, Box 17262, 
Memphis, Tenn. 38187: $19.95; 267 pp.) Just outside Chunyan, China, at an 
intersection with the fabled Burma Road, stands a 20-foot monument to one Bob 
Mooney. Years ago, the Red Guards, in a typical fit of xenophobia, hammered the 
memorial to bits. The people of Chunyan saved the bits. When the storm passed, 
they painstakingly reassembled the monument, complete with the inscription: "As 
prophesied by the Ancients, battles will be fought in the air by warriors who 
ride the wind." Today, Chunyan school-kids put on an annual play about Mooney, 
with the older boys vying for the right to play the pilot. Some people never 
forget. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of us do, though, and this rankled Bill Band. Grazing through the World 
War II chapter of his granddaughter's high school history book, Band was 
nettled to note that the Flying Tigers came up empty. Claire Chennault's old 
outfit -- the audacious young acrobats who tied up a million Japanese troops 
and a thousand aircraft in China, an entire war machine that otherwise would 
have been thrown into the battle for the Pacific -- had been stiffed again by 
the historians. Band's book closes the gap. The man has a prodigious memory. He 
recalls with wry affection the semi-primitive, pre-radar P-40 fighters with 
bombs and fuel tanks slung precariously from unarmored bellies, with leaky 
oxygen tanks and canopies that wouldn't open for bail-out, with tires flattened 
from rickety runways "smoothed" by as many as 900 coolies pulling a huge 
concrete roller. He remembers blowing bridges and railroads and strafing whole 
armies, and the men -- boys, really -- who came back, succored for hundreds of 
miles by gallant Chinese guerrillas in loincloths, and those who didn't like 
his buddy Mooney. Bond is a storyteller, not an author, but it's the 
"unauthorliness" of his memoir that lends the book the grit of authenticity.

SHOWS FOR YOUNGSTERS AND THEIR PARENTS TOO; 'OCEAN GIRL' TELLS A WHALE OF A 
STORY, WITH AN ENVIRONMENTAL MESSAGE TOO 
</P>

<P>
 Here's a girl who can talk to the animals -- or at least to an elusive 
humpback whale. She's the mysterious Ocean Girl, discovered off the Great 
Barrier Reef by a family who recently relocated to Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 The new fantasy-adventure series, acquired by the Disney Channel, is produced 
and shot in Australia. Set underwater, in tropical rain forests, around 
waterfalls, lagoons and the coral reef, "Ocean Girl" focuses on Neri (Marzena 
Godecki) and two boys, Jason (David Hoflin) and Brett (Jeffrey Walker), who 
discover her. 
</P>
<P>
 Neri can swim amazingly fast and communicate telepathically with her best 
friend, a 40-ton humpback whale she calls Charley. The boy's recently divorced 
marine biologist mother, Dr. Dianne Bates (Kerry Armstrong), has moved her 
family to ORCA, a futuristic underwater research colony in the Great Barrier 
Reef. Dr. Bates and her scientist partner, Dr. Winston Seth (Alex Pinder), set 
out to study the brain patterns of the humpback whale, choosing Charley as 
their subject. 
</P>
<P>
 After the boys befriend Neri (and keep her a secret from their mother), she 
shows them the beauty of the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were very excited about it when we heard about it," says Doug Zwick, vice 
president of program acquisitions, who dubs the show "90H20." "It's very 
exciting visually and creates a successful different world." 
</P>
<P>
 Heavy Australian accents don't deter from the show, Disney programmers say. 
"It was actually produced by an American, Jonathan Shiff, who brings a real 
American sense to the show," emphasizes Zwick. Moreover, he adds, "You get so 
caught up in the unique reality they've created." 
</P>
<P>
 The show, while first a fantasy, is "grounded in a '90s sensibility for kids, 
without using robots, which are all over the place now. It's a good continuing 
story," Zwick says. There is, he notes, "a good female protagonist, who's not 
just tagging along with the boys, but is often the leader. It's a story for 
both boys and girls." 
</P>
<P>
 The show's title star, 16-year-old Marzena, believes kids will respond to the 
beautiful locations. "They'll like how the girl and the whale are linked and 
the underwater city. There are a lot of positive messages about the environment 
and messages about believing in yourself," she says during a phone break on the 
show's Australian film shoot. 
</P>
<P>
 "For kids who haven't seen the reefs and the rain forests, we show them what 
there is to lose and what a shame it would be if that happened," Marzena says. 
"The barrier reefs are just incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 Zwick says Disney was so confident in the series that it added a request for 
an additional 13 episodes to the previous 13. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ocean Girl" airs Mondays at 7:30 p.m. on the Disney Channel. For ages 6 and 
up. More Family Shows 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's part 2 of By Way of the Stars (Sunday 2 p.m. Disney) continues to 
follow the adventures of young Lukas and Baroness Ursula as they travel from 
Prussia to throughout North America looking for their families. The four-part 
miniseries concludes at the end of the month. For ages 6 and up.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Disney has also acquired Fox's The Sinbad Show (Monday at 7 p.m.), about a 
bachelor who takes in two foster children, starring comedian Sinbad; the 
animated Marsupliami (Saturday and Sunday at 9:30 a.m.), about a mischievous 
jungle creature; HBO's The Baby-Sitters Club (Thursdays at 7 p.m. and Sundays 
at noon), which follows the adventures of a group of eighth-grade girls, and 
The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, which catches up with the lovable bear 
at Hundred Acre Wood (weekdays at 8 a.m.) For ages 4 and up.

COMMENTARY; HOW WE GOT FROM SMARTS TO 'WHEEL OF FORTUNE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 How different were the quiz shows of "Quiz Show" days from today's televised 
games? 
</P>
<P>
 About as different as naming the opera Puccini never completed vs. naming 
something you buy at the hardware store (based on 100 people surveyed). 
</P>
<P>
 But the generational gap goes far beyond "Turandot" vs. turpentine. Compared 
to today's game shows, the 1950s genre featured in the Robert Redford-directed 
movie differed in question content, show style and even time period -- 
literally, a matter of night and day. 
</P>
<P>
 Some game-show changes had to do with the shocking scandal that erupted around 
"Twenty-One," the program featured in "Quiz Show," and other games in the late 
1950s. Others resulted from the evolution of popular culture, as television 
itself took hold of the public, steering it away from reading and other 
intellectual pursuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheating caused the scandal, but producers believed they had to overhaul the 
entire format if they were to have any hope of cleansing the taint. Quiz shows 
would never repeat their prime-time popularity of the 1950s ("The $64,000 
Question" was the top-rated show of 1955), but they were too cheap and too 
profitable to be abandoned, said Matt McAllister, assistant professor of 
communication studies at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes were more than cosmetic. They included moving away from the 
classical studies featured on the intellectual quiz shows, the 
super-intelligent contestants and the prime-time schedule, which featured an 
amazing 13 quiz shows in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
 "They put it in a ghetto area, the daytime, and feminized it" for the larger 
female audience, at least according to the stereotypes of the day, McAllister 
said. "Instead of shows about intellectualism, we now had shows about 
shopping." 
</P>
<P>
 According to some experts, the password became dumber. Brain stumpers about 
the arts and world history were replaced by guesses about the price of a box of 
Tide and who "blanked" whom. ("Jeopardy!," a challenging show that runs in the 
evening in many markets, is a throwback, they say.) 
</P>
<P>
 "The questions are a bit easier to grasp" now, says Thomas A. DeLong, author 
of "Quiz Craze" (Praeger Publishers, 1991, $22.95), which traces the history of 
quiz shows from radio to today. 
</P>
<P>
 DeLong concedes that most '50s viewers did not know which wines were served at 
a 1939 state dinner at Buckingham Palace -- just one part of an answer on "The 
$64,000 Question" -- but that there was a Great Books canon shared by much of 
the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think people have the basic, broad common knowledge that they had 50 
years ago ... because people don't study the classics, geography and other 
basic subjects," says DeLong. However, "there's a lot more to learn today." 
</P>
<P>
 Shows evolved to reflect the common-sense and technical knowledge that is 
valued today. 
</P>
<P>
 The concentration on shopping, which spawned shows like "The Price Is Right" 
and "Supermarket Sweep," also achieved a larger goal, giving viewers a 
not-so-subtle nudge to buy the refrigerators and mink coats displayed by Carol 
Merrill. 
</P>
<P>
 "They moved away from the educational to a consumerist" focus, say Olaf 
Hoerschelmann, who has done extensive research on game shows at Indiana 
University. "They were trying to repress the connections with the scandal." 
</P>
<P>
 As television established itself, the new medium's need to appeal to 
intellectuals for acceptance also diminished, he said. It developed its own 
form and no longer had to copy the more cerebral ways of books and magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 The shows eventually abandoned their highly educated super-contestants, who 
had become stars in the 1950s, for TV and movie celebrities and, finally, for 
regular people, DeLong says. For one thing, the pool of genius contestants was 
only so big. 
</P>
<P>
 "The primary appeal of those shows were the contestants. They were different 
from us, above us in intelligence," McAllister says. "The appeal of the game 
show today is the game, not the people. On 'Wheel of Fortune' there are 
contestants who are dumber than us."

ON THE TOWN: A CHANGE OF PLACE; GOING TO CATALINA IS A GOOD EXCUSE TO ISLE AWAY 
THE HOURS 
</P>

<P>
 While my husband's employers were moving their business from their 
mid-Wilshire location to Downtown, some of the staff celebrated with a midweek 
excursion to Santa Catalina Island. I agreed to go, but when the alarm went off 
at 7 a.m., it was a struggle to haul my less-than-enthusiastic self out of bed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ever been there?" Huz asked. "No. Maybe. I'm not sure!" I muttered. Sea and 
surf have never been my style. I prepared lethargically, Huz prodding me at 
intervals with reminders that the company rendezvous was set for 8:30. Racing 
from the house, we beat morning traffic, arriving seconds shy of missing the 
Catalina Express. The upper deck was packed, so we sat in the forward 
compartment. The mood turned romantic when we went outside to stand arm-in-arm 
at the prow, enjoying wind and spray, watching the coastline recede. The sky 
was overcast and gray -- my kind of weather. The water was aquamarine and 
choppy. The cabin cruiser clipped rockily along at 25 miles per hour. 
</P>
<P>
 After 10 minutes, my landlubber's legs tired of the pitching and yawing, so we 
went inside. While Huz read a book, I went to the front of the cabin. The 
grumble of the engine conjured up the adventure novels of my youth: with 
Sinbad's hapless crew on his fifth "Arabian Nights" voyage, his doomed ship 
meeting the rocks; aboard the Hispaniola, avoiding the peg-legged wrath of 
Treasure Island's mutinous John Silver, or out from New Bedford aboard Ahab's 
Pequod, hunting Moby Dick. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes off Avalon Bay, sunny Catalina emerged on the horizon. Onetime retreat 
for Laurel and Hardy, the 21-mile-long island was a sometime movie set. It's a 
former colony of Spain, pirate's hold, gold rush bonanza and splashground for 
the wealthy, a familar tourist flock since the Jazz Age. Today you can jet ski, 
play miniature golf, ride horses and even parasail. But in our state of 
citified ennui, that seemed too much like work. We opted for a tour package. 
Eager to see some buffalo, I picked Skyline Drive. But Huz preferred the Glass 
Bottom Boat. 
</P>
<P>
 As we boarded the MV Moonstone, I had a sudden sense of deja vu. As a petulant 
teen-ager, I had visited the island with my mother's church youth group. I'd 
enjoyed the boat ride but thought Catalina dull stuff. Now I stared, 
mesmerized, through the window to the underworld, blinking only to compare the 
creatures below with those illustrated on the flyer. The calico bass, Day-Glo 
orange garibaldi, opaleye and half-moon fish were abundant, but few of the more 
exotic denizens came up to play. What passed for a couple of eels wiggled near 
the ocean floor. A spiny lobster crawled between rocks. The high point was the 
unexpected sighting of a large shadowy bat ray. 
</P>
<P>
 Under hot blue sky, we walked toward Descanso Beach, studied the Art Deco 
murals over the Avalon Theatre entrance, then visited the adjacent tiny history 
museum. After lunch, we skittered back along the boardwalk to catch the tour 
bus and soon were navigating interior roads so dangerous that mirrors were 
placed at intervals to help drivers make safe turns. From the two-hour 
narration, we garnered that the buffalo were actually bison, that the world's 
only saltwater toilets had once been installed here to conserve fresh water and 
that all surviving Gabrielino Indians had been forced off the island before the 
turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in town, our trip nearly over, we enjoyed root beer floats, feeling like 
slightly overbaked truants. Sure, it was corny, but it busted our routine 
nicely. On the way back to Long Beach Harbor, Huz read quietly, then fell 
asleep against my shoulder. Miles from shore a daredevil sky diver dangled from 
his parachute. Then I noticed a flock of gulls. Fins appeared and arcing 
dolphins broke water level. I watched until they disappeared. Then I shut my 
eyes and imagined having that kind of freedom.

 A DARKER SHADE OF CRIMSON: The Odyssey of a Harvard Chicano by Ruben 
Navarrette Jr. (Bantam: $11.95; 270 pp.). Navarrette found himself adrift, 
socially, culturally and intellectually, when he came to Harvard from a small 
high school in the Central Valley. He initially tried to pose as a man of the 
people, a spokesman for dark-skinned laborers, but realized he lacked the 
credentials. A light-complected, middle-class scholar who didn't even speak 
Spanish well, he had more in common with his Anglo-Saxon classmates. 
Navarrette's well-crafted coming-of-age story reveals how his ethnic awareness 
enabled him to develop a more generous vision of humanity.

eruptions rank among the most awesome natural phenomena. Carl Johnson's text 
includes clear explanations of the origins of volcanoes, the different types of 
lava (clinkery aa vs. viscous pahoehoe), etc. But Dorian Weisel's photographs 
give this book its appeal: Lava gushing like water in a fountain; cars and 
houses disappearing in a fiery rain of ash; molten rock exploding as it strikes 
cold seawater. The reader wonders how Weisel shot these dazzling pictures 
without being incinerated.

 THE WILD MUIR: Twenty-Two of John Muir's Greatest Adventures selected and 
introduced by Lee Stetson, illustrated by Fiona King (Yosemite Assn., P.O. Box 
545, Yosemite National Park, Calif. 95389: $9.95; 211 pp.). Stetson, who has 
portrayed John Muir in a one-man show for more than a decade, offers a highly 
readable collection of excerpts from the naturalist's longer works. The 
selections emphasize Muir's delight in exploring untamed nature, often at the 
risk of his life. In one of his most famous adventures, he climbed a tall 
Douglas spruce during a violent windstorm, savoring the movements of his 
precarious perch. His reaction to a powerful earthquake in 1872 was to run from 
his Yosemite cabin, "both glad and frightened . . . sure I was going to learn 
something."

 THE SLAVE IN THE EMPTY GRAVE by Raymond J. Libert (Dorrance: $6.95; 28 pp., 
paperback original). This slim novella describes the efforts of 16-year-old 
James to work his way across the South during the Depression. Stranded in 
Georgia, the industrious James makes a discovery that enables him to aid his 
benefactors, the last members of a family ruined by the Civil War. Libert 
writes agreeably, but this story belongs in an anthology of new writing, rather 
than in a book by itself.

 ARGUING IMMIGRATION: The Debate Over the Changing Face of America edited by 
Nicolaus Mills (Touchstone: $12; 223 pp., paperback original). Collected from 
various mainstream publications, the essays in this anthology present moderate 
points of view in an increasingly acrimonious debate.The authors cite 
statistics on the contributions and costs of legal and illegal immigration, but 
rarely explain how the figures were calculated. The desire to appear both 
reasonable and politically correct forces the writers dance around the 
questions that make the issue a hot topic. Readers who hold strong views on 
immigration will find at least one piece that confirms their opinions; 
undecided readers will put the book down feeling like Omar Khayyam, who, after 
listening to "great argument," "came out by the same door as in I went."

 THE WEST OF WILD BILL HICKOK by Joseph G. Rosa (University of Oklahoma Press: 
$15.95; 223 pp.) . James Butler Hickok (1837-76) was a man of genuine 
accomplishments, serving as a Union agent during the Civil War and a frontier 
lawman. He was also one of the nation's first media stars, whose real and 
fictionalized adventures were chronicled in the popular press. In an expanded 
version of his 1974 study, "They Called Him Wild Bill," Joseph Rosa examines 
Hickok's life and legend. He supplements the account with an array of vintage 
photographs and drawings of Hickok, his family and other people involved in his 
life.

 ONE STEP CLOSER TO HOME by John McPherson (Andrews & McMeel: $6.95; 128 pp., 
paperback original). John McPherson's comic strip "Closer to Home" recalls Jim 
Unger's "Herman": a single panel depicting the daily disasters of frowzy women, 
lumpish men and their dumpy children. A small boy goes through his dad's ties 
while his older sister watches, holding Father's Day wrapping and yelling, "For 
cryin' out loud, just pick one! He's never going to recognize it!" McPherson's 
limited draftsmanship sometimes prevents his drawings from communicating as 
clearly as they should, but he's often very funny, and the development of his 
personal style will be entertaining to watch.

PALM LATITUDES: MELTING POT; L.A.'S RUSSIAN (APPLIANCE REPAIR) MAFIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Idelle Davidson 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Alex Uchitel, a young immigrant from Kiev, bought a North Hollywood-based 
appliance-repair company 10 years ago, his biggest hope was to turn it into a 
successful one-person operation. He did but quickly found that his company, 
Around the Clock, was in fact keeping him up around the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Desperate for rest, Uchitel realized he needed to farm out some of the work 
and sent out an SOS throughout the Russian community of West Hollywood, where 
he lives. "We Russians all know each other," says Uchitel. "When they come to 
America, they're looking for work, and they ask around." 
</P>
<P>
 The result of his plea is an unusual group of handymen: Most of Uchitel's 10 
subcontractors, from Moscow, St. Petersburg and Kiev, have advanced degrees in 
avionics, electronic, radio and computer engineering. 
</P>
<P>
 Why would someone who worked on a MIG settle for fixing a Maytag? It's the 
economy, glupetz. Says Vitali Leonov, who holds a doctorate in aircraft 
engineering: "I didn't even try to look for a job in my field. I didn't speak 
English and the economy was so bad." Leonov contacted Uchitel the moment he 
arrived from Kiev. That was four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonov recalls one homeowner -- also an engineer -- who grilled him about his 
knowledge of microwave oven repair. "I drew him an electrical schematic 
explaining how his oven worked and what was wrong with it," he recalls. "I 
passed his test." 
</P>
<P>
 Uchitel, who does not have a college degree, says he encourages his friends 
back home to look him up. Many of them have had dreams about the United States 
since they were kids. But when they arrive there is usually a language barrier, 
and they must wait several years to become citizens. "So I help them," he says. 
"You might say, I'm a little like their godfather." Idelle Davidson

PALM LATITUDES: THINGS TO COME; ARMED REVOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mark Ehrman 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here's the scenario: Some manmade formations are discovered on a highly 
radioactive portion of a nuclear test site in Nevada. The government has washed 
its hands of the whole affair. Now it's the public's turn. Using the Internet 
to control a camera and a robot arm at the site, they must come up with a 
hypothesis that explains the presence of a handful of artifacts found there -- 
a pipe, goggles, torn pieces of newspaper, papers with cryptic equations and 
miniature model sea animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the formations and the artifacts are in a 5-foot-long sandbox 
located in a corner of a room at USC, part of what is essentially a highly 
sophisticated computer game. But the mind controlling the robot and studying 
the excavation could, via the Internet, be anywhere -- across the hall or 
around the world. It is the only publicly accessible Internet site that allows 
users to interact visually and physically with a real -- as opposed to virtual 
-- environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first system to combine robotics, archeology and interactive 
art," says Michael Mascha, a USC anthropology professor. Mascha, along with 
assistant professor of computer science Ken Goldberg and an interdisciplinary 
corps of graduate students, created and maintain the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Other sites on the World Wide Web -- a portion of the Internet that allows 
sounds and images to be transmitted in close to real-time -- link cameras at a 
site to remote computers, allowing users, through a graphical interface 
software called Mosaic, to actually see what the camera was seeing from 
anywhere on the 'Net. 
</P>
<P>
 What we provide here is the logical next step," Mascha says, while the 
system's hydraulic pump fires a blast of air directed from a computer terminal 
in Chile. "We have an arm connected to the machine. So now you can not only 
observe the real world but also reach out and interact with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Since going online last August, "The Mercury Project," as its known, has been 
accessed by hundreds of users a day, each queing up for a five-minute foray in 
the sand. The address is http://www.usc.edu/dept/raiders/story/index.html.) 
They input what information they glean in a log that other excavators can read. 
Once someone solves the puzzle, the USC researchers have other projects ready 
to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the system is set up as a game, it's geared toward letting an 
archeologist control the activity at a remote site. "The teacher could be in 
Europe, and the site could be in Australia and the students are in the U.S. and 
they could together make a dig. And the professor could say, 'OK, now you 
students take over,' " Mascha says. 
</P>
<P>
 But the potential applications go way beyond that -- to surgery, offshore oil 
exploration and virtual classrooms, to name a few. And thousands more 
applications ideas pour in through user feedback. "Whoever thought this one up 
is brilliant," messaged one enthusiastic explorer from Rochester, N.Y. 'Now if 
this could only operate the Shuttle's arm.' Mark Ehrman

GOOD FORTUNE FOLLOWS TERESA BLAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY M. REICHARDT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Good things just happen to Teresa Blake. On her first trip to New York, she 
landed the role of Gloria Marsh Chandler on "All My Children" (1992). Then, 
after almost a year on the show, her high school sweetheart saw her on the 
soaper and, after the two reconnected, they got married. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had gone our separate ways so many years before that it took him a year to 
write to me," she explains. "I called him right away. Then we talked on the 
phone for about a year before we saw each other again. When we finally got 
together, we were engaged three months later." 
</P>
<P>
 Blake's husband is Mike McGuire, the drummer for the country-Western group 
Shenandoah. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew the group," says Blake, who is a country-Western music fan, "but I 
didn't know he was in it. At first I gave him a hard time pretending I didn't 
recognize the names of various groups, but I really am a fan. I am so proud of 
him. He also writes music and sings harmony too." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Blake and her husband are natives of Alabama. Off camera there is a 
Southern lilt to Blake's words. As for her husband, she says, "Bless his heart, 
he still sounds like a native Alabamian." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Blake: "I do miss the people back home -- and the laid-back attitudes. I 
miss sitting down in a restaurant and hearing, 'Hey, sugar, what you want?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Blake disdains ill manners. "If someone does not acknowledge having a door 
held open, I don't hesitate to speak out." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most striking things about Blake is her wild mane of long blond 
hair. 
</P>
<P>
 "Growing up it was the biggest pain," she says. "My grandmother would accuse 
me of not combing it or ask me, 'Do you lose things in it and find them days 
later?' Then I'd spend hours and hours trying to straighten it. Finally, since 
most of my friends liked it wild, I kept it that way. Now 'All My Children' 
keeps trying to tame it. I don't mind it, but I really love Kelly Ripa's 
(Hayley Vaughan) hair." 
</P>
<P>
 When Blake speaks of "All My Children," she says "I'm well-treated, and there 
is not one person I don't like." 
</P>
<P>
 But she does find fault with what has happened to Gloria. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish Gloria would find her backbone again," says Blake. "I'd like her to 
pull herself up by the bootstraps and get really mean. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was first hired, although it was a three-year contract, I was such a 
bad girl that I felt I'd have fun for from three to six months and be let go. 
Then I was allowed to be vulnerable. I was happy at first, but now I want some 
spunk." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Gloria wants to get as far away as possible from her husband, Adam 
Chandler, played by David Canary, Blake feels quite the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a wonderful man," she says of Canary. "He's taught me so much. If you 
get a chance to get close to him, you realize you've been given a gift." 
</P>
<P>
 Describing her other more recent co-star, Grant Aleksander, who plays Alec 
McIntyre, Blake says: "He's like my big brother." 
</P>
<P>
 Blake has everything she wants in real life, but she expects her next good 
fortune to come in duplicate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not planning a family right away, but when we do -- well, twins run in 
both of our families every third generation," says the actress. "And this is 
the third generation for both of us. My great-grandmother had three sets of 
twins!" 
</P>
<P>
 "All My Children" airs weekdays at noon on ABC.

 SSSHHHH! ; THE CATCHER WAS A SPY: THE MYSTERIOUS LIFE OF MOE BERG, BY NICHOLAS 
DAWIDOFF (PANTHEON: $24; 453 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dick Roraback, Dick Roraback is a free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "People think I'm making him up," says Linda McCarthy, and with good reason. 
McCarthy is curator of the CIA Museum. Her license plate reads MOE BERG. She 
"idolizes" him, she says. When Berg died, a lot of people were obsessed with 
him. Some still are. His name keeps coming up. 
</P>
<P>
 Who was Moe Berg? He may have been 90% genius, 10% fraud. It may have been the 
other way around. But this we know: 
</P>
<P>
 He was a major-league catcher. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a spy for wartime OSS, poised, at one critical juncture, to blow away 
no less a man than Werner Heisenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 He was exceptionally learned, conversant with a dozen languages, with physics, 
opera, Petrarch's sonnets and the trajectory of a screwball. 
</P>
<P>
 He was weird. Very, very weird. 
</P>
<P>
 In the lucid, literate, endlessly compelling "The Catcher Was a Spy," Nicholas 
Dawidoff has parsed the paradox, taken it apart and put it together again as 
well as any writer could. Elements of the puzzle are missing, and always will 
be: Of necessity, the surface of spies' lives are cratered with caesurae, with 
discontinuity, with mystery, and Berg was as mysterious as they come, even -- 
especially -- when he didn't have to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Long after his spying days were over Berg would pass friends on the street 
without a tic of recognition, or at best with finger to lips in the ssshhhh 
mode. He hid a lot; in Rockefeller Center, behind a pillar; in a park in Bad 
Homburg, plainly visible behind a bush bare of leaves. In a Newark coffee shop 
he chanced upon Jackie Robinson, whom he had never met, whispered in his ear 
from behind and walked off. In Los Angeles, he had a sudden, urgent 
"appointment" in a restroom at City Hall. In mid-Manhattan traffic he abruptly 
left his taxi to board another bearing a total stranger. For these and a full 
quorum of quirks there was no apparent reason, no explanation. Only ssshhhh.  
</P>
<P>
 For his 25 postwar years Berg had no money, no assets, no job, no address (he 
picked up his mail at a Boston newsstand), no possessions save a succession of 
identical black suits and a bonanza of books stashed all over the country. What 
he did have, writes Dawidoff in a typically eloquent passage, "were 
experiences, signal moments gathered like pretty quartz stones along the shore 
and then fingered again and again until they were polished to a shimmer." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Berg lived off these experiences, and off an innate allure, a man 
who could charm the socks off a White House cat. Chance acquaintances were 
happy to put him up for months. Doctors would operate gratis. Even railway 
conductors, no less vulnerable, would let him ride for free. He'd earned it, 
Dawidoff somehow implies, and somehow the reader agrees, though not quite sure 
why. Even in print, Berg exudes magnetism, even in "a life of abiding 
strangeness," a life "resonant with ambiguity" from the first breath. 
</P>
<P>
 It had something to do with being Jewish, Dawidoff thinks. Like his father -- 
who left his Ukranian village because it was "too Jewish" and opened a pharmacy 
in a Christian neighborhood of Newark -- Berg was "drawn to patrician settings 
where he was the exception": Princeton, baseball (not exactly patrician but no 
minyan either), the "devotedly collegial" OSS. "Branded with the mark of a 
faith he had been raised to resist," Berg nevertheless prevailed on his own 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Described under his yearbook photo as "A Hebrew," Berg -- tall, solid, darkly 
handsome -- became "the best baseball player in Princeton's history," thanks in 
small part to confusing the foe by exchanging infield signals in Latin. 
Big-league baseball was less discerning: After a frantic search for a Jewish 
player to boost attendance, the Giants finally signed one, whereupon vendors 
were ordered to hawk "ice-cream Cohens." 
</P>
<P>
 Torn between the law and a game he loved almost beyond reason, Berg was 
advised by a friend to "take the baseball career; the law can wait." (He had 
his cake and ate it: 19 years in the majors and a law degree from Columbia in 
his spare time.) Converted to catcher after an injury, the original "good 
field, no hit," the "savant in shin guards" intrigued the press, bemused his 
teammates and nonplussed managers (caught reading on the bench, Berg told Red 
Sox manager Joe Cronin: "You lead your life and I'll lead mine and next year 
we'll beat the Yankees"). 
</P>
<P>
 It was a convenient arrangement: Baseball had a character and a first-rate 
catcher; Berg had the time and money to traipse about the globe. Then came the 
war. 
</P>
<P>
 Even pariahs are patriotic, and Berg was surely that. He also was the perfect 
spy. He was perfect "because he was a man who found it easy to make other 
people talk about themselves while keeping himself a secret, and because he was 
a loner with a penchant for disappearing." He loved the spy game too -- its 
travel, its intrigues, its exquisite silences, its exalted contacts and 
companions. Free-wheeling, swashbuckling OSS chief Wild Bill Donovan had found 
his man, and he knew what to do with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergian spy-stories are legion -- mainly foreign legion: Nobody, including the 
OSS, was ever sure where he was. His primary assignment, though, was of vital 
importance to the Allies. Berg, among others, was to track and assess Nazi 
Germany's progress toward manufacture of a nuclear bomb -- "the greatest secret 
in the world." To that end, he was to ferret out German physicists' quondam 
colleagues -- in Switzerland, Italy, Scandinavia -- and pump them dry. More 
specifically, he was to locate the fabled Heisenberg, anti-Nazi but pro-Germany 
and "the greatest theoretical physicist in the world." Berg not only found him, 
he met him, while posing (at 42) as a Swiss student. Further, an OSS team 
member recalls, "If anything Heisenberg said convinced him the Germans were 
close to a bomb, then his job was to shoot him -- right there in the 
auditorium." 
</P>
<P>
 The Germans, it turned out, were not close, a fact that shouldn't, and didn't, 
diminish Berg's skills at espionage. Though he bumbled occasionally -- he 
simply could not keep his .45 tucked safely in his pants -- his prolific and 
detailed reports on Axis weaponry and technology were invaluable to America's 
war effort, earning Berg a Medal of Freedom (which, true to type, he refused). 
Berg himself was ecstatic with his role. Then the war ended. 
</P>
<P>
 For most, the war had played havoc with their lives. For Berg, "returning home 
was the disruption." To his chagrin, the spying was over. While the OSS 
"thrived on spontaneity," its successor, the CIA, was far more structured. And 
structured Berg was not. His became "a life without calendar. . . . He wandered 
aimlessly, unburdened by appointment, salary or obligation . . . living on wit 
and charm and the kindness of friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Concluding his graceful, fluent study, Dawidoff deplores the waste of a life 
but remains drawn to "a character of fantastic complication who brought 
pleasure and fascination to nearly everyone he brushed against." 
</P>
<P>
 He died, this catcher/spy, in 1972. His burial site? Nobody knows. Berg would 
have loved it.

 No, a new Dostoevsky novel has not been discovered. "Demons," first published 
in 1871-72, and Dostoevsky's last major novel before "The Brothers Karamazov," 
is the work we have commonly known in English as "The Possessed." Such is the 
title Constance Garnett gave to her translation of the novel (its first, though 
it came out more than 40 years after the original). A more recent translator, 
Andrew MacAndrew, has kept it; two others, David Magarshack and Michael Katz, 
have -- independently -- called the work "The Devils." All four versions are 
currently in print. Do we need a fifth? Given the quality of the 
Pevear-Volokhonsky translation, the answer is most definitely yes . 
</P>
<P>
 The title is a case in point. The Russian word means evil spirits, not the 
people possessed by them. Had Dostoevsky wanted to name this work "The 
Possessed," he could easily have done so, Russian having an exact equivalent. 
There is also a perfectly good Russian word for devils, and it is not the word 
Dostoevsky chose to use. 
</P>
<P>
 "Demons" is the Dostoevsky novel for our age; in fact, it is a key novel as 
such for an age that has come to recognize the evils of ideology -- any 
ideology. At the time it appeared in Russia, it could be read as the other sort 
of "key novel," a roman a clef , based as it was on the ideologically 
rationalized murder of a party member who had strayed from the fold. Millions 
and millions of ideologically rationalized murders later, it is infinitely more 
timely. Dostoevsky could not be published at all in the Soviet Union during the 
Stalinist years, and even in the relatively liberal post-Stalinist period this 
novel remained taboo and thus virtually unavailable in popular editions. Now 
that Russia has renounced its ideology it is being read with a vengeance: 
"Demons" tells Russia's story in microcosm, and in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes the novel prophetic, however, is not so much how closely 
Dostoevsky's ideas approximate their 20th-Century counterparts as how deadly he 
makes any idea that assumes absolute priority. Each of the ideas has a voice 
very much its own, the voice of the character who professes and to some extent 
personifies it. 
</P>
<P>
 Dostoevsky's style has long been a bone of contention. Russian though he was, 
he came largely out of the early 19th-Century French urban ecole frenetique, 
and his diction tends to have a frenetic quality about it. Some Russians 
condemn it -- and him with it. Nabokov, admittedly wishing to shock his Cornell 
students into reading the novel, called "Demons" "grand booming nonsense with 
flashes of genius. . . . It is, as in all Dostoevsky's novels, a rush and 
tumble of words with endless repetitions, mutterings aside, a verbal overflow 
which shocks the reader after, say, Lermontov's transparent and beautifully 
poised prose." 
</P>
<P>
 When translating Dostoevsky, Garnett was under some pressure from her editor 
"to tone down such passages as might be thought offensive," but she was also 
temperamentally inclined to do so. Of the more recent translators, MacAndrew 
tends to tone down Dostoevsky's language even more than Garnett, thereby making 
him "an easier read." 
</P>
<P>
 The path they have chosen is to retranslate the entire Dostoevsky corpus in an 
internally consistent manner (so far they have completed "The Brothers 
Karamazov," "Crime and Punishment," and "Notes from Underground" to great 
critical acclaim) and in the face of the commonplace that a translation should 
sound "smooth" and "natural." My feeling is that the reason they have succeeded 
so well in bringing Dostoevsky into English is not that they have made him 
sound bumpy or unnatural but that they have managed to capture and 
differentiate the characters' many voices. 
</P>
<P>
 All Dostoevsky's works are notably weighted toward dialogue. In "Demons" even 
the narrator participates actively as a character, conversing with us rather 
than telling us what to think (as do Tolstoy's narrators in no uncertain 
terms). Nabokov -- again, by way of disparagement -- called Dostoevsky "more of 
a playwright than a novelist" and complained that "the natural background and 
all things relevant to the perception of the senses hardly exist." Garnett 
acknowledged feeling less at home with dialogue than description; Pevear and 
Volokhonsky come into their own when faced with Dostoevsky's wonderfully 
quirky, yet in the end functionally more than justified use of varied speech 
patterns. Like their author, the translators convey through form, through the 
multiplicity of voices, the polyphony that the critic Mikhail Bakhtin, a 
staunch Russian admirer of Dostoevsky's, has made a catchword of contemporary 
critical discourse. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people prefer paintings by the Old Masters in the smoky, dirt-encrusted 
form in which they first encountered them; others revel in restorations. Yet in 
the end what really matters is the quality of the restoration, that is, the 
restorer's tact and skill. In this instance readers with no Russian can rest 
assured they are in the best of hands: The introduction, the helpful but 
unobtrusive notes, and most of all the fine translation make the new "Demons" a 
capital job of restoration. The Dostoevsky it conveys comes closer to his 
Russian persona than any we have had till now.

MY BUBBES; TESSIE IS 93; PEARLIE, 92 -- THE STRONGEST WOMEN I KNOW. THEY'RE 
PIONEERS, AND ADVENTURERS, MATRIARCHS AND SHTARKERS . THEY ARE MY GURUS, MY 
PERSONAL GUIDES TO THE EXISTENTIAL DILEMMA.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Compared to my grandmothers, I'm a shmegegge . That's shma-geggy , Yiddish for 
nerd or ineffectual slob. They, of course, would fiercely deny that their 
granddaughter is a nudnik . How could I be anything but brilliant and beautiful 
in their eyes? Perfect, even. But the truth is that next to them, I am a 
regular shmo . 
</P>
<P>
 Take gin rummy, for instance. The last time I played Tessie, my father's 
mother, she killed me -- 98-0. She knew she would. When I asked her to play, 
she replied, without malice: "Why? You vant to see how you can lose?" 
</P>
<P>
 As for my mother's mother, Pearlie, her particular genius resides in a ball of 
yarn and a crochet needle. You need a toilet-paper cover? A doll with braids? A 
place mat? An afghan? A beret? You name it, Pearl makes it. She shouldn't, 
because of her arthritis. But sometimes, a yarn master can't help herself and 
sneaks in a baby sweater for her great-granddaughter, packaged inside a knotted 
plastic bag. ("She's so beautiful, kineahora ," Pearlie tells me, invoking one 
of her oft-chanted Yiddish expressions to ward away the evil eye while pressing 
another crocheted goody into my hands for my 10-month-old daughter, Lucy. I am 
pathetic and bring Pearlie nothing. She waves her thin, veiny hand, as if to 
bat away my guilt, and says, "It's nothink, dahlink.") 
</P>
<P>
 My grandmothers are the strongest women I know. True, their health is fading. 
But in my mind, they're pioneers and adventurers, brave and fearless. Shtarkers 
, to be precise, who live by themselves. Tessie Weinreb in Queens, N.Y., 
Pearlie Feldman in Santa Monica. They're also the first women I've watched grow 
old, outliving, between them, 12 siblings, three husbands, one son and most of 
their friends. Pearlie is 92; Tessie is 93. "Maybe," Tessie says with a shrug, 
"God forgot my address." 
</P>
<P>
 Always with the jokes, they can get on my nerves. They can even drive me 
crazy, with their Old World superstitions and Neanderthal attitudes about a 
range of issues. Pfui! And yet, they are my gurus. Just as striking as their 
longevity is the sense of utter constancy they offer in a world that seems to 
speed along faster and faster. Like it or not, they are my personal guides into 
old age and the existential dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
 "You shrink, this you should know," Tessie advises. 
</P>
<P>
 "You shrivel up, just like a potato," Pearlie agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Two matriarchs, they are my bubbes -- the Yiddish term for grandmothers, 
pronounced with the vowel sound in bubbles, bub-ees. They are not in the least 
pretentious, nothing fancy-shmancy about them. And they offer no sugar-coated 
prescriptions for life: It is hard, it is complicated, it is not forever. There 
is joy in sorrow and sorrow in joy. Always, there is family. And passion. Even 
now, the titles of their favorite TV shows speak volumes. Tessie's is "The 
Young and the Restless." Pearlie's is "Mad About You." 
</P>
<P>
 The last of a breed, they are still close to their immigrant past, hardened by 
wars and the Depression and shaped by discrimination against Jews that began to 
dissipate only in the 1950s. Now they have little patience for basic questions. 
What is, is. Ask Tessie, for instance, why being an Orthodox Jew is so 
important to her, and she answers rhetorically: "Why does an Arab wear the 
shmatte on his head?" Ask Pearl why she continues wearing her wedding band, 17 
years after her husband's death, and she quips: "I'm married forever to him. 
All my life. I'm a Jewish nun." 
</P>
<P>
 I should say, at this point, that I am utterly baffled at how middle age has 
turned me into a sentimental sop. Pathologically so. I cry over stuff that is 
embarrassing -- my 10-year-old's Little League game, my 7-year-old's 
musical-comedy debut, my baby girl's weaning. I am a boomer sandwich, eyeing my 
children's growth, my parents' aging and my grandmothers' frailty as signs of 
my own mortality. So I unearth the past to make future connections, keeping the 
continuum alive. I go back to the Source.  
</P>
<P>
 To Pearlie and Tessie. My grandmas. My heroes. My bubelehs . 
</P>
<P>
 I first decided to interview my grandmothers when I realized that they were 
having a difficult time recuperating from falls they suffered in the summer of 
1993. Both had slipped and broken their arms. Pearlie's stumble was especially 
traumatic, since it occurred when she was two-stepping with her folk-dance 
troupe, the Dancing Dolls, during the rousing finale of "Achy Breaky Heart." 
</P>
<P>
 I phoned them both to say that I wanted to write an article about them. 
</P>
<P>
 " Oy vaysmere ," Tessie complained right away, "Can't you get a better 
subject? I can't see. I can't hear. I can't talk. What else?" Translation: She 
couldn't wait to see me. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearlie was equally happy to comply. "Joyala, my life is an open book. You 
just tell me when." 
</P>
<P>
 In the following months, with tape recorder in hand, I periodically visited 
them and, on occasion, telephoned. When I stayed with Tessie, we were 
roommates, and her snoring drove me wild; Pearlie and I stole time together 
over tea and bopkas . I found myself frantically jotting down notes about the 
details of their lives, as if the act of remembering would allow me to hold on 
to them longer. Then I resisted writing their stories with every journalistic 
bone in my body: How could I truthfully distill the lives I most wanted to 
extol ? 
</P>
<P>
 At first glance, Tessie and Pearlie seem as different as two women could be. 
Tessie can be secretive and has few close friends, though she is acidly funny; 
Pearlie, who tosses her head back and lets go a piercing cackle when she 
laughs, is vocal and has a range of acquaintances and relationships. Pearlie is 
ribald, Tessie is circumspect. Tessie boycotted my wedding 17 years ago when I 
married my husband, Brock, who is not Jewish; Pearlie not only came to our 
wedding, just a month after her husband died, but she also joyously danced 
there, a la Isadora Duncan, in pink chiffon. Tessie strictly observes Jewish 
rituals, keeping kosher and attending shul as often as possible; Pearlie, who 
prays by writing letters to her deceased son and husband, believes that 
religion resides in the heart. 
</P>
<P>
 On closer inspection, though, it quickly becomes clear that my grandmothers 
face the same predicament: Both women, in a sense, have become invisible. As 
with the matriarchs of the Old Testament, you have to read between the lines to 
understand them -- or just to find them. To be an old woman in American culture 
is to be cast off, dismissed as daft. Jewish mothers, in particular, have 
become cultural icons and the butt of countless jokes. Yet, these public 
portrayals mask a deeper truth that is no secret: Women outlive men. Thus, 
their undisputed power resides in their longevity, as keepers of the family 
legacy. Tessie and Pearlie stand as symbols that sometimes there are men around 
and sometimes not, but life goes on pretty much the same either way. 
</P>
<P>
 They tell stories about their past with the narrative panache of Isaac 
Bashevis Singer. Are their stories true? Some go back so far, to the middle of 
the 19th Century, that they surely improve in the retelling. But accuracy isn't 
the point, really. What matters to me, anyway, is that I find the girl in the 
woman before me, still alive with possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 What follows is my ode to bubbe hood, a patchwork of interviews, recipes and 
kitchen-table advice: Pearlie's wisdom and Tessie's tsuris ("worries"). 
</P>
<P>
 "You know what's tsuris ?" Tessie asks, casting one of her deadpan looks. "Two 
Jews were sitting on the train and they were talking tsuris . And the Irishman 
was holding onto the strap in the train. And he hears them talking tsuris , 
tsuris , tsuris . He says, 'For God's sake, if you have a sore ass, why don't 
you get up and give me a seat?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Mother's Day, May 8. 6:30 a.m. Inside Tessie's apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Come, mamashayna ," she says as soon as she's hugged me hello. "Come eat 
breakfast." 
</P>
<P>
 Bleary-eyed, I've just arrived on the red-eye from Los Angeles to her 
one-bedroom apartment in Queens. She lives in a six-story brick building, the 
Winston, in a tree-lined, working-class neighborhood of Briarwood, not far from 
Forest Hills. In anticipation of my arrival, she's already beaten the eggs for 
my matzo brei -- scrambled eggs with moistened matzo. Wrapped in a plastic bag 
and covered with a paper towel is her homemade marble cake, my favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 At 93, Tessie stands just under five feet, though she once was a couple of 
inches taller. She wears thick, pink-framed glasses, red lipstick, a flowered 
housedress and sneakers. Her right hand shakes, her fingers are gnarled from 
arthritis, her sciatica is a source of constant pain. Still, she manages to 
have her fingernails painted fire-engine red. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good to live long, but it's not good to get old," she tells me. "You 
can't do what you want." 
</P>
<P>
 She sets a cup of coffee on the place mat. "Do you use sugar or you use your 
disposition?" 
</P>
<P>
 Her apartment, decorated with family photographs from decades ago, is 
furnished neo-"I Love Lucy," with most of the lamps, tables and chairs from the 
1950s. But they've held up for a reason. "This is what I learned from my 
husband Izzy," she says of the grandfather I never met and for whom I was given 
my Hebrew name. "If you buy, buy good." In the living room, above an 
overstuffed couch, there hangs a pastoral oil painting of Stevensville in the 
Catskills. On a side wall, there are two ceramic dancers in frames. Over her 
bed, too, there are framed prints of Degas dancers. 
</P>
<P>
 It's drizzling out. I ask about her arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wouldn't let me alone." 
</P>
<P>
 "Who wouldn't let you alone?" 
</P>
<P>
 "The arthritis. They stick to me. They like me." A jokenik, she deflects most 
questions with her highly idiosyncratic brand of humor. I offer her a Mother's 
Day gift -- a box of soaps. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why spend money on me?" she asks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why not?" I ask. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Cause I hope I use it up." Meaning she doesn't think she'll live so long. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope not," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "You hope not?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Because me no like it," she says, invoking the upside-down syntax to a 
favorite old Yiddish musical, "Oy, I Like She." 
</P>
<P>
 To listen to someone you love tell you that she'd prefer to be dead is 
dreadful. In my grandmother's case, though, it's predictable. She's been 
talking this way, without remorse or rancor, for the last several years, at 
least. But her depression is also understandable. Once stubbornly independent, 
she now must rely on her two daughters, who structure their week around 
shopping for her and transporting her to the doctor or to the beauty shop. She 
has an attendant five days a week to help out. And she has an emergency button, 
plus the phone, her lifeline. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lost confidence in myself," she explains about her fall last year. "I don't 
trust myself anywhere. I don't go down for the mail myself. I do sometimes, but 
the cane -- I hate people should see me. So I don't go some places I want to 
go." She ventures out twice a week now, to her Golden Age Club on Mondays and 
to Danny's Specialty Beauty Shop on Saturdays to have her white hair fluffed 
and sprayed into a bubble-like crown. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, anything that I want to do, I can't do it myself," she says. It takes 
her half an hour to fasten her bra, longer to clean a chicken. "So what is it? 
I don't want to aggravate the Man Upstairs, but it's no use. Why do they 
celebrate the Golden Age?" 
</P>
<P>
 She reconsiders. "Maybe I'm too critical on myself, too," she adds. "The kids 
say that I'm too critical. Do you find me that way?" 
</P>
<P>
 Not at the moment. She's just served me a giant slice of cake for breakfast. 
Who am I to complain? 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes later, though, I'm fair game. For this trip, I've lugged along a 
breast pump so that I can continue to nurse my 10-month-old daughter when I 
return home. Tessie disapproves of the setup. "If she could do the four days 
without you, you don't need it," she says of the pump. 
</P>
<P>
 I disagree. "All right," she shrugs, "nurse until her wedding day." 
</P>
<P>
 The blue door to Pearlie's apartment has a little plastic sign hanging from 
the doorknob, like the ones you leave out for room service in a hotel. But 
Pearlie's sign is a daily reminder of what it's like to live in the shadow of 
death: "Good Morning. I'm OK!" 
</P>
<P>
 Kathie Lee and Regis are blaring from the TV set. Pearlie tells me she doesn't 
much care for Kathy Lee's new haircut. We guffaw over Regis' beady eyes. Pearl 
has high cheekbones, bright eyes and a pixie haircut, like Peter Pan. I 
practically tower over her now, she's such a sliver of her former self. Though 
she moved to California 10 years ago, her voice is still coated in Brooklynese. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want orange juice or what?" she asks. She lives five minutes away from me 
in the Silvercrest, a concrete apartment complex for seniors. Her building is 
sandwiched between a muffler shop and the Phoenix Bookstore, a hangout for 
hipsters. During the week, she usually eats her meals downstairs in the dining 
hall; otherwise, she cooks for herself in her tiny kitchen, making nothing like 
the lavish spreads she is famous for in the family. But on the kitchen table, 
there is an entire plate of chocolate chip cupcakes she baked fresh for my 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
 She speaks in code sometimes, expecting me to fill in the blanks of her 
sentences. She forgets words. Names slip her mind. She calls this "the 
92-year-old thing." I tell her that I've got the same problem, but I'm 51 years 
younger than she. She cackles. So do I. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're no-cholesterol cupcakes," she explains, sitting at the table, which 
is covered by one of her crocheted tablecloths. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you make them from scratch?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah." 
</P>
<P>
 "Really?" 
</P>
<P>
 "And there's no cholesterol." 
</P>
<P>
 "Where's the recipe from?" 
</P>
<P>
 "From the box." A cake mix, in other words? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah. And they come out perfect. They're so easy. Yeah. Ya take 'em right out 
of the thing." The thing. She means the paper cupcake wrapper.  
</P>
<P>
 Her usual sartorial splendor is much in evidence. She wears a peach-and-white 
sweater with matching polyester pants and white Reeboks. She crocheted the 
sweater not long ago, and it has gold thread crocheted into the wool. Around 
her neck, she wears a gold charm that says "Happy Birthday," a gift from her 
grandchildren for her 90th. 
</P>
<P>
 "You gotta enjoy your life," she tells me, worried that I'm overextended. 
"Don't rush, rush, rush. Learn to enjoy while you have your health." Though 
she's slowed down recently, having stopped her volunteer work at the local 
hospital and cut out her weekly dancing with "the Dolls" for fear of another 
fall, Pearlie's great enthusiasm for life is undeterred by age. "I think if you 
keep yourself involved in lots of things and don't concentrate on yourself, it 
helps a lot," she says. "It's good to have outside interests, to keep the mind 
busy. It's like a sore in your heart to not be involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life is great, if we could only have it without pain," she says. "What's bad 
with life? There can be lots of fun in this world, lots of enjoyment -- air to 
breathe, food to eat, places to go. What do we know what we have in the other 
world? Nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Her mind is razor sharp, especially when I ask about her past. She conjures up 
vivid memories of having her tonsils extracted ("just yanked out with, like, 
pliers, but then I got to get ice cream with my father on the trolley"), of 
asking advice from the local health department on how to take care of her first 
baby because she wasn't sure if feeding him spinach at three months was 
advisable, of going through menopause ("The doctor said to me, 'Just lie down, 
put a cold compress to your head and chest, and relax.' And I didn't have any 
problems: It didn't last too long, about two years"). I survey her tiny 
apartment, decorated with recycled furniture from my parents' house, including 
the vanity table from my bedroom when I was a girl. Over the peephole to her 
door, she's hung a macrame object and little purple pompoms. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a shmtchek , shmtchkie -- a thing," she says, explaining this 
all-purpose Yiddishism (pronounced shmitch-eck and shmitch-key ) as a 
whatchamacallit. "If you want a hand, you say, 'Give me that shmtchkie .' " She 
smiles mischievously. "Grandpa used to call this a shmtchkala ," she says, 
pointing to her crotch.  
</P>
<P>
 I ask her to please not turn this into an X-rated interview. " Shmtchek can be 
any part of your body," she says.  
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, she was mad about Moe, my lusty grandfather who'd give me rides on 
his feet and make his biceps dance to the strains of Russian folk songs. She 
invokes his memory, his joie de vivre , whenever possible. When my younger 
sister recently reported how wonderful, kind and supportive her new husband is, 
Pearlie asked only one question, a la Moe: "Is he a good lovah?" A BUBBE 
QUESTIONNAIRE 
</P>
<P>
 Do you have any famous relatives or ancestors?  
</P>
<P>
 Tessie: None of them were in jail. To be famous? I can't recall. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearlie: No, except on Grandpa's side. His sister's daughter was married to a 
gentleman who was a senator. I forget his name. That's the only outstanding 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 What is your favorite health, beauty or fitness tip?  
</P>
<P>
 Tessie: Beautiful I was never. I'd rather go for health than beauty. But I 
can't control my health anymore. I like to be clean, neat. Fancy? No. Of 
course, I have my hair done and nails done every Saturday at Danny's. I'd 
rather look decent. So people wouldn't say, "That old lady, she looks such a 
shlump !" As for health, I just ate some potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearlie: When I look in the mirror, I'm not happy to see the wrinkles. The 
skin changes so much in your 90s. The whole face changes. I don't know how to 
stop it. I just don't want to get to look any worse than I am now. (Laughing.) 
Because I don't want to look scary to my great-grandchildren -- and it's bound 
to happen. Your face becomes crepey. Your eyes become smaller. Your nose 
becomes longer. I put on sunscreen when I go out. Just a little powder and 
lipstick. I can't pluck my eyebrows because the skin gets red and sore. I do 
the best I can. I brush my hair and wash it. Otherwise, no secrets. I never was 
one to stay in the beauty parlor. As long as I take a shower twice a day, keep 
myself clean. Not be a shtunk , smelly. 
</P>
<P>
 The word that best describes you is:  
</P>
<P>
 Tessie: Not a blabbermouth. My children say critical. It's easier to criticize 
than be correct. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearlie: Love. 
</P>
<P>
 Tell me the most unusual things about yourself or unusual things you have 
done.  
</P>
<P>
 Tessie: I got married again. Maybe I shouldn't have. I don't know. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearlie: I like to tell dirty jokes, a simple joke. It's nice to make people 
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 How do you like to celebrate your birthday?  
</P>
<P>
 Tessie: No wishes, no shmishes. That's all. I don't tell anybody it's my 
birthday. What's the difference? Those years that come, I don't appreciate it. 
I can't do what I want. I don't enjoy with the old age. To me, I'm not that 
thrilled about it. I'm living the longest of anybody in my family. So? Pish 
posh. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearlie: To be with the family. Oh yeah. 
</P>
<P>
 Can you love your children too much?  
</P>
<P>
 Tessie: There is no such thing to love children too much. No. It's not 
possible. Or is it? 
</P>
<P>
 Pearlie: When you give love, you give it with your whole being. I don't think 
I could love my children less, no matter what. Even my son-in-laws. My family 
is my life. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 It is a beautiful, crisp morning in New York. By 10, Tessie and I are still 
wearing our flannel pj's, with no intention of getting dressed. We've already 
broken into a box of chocolates I've brought with me from L.A. She likes the 
chocolate-covered honeycomb. "We're not eating, just noshing," she explains. 
</P>
<P>
 A lifelong Democrat, she loves to talk politics and is presently castigating 
Paula Jones. "Maybe she really instigated him," she says, referring to 
President Clinton. "This she wouldn't tell you." 
</P>
<P>
 We break out the cards, and I "wash" or shuffle them. The cards fly, 10 to 
her, 10 to me. She turns over a king of spades, double points. Her joints ache, 
her cough won't quit, her ankles swell. But over a game of cards, the physical 
ailments subside and her mind is as agile as ever. 
</P>
<P>
 My grandmother always uses a deck of red Bicycle cards, the ones with two 
cherubs atop bicycles in opposing circles. The drawing makes me think of Tessie 
as an angel, playing cards. The circle of life. It's a nice reverie, a 
confection that has nothing to do with reality. 
</P>
<P>
 "What kinds of meshugeneh ("crazy") cards you gave me?" she asks, surveying 
her hand. 
</P>
<P>
 If American Indians listen to their elders around a campfire, I listen to my 
grandmother with cards fanned in my hands, a discard pile between us. It's our 
little ritual, practically sacred. For as long as I can remember, we've related 
this way. First it was the game of war, then go fish. Then, when my hands were 
big enough, gin. She used to let me win when I'd stay with her while I was 
still in college, the two of us smoking cigarettes into the night. Now she's 
ruthless. I throw another card on the discard pile. 
</P>
<P>
 "See?" she chides me. "You don't know how to play. You gave me the jack and 
the queen!" 
</P>
<P>
 I tell her it's because I'm kind. She throws another card that I pick up. 
</P>
<P>
 "You take cards for tromba ," she chides me again. "You know what's tromba ?" 
I shake my head. "For speculation." 
</P>
<P>
 My knowledge of Yiddish is extremely limited, but Tessie uses these 
card-playing sessions to offer lessons. Amazingly, she has no age spots on the 
back of her hands. This, she tells me, is because her family had an oil 
business in Europe and her hands were constantly immersed in cottonseed oil. 
Her job as a teen-ager was to teach the workers how to extract the oil. "I was 
never young," she says of her childhood. "I was never a child." 
</P>
<P>
 Her father ran a brick and oil factory in what was then Austria, formerly 
Poland. Her mother never paid her a compliment. Raised "to be nice," she was 
born Toby Teitel in the shtetl of Kozowa in Galicia, not far from the Russian 
border. Her education was cut short when she was 13 because of World War I, 
though she could speak six languages. A refugee for two years, she crossed the 
Carpathian Mountains by horse and wagon to Czechoslovakia with her family and 
returned home around 1917, only to find that her Polish neighbors had taken her 
family's home apart, brick by brick. 
</P>
<P>
 After contracting typhoid fever and losing her hair, she supported her family 
by working the black market, trading oil and kerosene for flour and tobacco. 
Anti-Semitism was endemic. Since her father had a long beard and was easily 
identifiable as a Jew, he risked his life every time he walked outdoors. She, 
on the other hand, could pass as a shiksa in bare feet and peasant skirts. 
</P>
<P>
 Was she angry with her father for not protecting her? "The cannons were 
shooting over our heads," she remembers, "and if anything had to be done, I 
could do it. For me it was an adventure. An adventure to go, to do more than my 
father does. My father once said, we were having an argument, he says, 'I like 
to argue with Toby.' He knew I'd answer him right. And he liked it. He'd ask me 
my advice. He and I, we were really pals. Why should I be angry? I protected 
him, so he shouldn't have to go outside." 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 15, 1920, she and her parents came to America by steerage. At Ellis 
Island, she had her first taste of white bread and corn flakes for breakfast 
and reluctantly agreed to change her name to Tessie at the urging of her 
sisters. Within a year, she met a dapper egg handler, Izzy Horowitz, a gentle 
man who didn't have much of a flair for business but adored the violin. 
Together they opened a mom-and-pop grocery store in Brooklyn, called Clover 
Farms, and had three children. My father was the only boy. Tessie lived up to 
the meaning of her married name, Horowitz: "works hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Was she in love with him? "Yes, but I knew that I can do better than he. We 
were in business. . . ." Her voice drifts off, as if to suggest theirs was a 
marriage of convenience. What followed were years of the Depression, when they 
lost the store. While her husband worked as a grocery clerk, earning $20 a week 
in her brother's store, she raised money for the local hospital, the kosher one 
with two kitchens. During World War II, she sent her son off to war; he 
returned from Japan, wanting to become a psychoanalyst. Her daughters became a 
bookkeeper and a schoolteacher. Not long after Izzy died in 1951, she married a 
milkman, Sam Weinreb.  
</P>
<P>
 For Tessie, it is a virtue to never reveal one's true feelings, especially 
sadness. When asked how she's dealt with her grief, she says, "I never made any 
sour face to anybody. Nobody knew what's inside of me. They still don't." She 
catches herself, as if she's said too much. "I'm talking now," she adds, "but I 
shouldn't." 
</P>
<P>
 "Why not?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Pheh," she replies, waving her hand. 
</P>
<P>
 It's 12:30. She snaps on the TV. "Shut up!" she's yelling at the TV set. Her 
soap opera, "The Young and the Restless," is on, and she's bored by one of the 
plot lines. She likes to watch this show for the blind character who she claims 
has never blinked, a sign to Tessie of fine acting ability. But more, she's 
interested in the trial of a woman who's been charged with killing her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 If she'd had the opportunity, my grandmother tells me, she would have been a 
lawyer. Or better still, a writer. She's never admitted this girlhood fantasy 
to me before. With my pen and notebook in hand, I search her milky gray eyes 
and feel my shoulders lighten. The flash of connection, a flesh-and-blood link 
of desire, spanning three generations. Not that she says any more. She doesn't 
need to. 
</P>
<P>
 She sits in her recliner chair with the blue embroidered cloth draped over the 
headrest. "Oh, here's the caca-mercial again," she complains. 
</P>
<P>
 The phone rings. Bad news. My mother has learned she has breast cancer. She's 
opted for a mastectomy. 
</P>
<P>
 The phone rings again. It's Pearlie, her voice shaky, bordering on hysterical. 
She asks for my permission to call my mother, even though she's just spoken to 
her. She's made the same call to my older sister.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to be a bother to her," she tells me, saying she doesn't want my 
mother to worry that she's worrying. "I hesitate 10 times before I call. I 
don't want to be a nudge. 
</P>
<P>
 "See, when your children are babies and you learn to protect them, no matter 
how old they are, they're always your children. They're still your babies. And 
that feeling never leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I'm a pain in the ass," she adds, her voice cracking. "Please forgive 
me, Joyala. But she's my baby. My baby. Why can't it be me, not her?" 
</P>
<P>
 When I hear my grandmother, fragile, frightened, nervous, wanting to help but 
knowing she can do nothing, I hear myself -- and I cannot bear to listen. 
</P>
<P>
 In the weeks that follow, while my mother is recuperating from surgery, I 
speak to Pearlie more often than usual. Normally, we talk on the phone weekly 
and see each other about twice a month -- for family gatherings, brunches, 
birthday parties -- and invariably she ushers me home with another batch of 
French toast for my kids. But now, we've become allies in the worry department. 
My mother's cancer brings me closer to my grandmother, who tells me that her 
greatest wish in life is that her daughter be well. 
</P>
<P>
 For the time being, anyway, her wish has come true.  
</P>
<P>
 In June, Pearlie, my mother, Lucy and I watch my middle child, Gus, perform in 
a little show at the Odyssey Theater -- a four-generation cheering section. 
Afterward, Pearlie hands me an envelope to deliver to him. In it, she's 
enclosed $15 in cash and a note telling Gus how much she loves him. The 
following week, she bequeaths her old typewriter to my kids, too. Always 
giving, always bearing hugs and kisses, even in print with her Xs and O's. 
</P>
<P>
 And I wonder, how is it that someone who grew up with so little can give so 
much? 
</P>
<P>
 Born on the Lower East Side in 1902, Pauline Rosenwasser hated her given name, 
so she changed it to Pearl. Her parents immigrated from Austria in 1894. Her 
father pressed women's coats. Her mother opened a series of candy and dry goods 
stores in Brooklyn, often leaving her children unattended. While playing on a 
fire escape one day, Pearlie watched as a cousin fell three stories, suffering 
a minor concussion. She remembers her mother saying, guiltily, "It should only 
have been one of my children," and later wondering if she had cursed her own 
family. Of seven children, three died young -- two baby boys and a 13-year-old 
girl, from a weak heart. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Pearl was 13, she had to leave school to help support the family. 
Before she learned shorthand and worked as a stenographer, she sewed labels 
into coats for $5 a week. When she needed a winter coat, a family friend 
suggested she could get one wholesale from Morris Feldman, who worked on Second 
Avenue and specialized in tucking and tailoring coats for heavyset women.  
</P>
<P>
 "When I first met him and he invited me up to his shop, he took my 
measurements -- and he never tried anything," she remembers, dreamily. "He was 
a total gentleman! I always respected him so much for that!" She fell in love 
instantly; he was so handsome -- blue eyes and thick, wavy hair -- and he 
taught her how to tango. Her mother disapproved, since he was Russian-born, not 
American. Pearlie couldn't help herself; they had three children, a son and two 
daughters -- a stockbroker, a schoolteacher and an artist. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that everything was idyllic. She endured her husband's love for schnapps, 
cigars and horse races and the shock of her son's death, at age 53, from a 
heart attack on a subway. At the funeral, Moe had no idea their son had died, 
since he had suffered a series of strokes. Three years later, after nursing him 
through a terminal illness, Pearlie moved West to be closer to her older 
daughter, my mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Just how Pearlie managed to live this long is a question she's often asked, 
since she's outlived everyone at the Silvercrest. "You got to listen to your 
body," she says simply, "like even if you get a corn, you soak your feet." 
There are some dietary concessions, including the no-cholesterol cupcakes. But 
truth be told, she's a big proponent of butter, of an occasional glass of wine 
and of gargling with Cepacol at the first sign of a sore throat. And exercise 
is important: She walks to the Third Street Promenade daily, jogs in place in 
her apartment and takes an exercise class for her arthritis twice a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really think as long as you can move, you should keep on moving," she says. 
"Because when you sit, everything sits with you. When you hit 92, especially, 
the body sort of lets you know, 'Ah, you're getting old, take it easy. We're 
tired of taking care of you, the bones.' " Most recently, she realized her 
taste buds had stopped working. 
</P>
<P>
 But back to the longevity question. "Oh, I think it's the family that makes me 
live this long," she says of her nine grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren. 
"There's so much enjoyment in this. I couldn't ask for anything more. No money. 
No jewelry. No anything could compete with the wonderful family I have." I 
assure her she doesn't have to say this for my benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I say thank you to God for letting me live this long. And anything He gives 
me over that, I thank him again twice. But I want to tell you something," she 
adds. "If you're a good person when you're young, you're a good person when 
you're old. And if you're a nasty person when you're young, you're a nasty 
person when you're old. Character doesn't change. Age don't change character." 
</P>
<P>
 What does Tessie think of Pearlie and Pearlie of Tessie?  
</P>
<P>
 Tessie: I like her very much. I admire her very much. She is a different type 
than I am. I grew up in Europe. She grew up in America. I don't know which way 
is better or worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearlie: Tessie? She is a good person, a very interesting woman. She has a 
different attitude about life. She is looking toward death. She thinks it would 
be a relief. I don't figure that. I want to last as long as I can. I want to be 
on this Earth. She says it would be great if she died in her sleep. But life is 
so interesting, you know? So much change. You find it interesting enough to 
want to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 The status of women in Judaism has always been problematic to me. Things are 
changing, of course, but not by much. It takes a lot to undo 5,000 years of 
put-downs. Just take a look at the Book of Leviticus and the childbirth 
purification ritual: A woman who bears a son is unclean for 40 days thereafter, 
whereas a woman who bears a daughter is unclean for 80 days. Exactly how this 
hideous little 40-day difference can possibly be accounted for is unclear to 
me. Can anyone in his right mind really believe that girl babies are somehow 
dirtier than boy babies? 
</P>
<P>
 Here's my grandmothers' feeling about it: Gender shmender. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, to explain the exalted-cum-pampered status of males in my own family, 
Tessie offers a story. "My grandmother Toby, the one that I'm named after, she 
had a daughter. Then she had a boy. The boy died young. She had another baby, a 
girl. Another baby, a boy, passed away. The boys couldn't live and the girls 
lived. She already had three daughters and not even one son. And it bothered 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 "She became pregnant again. She had a dream that an old man with a long gray 
beard came to her, and he said, 'You know you're pregnant and you're going to 
have a boy. But name him after me. My name is Chaim. And he's going to live.' 
They had nobody in the family with that name, Chaim. You know, there was a 
Yousla, Moishe, but no name Chaim. And the baby was born a boy, and she named 
him Chaim, and he was the only son. That was my father. He was a spoiled brat. 
He took advantage of his four sisters." Yet she idolized him completely. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping that Tessie and Pearlie would give voice to my own beliefs, I asked 
them the same leading question: 
</P>
<P>
 Are you a feminist?  
</P>
<P>
 Tessie: Say it in plain English. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearlie: What do you mean, a feminist? 
</P>
<P>
 Do you believe in equal rights for women?  
</P>
<P>
 Pearlie: Definitely. Women need to work and be equal. But also, not to hoit 
yourself. It's hard to have a career and family. I love to see women get ahead 
in the medical field and all over. When we were younger, we didn't have that. 
We were treated like a pot on the stove. Really! We had to do the dishes and 
clean the house, and the men got so much more respect because they were 
supposed to be smarter than us. They had more education than us. Now, when I 
see these women doing things that men never even dreamed of doing, I think the 
coming world is great. We can expect much better and bigger things now. 
</P>
<P>
 Tessie: Yes, that I would like. I wouldn't mind that at all. Politics interest 
me very much. If I'd be much younger, I'd run for senator, and I'd make the law 
even better for the women than the men. My mother and her mother were brought 
up to just get married and keep house and raise the children. When I grew up, 
they had to educate the boys. The girls don't need anything because they can 
wash diapers without education and things like this. A woman should have the 
same rights as a man. I wouldn't let my husband go above me. If he drives, I 
drive, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Just now, Pearlie is remembering her happiest moments as a child and confides 
they were stolen and secretive -- reading. "My biggest pleasure was going to 
the library, taking home seven or eight books -- they'd give you as much books 
as you wanted -- putting it under my cover in the bed, and after Mama would go 
to bed, I'd turn on the light and read for hours. I got more out of reading 
even than going to the movies." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, like the last few times I've seen her, Pearlie's eyes are red-rimmed. 
At first, she says the pinkness is caused by her allergies, but later admits 
it's more often from crying. 
</P>
<P>
 "Living here," she says, "most of the people that die -- and they die in their 
sleep -- everybody else says, 'Oh boy, if I could only die in my sleep, it 
would be wonderful.' To be honest, everybody fears it. And they won't talk 
about it, either. They just say, 'Oh well, I wish I could die like that.' " 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first time that Pearlie has spoken to me about her fear of 
dying. On more days than she cares to recall, another apartment in her building 
stands empty because of the death of a friend or neighbor. More than once, she 
has told me that she feels "desolated." Just a week ago, her 95-year-old 
brother, Marty, died.  
</P>
<P>
 Pearlie sits in her recliner chair from Sears, the one my mother and aunt 
bought for her last year. It almost looks thronelike, since she's covered it 
with one of her purple and orange afghans. She drifts off for a moment as the 
car mechanic next door checks another muffler. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes you feel sad," she continues, shutting her sliding glass door to 
mute the noise. "Your family leaves you. It's like a tree grows, and the 
branches come down, and the tree looks so lonesome and lonely. But I don't feel 
abandoned. I still feel attached." 
</P>
<P>
 I call Tessie, worried about the headaches she has begun to mention to my 
father. She recently was scared by a dream, of her parents calling out to her. 
Is her time near? 
</P>
<P>
 "How's your head, Grandma?" I ask. 
</P>
<P>
 "What head?" she rifles back, deflecting my concern. She asks about my 
children, starting with my older son, Trevor, one of her 14 
great-grandchildren. I report his latest accomplishment, placing second in a 
citywide math meet. As if to make up for lost moments (with my father, I 
wonder?), she instructs me to tell him how wonderful he is. 
</P>
<P>
 "You should!" she insists. "You should give him a compliment. When he deserves 
it. Don't be stingy! I'll teach you psychology. Really. No, this is a fact." 
</P>
<P>
 Then she adds, "Tell Brock hello." She has almost forgiven him for not being 
Jewish. When she was last in California, he teased her about flying off with 
him to the Caribbean. It's a joke she can't resist. "Tell him he's still my 
lover boy." 
</P>
<P>
 She says her health won't allow her to make her annual pilgrimage to 
California. She jokes that maybe she'll be "out of town," as in no longer 
alive. "If I don't come next year," she quips, "I'll come two years later."  
</P>
<P>
 I've put myself in an impossible position. Contrary to professional standards 
of journalism, I promised my grandmothers they could have prior approval of the 
details in this article. Family over business, as they'd say. 
</P>
<P>
 What did they think? 
</P>
<P>
 "Praise the children more," Pearlie says of her daughters. "They're the best. 
They don't come better. And you make Grandpa sound like a finagler and a 
gambler. You should portray him as a family man. Family always came first for 
him. He was such a good man." 
</P>
<P>
 There is one other little thing, Pearlie says, laughing. "The Salvation Army 
runs this building. Do you have to put in the part about my, you know, crotch?" 
</P>
<P>
 And Tessie? "It's OK," she told me, obviously holding back. "It's all right. I 
still don't like that you're talking about me. I don't want to be popular." 
</P>
<P>
 "Did I get anything wrong?" 
</P>
<P>
 "If I didn't want you to write it, I wouldn't have told you," she adds, 
shrewdly reflecting the advice most press agents offer their celebrity clients. 
"It's my simple life. But it is so." SAY GOODBY, BUBBES 
</P>
<P>
 Tessie: The more you live, the more you learn, the more you can forget. 
Farshtayt? ("Understand?") 
</P>
<P>
 Pearlie: People are so good, you have no idea. Anything else you want to know, 
Joyala? GRANDMA PEARLIE'S FAMOUS FRENCH TOAST 
</P>
<P>
 I put in two eggs, two large eggs. I put in just a cup of milk. And I put in a 
little drop of vanilla. You can use almond flavor or vanilla. If you don't want 
to use it, you don't have to use it. And a little sugar. I start off with a 
teaspoon and I find if I feel I need more, then I just add a little more, but 
don't forget the children put syrup on it, see, so we don't need it that sweet. 
</P>
<P>
 You can use any kind of white bread, sliced, if they like white bread. If you 
like whole wheat, you use whole wheat. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, you can fry it in butter, you can fry it in the no-fat, no-salt 
margarine. If I haven't got margarine, I use butter. 
</P>
<P>
 Soaking the bread, that's the secret. You have to have your oil or butter or 
whatever you put in there melted, and you mustn't leave it in too much in the 
milk. If you leave it in too much in the milk and the eggs, then it gets sloppy 
and then you can't have it like one piece. So you just put it in, take it out. 
I don't use too much grease. While it's frying, I see if it needs it, and if 
it's starting to burn, then I just add a little more, because I try to use as 
little as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's the whole big spiel. GRANDMA TESSIE'S AMAZING MATZO BALL SOUP  
</P>
<P>
 First of all, the chicken should be fresh. A good chicken. Usually, the 
non-Kosher chicken is not so fresh, because non-Kosher can stay in the freezer 
who knows how long? But if it's a nice, fresh-killed chicken, I clean it up. 
Take out all the feathers and all. Clean. And then, let's say for a chicken, 
you need four pounds. It's a good chicken already. 
</P>
<P>
 You put in some water in the pot to cover the chicken. Slowly, you bring it to 
a boil and take off the stuff. It gets foam, like. The fat. Nowadays an hour 
and a half is a lot. You cook it slowly. You put in vegetables, like carrot and 
celery. I don't like onions. I don't use no pepper, just salt. Very plain. 
Other people put in other stuff, yet. It's not like liquid when it gets cold. 
It's so like Jell-O. 
</P>
<P>
 I take out the carrot with a spoon or when I pour off the soup. I like the 
carrot. I don't like the celery to eat. I remember my sister Leah, she used to 
put in all kinds of vegetables. And he, Harry, her husband, he ate it all, the 
vegetables. I couldn't stand it, to see him eat it. 
</P>
<P>
 The matzo balls, you cook it separate, not in the soup. Let's say I make two 
eggs, is more than enough. For one person it's even enough one egg. And I put 
in a little matzo meal, about a half a cup. I beat it up good with a little 
salt. You can even put in a drop of pepper, which is OK. A drop of seltzer 
makes the balls fluffier, maybe a tablespoon of seltzer. I don't know the 
measurements. That's why I can never give anybody any recipes. Because I just 
mix it and I see, when it starts getting thicker or so. It's important you 
should let it stay a few hours, so it hardens up by itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I boil up a pot of water. Throw in the balls. But don't make them bigger 
than a walnut, or it'll come out like a big peach. Let it boil for 40 minutes. 
And that's all. So what?

 "Three Squirt Dog" is a hunk of gurgling cherry-red, 5-liter turbo-charged 
steel . . . that goes absolutely nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the summer of '83 in Cleveland. In this first novel, Rick Ridgway speaks 
through Bud Carew, a 21-year-old with a "buttwipe B.A." and "no solid 
employment prospects." Bottom line: Bud's that snotty, P.C. record store clerk 
who tries to shove his esoteric haircut music down your unwilling throat. He 
fuels his life with canned beer, PG-rated adventures and unimaginative sex 
scenes (all the while dropping music, literature and pop culture minutiae that 
would humble even Dennis Miller). What little plot there is starts with a youth 
puke-fest, peaks with B-movie high-jinx involving a backwoods cop and ends with 
more adolescent sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Bud's mom is in a hippy commune in Oregon. Dad died four years ago. Bud lives 
a freewheeling life at the pad of uncle Dewey, a record-store owner. He works 
at the store, and at the local supermarket -- stocking food (and eating it). 
His life revolves around sex, sex and sex. The novel's few twists involve 
scheduling the act around his girlfriend's periods, her family vacations and 
his stereotypically slacker-esque work schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridgway tap dances all over the pages of "Three Squirt Dog." (The book is 
named for a make-believe rock band; squirt equals urination.) Scenes speed by, 
and one-liners are omnipresent. There are smug exchanges between Bud, womanless 
friends Zak and Tony, uncle Dewey, grosser-than-thou teen-age brother Omar and 
godsend girlfriend Jane. The lines are so complementary to each other, the 
language so uniform, that the characters melt into one large snot-nose youth, 
using the language of the "dweeb," the "bush-head" and "DNA mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 You expect a laugh track. Even a parakeet gets a line. "Pretty vacant," it 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to out-Coupland Douglas Coupland, Ridgway mixes his high-octane gruel 
with feel-good innocence. Boy loves girl and all is right with the world. Don't 
worry, be sappy. (Douglas Coupland's "Shampoo Planet" involves a hippy mom, a 
love-struck twentysomething protagonist, and plenty of digs. But the thematic 
vibes are much heavier.) 
</P>
<P>
 Ridgway wants us all to recall the days of fresh flesh, flatulence contests 
and adolescent Angst. But we don't need to read 182 pages to do that. He wants 
us to be in awe of his rhythm, cadence and made-up youth vernacular. Save it 
for a poem. And he wants us to buy into what little guidance he offers. A phone 
call to Psychic Friends Network could be cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
 During a drunken, candle-lit chat, a cameo character drops in and does his 
Jesus Christ comic act for the kiddies: "You really want to know my attitude 
toward earth and its discontents? I can sum it up in six easy words: You broke 
it, you fix it." 
</P>
<P>
 Heavy soliloquy -- check. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the philosophical vibes are of the Butt-Headian variety: "I just like 
things that feel good and look good and smell good and taste good . . . it's in 
my genes," Bud says to Jane after sex. (Butt-Headian translation: "I don't like 
stuff that sucks.") 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so we're trapped in 1983 with no compass. So give us some laughs, some 
love, some adventure. The laughs are sophomoric, based on hygiene, bowel 
movements and dim-witted straw-man characters. The sex scenes are clumsy. And 
the adventure involves ransacking and roughing-up a red-neck cop. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the marketing fraud of "Three Squirt Dog," which might have more 
to do with the publisher than Ridgway. Judging by its bright, 
pink-squirt-on-yellow cover, the novel is another generation exposition. Kids. 
'80s. Pop culture terrain and multi-hyphen refrains. One problem: Ridgway is 
47, according to the Cleveland Plain Dealer, his hometown paper. You won't see 
that on the jacket, in the press release or even get it from the publicist -- 
who dodged the age issue. He would have been 36 in '83. Sort of confirms young 
America's sneaking suspicion that baby boomers are manipulative when it comes 
to media. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, knocking the book based on Ridgway's age is a false argument. The 
book falls on its own. But it seems to have suckered some late-comers to the 
Generation X media circus. The New Yorker compares its simplicity, carnality 
and positive vibes to rock 'n' roll itself. 
</P>
<P>
 That's too bad, because young authors such as Coupland, Erika Taylor ("The Sun 
Maiden") and Bruce Craven ("Fast Sofa") rock much louder. And they have places 
to go.

CHILDREN'S BOOKSHELF: SAY IT WITH PICTURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once the province of innocuous illustrations and sentimental stories about 
poky little puppies, the picture book has undergone an aesthetic overhaul in 
the last decade to emerge as one of the most creatively stimulating areas of 
publishing for children. Not only is the art now innovative and visually 
satisfying, but the accompanying stories have become richer and more textured, 
as well. This happy harmony of art and text are hallmarks of four of the best 
of the current bumper crop of picture books. 
</P>
<P>
 Author-illustrator Patricia Polacco's PINK AND SAY (Philomel: $15.95) offers 
an emotionally powerful story of an interracial friendship forged on a Civil 
War battlefield. Injured and left for dead, 15-year-old Union soldier Say 
Curtis is rescued by another teen-ager, Pink Aylee, who has skin "the color of 
polished mahogany." Separated from his own fighting company, Pink manages to 
carry Say to his home where his mother, Moe Moe Bay, lovingly nurses the 
wounded boy back to health. Based on a real-life experience of her great-great 
grandfather, Polacco's story demonstrates that history does not always promise 
happy endings. For when the two boys try to return to their units, they are 
captured and sent to the notorious Andersonville Prison where, tragically, Pink 
is hanged. Polacco's haunting story has the integrity of emotional truth while 
her richly colored pictures spill across double-page spreads to expand the 
reader's emotional involvement with this memorable and moving tribute to the 
human spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 Though seldom more than 32 pages long, picture books are large enough to 
embrace the whole range of human emotion, and hilarity is the order of the day 
in the latest of Susan Meddaugh's wacky stories about Martha, a pooch who can 
talk when she eats alphabet soup. In MARTHA CALLING (Houghton Mifflin: $14.95) 
the word-loving canine enters a radio call-in contest and wins a weekend for 
four at the cozy Come-On-Inn. The only problem? Those three little words Martha 
hates: "No Dogs Allowed." Not to worry, though: Meddaugh's brightly colored, 
deftly designed cartoon illustrations conspire with Martha's effervescent 
babblings to laugh-out-loud effect and a comically satisfying resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Yorinks, author of the Caldecott Medal-winning "Hey, Al!," has teamed 
up with veteran Mad magazine artist Mort Drucker to bring us a rollicking story 
of the Old West, WHITEFISH WILL RIDES AGAIN! (Michael diCapua 
Books/HarperCollins: $15). Yorinks' tale about a legendary lawman who has 
traded his gun for a harmonica moves along as briskly as a runaway buckboard 
while Drucker dazzles us with full-page pictures that are filled with comic 
detail and combine the best of cartoon and caricature techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 A fiesta in the Old Southwest is the setting for Deborah Nourse Lattimore's 
FRIDA MARIA (Browndeer Press/Harcourt Brace: $14.95). Working with rich earth 
tones, Lattimore has created fresco-like paintings that evoke the art and 
architecture of the California missions. They also provide a rich historical 
backdrop for this affectionate story of a spirited girl who defies tradition to 
ride in an important horse race, winning -- in the process -- both the event 
and the approval of her tradition-loving mother. Remember Ratty, Mole and Toad? 
</P>
<P>
 Did you ever wonder what happened to the animals from "The Wind in the 
Willows"? For example, did Toad remain a sensible animal? A sequel to Kenneth 
Grahame's classic children's story is being published this fall. Write us what 
you think happens. We'll publish the best of your sequel ideas. Send by Oct. 
21. to:

 27 September, at Duttons in Brentwood Anne Lamott signs "Bird by Bird, Some 
Instructions on Writing and Life" (Pantheon). "You're so nice to wait in line," 
she calls out. "You should all get checks." She turns to the cashier next to 
her. "Excuse me," she says, "will you please write these people some checks?" 
</P>
<P>
 In line are several women with babies, one of whom tells Lamott: "We never 
would have survived without 'Operating Instructions,' " Lamott's journal of her 
son Sam's first year. 
</P>
<P>
 When Lamott stands to read, she says, "I'll read the chapter on jealousy. It 
makes me look really mentally ill. Or, I could read the chapter on morality, 
which makes me look really moral. " 
</P>
<P>
 Jealousy, however, wins. "Jealousy is one of the occupational hazards of being 
a writer, and the most degrading," she reads. "And I, who have been the Leona 
Helmsley of jealousy, have come to believe that the only things that help ease 
or transform it are (a) getting older, (b) talking about it until the fever 
breaks, and (c) using it as material. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Lamott then asks for questions. The audience is quiet, shy. "Oh, I have a 
question," says Lamott. She raises her own hand. "How's Sam?" she asks. "Fine," 
she answers. "How's kindergarten?" she asks. "Fine, now that he knows what it 
is," she says. "He was anxious all summer, until he found out he just had to go 
there during the day. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 When a young woman asks how to start writing, Lamott suggests starting with 
short assignments and letting yourself write really, "execrable" (a euphemism) 
first drafts. "Writing one page a day, even taking time off for holidays and 
PMS, you'll have 250 pages in a year." 
</P>
<P>
 30 September, Bodhi Tree Bookstore One would think that proof of God's 
existence would at least fill Dodger Stadium. But mathematical physicist Frank 
Tipler, who claims to have proof of God and the Resurrection, has attracted 
50-odd people to the Bodhi Tree annex. 
</P>
<P>
 His proof, detailed in "The Physics of Immortality," (Doubleday), involves 
quantum cosmology, game theory, eschatological theology and many leaps in 
logic. 
</P>
<P>
 Tipler himself, a garrulous bespectacled fella in a brown suit, red tie and 
deep Southern accent, is clearly enjoying himself. 
</P>
<P>
 His gleeful didacticism stirs the crowd. Interruptions are constant. Is there 
free will? Are people really sophisticated computers? Tipler answers at length 
until time runs short and he hasn't begun to deliver the goods. 
</P>
<P>
 The goods, per se, are not easily summarized. One line of reasoning goes 
something like this: Life, which may have started from a single cell, has 
already engulfed the earth. Eventually, life must engulf the entire universe -- 
become omnipresent. To do this, life must gain control over all resources -- 
become omnipotent. Life must also increase its knowledge -- become omniscient. 
Since omnipresence, omnipotence and omniscience are the three attributes of 
God, do we not then have God? 
</P>
<P>
 1 October James McCourt, in Los Angeles for a weekend of work, answers this 
question: How does it feel to have his unconventional, brilliant, maximalist 
novel of drag queens, opera divas and AIDS, "Time Remaining," (Knopf: 1993), 
included in Harold Bloom's eclectic canon, along with Faulkner, Sophocles, 
Melville? 
</P>
<P>
 McCourt squares his shoulders. "Just fine."

 When the Arroyo Bookstore opened a few years ago on Figueroa Street in 
Highland Park, it was bursting at the seams with books and other reading 
materials. 
</P>
<P>
 But after a recent move to new quarters, one of the few stores in Los Angeles 
concentrating on the Latino experience has a little more breathing room for its 
array of books, videos and recordings. 
</P>
<P>
 This Sunday, owners Phil Gillette and Florencia Teran will celebrate the 
store's fourth anniversary and its reopening at its new location in the former 
Hunchback Cafe on South Avenue 57. It is twice its original size and includes 
an art gallery and a cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 The celebration, from 1 to 9 p.m., will include artists and authors from the 
Los Angeles area and throughout California. Visitors can browse through the 
store's 10,000 titles, compete in a contest to name the store's cafe and sip 
coffee free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Local artist and musician Eloy Torrez and Maria Elena Gaitan, "La Chola con 
Cello," who plays during intermissions for the comedy group Culture Clash, will 
perform. 
</P>
<P>
 Other guests include poet and performance artist Luis Alfaro; Jose Montoya, 
poet and "commander in chief" of the Royal Chicano Air Force, an artist 
collective; Cal State Northridge Chicano studies professor and poet Evangeline 
Ordaz; writers and actors from Con Safos magazine, a literary group; part-time 
professor and author Charley Trujillo; Cal State Los Angeles student and poet 
Guadalupe Aguilar and poet Frankie Estrada accompanied by the musical group 
Skillet.

 My wife and I have gone through the travail of trying to get friends and 
family to return our books (so many times) that I decided to write a bookplate 
inscription. Here it is: 
</P>
<P>
 Would that I could keep them both:  
</P>
<P>
 The friend I love for all his faults,  
</P>
<P>
 The friend I call a favorite book.  
</P>
<P>
 Either I lend my friend my book,  
</P>
<P>
 And wait and wait and finally  
</P>
<P>
 Resign myself to the bereavement of its loss;  
</P>
<P>
 Or else I make a point to get it back,  
</P>
<P>
 And in the process of exposing his or her neglect  
</P>
<P>
 Alienate, to some extent, my friend.

THE KENNEDY CHARACTER ASSASSINATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am delighted by the extensive, generous coverage you gave my book, "The 
Kennedy Women" (Book Review, Sept. 11). I confess, however, that I am one of 
these hopelessly old-fashioned authors who believe that nothing matters more 
than getting the facts right. And it's simply beyond me how your reviewer, 
Marie Brenner, could have made so many errors. 
</P>
<P>
 I found one clue in her review. At one point she describes "The Kennedy Women" 
as full of "many fine anecdotes and scenes: gossip as insight." Gossip is 
half-truth, rumor. My book has no gossip in it, but intimate truths about the 
lives of these women. 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't see any difference between gossip and fact, then facts and 
half-facts can be pushed around to prove one's thesis. Brenner begins by 
writing about the television program "At Home With the Kennedys" in which the 
Kennedy women "burbled about their lives at Hyannis" in 1960 during the final 
week of Jack Kennedy's presidential campaign. Alas, that television program 
took place in 1958 during Kennedy's senatorial race, though it sure makes 
interesting reading to move it up two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Brenner writes that when Joe Kennedy has a stroke around noontime in 1961, 
Rose has a long lunch and a swim and it is not until late afternoon that Rose 
"arranges to take her husband to the hospital, and by that time, he is beyond 
help." That makes for great reading, but Joe was taken to the hospital hours 
before, as any reader of my book will know. 
</P>
<P>
 Brenner writes that at Jackie Onassis' funeral, the Kennedy women entered the 
funeral "indefatigable, almost jaunty," the wake was "raucous" and that at the 
deathbed the Kennedy "sisters . . . seemed as if they were at a cocktail party, 
one friend told me." This is not from "The Kennedy Women." This is gossip. This 
is wrong-headed, wrong-spirited, simply wrong. This really doesn't belong in a 
review of my book. 
</P>
<P>
 Brenner is correct when she writes that "Leamer is more interested in the 
personalities than the politics of the Kennedy White House." I would have been 
delighted to write about the politics of the Kennedy White House if the women 
had taken part, but they did not. 
</P>
<P>
 LAURENCE LEAMER, WASHINGTON, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Marie Brenner responds:  
</P>
<P>
 Thanks for your letter. You are right about the date on "At Home With the 
Kennedys." The commercial was made in 1958, not 1960. It was frequently 
discussed during the 1960 Presidential campaign and has been replayed often 
since, thus the confusion. As for the rest, I respect your absolute right to 
disagree with my opinions.

BIBLICAL BLUE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding Book Review Aug. 28, "The Primary Colors" by Alexander Theroux 
reviewed by Peter Rainer. It was stated that the "color blue is not mentioned 
in the Bible." Kindly have someone check the Bible and look at Numbers XV, 38 
the Lord's words to Moses, "Bid the children of Israel . . . to wake garments 
with a fringe of blue thread on each corner of this undergarment."

NOT EXACTLY THE RENAISSANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Daniel Farson in his review of "The Civilization of Europe in the Renaissance" 
makes the statement that he "knew of Suleiman's invasion, which was bogged 
down, literally, at the gates of Vienna by a quagmire of mud due to torrential 
rain." 
</P>
<P>
 I checked briefly but during the time period in the cited book, the Ottoman 
Empire never got beyond Hungary and Croatia. The sacks of coffee left behind at 
Vienna by Turkish troops occurred in 1683 when a Polish army led by their King 
Jan Sobieski routed the Turks and sent them packing to the Southern Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyhow, Farson seems a bit confused and needs to recheck his history.

By JAY B. DAVIS, After the 1992 riots, Crenshaw High biology teacher Tammy 
Bird, her students and volunteers turned a small vegetable patch on campus into 
Food From the 'Hood, a student-run garden and salad dressing business. With the 
help of a $50,000 grant from Rebuild L.A. and other funding, the project now 
provides 22 students business experience and college scholarships. The project 
puts into practice Bird's philosophy that hands-on teaching is the best way to 
learn. She was interviewed by Joy B. Davis.

<P>
 The garden is my way of teaching hands-on botany, to get the kids outside, 
taking them out close to nature. 
</P>
<P>
 My classes were out there every Friday for six or seven years. But I didn't 
have any help from the community and as a teacher I didn't know how to ask. I 
was a little shy about it. After the riots we had a lot of what I call white 
flight into the inner city to lend a helping hand. So we channeled that energy 
into the garden. 
</P>
<P>
 I genuinely love to teach and I see what I do making a difference. I'm in the 
teacher-training magnet here and one of my jobs is to teach kids to be 
teachers. There are so few minority teachers and so few minority role models at 
the high school level, especially male ones, that if I can trigger some of 
these kids into going into teaching, great. 
</P>
<P>
 Teaching's got to change. Kids have to learn real-life situations, they have 
to be technical, they have to be able to go out and survive in the world. Food 
From the 'Hood will help some of these kids go into business, and some will be 
able to go into teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 I wanted to be a veterinarian when I was in school. I had my sights on 
pre-med, but I didn't like the people in the pre-med classes so I turned to 
marine biology. I was out working on a marine research vessel and that's where 
I learned my hands-on teaching. I learned that I loved being out there, loved 
show and tell, loved my subject field. 
</P>
<P>
 When I graduated from Occidental College, the Los Angeles Unified School 
District had these applications: "We need science teachers, we want you! We'll 
pay you and give you a credential." I thought: This could be a nice 
steppingstone before I go to graduate school. I came to Crenshaw and fell in 
love and haven't left since. I'm a song and dance person; I have a high energy 
level. If I don't, I don't feel like I'm a good teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 At Crenshaw I have a whole zoo now; we have chickens out there, a cat, a 
little goat that runs around. Why do I need to be a veterinarian? I have at 
least 10 to 15 puppies that wander in here each year. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm hoping that English teachers and math teachers and history teachers will 
look at the garden and realize that integrating subject matter is a must, just 
as science studies integrate chemistry, physics and biology. I'm hoping that 
all classes will teach kids practical experience, and I hope there's more 
businesses that kids run like Food From the 'Hood. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't like it when kids are just handed stuff: "Here, we feel sorry for 
you." These kids are earning their scholarships now, they're going to really 
appreciate their education because they're paying for it. They earned it. 
</P>
<P>
 (All profits from salad dressing sales go to a scholarship fund, and student 
owners receive shares after graduation based on academic performance, college 
preparation work and the amount of work they put into the business. They do not 
receive salaries.) 
</P>
<P>
 I'm hoping they'll learn more of a sense of value, more of a work ethic and 
have the practical experience where they can go out and survive. 
</P>
<P>
 When we're out in the garden or talking about nutrition, they say: "That's why 
you taught us that in class!" They pick it up. Students hate math and yet 
they're learning accounting, counting their money and figuring out deposits. 
That's what math is all about. This isn't fictitious -- this is real. 
</P>
<P>
 There's always hitches but what do you do? Do you stop and say, "Oh, we can't 
go any farther?" You come against a wall, you step back and you figure out how 
to get around it. That's what we did.

RIFFING WITH MICHAEL ONDAATJE; A BRIEF ENCOUNTER WITH THE CANADIAN WRITER AND 
HIS IMAGINATIVE OBSESSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Monthly's arts and entertainment supplement. She is also a film reviewer for

<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Ondaatje is wheeling me around downtown Toronto in an impressively 
dented Honda, looking for a new restaurant called the Angie Dickinson. The 
Angie Dickinson is closed; we settle for an outside table at the Boulevard 
Cafe, where a restaurant employee soon collars Ondaatje to tell him that her 
copy of his best-selling novel, "The English Patient," has 30 pages missing. 
"That's terrible," he says, and gives her a number to call for a replacement 
copy.  
</P>
<P>
 At a dinner party the night before, I had met a number of Toronto writers and 
film people who fiercely claimed Ondaatje as Canadian property. Though he was 
born in Sri Lanka and partly educated in England, Ondaatje ( on - DAH - chay ) 
is a local hero in Canada, where he has produced a steady stream of poetry and 
prose since he moved there in the early 1960s. When "The English Patient" 
shared the 1992 Booker Prize, a coveted British award for fiction, it generated 
enormous pride in a country caught in a post-colonial bind between reverence 
for its Anglo American heritage and the desire to grow its own literary 
culture. "He was highly admired," says Ellen Seligman, who edits Ondaatje and 
Margaret Atwood at McClelland & Stewart, a top Canadian publisher. "Now he's 
highly admired by a lot more people." 
</P>
<P>
 Evidently: During lunch our waitress hovers reverentially and apologizes for 
interrupting with food. Although he's uneasy about the loss of privacy that 
comes with fame ("I have to take visibility lessons"), Ondaatje receives the 
attention with the same easy grace that earlier had him chatting with waiters 
about whether the new local dog-leash laws favor canines or humans. 
</P>
<P>
 Ondaatje considers himself a Canadian writer, whatever that means in an age 
when "local" has all but lost its significance and "national" may also be 
headed for oblivion. Only some of his poems (reprinted this year by Knopf in a 
handsome paperback under the title "The Cinnamon Peeler") and his exquisite 
1987 novel, "In the Skin of a Lion," which centers on immigrant workers who 
built the Bloor Street Viaduct in 1920s Toronto, are set in Canada. Although a 
sense of place and time are crucial to all his work, Ondaatje's books are 
bounded more by the geography of his imaginative obsessions than by any home 
turf.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Collected Works of Billy the Kid" (1974) rereads the American Western 
icon the author loved as a child in Sri Lanka, in a wild collage of prose, 
poetry and photographs mixed with archival material woven into fake interviews. 
"In Coming Through Slaughter" (1976), Ondaatje abolishes the borders between 
fact and fiction to put his own delirious spin on the life of Buddy Bolden, a 
Southern jazz musician who went mad during a parade in 1920s New Orleans. "I 
always wanted to be Fats Waller," says the writer, who is a jazz fanatic. "I 
still want to be Fats Waller." 
</P>
<P>
 Lunch with Ondaatje is like an extended surf through a vast Internet thick 
with bulletin boards for language, literature, world politics, pop culture and 
stand-up comedy, with the least-clicked icon being the collected works of 
Michael Ondaatje. He has a passionately associative mind that's triggered by 
the slightest stimulus -- everything reminds him of something else.  
</P>
<P>
 I remark that his writing reminds me of John Fowles', and off he goes. "A 
friend of mine with a dog bought 'The French Lieutenant's Woman.' He was 
touching it and bonding with it, and when he went out the dog ate the book. So 
he bought another copy, and the dog ate that one too. The third copy survived 
on a high shelf." On his friend, the novelist Kazuo Ishiguro ("The Remains of 
the Day"): "He's the funniest man in the world. When he was here I took him to 
a mad church -- it's not officially mad yet, but it's going mad -- and they had 
this bizarre event where they bless all the animals. We took our dog." On 
Faulkner: "He's the funniest writer in America. I wanted to write a thesis once 
on the animals in Faulkner." We're talking about media language, and he 
remembers that the attack on Grenada was referred to on television as a 
pre-dawn vertical insertion. "Someone said, 'Oh, that sounds lovely.' " Which 
in turn reminds him of a scene in the Polish movie "A Year of the Quiet Sun," 
in which an American man and a Polish woman must declare their love through an 
interpreter. "Honestly, it's the most devastatingly brutal scene." He offers to 
sing me the entire score of "High Society." 
</P>
<P>
 And so on and delightfully on. But if I want to know why people in his novels 
repeatedly suffer random reversals of fortune, he tosses me a bone about the 
randomness of life in the 20th Century and grows terribly interested in his 
lamb tenderloin and Chilean Chardonnay.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ondaatje's work has been available in the United States for 20 years, but it's 
"The English Patient," which quickly became an international bestseller and was 
optioned for a movie by the Saul Zaentz Company, that has brought him name 
recognition outside Canada. His new fame keeps him so busy that pinning him 
down for an interview has been about as easy as drafting a free-trade agreement 
-- which might not have been the case a year ago.  
</P>
<P>
 Zaentz has summoned him to San Francisco for a script conference with English 
writer-director Anthony Minghella ("Truly, Madly, Deeply"), who is adapting the 
screenplay and will direct the movie. After that, Ondaatje flies to Italy to 
accept an award for "The English Patient," then on to London for the 
publication of his wife's second novel and to the Jack Kerouac School of 
Disembodied Poetics at the Naropa Institute in Boulder, Colo., to hobnob with 
the likes of Allen Ginsberg and Hubert Selby Jr. Not bad for one whose 
end-of-term reports at an English boys' school in the early 1960s pronounced 
him "a very pleasant boy, moderately able," and predicted a glittering future 
as a customs officer. 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to see how Ondaatje's teachers misread him. With his post-hippie 
gray beard and amused blue eyes, the handsome, slightly rumpled, slightly 
bashful 50-year-old writer comes across as an unassuming man, warm and 
responsive except when he suspects his personal life is about to be invaded or 
when an interviewer tries to tell him what his books mean -- in which case he 
retreats behind a wall of affable reserve. Words tumble out of him in a soft 
accent evenly inflected with Canada, Sri Lanka and the more posh reaches of the 
English education system. "I hate him," says Saul Zaentz, who clearly adores 
Ondaatje. "Because he's good-looking, and he can talk and he can write, the 
attributes that I lack." 
</P>
<P>
 Even now that he's published, he has difficulty calling himself a writer. His 
laugh rolls out in self-deprecating gurgles as he tries out more grandiose 
titles. "An artiste. A scribe. A prophet. An auteur ." Still, Ondaatje is 
enjoying his expanded reading public; he shows me a letter from a San Francisco 
man who showed up for jury duty with "The English Patient," only to find 
another prospective juror carrying her own copy and the judge apologizing for 
yawning because he'd been up all night reading the same book. Attending 
readings with him in San Francisco bookstores, says Zaentz, was almost like 
being with a celebrity. "He's a wonderful reader, and he takes questions very 
seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 Word-of-mouth and the Booker Prize aside, it's no surprise that Ondaatje's 
most recent book made the leap to bestseller. Though it's every bit as 
innovative in form as the others, "The English Patient" is his most accessible 
work, a heart-stopping war yarn about four bruised psyches rattling around a 
bomb-damaged, abandoned Italian villa in 1945. At their center is the patient, 
a mystery man burned into a mass of blackened flesh, who lies prone under the 
obsessive care of Hana, a young Canadian nurse who holed up with him in the 
villa (a makeshift military hospital) when everyone else evacuated. They have 
been tracked down by Caravaggio, an Allied spy whose thumbs -- along with his 
raffish elan -- were torn off by Fascist interrogators, and joined by Kirpal 
(Kip) Singh, a young Sikh sapper trained by the British, who continues to comb 
the treacherous territory in and around the villa, dismantling a forest of 
bombs and land mines rigged with brilliant malice by the retreating Germans. 
</P>
<P>
 Alone and in shifting combinations, the lost souls of the Villa San Girolamo 
read and talk, forage for food, tend garden, shoot up morphine, make love and 
aimlessly stalk each other through the villa's 20 rooms. Out of these routines 
grows a quietly crazed but truthful community, patched together in the dying 
months of a world war. And the English patient lies in a drug haze reliving, in 
flashback fragments, his love affair with a colleague's wife in Egypt.  
</P>
<P>
 " Sometimes when she is able to spend the night with him they are awakened by 
the three minarets of the city beginning their prayers before dawn. He walks 
with her through the indigo markets that lie between South Cairo and her home. 
The beautiful songs of faith enter the air like arrows, one minaret answering 
another, as if passing on a rumour of the two of them as they walk through the 
cold morning air, the smell of charcoal and hemp already making the air 
profound. Sinners in a holy city. " -- "The English Patient" 
</P>
<P>
 Reading Ondaatje for the first time can be a shock -- in our disclaiming age, 
lyricism embarrasses. Ondaatje writes with the slow burn of a man who cut his 
teeth on poetry and unfolded from poetry to prose and back again; often the 
only difference is in how the text sits on the page. "The English Patient" is 
stuffed with scenes that wallow in their own wild beauty and drop away, 
apparently without advancing the story. "The avoidance of plot," Ondaatje calls 
it, grinning. 
</P>
<P>
 True -- if plot is narrowly understood as a straight line from conflict to 
resolution. For him, plot is an open-ended dance with multiple voices and 
languages; the burned man's memory is also the author's adventure with form, 
opening up a vast emotional and physical arena for four personal crises 
unfolding in the broader drama of world war. 
</P>
<P>
 As the patient remembers, the novel slips the restraints of the present and 
darts around in the time and space of memory: to London and the Sussex 
countryside, where Kip absorbed the casual racism of the British and the 
gentlemanly honor code that threatens to explode in his face even if the bombs 
don't; to a dovecote in France, where Hana's father lies critically injured; to 
the Macedonian quarter of Toronto, where Hana's inchoate bond with Caravaggio 
first grew; and, over and over, to the African desert, where the patient's life 
unravels in every sense.  
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't understand what's happened to him until he starts to tell it," 
explains Ondaatje. Neither does the author, until he starts to tell it. For 
him, the formal shifts -- the flashes back and forward, the poetic fugues, the 
alternating bursts of comedy, high-octane sexuality and Faulknerian savagery he 
visits on his characters -- all these are the tools of writing as discovery, of 
asking rather than telling. Ondaatje begins each book with almost no knowledge 
of his characters. "People write in different ways, but for me there's 
absolutely nothing. Most of my books are led by a curiosity to know something 
about someone. I become so curious about Billy or Bolden that I try and use 
every form to understand all the facets." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 " The first sentence of every novel should be: "Trust me, this will take time 
but there is order here, very faint, very human." Meander if you want to get to 
town. " -- "In the Skin of a Lion" 
</P>
<P>
 In his novels, Ondaatje has a habit of stepping out of narrative for literary 
chats with the reader. It's the meander, not the getting to town that he loves 
to talk about, whether in his own work or that of other artists he admires -- a 
crafty five-minute riff from a Tom Waits album, a passage in a Don DeLillo 
novel that mutates into poetry, the unplotted lyricism in a single tracking 
shot by Sergio Leone. 
</P>
<P>
 Spend time with Ondaatje, and you start to see the world around you as a 
playground stockpiled with absurd wonders waiting to be plucked out of context, 
recombined and called fiction. As we look for the restaurant, I remember that a 
leggy Miss Angela Dickinson shows up as Billy's sexually gifted 
whore-girlfriend in "Billy the Kid," which was written in the early 1970s. 
Ondaatje's work bows gleefully to a world where nothing (and no one) remains in 
place anymore, where bits of culture detach from their moorings and float 
freely, changing shape and meaning as they go. Which is how the legend of Billy 
the Kid became "one of those strange, migrating mythologies" that grabbed the 
heart of a boy in 1950s Sri Lanka, who is pictured at the end of the book, 
posing bashfully in his cowboy suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever boundaries remain between fact and fiction, life and art hold little 
interest for Ondaatje unless he's tearing them down or making them up. He glows 
over a letter from a historian of bomb disposal who had read an excerpt from 
"The English Patient" in the New Yorker and asked to be put in touch with Mr. 
Kirpal Singh. "I haven't got the nerve to write to him and say, 'No, I made it 
all up.' " A note at the end of "Running in the Family," Ondaatje's memoir of 
his return to Sri Lanka in 1978 and 1980, apologizes for the book's "fictional 
air" and adds innocently, "in Sri Lanka a well-told lie is worth a thousand 
facts."  
</P>
<P>
 Ondaatje talks about his life only with reluctance. "I'm a compulsively 
secretive person," he confesses. Later he amends "secretive" to "private" and 
asks, "Is that better or worse?" I tell him I don't care which, so long as he's 
not revising himself. He laughs. "I don't think I am secretive with people I 
know well. I'm more careful here in Canada, because there's a hunger for 
anything about 'Can. Lit.' in the academic world and the media, which I don't 
like. People get portrayed by their image, as opposed to their writing. 
Somebody like Jay McInerney, maybe he's exactly what he's portrayed as, but -- 
I think that's a real problem today." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not only Ondaatje's insistence on privacy that makes him dismissive of 
biography. Valid or not, comparisons between his life and his work don't 
interest him nearly as much as the process by which his characters grow into 
life. "I could say I was someone living in a new country and all that, and I 
would see myself as the outsider," he says uncomfortably. "But after you say 
that, what does it mean?" 
</P>
<P>
 It means he's leaving me with an open field to interpret a life that fairly 
teems with potential parallels. "The best art is always mongrel," Ondaatje 
observed in a recent BBC documentary about his life and work. He was talking 
about the shaping of early 20th-Century English literature by immigrant writers 
like Joseph Conrad and T. S. Eliot, but the cap fits. In "Running in the 
Family" ("three-fifths fact, two-fifths fiction"), one of his relatives is 
asked by a visiting British governor what his nationality is and replies, "God 
alone knows, your excellency." 
</P>
<P>
 Ondaatje was born in 1943, the youngest of four children in a privileged, if 
sporadically impoverished, family of Indian, Sinhalese, Dutch and English 
origin. With near-Chaucerian merriment, "Running in the Family" embroiders his 
enormous extended family into a comic soap opera about a bunch of Roaring '20s 
party animals with a highly developed sense of theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Together with Sri Lanka's swollen physical environment -- stifling wet heat 
and monsoon rains, with bats and snakes (so he says) taking up residence on 
tables and radios -- the affairs and escapades of the Ondaatje clan provided 
drama enough to turn anyone into a storyteller. (One of Ondaatje's sisters 
writes children's books in England, and his eldest brother, a Toronto tycoon, 
wrote his own, much bleaker family memoir. "I think he was getting pissed off 
that I was writing the books," says Ondaatje with a grin.)  
</P>
<P>
 Shipped around to various aunts and uncles, the Ondaatje children were 
somewhat buffered from the war between their alcoholic father and dramatic 
mother, especially Michael, who was only 5 when they separated. But the clamor 
of conflicting voices must also have left him with the sense that all 
interpretation is relative and provisional. 
</P>
<P>
 In person, Ondaatje is the high-spirited charmer who gets a kick out of his 
wacky family, the ironist who revels in making things up. What you don't see is 
the wistful brooder whose "purple moods," as he puts it in a poem dedicated "to 
a sad daughter," run like a deep vein through all his work and especially the 
final pages of "Running in the Family," in which he pays sorrowful tribute to 
his remote father. Yet for Ondaatje, the memoir is the least personal of his 
books because it mostly lacks the protective cloak of fiction. "It was like the 
voice at the dinner table as opposed to the secret scribbler. Most of the other 
books are the secret scribbler." 
</P>
<P>
 When Ondaatje was 11, he moved with his mother to London. At Dulwich College 
he received what he calls an ironic education: All the learning took place on 
the side. "It was a set of principles from Mars," he says with feeling. "I 
remember in my first class the teacher -- Mr. Welsch -- stared at me for about 
a minute as if that would tell me what a terrible crime I'd committed, which 
was that I hadn't taken my cap off." Mostly because of his mother's 
encouragement, he read voraciously, and at age 17 he sent a short story to 
Punch. "It came back within seconds, and I said, 'Well, that's it then, I'm not 
a writer.' "  
</P>
<P>
 Invited to Canada by his brother Christopher, Ondaatje began writing poetry at 
college in Quebec. Though he balks at the notion that he writes "poetic 
novels," poetry remains the major influence on his prose structure and style. 
"Emotionally I feel much closer to poetry than to the novel. I feel more 
comfortable with something that is small and tight and without any unnecessary 
parts, but it can also be completely suggestive as opposed to something with an 
idea or plot. With a novel you step into a very large house, and you have to 
live in that house for a long time. Poetry is a pacing of oneself. It's like 
going underwater, and your heart has to slow down -- it's that altering of your 
own self." 
</P>
<P>
 Ondaatje's literary education proper began when he moved to Toronto in 1966 
and joined the underground poetry scene that revolved around the tiny Coach 
House Press, which published much of Ondaatje's work up until "In the Skin of a 
Lion." "That landscape did not suggest audiences or even reviews, which freed 
me to try out things and not worry about whether this works or not, or whether 
it reaches an audience in some way. I feel very lucky that I didn't have a 
public, so I could try anything, poetry or half-poetry, half-prose as in 
'Billy.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After lunch, Ondaatje drives me over to the print arm of Coach House Press, a 
cramped brick building whose entrance is guarded by two gorgeous, elderly 
printing presses. "Russell Banks cried when he saw these," says Ondaatje, and 
then he disappears behind a newspaper, surfacing only to chat with assorted 
bearded types and fire sporadic one-liners into my conversation with his wife, 
Linda Spalding. 
</P>
<P>
 Spalding is an alert Kansas native with two novels under her belt who, with 
her husband, co-edits Brick, a literary magazine published three times a year 
using the Coach House printing facilities. Together they have transformed a 
resolutely Canadian, rural-populist journal into a cosmopolitan magazine where 
the work of local writers rubs shoulders with Edmund White on "queer" fiction, 
Anita Desai on the Indian poet Tagore, Fielding Dawson on Miles Davis. When I 
ask if they ever think of giving up the labor-intensive work of bringing out a 
magazine, Ondaatje rustles his newspaper and mutters, "Three times a year." 
</P>
<P>
 Brick is also peppered with Ondaatje's photographs, mostly captioned with 
deadpan gag lines and often starring the family beagle, Gladys (Why Gladys? 
"One can't go out on the lawn and call, 'Cosima!' "), playing chess, guarding 
an upside-down poster of the Mona Lisa or snoozing peacefully atop a copy of 
"From Here to Eternity."  
</P>
<P>
 "One's a bit of a ham," says Ondaatje, whose several short films include 
"Carry on Crime and Punishment" ("a very bad imitation of Chaplin about kids 
kidnaping a dog, people running into bushes, that sort of thing, good jazz 
score, stolen copyright") and "Love Clinic," about a center for reprogramming 
people devastated by love. 
</P>
<P>
 The hamminess in his novels almost invariably slides into something more 
serious -- and more dangerous. In "The English Patient," Kip is drawn straight 
out of Chaplin, an innocent rural Indian who's in love with Western consumer 
goods and hums along to big-band music on his crystal set while he dismantles 
bombs. But Kip also grows into the nearest thing the novel has to a hero, "one 
of the charmed, who has grown up an outsider and so can switch allegiances, can 
replace loss," and the only one of the four with sufficient internal solidity 
to take decisive action when his world falls apart. 
</P>
<P>
 "You fictionalize things by putting them together," says Ondaatje with wily 
simplicity. If this were all, it wouldn't be much. Any smart-mouth with a 
literature degree and a subscription to Vanity Fair can cobble together a bunch 
of pop images and call the result a postmodern novel. For Ondaatje, though, the 
fragmented structure and the fanning out into different voices in his work 
create a kind of realism, a mirror to the way our minds really work. "It's not 
a case of postmodernist literature, it's a story, but the story isn't an A-to-Z 
thing. I've always believed people think like this. I got fabulous letters from 
people who don't read at all, who read 'The English Patient' and understood 
perfectly." 
</P>
<P>
 Understood what? No matter how I try to draw Ondaatje into a discussion of 
what his work is about, he finds a hundred pleasant ways to play dead: "Maybe." 
"Don't know." "How interesting." "Next." A few hours of this dance, and I'm 
desperate enough to mumble something about the symbolism of land mines in "The 
English Patient." Ondaatje gives me a weary smile. "For me, the minefield was a 
minefield. Ezra Pound says the first principle of metaphor is that a hawk has 
to be a hawk before it's something else. Before it becomes American imperialism 
or something, it's got to be a recognizable hawk." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, sure. But he can't be that baffled when critics interpret "In the Skin 
of a Lion" as a novel about immigrants, or "Billy the Kid" as "a commentary on 
the violent myths of the American West." "The last thing I was thinking of," he 
assures me with the admit-nothing air of one who knows he's getting away with 
murder. "I have great fears," he says. "I'm terrified of guns, I'm terrified of 
heights, so I write about bridge-builders and gunfighters. Somebody said to me, 
'Do you get migraines?' I said no." He giggles. "They said, 'When I have a 
migraine I can understand your work perfectly.' " 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 It dawns on me that if I quit pestering Ondaatje for exegesis he will come up 
with it in his own way, which is to let meaning grow out of form. A word he 
uses often -- descant -- best evokes the way his mind works, bouncing off 
received images into his own unfolding concerns. The process is more 
transparent in his earlier writing, which works up a lather from what's known 
about public figures and shoots off sideways into new territory.  
</P>
<P>
 "With 'Billy,' I was reacting against the genre of film, where everything was 
so secure and obvious that nothing really was going to surprise us. I was so 
fed up with Westerns by the time I was in my 20s, they were so sillily 
romantic. A lot of the writing in the '60s was either very sociological about 
violence or a cliche. So I thought, 'I'm just going to make him dangerous, not 
just for the sake of being dangerous, but because this is what the reality is.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Ondaatje may not have set out to flip a finger at the romance of Western 
violence, but he ends up doing exactly that. "The Collected Works of Billy the 
Kid" upstages the abstract, orderly brutality of Western movies and comics with 
its own runaway vaudeville. As the book leaps between B-movie comic horror and 
quiet scene-setting, between the suggestive brush strokes of poetry and the 
expansiveness of prose, it grows into a cantata for several voices telling 
their versions of Billy. 
</P>
<P>
 Ondaatje's writing is always the unofficial story, a celebration of the Kips 
and Hanas and Buddy Boldens who walk voiceless and invisible through the 
history books. In lesser hands that kind of populism could fall flat on the 
page, but Ondaatje's characters keep gathering layers as they go along. No 
other fiction I know shows workers the tough-minded tenderness of "In the Skin 
of a Lion," Ondaatje's soaringly romantic third novel. It's impossible to know 
where research leaves off and imagination begins in Ondaatje's sensuously 
physical descriptions of bridge-building in Depression-era Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 The book began as a "descant" from the life of Ambrose Small, a wealthy 
Toronto financier who vanished mysteriously in 1919. One year and 200 pages 
later, Ondaatje decided that he couldn't stand the man ("I felt like an 
official biographer of some financial scum") and started over, relegating Small 
to a bit part and bringing his minor characters to the forefront. In "Skin," 
the outsider role is reversed when Patrick, an all-Canadian youth, becomes an 
alien among the Macedonian immigrants with whom he works as a laborer on the 
tunnel to be used for the Toronto waterworks. As they draw him into their 
community, Patrick is caught up in a passionate three-way love story and a 
drama -- part caper, part action-adventure -- of class war.  
</P>
<P>
 " His own life was no longer a single story but a part of a mural, which was a 
falling together of accomplices. Patrick saw a wondrous night web -- all of 
these fragments of a human order, something ungoverned by the family he was 
born into or the headlines of the day. " -- "In the Skin of a Lion" 
</P>
<P>
 "Skin" is no less than a people's history of Toronto, a euphoric hymn to the 
city and the dignity of labor. In Ondaatje's novels, history matters; his 
characters humanize a savage 20th Century that eats itself alive with random 
catastrophe. At a time in our cynical literary culture, when readers are 
stranded between the willful obscurantism of the artistic avant-garde, which 
has all but declared the story passe, and the slick packages of Michael 
Crichton or John Grisham, Ondaatje joins a narrowing fraternity of writers who 
remain true to the rich, particular humanism and grand opera of the popular 
19th-Century novel, while expanding its forms and its power to make things 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
 As we finish the interview, I mention a friend who once told me that she 
writes because writing makes her better than she is. "That's a lovely answer," 
Ondaatje says. "If there's a callowness in you, it doesn't survive because you 
live with a book for five years and go over it 200 times. I really feel that, 
because the best parts that are not in me before I begin are there eventually 
in the book. Once you get the voice, you're saying what you know, and after 
that you start saying what you don't know. When I got the voice with 'The 
English Patient,' there was stuff said about nations that I had never imagined 
before. It's absolutely thrilling. Like putting two and two together and 
getting six."

FIRSTHAND EXPERIENCE OF PLIGHT OF ASIAN AMERICAN STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Diane Seo's article "Silent Minority: The Plight of Asian American Students" 
(Sept. 18) holds a lot of truth. 
</P>
<P>
 Seo's main statement is that Asian American students are often alienated from 
their non-Asian peers due to misconceptions about Asian youths. 
</P>
<P>
 As an Asian American myself, I have experienced and seen a lot of the burdens 
that Asian youths must deal with. There is constant pressure from Asian parents 
that their child must do well in school, yet on the other hand there are the 
expectations of peers and classmates to get more involved in social activities. 
The Asian youth, himself, is constantly torn by these two forces as well as by 
his own dreams and desires. 
</P>
<P>
 One solution might be to have a multicultural week every semester in school 
where each student befriends another of a different ethnic background. The two 
students would spend the week together and get to know each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Another idea is to have monthly teachers and parents' meetings, with 
interpreters, to discuss issues related to Asian students. 
</P>
<P>
 Asian American youths will have to play the key role to lighten their burdens. 
They will have to break out of their shells and stand up to their parents and 
peers. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of the problems are brought on by their inability to speak up. Though 
this characteristic may have been ingrained in them through their culture, 
Asian youths need to overcome this so that they will be able to communicate 
better with their parents and their classmates. When this starts to happen, 
misconceptions about them will begin to be dispelled.

 It's the game that East Los Angeles has been waiting for. 
</P>
<P>
 Not the annual Garfield-Roosevelt grudge match, but next week's showdown 
between Franklin and Wilson that will likely determine the Northern Conference 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin fired the first shot with a 41-7 drubbing of Verdugo Hills Friday 
afternoon and the Mules retaliated with a 55-14 dismantling of Eagle Rock 
Friday night at Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 The message is clear: Neither team is going to give an inch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought this game would be the acid test even though I am surprised at the 
score," Wilson coach Eddie Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mules opened the game with an impressive seven-play, 3:12 drive that ended 
in a 10-yard touchdown pass from Eddie Gonzalez to Buster Bradley, giving 
Wilson a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson never looked back, scoring 27 of the game's next 34 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez, who threw for 258 yards and two touchdowns, accounted for four of 
Wilson's eight touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez scored twice in the second quarter on two-yard runs, the last of 
which boosted Wilson's lead to 28-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Arlin Slayton had 10 carries for 44 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Eagle Rock's Trenell Young had 86 yards in 22 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Records: Eagle Rock 4-2; Wilson 5-1 
</P>
<P>
 Next week: Franklin at Wilson.

DEFEAT ENDS CAL STATE L.A. DREAM STREAK; VOLLEYBALL: IN A POSSIBLE PREVIEW OF 
THE NATIONAL TITLE GAME, BAKERSFIELD TAKES MATCH, 7-15, 15-8, 15-11, 15-11. THE 
GOLDEN EAGLES' 18 STRAIGHT WINS HAD SET A SCHOOL RECORD.

 Cal State Bakersfield won this time around, defeating Cal State Los Angeles, 
7-15, 15-8, 15-11, 15-11 in a California Collegiate Athletic Assn. volleyball 
match Tuesday night at Cal State L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least one rematch is inevitable for the top two teams in NCAA Division 
II. They will meet again next month in the regular-season finale and probably 
again in the West Regional. The top-ranked Roadrunners, who improved to 23-1 
and 4-0 in conference, beat the Golden Eagles in four games in last year's 
tournament finals. 
</P>
<P>
 "This game here should be the national championship, but we'll play them two 
more times," said Cal State L.A. outside hitter Korina Kemp, who had 19 kills 
and 17 digs. "We'll get them. This loss isn't going to kill us. It's just one 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 The defeat was the first for Cal State L.A. (18-1, 4-1) and ended a 
school-record winning streak for all sports. The soccer team won 16 consecutive 
matches in 1981, and the previous record for volleyball was 14 in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Prospects for the Golden Eagles extending their streak appeared good after 
they won the first game, 15-7. Cal State L.A. raced to a 5-1 lead and increased 
its lead to 13-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State L.A. could not recover in the second and third games after falling 
behind by margins of 7-1 and 5-0. Bakersfield, the two-time defending CCAA 
champion, reeled off four consecutive points to break an 11-11 tie in the 
fourth game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't keep playing with the same intensity," Kemp said. "When you're 
playing teams of this caliber, you have to play perfection volleyball. 
Everything has to be 100%, and when you have those lapses, errors come out and 
you lose games. We didn't play bad, but it's those really small technical 
things that separate teams."  
</P>
<P>
 Outside hitter Andrea Ferchaw led Cal State L.A. with 26 kills and 19 digs. 
Middle blocker Kaili Kimura had 10 kills and two service aces, and setter 
Adrianna Huerta added 58 assists for the Golden Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our game is to establish the middle, and we didn't do that," Kimura said. "We 
relied on the outside. We didn't play exactly how we wanted to play in the 
first game, but we got real lucky and won. If we didn't improve by the next 
game, we knew they would get us like they did."

FRIDAY FOOTBALL ROUNDUP; JORDAN'S VICTORY ENDS 3 YEARS OF FRUSTRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Quarterback Nate Turner's 12-yard scoring run in the fourth quarter ended 31 
games of frustration for Jordan, as the Bulldogs held on for a 9-8 victory over 
Huntington Park on Saturday night at Huntington Park. 
</P>
<P>
 But with less than two minutes remaining in the game, a last-ditch drive by 
Huntington Park and premature celebrations by Jordan players and fans 
jeopardized the Bulldogs' victory, their first since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Players and fans rushed the field after Turner's touchdown, prompting the 
referees to penalize the Bulldogs for delaying the game on the ensuing kickoff. 
Huntington Park took the kickoff, then drove to the Jordan 33, where they faced 
a 4th and 10.  
</P>
<P>
 Jordan defensive end Junior Chavira nailed quarterback Gabriel Madera for a 
seven-yard sack, ending the comeback drive but setting off a second Jordan 
celebration that cost it another 15-yard penalty. But the Bulldogs were able to 
run out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put the guys through extra work this week," said a pleased coach Willie 
Brown, who accepted congratulations from his jubilant players and Jordan 
followers after the game. "That made the difference. They played together as a 
team and never gave up." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, the former Raider All-Pro and first-year coach at Jordan, saw 
Huntington Park overcome a 3-0 deficit when Cesar Aguilera scored on a one-yard 
run in the third quarter, culminating a 45-yard drive that began after Jordan 
turned the ball over on a fumble.  
</P>
<P>
 Tailback Termell Goss ran for 155 yards on 15 carries. Turner was four for 11 
and 117 yards passing and rushed for 58 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody was a family today," said Goss. "Everybody came together. And Coach 
Brown really wanted to win this game." 
</P>
<P>
 Records: Jordan 1-5; Huntington Park 0-6 
</P>
<P>
 Next week: Huntington Park at Jefferson; South Gate at Jordan.

 Dorsey 14, Carson 13 -- Antwain Wilson carried 16 times for 112 yards and 
scored a touchdown and Jemell Gordon had 88 yards in 16 carries as Dorsey used

11-play drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson running back Joseph Redmond scored touchdowns on two one-yard runs, the 
latter coming with 7:19 left in the game. A personal foul set back Carson 15

Locke. 
</P>
<P>
 With 7:46 left in the second quarter, Hatley took a handoff from quarterback 
Larry Roberson at the Saints' four-yard line and surged toward the end zone. 
Hatley, however, fumbled the ball and the Saints recovered. After a short 
meeting, the referees decided that Hatley broke the plane of the end zone 
before fumbling and awarded Jefferson a touchdown to make the score 10-6.

 Minnie Lee Langley was 9 years old when the world as she knew it came to an 
end. She had been born into an uncommonly independent African-American 
community on Florida's upper Gulf Coast just before World War I. Langley lived 
with her grandparents, and her prosperous extended family had a fine two-story 
house nearby, with a piano in the parlor and books on the shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 But in one week in 1923, all that was gone. On New Years Day, and for six days 
afterward, white men primed with moonshine and bent on vengeance flocked to the 
tiny town after a black man in the adjacent community of Sumner had been 
accused of assaulting a white woman. At least 8 people were killed, and the 
homes, businesses, schools and churches of an entire town -- Rosewood, 
population 200 -- were leveled. 
</P>
<P>
 Langley barely escaped. Half-naked, she fled with her family into the swamps. 
There they watched while Rosewood blazed. "We seen the fires burning," she 
recalls, "that fire just leaping over the railroad." To her young eyes it was 
like Judgment Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighty-one now and yard-rake thin, childlike once again with age, Langley is 
transported back to that place when she speaks of it, her voice strained yet 
steady. She remembers watching as a white man saved her uncle's life, wrestling 
him away from a lynching party. She can still see her 32-year-old cousin, 
Sylvester Carrier, as he pulled her into a closet under the stairway in the 
Carrier house. Cousin Syl told her to duck and propped a rifle on her shoulder. 
"When the crackers burst the door open," she says, "he shot the first one that 
came in." 
</P>
<P>
 But "the crackers" didn't stop coming, some from miles away, some from out of 
state. Days later, in the swamps, Langley remembers, "they were hunting for us. 
Anybody they saw in the woods, they just shot them down. They didn't care who 
they were killing." Langley's grandfather would die in the carnage; her family 
was separated. She lost everything. 
</P>
<P>
 For almost 70 years, the events that Minnie Lee Langley can recall so vividly 
lay half-buried. Whitewashed news account drew national attention for a time, 
even making the front page of the New York Times. But no one, black or white, 
was ever indicted for any crime. A local all-white grand jury interviewed 35 
witnesses but claimed there was a lack of evidence of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 The survivors scattered quickly -- to Tampa, Jacksonville, Gainesville, Miami 
and beyond -- too afraid, battered or cynical to try to reclaim their property 
and their lives. Those who could bear to speak of it passed down the story, 
telling their children about the terror and their losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Local whites told their own version of the massacre behind closed doors, and 
there was talk of grisly souvenirs -- body parts -- kept in Mason jars and 
showed off from time to time. "I've seen them," claims Robin Raftis, a writer 
and former editor of a small north Florida weekly newspaper. "Penises, 
testicles, fingers, even a toe. You name it, they jarred it." 
</P>
<P>
 But when it came to outsiders, the victims and participants joined in a 
conspiracy of silence and shame. Rosewood had become a forgotten chapter of 
Southern history. Then last winter, the forgotten was finally officially 
remembered. Minnie Lee Langley and a handful of other survivors sat in a 
hearing room in the Florida state capital in Tallahassee, and testified to what 
had happened to them and to Rosewood in 1923. Two months later, Florida Gov. 
Lawton Chiles signed into law the Rosewood Claims Bill. In an unprecedented act 
of Southern contrition, the bill set aside more than $2 million in reparations 
for Langley and other survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 The struggle to bare the secret, to dig up the buried past, to bring Minnie 
Lee Langley and the others into that hearing room to gain a measure of belated 
justice is a story almost as compelling as the Rosewood saga itself. In it, the 
survivors stand with tragic dignity, but around them swirl ego clashes, 
competing self-interests, suspicion and charges of racism on all sides. As the 
survivors tried to tell their tale, and officialdom tried to figure out what to 
do about it, a small group of men slugged it out on the sidelines to see who 
would be the hero of the contemporary drama. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles was burning. A jury had just acquitted the four police officers 
who had beaten Rodney G. King, and racial tensions were erupting there and 
across the nation. In Miami, police were out in force as producer Michael 
O'McCarthy nervously drove through an African-American neighborhood looking for 
Lee Ruth Davis. O'McCarthy thought it ironic: After having spent a year 
off-and-on searching for Rosewood survivors, he'd finally found one -- was on 
his way to see her -- and the backdrop was this new conflagration of race and 
justice denied. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most Floridians, and the rest of the world, O'McCarthy would have never 
heard of Rosewood had Gary Moore, a journalist with the St. Petersburg Times, 
not passed through the nearby town of Cedar Key in 1982 and asked local 
residents why the area was all white. Shocked and intrigued by the answer, the 
reporter spent the next two years exploring the question full time. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore's first painstaking account of the massacre, written with Faulknerian 
flourish, laid out how Rosewood had come to vanish. He told of the purported 
assault, which blacks insisted had been carried out by a white man. He told of 
the blood-lust that possessed the mob as it rampaged through the town, killing 
black people indiscriminately. And he told of Sylvester Carrier's courage in 
fighting back when his home was besieged, which so infuriated the white 
attackers that they took the violence to another level. The story inspired a 
"60 Minutes" segment in 1983 and was optioned for the movies. But then it sank 
again into obscurity. 
</P>
<P>
 O'McCarthy, an independent producer who'd toiled without great success in 
Hollywood, first heard of Rosewood in 1991, four years after returning to his 
home state. At the time he was packaging TV movies about serial killers. At 48, 
O'McCarthy was starting to thicken around the middle, his dark hair turning 
gray. But he retained enough of his youthful good looks to take modeling 
assignments. It was a good thing, too -- his movie earnings needed the help. 
</P>
<P>
 When he learned from a producer colleague that the Rosewood film project had 
fizzled, O'McCarthy drove immediately to the Gulf Hammock, the region of swamp 
and forest where Rosewood once had stood. A green highway sign marked the spot, 
but all he saw was a trailer park, cow pastures and a restored Victorian house, 
which had been left standing in 1923 because its owners were white. Rosewood's 
other structures had been reduced to scattered brick foundations hidden by 
overgrowth. The red cedars that gave the town its name crowded the landscape, 
as if trying to reclaim the land. 
</P>
<P>
 O'McCarthy headed into Sumner, where he asked questions at a general store, 
and then on to Cedar Key, nine miles west. He sensed a reticence whenever 
Rosewood was mentioned. "It was like incest in the family," he says. This was 
no mere historical event, he realized. People who participated in the violence 
still lived in the area, he was warned, and asking about Rosewood could be 
dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 From Moore's article and a transcript of the "60 Minutes" episode, O'McCarthy 
came up with a list of Rosewood survivors. When he returned to his home in 
Miami Beach, he began working the phones. He would have to find people with 
first-hand knowledge of the massacre willing to sell him the rights to their 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
 He tried to enlist the help of civil rights organizations, such as the NAACP, 
Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition and the Southern Poverty Law Center. Their 
resources and reputations could only boost his efforts, and there was another 
other important consideration. O'McCarthy knew that the first Rosewood movie 
had fallen through partly because it was a period piece. If these organizations 
were willing not just to investigate Rosewood but to take it on as a cause, it 
would give the story a contemporary framework and the narrative of a crusade, 
which, he figured, would make a movie much more salable. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that O'McCarthy was being entirely mercenary. He was a former political 
editor of the L.A. Free Press who had befriended Black Panthers and protested 
the Vietnam War. In 1982, he was the national spokesman for a veteran's hunger 
strike designed to bring attention to their issues. From his perspective, the 
unresolved crimes of 1923 mirrored unresolved issues of the late 20th Century 
-- problems of race, sex and class. "If you mix these elements together," he 
says, "it sets off a kind of nuclear reaction, it triggers all the madness in 
every participant's mind." 
</P>
<P>
 At first, every organization he contacted for help turned him down. "Your 
objectives are laudable, and we believe the truth should be pursued," an NAACP 
executive wrote in late 1991. "Unfortunately, our limited resources both in 
financial and staff terms rule out our active participation." 
</P>
<P>
 On his own, O'McCarthy wasn't having much luck tracking down cooperative 
survivors. He couldn't afford to devote full time to the project, and, like the 
residents of the Gulf Hammock, the victims of Rosewood weren't always anxious 
to talk -- they feared reprisals or simply didn't want to dredge up the painful 
past. Gary Moore offered him one good lead -- a Tampa family directly related 
to Sylvester Carrier. But Moore also warned O'McCarthy that the family was 
contentious -- one aged survivor had run him out of her yard rather than talk 
to an outsider about what happened. McCarthy decided to stay clear of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, about a year after he began working on the Rosewood project, 
O'McCarthy turned up Lee Ruth Davis. He heard that she was living in Miami, and 
he made contact through the simplest of research tools -- the phone book. When 
he called, she sounded ready to step forward, almost as if she'd been hoping 
someone would ask her about what had happened in 1923. Davis welcomed 
O'McCarthy to her modest house, offered him iced tea and then proceeded to 
describe her experience in the horrifying detail of first-hand experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis was 8 years old in 1923. Her father, forced to flee, left her and three 
of her siblings in the care of John and Mary Wright, a white family who saved 
many women and children. Mary Wright treated the young ones as if they were her 
own, feeding them, calming them. But the children panicked one day while left 
alone during the rampage and fled, taking refuge for a while in the swamps. 
"This is a terrible story," Davis would say in a sworn statement in 1993. "It 
is the first time in my life that I see people with guns. . . . We all got down 
on our bellies and crawled. I don't know how far we crawled on the stomach. We 
tried to keep people from seeing us through the bushes." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only did Davis sign her rights over to O'McCarthy the evening they met, 
but she also agreed to speak out in any other forum necessary to win 
recompense. And she gave him what would turn out to be another crucial lead: 
the phone number of her cousin, Minnie Lee Langley. Langley was one of the few 
people still alive who had been in the Carrier house when Sylvester fought 
back. Now O'McCarthy had a human link to that pivotal part of the story, and 
one who like Davis was very willing to talk. By the time he was done 
interviewing Langley, he had "a picture that was very concrete and very clear 
and at the same time filled with conjecture, mystery, lies, deceit -- it had 
all the things that we think of in Southern history having to do with the 
races." 
</P>
<P>
 All that remained was for him to somehow get the wheels of justice rolling, to 
get these women represented in a court of law and to get them a measure of 
justice they had so far been denied. Once again, O'McCarthy's incessant 
networking on Rosewood paid off. He wrangled an introduction to Steve Hanlon, a 
lawyer who was making a name for himself representing underdogs in high-profile 
cases at Holland & Knight, Florida's largest law firm and one of its most 
prestigious. When Hanlon agreed to represent Davis and Langley pro bono, it 
appeared for the first time that O'McCarthy's crusade in behalf of the 
survivors -- and his movie -- wasn't just a pipe dream. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was one other thing: O'McCarthy believed he'd improve his film's 
chances of being made if its hero were white. Hanlon would have fit the bill. 
But O'McCarthy had already decided to make himself the hero. He planned to 
model a character after himself, a white knight out to uncover the secret of 
Rosewood. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Arnett Doctor is angry. A stern and religious man with a gray goatee, a 
shaved, square head and a withering glare, he all but simmers in a perpetual 
state of rage. Perhaps it stands to reason. The 51-year-old retired Tampa 
businessman grew up in the shadow of Rosewood -- his great-grandfather was Ed 
Goins, the second largest landowner in Rosewood and owner of a turpentine still 
that supplied up to 50 jobs. Sylvester Carrier was his uncle, and Minnie Lee 
Langley his cousin. His mother, Philomena, was in the Carrier house the night 
of the attack, and her grandmother, Sarah, did not survive it. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Doctor has done well in life, he fumes about how much further ahead 
he would have been had Rosewood been left in peace. "My great-grandfather was 
the major employer in Rosewood and his sons and his daughters were fairly well 
educated people, and then this atrocity occurred and bango! My mother and her 
brother and her sister -- no education. My mother's generation was cut off. All 
of a sudden my mother had to start scrubbing floors." 
</P>
<P>
 Well before O'McCarthy ever heard of the massacre, Doctor had had the idea 
that the "Rosewood Family" -- the survivors and their descendants -- should 
seek redress from the state of Florida. In 1985, Doctor presented the notion at 
his family's annual reunion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made an information packet and passed it out," he says. "Most people threw 
it away." His own mother had made it clear that she preferred her family not to 
mention Rosewood. She had been the one who'd chased Gary Moore out of her yard. 
Doctor decided to honor her wishes as long as she was alive. 
</P>
<P>
 She had been dead almost two years when Doctor first heard of O'McCarthy in 
early 1993. The producer was steadily trying to generate interest in his movie 
and the Rosewood issue, and he appeared with Langley and Davis on "The Maury 
Povich Show." On national TV, O'McCarthy did what comes naturally to a 
Hollywood producer -- he simplified the story. While he didn't exactly say that 
the two women with him were the sole survivors of the massacre, he implied that 
any others were scattered with the wind, their whereabouts unknown and 
unknowable. Langley and Davis, it was clear, were meant to be the beneficiaries 
of the legal case, and -- along with O'McCarthy -- the stars of his film. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctor's sister Yvonne fired off an angry letter to Cousin Lee Ruth, 
criticizing the "lies" that had been told on the air. Playing on the survivors' 
old fears of white reprisals, she warned: "You know Lee Ruth, we all have to be 
careful, because you never know to whom you're speaking and in fact, to whom 
they are acquainted. There is still alot (sic) of hate crimes being committed 
today." 
</P>
<P>
 Doctor contacted Holland & Knight after the telecast, demanding that his group 
be included in any legal action. Doctor's Rosewood family would become the 
decisive majority in the legal machinations. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometime later, Doctor and O'McCarthy had a single telephone conversation. 
Circling each other warily, they discussed the possibility of Doctor's group 
coming into the movie deal. But the two men couldn't reach an agreement. As 
Doctor explained later, he had already written the producer off as someone out 
to "bamboozle" the survivors and make a buck. 
</P>
<P>
 While O'McCarthy continued struggled to keep his movie on track, Doctor began 
to conduct his own negotiations with Hollywood. Slowly, O'McCarthy was being 
frozen out of a process he had set in motion.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after Hanlon met with Doctor, the Rosewood survivors' legal strategy 
was set. They decided to get a bill introduced in the Legislature modeled after 
the federal act that had awarded reparations to Japanese Americans placed in 
World War II internment camps. 
</P>
<P>
 By early 1993, the claims bill was ready to be filed. It asserted that state 
officials had known about the massacre yet did nothing to stop it, and it 
called for erection of a memorial and for the payment of restitution to 
survivors and their children. But the sponsors missed a deadline for filing the 
bill. It would have to wait another year. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, opposition to the idea of reparations was growing. It was all well 
and good to have considered reparations for two survivors, but where would it 
stop? As the number of known survivors grew, opponents grumbled that 
restitution might bankrupt the state. And what about other historical 
injustices and other claims, from Seminole Indians, the descendants of lynching 
victims, and who knew what else? 
</P>
<P>
 All along, many north Florida whites had been quick to trivialize the violence 
as the work of "rednecks" who "let booze get the best of them." Others repeated 
the stories handed down by their parents -- that the trouble at Rosewood had 
been caused by armed blacks fighting a guerrilla war against stalwart whites. 
The claimants, it was said, were liars with dollar signs in their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Even those who believed the survivors' side of the story weren't sure that 
payment was necessary: "The people lost their land because they didn't maintain 
it and pay taxes," reasoned Robin Raftis. "It was their choice not to come 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 In the face of such contention, and under pressure to do something despite the 
bungled bill filing, Florida House Speaker Bolley L. Johnson in 1993 authorized 
a study to establish the details of the massacre and to determine what blame, 
if any, could rightly be laid on the state. 
</P>
<P>
 As five historians opened their investigation, the age of those who could have 
witnessed or been involved in the event lent a sense of urgency to the task. 
Many of Gary Moore's original sources were dead and gone. Lee Ruth Davis had 
died in August of that year. 
</P>
<P>
 The study team faced further difficulty when they approached Moore in hopes of 
gaining access to taped interviews now a decade old. Moore, who had been unable 
to get a book deal based on his research, reportedly demanded $10,000 in 
exchange for letting the government listen to his interviews. The investigators 
balked; and Moore kept the tapes to himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the team soldiered on, talking to witnesses and studying 
contemporary accounts, finally confirming basic facts of the slaughter: that 
the alleged assault was the catalyst, that it was whites who started the 
killing. Various sources had put the number of people killed anywhere from 
seven to 200. The study could find documented evidence of only eight deaths. It 
acknowledged, though, that the number could be higher. 
</P>
<P>
 The report found that Rosewood may not have been been a black heaven on earth, 
as some survivors have portrayed it, but it had been a stable community of 25 
to 30 black families with three churches, a Masonic hall, a baseball diamond 
and some businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Lives had indeed been saved by heroic efforts, including the actions of John 
and Mary White, and of white conductors who stopped a train that ran through 
the swamp so that blacks hiding there could board it and be taken to safety.  
</P>
<P>
 The property the victims left behind -- the land and belongings -- ended up 
being acquired by some of the white landowners, including the Wrights. There 
was no evidence the blacks were ever compensated. 
</P>
<P>
 Grisly murders and mutilations had certainly taken place -- including the 
unprovoked killing of Minnie Lee Langley's crippled grandfather, James. During 
a lull in the shootout at the Carrier house, he had helped her and others 
escape into the swamp. He was later caught by the mob, taken to the graves of 
his family members and shot to death, execution style. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing that didn't hold up was the often-told tale of Sylvester Carrier's 
survival. Langley claims to have heard his retreating laughter in the woods as 
she hid upstairs, and Arnett Doctor has always asserted that Sylvester survived 
into the 1960s, that he was spirited away from the carnage at the Carrier house 
in a coffin by black Masons. But the evidence turned up by the state indicated 
that Sylvester was dead on the first floor of the house when the mob finally 
took it. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, the study did lay a portion of the blame for the violence 
squarely on the state. Five days into the disturbance, before the town had been 
burned to the ground, Gov. Cary Hardee had considered calling out the Florida 
National Guard. Instead, he accepted the local sheriff's word that everything 
was under control. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite confirmed reports of deaths, and with a mob of between 200 and 300 
armed white men still roaming the countryside, Hardee went hunting. That 
inaction, said the study, allowed the steamrollering rampage to culminate in 
the total destruction of Rosewood.  
</P>
<P>
 The report concluded: "Rosewood was a tragedy of American democracy and the 
American legal system." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the heels of the study, legislative sponsors last December sought $7 
million in compensation for victims. The claims process provided just the forum 
O'McCarthy had wanted. Before the Legislature could consider the bill, a 
government fact-finder, would hold hearings and then make a recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearings, held late last winter, were extraordinary -- one by one, the 
elderly survivors told their stories. Minnie Lee Langley was among them, as was 
Wilson Hall, whose father had owned a sugar cane mill, grist mill and 
smokehouse and operated a small store. After his family was forced to flee, 
Wilson, age 7, was eventually reduced to scavenging on garbage trucks. Opposing 
the claim were several whites whose fathers had been involved. They insisted 
that Hall, Langley and the others were lying. 
</P>
<P>
 As in a court of law, Hanlon went head-to-head with Assistant Atty. Gen.James 
Peters on the issue of whether the state had a moral obligation to compensate 
the victims. Although Chiles supported compensation, Peters questioned the 
thoroughness and accuracy of the study. He argued that even if the state had 
not taken proper action to halt the carnage, the events were too old for the 
current government to be held accountable. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, his cause was aided by Gary Moore. It had been Moore's article 
that first publicly attached the word "massacre" to what happened in Rosewood. 
Now he appeared before the fact-finder, Richard Hixson, to bitterly blast the 
researchers' findings. 
</P>
<P>
 In his own writings, Moore had always emphasized the gaps in the available 
record, the distortions and myths that were propagated over the years by both 
blacks and whites. Since the appearance of his original story, he had become, 
if anything, more enamored of the notion that there was no knowable truth. It 
was in everybody's interest to embellish what happened, to say the town was 
more prosperous than it was, to exaggerate the number of deaths, to make this 
person or that more heroic than anyone possibly could have been. Only his tapes 
held the truth. And, since government researchers had not listened to the 
tapes, the bill under consideration merely endorsed the myths of one Rosewood 
faction, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Hixson recommended payment, saying the state had a "moral 
obligation." But he greatly scaled back the amount. In April, the bill passed 
the House 71-40 and the Senate 26-14. 
</P>
<P>
 The $2.1-million bill awards $150,000 for emotional trauma to each of four 
specifically named survivors -- Langley and Hall along with Arnett Goins and 
Willie Evans. Other survivors have until Dec. 31 to apply for compensation. In 
addition, money is being set aside to compensate families who lost property and 
to fund scholarships for the descendants of victims. Relatives of the survivors 
cheered and hugged after the victory, even though the bill awarded much less 
than they had requested. In his comments after the bill passed, Doctor didn't 
mention O'McCarthy at all. Just as the producer, in some of his statements to 
the press, had portrayed himself as a crusading white knight, Doctor has 
implied that he, Arnett Doctor, had been the catalyst or that Lee Ruth had 
contacted Hanlon on her own. The producer had become the invisible man. While 
joyous Rosewood survivors and their supporters celebrated, O'McCarthy, while 
pleased with the bill's passage, fumed over being left out. "I guess I was the 
wrong color," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rosewood, in the parlance of Hollywood, has become "hot." Stories on the 
massacre and restitution have been featured on national television, in numerous 
newspaper articles and in Esquire magazine. Suzanne DePasse, producer of 
"Lonesome Dove," purchased an option on O'McCarthy's rights and story package a 
year ago, but never went into production with it. At press time, O'McCarthy's 
agent at Creative Artists Agency was preparing to pitch it elsewhere. "I've put 
it into the hands of the two most powerful entities I know: God and CAA," says 
O'McCarthy, who has been plugging away on other TV and commercial projects with 
moderate success. At least two other Rosewood movies are said to be in 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 After 71 years of bearing the burden and the pain of Rosewood alone and in 
obscurity, a handful of survivors has finally gotten recognition from the state 
and the world at large that they suffered a great injustice, endured a terrible 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
 But the depth of that loss, and the advanced age and health of the victims, 
makes the victory cause for muted celebration at best. For Minnie Lee, her 
years in Rosewood were a time of innocence, the last truly contented time of 
her life. She had planned to go to school to become a nurse. Her grandmother, 
with whom she lived after her mother died in childbirth, was going to help her. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the massacre, her plans were derailed. She spent three or four days 
in the cold, swampy woods, staying out of sight of the gunmen. Her grandmother, 
Emma, who was slightly wounded in the siege on the house, got separated in the 
tumult. 
</P>
<P>
 Langley was one of the lucky ones picked up by the train conductors. She 
remembers them gently lifting her up into the stopped car. Of those who helped 
her toward the end of the ordeal, she says now, with a smile: "Some of them 
were too good to be white." 
</P>
<P>
 Word of the massacre had reached her relatives in Gainesville, 46 miles away, 
by the time the train arrived. She found them waiting at the station. She 
eventually was reunited with her grandmother, but Emma died within a year. 
Family members consider her an uncounted victim. Minnie Lee had to leave school 
to take a job. She worked most of her life in a brush factory. She cries, 
still, when she talks about what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you the truth: After what happened to my grandmother and my 
grandfather, it took my life," she says, "because I loved them."

 Like Lewis Carroll's Alice, fashion has the power to suggest a parallel 
universe.Try on a tartan kilt and hear pipers marching to battle on the 
Scottish Highlands, or slip into a vinyl jumpsuit and envision docking at the 
nearest space station. Clothes can and do transport us. When paired with luxe 
fabrics such as silk, satin and velvet, exquisite pleats and shirring produce 
fantastical results. Wear one of these creations, and leave everything else to 
your imagination.

SOUTHWEST SIMPLIFIED; HIS BIKINI A BUST, JOHN SEDLAR IS TAKING A MORE 
DOWN-TO-EARTH VIEW AT ABIQUIU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 John Sedlar is making a new beginning. At Abiquiu in Santa Monica, it's Take 
Two on the sophisticated modern Southwest cuisine he developed first at Saint 
Estephe in Manhattan Beach and then at Bikini in Santa Monica. After Bikini 
fizzled to a close early this year, he's back at the same polished two-story 
space, this time with a new name, a new menu and much more reasonable prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherever this chef is cooking, I'm interested. Sedlar's work has always been 
heady stuff, visually gorgeous, demanding in its references and technically 
well-executed. But it had limited appeal. Even if you loved it -- and I do -- 
Bikini was an intense experience that didn't bear repeating often. 
</P>
<P>
 With Abiquiu he has redefined his concept, making it more user-friendly. The 
result is less precious, more accessible than Bikini's rarefied fare. It's as 
if someone who's always thought of himself as a fine artist realizes that the 
times demand he turn instead to more practical crafts. Sedlar's experience 
reflects that of other owners of high-end restaurants, such as Michel Richard 
of Citrus and Mauro Vicenti of Rex il Ristorante, who have opened 
establishments with more reasonable fare, Richard with his Citrus Bistro and 
Vicenti with Alto Palato. 
</P>
<P>
 Abiquiu is certainly a more relaxed, casual place than Bikini, which was one 
of those "special occasion" restaurants. At Abiquiu you can come in for a bowl 
of posole soup and a Taos Caesar salad with blue-corn croutons, or make your 
entire dinner from just one entree, say the Pecos River campfire trout fried up 
with bacon, quail eggs and crusty hash browns. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant is also an affectionate tribute to Sedlar's mother and 
grandmother, whom he credits with teaching him the basic vocabulary of 
Southwest cooking. He's hung grainy black-and-white family photos on the wall 
and named the restaurant for the town where his great-grandparents had a ranch. 
In this chef's hands, that inherited tradition of home cooking is transformed 
with a formidable arsenal of techniques, the underlying pattern of flavors 
overlaid with traces of far-off cuisines he's picked up in his travels. 
</P>
<P>
 Sedlar does like to play. He'll take one ingredient and compose variation 
after variation on a theme. Corn shows up in a number of dishes but in a 
different guise each time. Short-waisted blue corn muffins are tied with 
cornhusk ribbons. A comforting bowl of red-corn posole soup is stained with 
crimson chile. A hand-patted round of masa sope is topped with artichoke and 
juicy charred quail and set in a gorgeous cumin-studded sauce. Ragout of nopal 
cactus and fresh corn garnishes one of my favorite appetizers, scallops with a 
"tumbleweed" of deep-fried shredded filo dough, while roast Chinese duck, 
succulent in an anise-scented glaze, gets a fluffy corn brioche dressing. And 
for dessert, there's a fabulous Zuni corn souffle, tall and tender, with a pale 
passion fruit cream to spoon on top. It's like eating clouds. 
</P>
<P>
 Sedlar is just as mischievous with chile. His chile relleno has been to 
Bangkok and back; the filling is translucent shrimp, the sauce a peanut-laden 
ocher smear. A bowl of slippery vichyssoise seems innocuous enough until you 
discover the dab of green chile paste in the middle. The fist-sized grilled 
cowboy steak is topped with a blistering green chile pesto. Ahi tuna rubbed 
with chile spices rests on a cushion of startling green jalapeno mashed 
potatoes. As a small surprise, he's slipped a little chile flavor into the 
chocolate ice cream that comes with his show-stopping banana split. If chile 
and chocolate sounds entirely too weird (it's actually quite wonderful), you 
can order a molded dark-chocolate chile relleno or a gilded chocolate tamale 
filled with a hazelnut ganache.  
</P>
<P>
 But give the man a tamale and he really goes to town. Just after Abiquiu 
opened, it featured a "tamale bar" at lunch on the upstairs outdoor patio. 
Lunch has since been moved downstairs and the tamale bar closed, although it 
will reappear in November. That's when patrons can get the full experience of 
the Sedlar tamale. Sedlar, the menu proclaims, uses the traditional steamed 
masa tamale as the base and adds "outrageous toppings" -- bouillabaisse, corn 
chowder, "free-range" vegetables, whitefish mousse and caviar. Masa is an 
eminently neutral medium, so it's not surprising that he gets away with some of 
the more exotic renditions. Still, Sedlar's Grandma Eloisa perhaps knew best. 
The traditional chicken or pork tamales are closer to the soothing and 
substantial food they're meant to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Sedlar is quite capable of being dull, too. Delicate squash blossoms stuffed 
with a Black Forest ham mousse curry sounds interesting, but a bland filling 
that resembles ground-up pink eraser makes it less than successful. The "flying 
lobster dude ranch sushi," which is not sushi at all but cooked lobster and 
Spanish rice, just doesn't fly. And along with the menu's inconsistencies, the 
kitchen can be uneven, and the service is sometimes absent-minded. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-page, pretty much all-California wine list includes a number of good 
wines in the $20 to $30 range, including Au Bon Climat's crisp '93 Pinot Blanc 
($24) and '91 Petite Syrah from Stag's Leap ($29). 
</P>
<P>
 Sedlar may still be feeling his way. He's had to learn how to compromise by 
giving up pricey ingredients, working with a smaller kitchen staff and 
simplifying his cooking. But despite its ups and downs, Abiquiu has a warmth 
and earthiness that give Sedlar's new beginning an undeniable appeal.

ON THE RECORD: BEETHOVEN LEAN, MEAN AND LIVELY 
</P>

<P>
 A decade ago, no self-respecting musician specializing in historically 
informed performance, on period instruments, would have been caught dead 
conducting our traditional symphony orchestras. But then, they wouldn't have 
been invited to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Conductors once ridiculed as being amateurs at worst, inspired loonies at 
best, e.g., Nikolaus Harnoncourt, Roger Norrington, John Eliot Gardiner, have 
gained acceptance to the point where they are embraced by the traditional 
orchestras -- not only as guest conductors but, as in the breakthrough instance 
of Gardiner, in the chief conductor's job. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardiner's story becomes even more noteworthy when one considers that he 
inherited the NDR Symphony of Hamburg from one of the last of the German 
heavyweights, 80-something Gunter Wand. A changing of the guard if ever there 
was one, and an admission that a tradition and an era had passed, irrevocably. 
</P>
<P>
 What Gardiner is likely to accomplish in Hamburg remains to be seen. What 
prodigies he continues to produce with period forces is strikingly affirmed in 
a set of the nine Beethoven symphonies (Deutsche Grammophon Archiv 439 900, 
five CDs). The instrumental ensemble is the 60-odd member Orchestre 
Revolutionnaire et Romantique, a pretentious mouthful, in effect an enlarged 
version of his English Baroque Soloists. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardiner becomes the fifth period-specialist -- following Norrington, 
Harnoncourt, Christopher Hogwood and Roy Goodman -- to give us the nine as they 
presumably sounded when they were new. And, not surprisingly, each of the five 
editions presents a different take on the way it was. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief, persuasive talk included in the set, Gardiner examines the 
historical significance of the symphonies, not only in terms of their 
revolutionary aspects and influence on the future course of music, but their 
roots in Mozart, Haydn and French composers of the second half of the 18th 
Century. He also talks about the particular sounds of 18th-Century instruments 
and the manner in which they convey Beethoven's musical thought. 
</P>
<P>
 That the desired sounds of the past are captured, or recaptured, throughout 
these performances is easy enough to believe. Among the period-instrument sets, 
this one is by far the best executed (Harnoncourt employs mostly modern 
instruments, so let's exclude him from consideration here). Gardiner's readings 
are unfailingly fleet and urgent. The performing scores are clearly based on 
the best, least cluttered editions available. What emerges is Beethoven 
straddling stylistic eras, and for the most part it works wonderfully well. 
</P>
<P>
 This is Beethoven lean, lithe, at times even plain -- as opposed to heavily 
"interpreted" -- with woody woodwinds, piercing brass, rifle-shot timpani and 
lightweight, but by no means thin-toned strings. 
</P>
<P>
 Norrington, in his EMI set with the London Classical Players, conveyed some of 
the same notions, but when he recorded the nine symphonies nearly a decade ago, 
his ensemble -- indeed, period-performance in general -- hadn't reached nearly 
the high level of proficiency routinely encountered today, on recordings at any 
rate, and even surpassed by Gardiner's superb band. 
</P>
<P>
 The First and Second symphonies here are particularly invigorating in their 
closely woven textures and taut inflection. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ninth Symphony, which has become so heavily freighted with meaning -- and, 
the more meaning, the slower the tempos, the thicker the textures, the more 
quirkily variable the rhythmic scheme -- if anything gains in impact from 
Gardiner's hard-driving approach. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Pastoral" is enchantingly fresh, the ensemble at its most elegantly airy, 
the pacing quick but relaxed. There is a feeling of sweet intimacy in the 
"Scene by the Brook," and the storm breaks with the kind of hellish intensity 
that must have jolted its first listeners, with those tight timpani 
thunderclaps packing a particular wallop when compared to the sound of the 
modern instrument. There's an eerie foreshadowing of Berlioz here. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Eroica" does not begin promisingly, with Gardiner possibly 
overemphasizing its relationship to the Classical past and rather 
self-consciously trying to banish the presence of the Titanic, as opposed to 
the nervously energetic, Beethoven. The approach does, however, work in the 
tense coda, which culminates in an explosive climax. The ensuing movement's 
funereal tread is no less effective for being more tersely inflected here than 
is usually the case. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, Gardiner and his splendidly accomplished and responsive players have 
made the most convincing recorded case to date for the historically informed 
approach to Beethoven, a fulfillment in many respects of the promise offered by 
Norrington's pioneering effort.

STEVE KANALY MOVES TO PINE VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "All My Children" has snared Steve Kanaly for the role of Seabone Hunkle. 
Viewers of the defunct prime-time series "Dallas" will remember Kanaly from his 
longtime role as Ray Krebs. 
</P>
<P>
 On "All My Children," Seabone makes a surprise arrival in Pine Valley that is 
sure to cause more than a little trouble for his children, Dixie Martin (Cady 
McClain) and Del Henry (Winsor Harmon). The half-siblings share the same father 
and different mothers. Just what Seabone will have up his sleeve has not been 
revealed, but his arrival will no doubt have something to do with his wealthy 
former brother-in-law, Palmer Cortlandt (James Mitchell), who dislikes Seabone. 
</P>
<P>
 A little background: Seabone was married to Palmer's sister, fathered Dixie, 
then dumped mother and daughter to spend the rest of his life with Del's 
mother, albeit without the benefit of a divorce from Dixie's mom. Kanaly is 
scheduled to debut this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, film actress Camryn Manheim, who co-stars with Bridget Fonda in the 
upcoming feature film "The Road to Wellville," is slated to make an appearance 
Tuesday and Wednesday on "All My Children" in the role of a state penitentiary 
prison clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Ellen McLaughlin of "Angels in America" will play Sheila, a prison 
inmate who Laurel Montgomery (Felicity La Fortune) goes to see in hopes of 
getting the lowdown on Jane Cox (Robin Mattson). McLaughlin's air date is 
scheduled for Wednesday, barring preemptions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There has been yet another head writer change over at "Another World." Taking 
over the reins is Carolyn Culliton, who replaces Peggy Sloane (who took over in 
October, 1992). Sloane's writing earned "Another World" a Daytime Emmy 
nomination in the best writing category last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kirk Geiger's final appearance as Kevin Buchanan is slated for Monday's 
episode of "One Life to Live" (barring preemptions) because the powers-that-be 
intend to "age" the character. Taking over the role of Kevin will be Jack 
Armstrong, who is best known for his stint as Greg Nelson on "All My Children" 
(1986). He was also seen on "Guiding Light" and "Ryan's Hope," as well as the 
late-night series "Eden." Armstrong is to begin appearing in early November.

<P>
 From the clean, audible concert footage to the musicians' "therapy" sessions 
to a day in the life of the guitarist's dog, this video of live performances 
and offstage antics is a raw and understated complement to last year's big 
success, "Siamese Dream." 
</P>
<P>
 Leader Billy Corgan narrates the band's history over early footage of the 
quartet, and interviews with fans are sprinkled through the 90-minute 
video.Bumpy camera work and amateur effects induce motion sickness in spots, 
but overall "Vieuphoria" is smooth and quirkily entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Pumpkins album, "Pisces Iscariot," is similar in spirit -- a 
collection of B-sides, rarities and radio performances with a more intimate 
appeal than the band's regular collections.  
</P>
<P>
 It offers the bittersweet vocals and loud dynamics that characterize the 
Pumpkins, but the production is rougher, the singing more vulnerable and the 
music warmer. Not as dazzling and powerful as "Siamese Dream," the album 
satisfies a quieter side of the soul. 
</P>
<P>
 Items are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three stars 
(good) and four stars (excellent).

POP EYE: OUT OF COURT -- AND OUT OF TIME?; IT'S BEEN FIVE YEARS SINCE STONE 
ROSES' DEBUT ALBUM MADE A BIG SPLASH. A NEW ALBUM IS DUE, BUT IS THERE AN 
AUDIENCE? 
</P>

 The Stone Roses' 1989 debut album, a mix of swirling guit ars and pulsating 
beat, was hailed in some pop circles as the Second Coming. And expectations 
soared even higher when Geffen Records signed the band from Manchester, 
England, in 1990 for about $4 million.  
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of delays later, the band's second album is finally set for release . . 
. with the title "Second Coming." 
</P>
<P>
 But is it coming too late? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a matter of how many years have passed, but how good the album is," 
insists Geffen's head of marketing, Robert Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some respects, the Stone Roses were ahead of their time, the blend of 
guitar-driven rock with an alternative base. . . . That music is now the 
mainstream, and there is an enormously enlarged potential audience. And there's 
an enormous cache of belief and interest in this band, and I think people will 
not be disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
 Interest is clearly still high in England, where the album will be released 
Dec. 6, a month before the U.S. release. There, the Roses were bona fide stars 
before successfully suing to be released from their deal with the U.K. label 
Silvertone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was never a great fan, I have to admit, but I think the mythology has been 
sustained over the intervening period," says BBC radio deejay John Peel.  
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, though, it's another matter. Despite prominent press 
coverage, the group never had a real hit here, and it scrapped plans for a 1990 
tour that could have helped raise its profile. Now the band will have to be 
reintroduced virtually as a new act. 
</P>
<P>
 "They definitely waited longer than they should have (to release another 
album)," says KROQ-FM program director Gene Sandbloom. "People in the industry 
are very much awaiting this album, but listeners, nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Megan McLaughlin, editor of the alternative music publication CMJ, "There 
was anticipation the last couple of times it was announced, but not since. It's 
too much crying wolf." 
</P>
<P>
 What has the band been doing all this time? 
</P>
<P>
 Even Steve Rosen, an L.A.-based manager who helped handle its affairs until 
recently, has trouble answering that one. "They haven't been doing too much," 
he says. "It's unfortunate. It was a great band and I'm curious to hear what it 
sounds like." Steve Hochman, with Dave Jennings from London

 Prince's long-unreleased, much-bootlegged "Black Album" may finally be coming 
out officially. Warner Bros. Records has tentative plans to release it next 
month.A finished new album, "The Gold Experience," has apparently been pushed 
back to next year amid uncertainty as to whether it will be issued by Warners 
or by NPG, the company that has handled releases by the mystery man under his " 
" identity. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the former Prince joined Nona Gaye in a new anti-gun public service 
TV spot. Gaye's father, singer Marvin Gaye, died after being shot by his own 
father 10 years ago. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Megadeth fans might want to track down copies of the band's new bio 
accompanying press mailings for the new "Youthanasia" album -- it was written 
by macabre author Dean Koontz, with tongue firmly in cheek. In one passage he 
notes that metal band bios are required to use words like thrashmasters , 
grizzly-throated and raging maniac , after which he simply writes, "Okay, 
there, I've used them." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Beck is set to start recording his second Geffen album, which could be out by 
mid-'95. . . . Also about to start a new album is White Zombie.

 RE-SOURCE: Six editorial staff members at the prominent hip-hop magazine the 
Source have walked out, joining suspended editor-in-chief and part owner James 
Bernard in calls for the resignation of publisher David Mays. More charges are 
flying, alleging physical threats against the staff by a rapper who is a friend 
of Mays. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard has filed a complaint in a New York City dispute resolution center, 
claiming that Raymond Scott (a.k.a. Ray Dog), a member of the group Almighty 
RSO, had threatened him with physical harm in an attempt to get coverage in the 
magazine. Mays had lobbied with Bernard for a story on the group, and when the 
editor refused, Mays hired a free-lance writer and put the article in the 
November issue without the knowledge of the staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically we feel disrespected by our publisher," says associate editor 
Carter Harris, who signed a letter asking Mays to step down and says that he 
also was harassed by Scott. "Two of us were threatened by Ray Dog, and our 
publisher did nothing about it and . . . went behind our backs and stuck this 
puff piece into the magazine about the group." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Bernard: "This is a fight for a precious thing, a magazine that speaks 
directly to a hip-hop generation from people who are part of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Mays says that new staffers are being hired and that a 
December issue will be put out as scheduled. STEVE HOCHMAN

 ENGLAND SWINGS: Brian Eno enlisted Bono, David Bowie, Paul McCartney and 
others for a recent project -- but as sculptors, not musicians. The creations 
of the stars were auctioned in London recently, raising $82,000 for a Bosnian 
children's charity.A small woodcarving by McCartney commanded the highest 
price, $18,750, from a mystery buyer, while Bono's music box, containing a pair 
of sunglasses and an American Express card, sold for nearly $3,000.

 * "Repetitive Beats," a single by Retribution -- a one-time collaboration of 
members of Killing Joke, hip-hop group Fun-Da-Mental and dance acts the Drum 
Club and System 7 -- is the latest effort by British rockers to protest their 
country's Criminal Justice Bill. The proposal would, among other things, 
effectively outlaw "rave" dance parties. Primal Scream and ex-Clash guitarist 
Mick Jones are among those doing remixed versions of the single, to be released 
in the U.K. on Oct. 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Primal Scream's Bobby Gillespie was among the estimated 100,000 people taking 
part in a recent Hyde Park demonstration against the bill. The London rally 
ended in violent clashes between demonstrators and police, with 38 people 
(including 11 police officers) injured.Dave Jennings from London

 Although uneven, it is surprising how close this 1993 reworking of the French 
film "The Return of Martin Guerre" gets to the traditional three-hankie 
satisfactions of classic '40s weepers.Set in 1867 in a benighted Tennessee 
hamlet, it stars Richard Gere in the title role as the town's biggest 
landowner, who strolls in after not having been seen nor heard from since he 
left for the Civil War seven years before. As surprised as his faithful old dog 
to see him is his wife (a radiant Jodie Foster). Gere, not at his best in 
costume pictures, and Foster prove persuasive anyway, amid an inordinate amount 
of Southern foolishness (HBO Sunday at 4 p.m.). Kenneth Turan

 OLDIE BUT GOODIE: If this summer's popularity of Mazzy Star's year-old "So 
Tonight That I Might See" album was a surprise, it's leading to an even more 
unexpected rediscovery of the group's first album, 1990's "She Hangs Brightly." 
 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than play the group's new single, "She's My Baby," KROQ has chosen to 
play the B-side, "Halah," which was taken from the older album, originally 
released on the small Rough Trade label before the band was signed by Capitol, 
which reissued it.Phil Costello, Capitol vice president of promotion, is 
elated, even though this could mean derailing the planned campaign for "She's 
My Baby" and focusing on the old song. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care what track they play off what record," Costello says. "All it 
does is build a fan base. I'm sure other stations will take KROQ's lead, and I 
can alter the campaign at any moment. There's even a video for the song that 
they did for Rough Trade." STEVE HOCHMAN

 WHAT YEAR IS IT?: Frankie Valli is as surprised as you are that a remix of his 
1976 Four Seasons' hit "December 1963 (Oh, What a Night)" is back in the Top 
20. 
</P>
<P>
 The unlikely revival started six years ago in the Netherlands, where the remix 
became a dance-club hit, spreading through Europe and Australia and finally 
reaching U.S. clubs early this year.Then the single -- released here by Curb 
Records -- was picked up by radio stations, starting with the Boston-based 
syndicated show "Open House Party." 
</P>
<P>
 But it hasn't really changed life for Valli, who, with his new version of the 
Four Seasons, plays regularly at Las Vegas and Atlantic City hotels.  
</P>
<P>
 "We were selling out before the single came along," says Valli, 57. 
</P>
<P>
 He has seen a difference in the audiences though. "A lot of kids come to see 
us now -- which is amazing to me at my age," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the Four Seasons may have been off the charts for a while, the 
group's old songs have been staples of oldies stations. 
</P>
<P>
 "That support has kept us alive and visible to new, young audiences," he says. 
"We don't have to rely on the same group of old fans." 
</P>
<P>
 The single, though, may revive a dormant recording career. A new album is in 
the works. Dennis Hunt

 AND ONE MORE THING: Tom Petty wanted to give something extra to his loyal fans 
with his new album, "Wildflowers," which will be in stores on Nov. 1. The first 
500,000 CDs sold will come in a special slip-cover, while 250 of those -- 
distributed randomly -- will include discs autographed by Petty. And the first 
single, "You Don't Know How It Feels," will also come with a bonus, a 
previously unreleased song called "Girl on LSD" with limerick-like verses 
dealing with behavior caused by a number of addictive substances.

 Psychological thrillers are only as effective as their villains, and this 1993 
film has a magnificent one.Barney Cousins is his name and, as played by Jeff 
Bridges (pictured), he is an only-too-believable maniac. Bridges' Barney is a 
college chemistry professor in the Pacific Northwest, a loving father and 
faithful husband, a man you could pass on the street without feeling mortal 
danger. Directed by George Sluizer, who also directed the original 1988 Dutch 
version. With Nancy Travis and Kiefer Sutherland (HBO Monday at 4:15 a.m.).

 This 1992 French film, written and directed by Agnieszka Holland, is an 
emotionally powerful piece of work marred by a clumsy plot structure. A 
nightmare set in Provence, which in its own way is as unnerving as anything 
they did over on Elm Street, it tells of the seemingly ordinary Duval 
family.After the 9-year-old son Olivier suddenly disappears, Holland's portrait 
of a family in crisis turns pitiless. The original policeman on the case, now 
transferred to Paris, picks up a 15-year-old hustler (Gregoire Colin, right, 
with Marina Golovine) who apparently is Olivier. While Holland explores such 
lofty themes as the effect of personality on the family and the nature of 
reality, she handles in a creaky way the resolution of the is-he-or-isn't-he 
story (Cinemax Wednesday at 8 p.m.). Kenneth Turan

 DIGABLE PLANETS

<P>
 "Blowout Comb" 
</P>
<P>
 Pendulum/EMI  
</P>
<P>
 * * * 1/2 
</P>
<P>
 Digable Planets' sophomore effort finds the New York-based trio with its feet 
on some seriously solid ground -- a curious place for a group whose jazzy, 
ethereal musings made them the bohemian darlings of hip-hop last year. That 
image, cemented by their nicknames (Ladybug, Doodlebug and Butterfly), will 
most likely be shattered by "Blowout." 
</P>
<P>
 Musically, Digable's new album rides in on the crest of the Long Beach vibe, 
the signal of a kinder, gentler hip-hop nation. They keep the beats oh-so 
languid and sexy while covering new lyrical turf. Songs such as "9th Wonder 
(Blackitolism)" find the group digging into and exposing the psyche of urban 
America deeper than any of their West Coast counterparts, without making any 
pat conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Digable's debut, which makes a knock-out first impression but wears a 
bit thin after repeated listening, "Blowout Comb" draws you into its subtle web 
and keeps you listening. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

 JAZZ PASSENGERS 
</P>
<P>
 "Jazz Passengers in Love" 
</P>
<P>
 High Street Records  
</P>
<P>
 * * 1/2 
</P>
<P>
 Are the Jazz Passengers an unusual group? You'd better believe it. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this, their sixth recording, a legitimate jazz album? Without a doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 Swinging around in all directions, tossing in fragments of mainstream, 
avant-garde, pop and theater, it sorely tests even the most liberal definitions 
of the art. But the bottom line is that this is music -- unusual though it may 
be -- that could only have been produced from a jazz sensibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Love," the Passengers' first vocal album, includes numbers by singers 
ranging from R&B's Jimmy Scott and gospel's Mavis Staples to pop music's 
Deborah Harry and jazzer Bob Dorough. The result simmers like a surrealistic 
stew over a jazz flame. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, it's a hot enough flame to sustain interest despite often obtuse 
lyrics (especially those by David Cale) and a heavy vocal emphasis. Bits and 
pieces of effective improvisation from saxophonist Roy Nathanson and trombonist 
Curtis Fowlkes sneak into the mix, and the vibes of Bill Ware play a major role 
in defining the Passengers' distinctive sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the most striking non-instrumental moments are provided by Scott's 
world-weary tenor, Dorough's epigrammatic "Ring the Bell" (which opens up 
needed room for instrumental soloing), Harry's strong vocal on "Dog in Sand," 
and Staples' stylish rendering of "Kidnapped." 
</P>
<P>
 A strange, off-the-wall and demanding album? Yes. But it is also a fascinating 
example of the expanding creative horizons of jazz at the close of the 20th 
Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor) to four stars (excellent). Don 
Heckman

RETRO; LUCY ABROAD; NEW VIDEO PACKS UP ALL 17 EPISODES OF THE EUROPEAN VACATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Europe has never been the same since the madcap Ricardos and the Mertzes spent 
their vacation on the Continent stirring up laughs and mischief during the 
1955-56 season of "I Love Lucy." 
</P>
<P>
 And fans of the legendary CBS sitcom, which starred Lucille Ball, Desi Arnaz, 
William Frawley and Vivian Vance, can relive the funniest European vacation to 
ever hit the small screen on CBS Video's new three-volume set, Bon Voyage: I 
Love Lucy Adventures in Europe. Priced at $70, the videos contain the complete 
17-episode European story arc. The shows, which total six-and-a-half hours, are 
edited together without opening titles and end credits. The film-to-tape 
transfers were made from the original 35mm prints. 
</P>
<P>
 Inserted into each video is an "I Love Lucy Passport to Fun," a book of 
puzzles relating to Lucy's European trip. Resembling an American passport, it 
includes crossword puzzles, word searches and mazes. Fans who mail in a 
correctly completed puzzle by year's end have a chance to win a trip to Europe 
and follow the Redhead and Co.'s itinerary -- London, Paris, Scotland, Rome and 
Monte Carlo. 
</P>
<P>
 The European story line set sail on "I Love Lucy" on Dec. 12, 1955, with 
"Ricky's European Booking." In this episode, Ricky and his band are hired to 
perform in Europe. Lucy naturally assumes she'll accompany him on the voyage. 
But Ricky tells Lucy that, because of expenses, she can only come along if she 
can raise the money for her passage. After Ricky hires Fred to be the band 
manager, Lucy and Ethel dream up a scheme to accompany them. 
</P>
<P>
 The episodes on the videos feature some of the best-loved "Lucy" stories, 
including "Lucy Meets the Queen," in which Lucy goes to great lengths to be 
presented to Queen Elizabeth while in London. The fantasy "Lucy Goes to 
Scotland" finds Lucy dreaming of her MacGillicuddy clan's village of Kildoonan. 
In her dream, she arrives at the town to meet her relatives only to discover 
she's come just in time to be fed to a two-headed dragon played by Fred and 
Ethel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I Love Lucy" always attracted major Hollywood guest stars over the year, 
including William Holden, Cornel Wilde, John Wayne and Harpo Marx. While 
abroad, the famous romantic French actor Charles Boyer appears as himself on 
the delightful "Lucy Meets Charles Boyer." 
</P>
<P>
 The best of the 17 episodes is "Lucy's Italian Movie," which originally aired 
April 16, 1956. The hilarious entry finds Lucy spotted by a famous Italian 
director on the train who asks her to be in his new film, "Bitter Grapes." 
Because Lucy thinks the film is about grapes, she decides to immerse herself in 
the role and ends up quite literally immersed in grapes. 
</P>
<P>
 The European episodes also are airing for the next eight days on Nick at Nite. 
Sunday: "Lucy Meets Charles Boyer." Monday: "Lucy Gets a Paris Gown." Tuesday: 
"Lucy in the Swiss Alps." Wednesday: "Lucy Gets Homesick." Thursday: "Lucy's 
Italian Movie." Friday: "Bicycle Trip." Oct. 23: "Lucy Goes to Monte Carlo." 
Oct 24: "Home From Europe." 
</P>
<P>
 "I Love Lucy" airs Sundays-Fridays at 9 p.m. on Nickelodeon and Sundays at 5-6 
p.m., weekdays at 9-10 a.m. and Saturdays at 5-7 p.m. on KTTV.

FOCUS; PREVENTING FILM DECAY; AMC REELS OFF SECOND CAMPAIGN FOR THE 
PRESERVATION OF CLASSICS

 The facts are grim. According to film experts, half of the 21,000 
Hollywood-produced short films and features made before 1950 on highly unstable 
nitrate stock have been lost forever. The news gets even worse for films made 
between 1893 and 1930 -- 75% of the features have crumbled into dust. 
</P>
<P>
 But cable's American Movie Classics is coming to the rescue. Last year, AMC 
and the Film Foundation, the film-preservation organization headed by director 
Martin Scorsese, presented its First Annual Film Preservation Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our primary goal was to raise consumers' consciousness that this art form was 
being decayed," says Kate McEnroe, AMC senior vice president and general 
manager. "We found a great many people didn't understand that. I don't think 
people realized to what extent the films were becoming extinct." 
</P>
<P>
 The three-day event on AMC screened restored and preserved films and raised 
$250,000 for the five major American film archives: the UCLA Film and 
Television Archive, Museum of Modern Art, Library of Congress, International 
Museum of Photography at George Eastman House and the National Center for Film 
and Video Preservation at the American Film Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival was such a rousing success that AMC is presenting its Second 
Annual Film Preservation Festival beginning Friday and concluding Oct. 24 at 7 
a.m. The festival will feature classic Westerns, John Ford films, Gary Cooper 
movies, nine Cecil B. DeMille epics, Gene Autry movies and a new Autry 
documentary. 
</P>

 "We're so delighted that the public is eager to see restored films," says Mary 
Lea Bandy, director of the Museum of Modern Art archive. "I think there are 
lots of people who don't know what film preservation means. When they have a 
chance to see restored films, they're excited and grateful and willing to 
help." 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing is a lot of people, when they think of old movies, somehow think 
they are movies that somehow are flawed because they have seen them on inferior 
copies," says Robert Rosen, director of UCLA's archive. "The cinematography and 
the artistry were wonderful back then." 
</P>
<P>
 Bandy says that young audiences finally are appreciating black-and-white 
films. "People are coming to understand more and more about movie history," she 
says. "They grew up on color, so to them black and white is as far removed as 
the pyramids." 
</P>
<P>
 Each archive received approximately $44,000 from money raised during the first 
festival. "It gave us a tremendous boost," Bandy says. "Our share has gone into 
a fund that's helping us to complete preservation of films that have been 
partially preserved and to make new prints so that these films can be widely 
accessible. What we intend to do with the funding is put it right back into 
completing preservation work and making prints, so the films can be loaned to 
other archives and seen on AMC." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the films in this festival, 80% are new titles; the rest were shown last 
year. Highlights include a tinted print of the 1903 landmark Western "The Great 
Train Robbery"; DeMille's 1914 Western "The Virginian," as well as his 1923 
epic "The Ten Commandments"; four John Ford films, "The Informer," 
"Stagecoach," "My Darling Clementine" and "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"; and the 
restored 1943 Gary Cooper-Ingrid Bergman drama in Technicolor, "For Whom the 
Bell Tolls." 
</P>
<P>
 The festival is presenting two versions of "My Darling Clementine," the 
original 1946 release version, preserved by MOMA, and a pre-release version, 
preserved by UCLA, which had been shown to sneak-preview audiences. The 
pre-release "Clementine" is approximately 10 minutes longer and has a different 
ending. 
</P>
<P>
 "The version everyone knows and the pre-release version are different in many 
ways after the first reel," Rosen says. "Reels two through five have different 
sound mixes. One of them has less music and additional bits of dialogue. It was 
discovered by our cataloguers who were looking at this thing and said, 'This 
one is longer. How can that be?' Then when you went back and looked at it, not 
only is it longer, it's different." 
</P>
<P>
 Each version, Rosen says, has its own validity. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA also restored "From Whom the Bell Tolls," based on the Ernest Hemingway 
novel. For nearly four decades, only the 130-minute version of the film has 
been available. 
</P>
<P>
 "The premiere version had a running time of 170 minutes, plus a 10-minute 
intermission," Rosen explains. "A lot of the critics were critical that it was 
too long. So the director (Sam Wood) very quickly made some cuts and brought it 
down to 156 minutes. What happened is that around 1957, Paramount reissued the 
film and shortened it. The pieces of the negative they cut out were thrown away 
and don't survive." 
</P>
<P>
 The Library of Congress had a copy of the 156-minute version. So UCLA copied 
the segments which had been discarded and reinserted them into the film. "We 
did go back to the concept of having an intermission. We were able to find the 
original overture and intermission music (penned by Victor Young) from a Los 
Angeles film collector who found the rolls of soundtrack in an old theater 
projection room." 
</P>
<P>
 Most restoration and preservation projects, Rosen says, "rely on a cooperative 
relationship with other archives and studios. Preservation is really a 
collaborative forum, just like film itself is collaborative."

HITTING THE NAIL

<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding "Natural Born Thriller," by Robert Hilburn (Oct. 2): 
</P>
<P>
 Hilburn's interview with Trent Reznor bothered me enough to prevent a return 
to sleep at 3:30 in the morning. Both Reznor's attitudes and Hilburn's 
indulgence of them were troubling. 
</P>
<P>
 I found the image of a young boy singing, "I want to (expletive) you like an 
animal" particularly disturbing. (Before the publication of the article, a 
19-year-old female acquaintance, a huge Nine Inch Nails fan, mentioned that a 
14-year-old had sung those same words to her. Her attitude seemed to be "Those 
kr-aazy kids. . . ."). Hilburn lets that image pass without comment. I believe 
it begs a question: Where are we when a kid of that age identifies with that 
lyric? 
</P>
<P>
 I believe that achievement is driven by expectation and vision. Tom Lehrer 
once said, "Life is like a sewer. What you get out depends on what you put in." 
Lehrer was blessed with both a sense of humor and irony. Both appear to be 
woefully lacking in Reznor's case. 
</P>
<P>
 If the purpose of art is to have people view things differently, to what end 
does that work? The result does not appear in a vacuum. What new and hopeful 
perspective can the average adolescent gain when viewing through a lens of 
violence, perversion and death? 
</P>
<P>
 Should an emotionally mature person have the option to listen to music or read 
material that plumbs the depths of existence? I think absolutely yes. I think 
it could be beneficial. 
</P>
<P>
 Should an adolescent who has only recently gained secondary sex 
characteristics and whose psyche is often confused at best be wading in that? I 
think not. Parents must instill a positive vision in their children. 
Unfortunately, they also must actively guide, or even dictate at times, what is 
appropriate for their consumption. 
</P>
<P>
 I fear that we have already created a moral, cultural Blob. If you step in it, 
you not only can't scrape it off your shoe, it eats you and goes looking for 
more.

<P>
 In recent stories, Robert Hilburn has blurred some facts concerning the 
relationship between Trent Reznor and the soundtrack to the movie "Natural Born 
Killers." 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is that Reznor did not oversee the selection of the individual songs 
and music for the film itself. The creative decisions were made by the 
producers, film editors and music editors under the supervision of director 
Oliver Stone, with Stone having final approval. 
</P>
<P>
 From this collection of songs, Reznor made his selections to be included in 
his self-produced soundtrack CD, which turned out to be a fine production, 
indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that this distinction was lost amid Hilburn's sweeping adulation of 
Reznor. 
</P>

<P>
 I enjoyed most of Robert Hilburn's cover story on Trent Reznor. Nine Inch 
Nails is a unique force in music, deserving all of its recent success. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Hilburn was way off the mark in attributing Reznor's female fanship 
to his sex appeal. Men and women are equally capable of feeling rage, lust and 
alienation. I listen to Trent Reznor for his brutally honest exploration of the 
depths of the human soul. 
</P>

<P>
 Thank you, Robert Hilburn, for showing everyone that Trent Reznor smiles and 
breathes like everyone else. He is human like you and me. His songs are from 
the hurt that lies within him, and if you think about it, the love that is 
within him also. For that, he is a beautiful person. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, I have hurt just as badly as he has and have loved someone that I 
could never have. Trent is human just as I am. There is nothing wrong with his 
songs. They are based on his beliefs, his world. I can relate to his feelings, 
his hurt and his loneliness.

 I would like to thank Robert Hilburn for introducing us to yet another new 
"genius," Trent Reznor. If he can produce the line "I want to (expletive) you 
like an animal" while still in his 20s, we can only imagine what his "artistry" 
and "vision" can produce in the years to come.

THE UN-NATURAL

<TEXT>
<P>
 Chris Willman tells us he played a reporter in the new Albert Brooks movie 
"The Scout" ("Out of His League, or Out of His Mind?" Sept. 25). Too bad he 
didn't play the same role for Calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 The self-absorbed and, despite its epic length, virtually news-free story read 
more like an advertisement for a reporter's ego and 20th Century Fox than 
journalism. 
</P>
<P>
 I also wonder: Even with a reporter involved in the production of "The Scout," 
how did The Times miss the biggest story -- that the baseball movie tested so 
disastrously that the filmmakers had to shoot an entirely new and totally 
unbelievable ending (call 'em up and ask). 
</P>
<P>
 I'd call this one a shutout: Hollywood 1, Professional Integrity 0.

CARPENTERS' TOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding "Trust Us, This Is Real," on the alternative-music album tribute to 
the Carpenters (Sept. 11): 
</P>
<P>
 Writer Paul Grein's question "And what does the man who produced and arranged 
the Carpenters' long string of hits think of 'If I Were a Carpenter'?" was 
posed to the wrong person. The man who produced the lion's share of the 
Carpenters hits was my late father, Jack Daugherty. 
</P>
<P>
 Daugherty, then a staff producer at A&M Records, produced the Carpenters' 
first five albums and first 10 singles, all of which went gold and most of 
which have probably gone platinum by now. Nine of 12 tracks on their 
quadruple-platinum greatest hits collection "The Singles 1969-1973" were 
produced by Daugherty, a 10th track co-produced by Daugherty and the 
Carpenters. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Grein's question is excusable. If Ray Coleman's biography "The 
Carpenters -- The Untold Story" is any indication, Richard Carpenter seems 
intent on trivializing Daugherty's inestimable influence in the creation of the 
Carpenters' sound. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of my writing is to draw attention to Daugherty's achievements as 
one of the most successful producers of that era. 
</P>
<P>
 My father would have enjoyed knowing that the sound he fashioned more than 20 
years ago continues to be appreciated by so many. As he wasn't a huge fan of 
modern music, he also would have appreciated the irony in the fact that 11 of 
the 14 titles on "If I Were a Carpenter" are remakes of songs that he produced.

BROWN, WILSON CLASH ON CRIME, IMMIGRATION, TAXES; DEBATE: CHALLENGER DISCLOSES 
DAUGHTER'S RAPE IN FORCEFUL ANSWER TO GOVERNOR'S CHARGE THAT SHE'S SOFT ON 
CRIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson and challenger Kathleen Brown traded charges of liar and 
hypocrite Friday in the lone debate of their race for governor, clashing on 
issues ranging from taxes and immigration to the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 The most emotional moment of the confrontation went to Brown, who forcefully 
answered Wilson's charges that she is soft on crime by disclosing that her 
daughter had been raped.  
</P>
<P>
 "You cannot imagine what it's like," she told Wilson, "to be a mother waiting 
at home late at night for your kids to come home, waiting for your daughter to 
come home in the evening, and having her come home and comfort her, because 
she's been raped. . . . So don't question my commitment to be tough on crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson responded: "Well, I have to question it, Kathleen, because despite that 
moving performance, I would say that when you've invoked your father as your 
role model on the death penalty . . . he granted clemency 27 times. Or excuse 
me, 23, whatever it was. Your professed political idol, your brther Jerry, 
appointed Rose Bird. Both Jerry and Rose Bird said what you have said, that 
they would enforce the death penalty." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown reiterated that she would enforce the death penalty -- and added that 
she would ensure that any judges she appointed shared her commitment to 
enforcing the law.  
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, who has focused most of his campaign around his promises to crack down 
on crime and on Brown's opposition to the death penalty, repeated those themes 
in the debate. He also blamed Brown for not helping raise funds for his 
Proposition 172 tax measure last year for local police. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said she had "no doubt" she would be able to enforce the death penalty, 
then said:  
</P>
<P>
 "You know, I have to go back to some of the things that my opponent said a few 
minutes ago questioning my resolve on crime. You know, Pete, you've 
misrepresented my positions on crime throughout this campaign. But I have to 
tell you what I resent most of all is you questioning . . . my commitment to be 
tough on crime. You cannot possibly imagine what's it's like to be a woman at 
night, leaving the office, going to your car at night, worrying about your 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "And you cannot imagine what it's like to be a mother waiting at home late at 
night for your kids to come home, waiting for your daughter to come home in the 
evening and having her come home and comfort her, because she's been raped. . . 
. You can't understand that. So don't question my commitment to be tough on 
crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, it was unclear whether Brown was speaking hypothetically. But 
during the post-debate press conference, she explained that one of her 
daughters had been the victim of date rape. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate was aired on 18 television stations in a dozen California cities 
and the national C-SPAN cable television network. Both the Republican governor 
and his Democratic challenger spent most of their time repeating themes from 
their competing TV commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither candidate committed any major gaffes. Both articulated clear, strongly 
worded attacks and sharp rebuttals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Four years ago when he ran for governor, he lied to you. He lied to you about 
raising taxes," Brown said, describing Wilson as "a-tax-and-spend Republican" 
for the $7 billion in tax increases Wilson signed to help close an inherited 
$14-billion deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't read his lips. Read my plan," Brown said, referring to the 62-page 
booklet, "Building a New California: The Kathleen Brown Economic Plan," which 
her campaign published recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kathleen, you lack the courage to be governor, because you fail to say where 
the budget is going to be cut," Wilson replied, saying it was "the height of 
hypocrisy" for Brown to criticize tax increases that he said Brown "warmly 
congratulated me" for enacting three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Attacking the Brown booklet, Wilson added, "The dirty little secret is, 
despite the rhetoric, it is a tax increase plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown replied that her plan would find funds to put more police on the streets 
and increase school funds by cutting $5 billion in unspecified "wasteful 
government programs." 
</P>
<P>
 "My mission is to give the taxpayers a better quality product at lower cost," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 They also exchanged sharp barbs over the Proposition 187 anti-immigration 
initiative, which Wilson supports and Brown opposes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Proposition 187 is going to make a bad situation worse. (Illegal immigration) 
must be dealt with at the border and at the workplace," Brown said, charging 
that Wilson was exploiting the immigration issue for political purposes and 
that as a U.S. senator he was responsible for federal policies he now blames 
for California's immigration problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got fingerprints all over the illegal immigration problem. As a senator, 
he opened up the floodgates to 1.3 million illegal immigrants," Brown charged. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson replied that it was then-Congressman Leon Panetta, now President 
Clinton's chief of staff, not him, who authored amendments to federal 
immigration laws which are causing much of today's immigration problem, and he 
defended harsh provisions of Proposition 187 such as kicking illegal immigrant 
children out of California schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I make no apology for putting California children first. Those children in 
the U.S. illegally deserve an education, but that education is due to them not 
from the government in Sacramento, or in Washington, but in the nation from 
which they came," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The federal government is foisting on us costs we cannot afford. It is wrong 
for Californians to have to pay those costs," Wilson said.

 Continuity or change. The old, post-World War II generation or the new Sixties

must choose whether to return conservative Chancellor Helmut Kohl to office for 
a fourth term or replace him with the younger Social Democrat, Rudolf 
Scharping.

 Kohl, 64 -- who aspires to become Germany's longest serving chancellor since 
the war -- has barnstormed the country with such optimism that he already has 
journalists asking if he plans to run again in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Scharping, meanwhile, seeks to be the Bill Clinton of Germany, a 46-year-old 
pragmatist leading his party back to power after 12 years in the back seat. 
Enough is enough, he says. It's time for a change. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kohl camp is betting that, no matter how much Germany's 60 million voters 
might worry and complain, ultimately they will opt for the status quo. "No 
German government ever has lost power in an election," said a confident senior 
government official. "Never has a challenger replaced an incumbent through an 
open election." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the latest polls give a slight advantage to Kohl's three-party 
coalition, made up of the Christian Democratic Union; its Bavarian sister 
party, the Christian Social Union; and the liberal Free Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are enough wild cards in the multi-party race that the weekly news 
magazine Der Spiegel has prepared five possible cover stories for its Monday 
edition. The weekly newspaper Die Woche still asks in a front-page headline if 
there will be "A Chancellor Change?" 
</P>
<P>
 The yearlong campaign has been an American-style competition of personalities 
over issues: The veteran statesman Kohl versus the bearded Scharping, who 
quotes Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Kohl stands for peace and stability, 
Scharping for jobs and social justice. 
</P>
<P>
 The business community clearly prefers Kohl. And despite the prevailing issue 
of "change," neither candidate has spoken of making any radical changes in 
Germany's existing economic or foreign policies, especially its relationship 
with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither man, though, will have the votes to govern alone, and Germany's small 
parties ultimately will determine who rules a coalition government. 
</P>
<P>
 With two ballots each to elect a Parliament, Germans vote for a deputy in 
their district and for a political party. The chancellor is then picked in 
Parliament by the largest party or the party that can control the most seats in 
alliance with others. 
</P>
<P>
 For decades, the kingmakers have been the Free Democrats. They helped bring 
the Social Democratic Chancellor Willy Brandt to power in 1969, and brought his 
party down again in 1982 when they switched sides to the Christian Democrats, 
putting Kohl in office. 
</P>
<P>
 The liberals have vowed to go with Kohl again, but they failed to win 
legislative seats in the last six state elections, raising questions about 
their viability in the federal vote. Can they scrape together the 5% minimum 
needed to win seats in Parliament? 
</P>
<P>
 Most recent polls say they can, and the government official, who asked not to 
be identified, insisted they would because "the liberals have always made it in 
the most important elections. . . . Germans are used to coalition governments." 
</P>
<P>
 If the liberals fail to make the cut, or if the two parties together fall 
short of a clear majority, Kohl could be forced into what is called a "grand 
coalition" with the Social Democrats. This option, last tried in the 1960s, is 
a last resort for both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one really wants it," said Sueddeutsche Zeitung's political reporter, 
Stephan Kornelius. "A grand coalition increases the extreme parties on the left 
and right. In the middle-term, it will harm both of the big parties." 
</P>
<P>
 The "extreme" vote is another uncertainty for Kohl, who ran a Cold War, 
anti-Communist campaign. Although the ultra-rightist Republikaner Party almost 
certainly will not make it into Parliament, the reformed Communist Party of 
East Germany, the Party of Democratic Socialism, has a shot with the leadership 
of its top candidate, Gregor Gysi, whom many consider to be Germany's most 
dynamic politician. 
</P>
<P>
 Polls show the PDS to have less than 5% support nationwide but strength in 
several eastern districts. Under a quirk in the election law, if they win three 
districts they could take up to 27 seats in the 656-seat Bundestag. 
</P>
<P>
 The Social Democrats sought to form a government with the ecological Greens 
Party, which is expected to win its way back into the Bundestag today after 
losing out in 1990. But the two parties alone are not likely to have enough 
votes, and a PDS victory could tip the scales in their favor. 
</P>
<P>
 During the campaign, Kohl hammered the Social Democrats for forming a state 
government in Saxony-Anhalt earlier this year with the support of the former 
Communists. His attacks forced Scharping to say he would not turn to the PDS to 
form a federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 But the mere idea that he would consider working with the PDS cost Scharping 
votes in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact in the East has not been as clear. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the East, the PDS has mayors and city councils. They are strongly 
organized and close to the people," said Sueddeutsche Zeitung's Kornelius. "A 
bashing of the PDS from the West is seen as bashing of the East." 
</P>
<P>
 About 20% of the country's electorate lives in the former East Germany. The 
most recent polls show they agree with their western countrymen that the 
nation's economy is on the upswing and are inclined to favor Kohl. But the 
polls just before Election Day also showed 15% of potential voters still unsure 
how they would cast their ballots.  
</P>
<P>
 The key may be in the question of change. At the beginning of the campaign 
season, more than half of all voters said they wanted a change in government. 
Now, according to the pollsters at the Allensbach Institute, only 46% say they 
do. And it takes more than that to oust Kohl. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a huge need for stability and predictability, not much desire for 
change," Kornelius said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it does come to a change of government," Berlin Free University historian 
Arnulf Baring told ZDF television, "it will be an accidental one. It would be 
only a few percentage points that shifted."

POET FROST'S PICTURE-POSTCARD TOWN LONGS FOR SOMNOLENT PAST; NEW HAMPSHIRE: 
DERRY IS ON THE ROPES, BATTERED BY A POPULATION EXPLOSION AND TAXPAYER 
REBELLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NIKI KAPSAMBELIS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some people just can't stand success. Sadly, this picture-postcard town is an 
example. 
</P>
<P>
 Home of poet Robert Frost and America's first man in space, Alan B. Shepard 
Jr., it once seemed that Derry had everything going for it. But today it has 
risen from its agrarian past to become what one cynical official calls "the 
duplex capital of New Hampshire." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, during the construction boom of the 1980s it became sorely overbuilt. 
New residents wanted schools for their children and they wanted them now. As a 
result, taxes went up. Then the taxpayers rebelled and the town is still trying 
to cope with that rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Shepard became a space hero 33 years ago and Derry started calling 
itself "Spacetown, U.S.A.," this picturesque countryside was ruled by dairy 
farms and the fact that Frost once lived here and taught at the high school. 
</P>
<P>
 But past glories largely are forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 The farms that marketed dairy products under the trade name of Hood are long 
since closed. The name is still evident in the Hood Commons mini-mall and the 
Hood Memorial Junior High School, which is overflowing with new students. 
</P>
<P>
 Across Route 28 from the farm where Frost lived, the setting of his poem 
"Mending Wall," is the Robert Frost Motor Inn and the Promises To Keep 
restaurant and function hall -- a line purloined from a Frost verse. 
</P>
<P>
 The house where Shepard grew up was auctioned off in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 But evidence of the 1980s construction craze is everywhere. Fast-food 
restaurants have sprouted alongside clapboard farmhouses, and housing 
developments have taken the place of dairy cows. 
</P>
<P>
 Derry, now the state's largest town and fourth-largest population center, is 
infused with condominium and apartment dwellers who commute south every morning 
down an interstate named for Shepard. More than 8,000 Derry residents commute 
30 minutes or more every day, and almost 6,800 commute out of state. 
</P>
<P>
 And everywhere there are those Derry duplexes -- some carefully landscaped, 
others boarded up and standing in lawns gone to seed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was growing like crazy," said Fred Tompkins, a town councilor and member 
of the Planning Board. "They came here in droves. . . . You could build 
apartments anyplace, and they proceeded to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 The duplexes house the young couples who represent one of Derry's most 
pressing problems: unremitting population growth. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, the town's population was 18,875. Today, it hovers around 31,000 and 
shows no sign of letting up. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1990, there have been 600 births among Derry families. As School Supt. 
David Brown says, that represents an entire school -- and yet, facing 
skyrocketing taxes, voters cut $2.4 million from the school district budget 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 A court-ordered revaluation cut the town's tax base by one-third in 1993, 
forcing a 64% hike in the tax rate. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980 the tax rate was $23.70 per $1,000 of property value. In 1990 it had 
risen to $25.20. Three years later it was $39.90. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the lost tax base was in business property and the condominiums, which 
dropped in value during the recession. The result was to shift more of the tax 
burden onto single-family homeowners, some of whom saw their bills jump 
thousands of dollars just weeks before taxes were due. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything went to hell in a handbasket," Tompkins said. "We've done too 
much, too fast." 
</P>
<P>
 This summer the Floyd School, a building nearly a century old, was closed to 
serve as storage for abandoned band instruments and athletic equipment. 
Elementary and middle-school children no longer will have music, art or sports 
programs. Students who used to attend Floyd will be squeezed into other 
schools, some of which already are exceeding capacity by hundreds of children. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the Floyd School closed once before, during the 1980s, because the 
town built a new school and didn't need all the classroom space. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe the issue here is simply that there is no more room at the inn in 
Derry," said David Jack, assistant schools superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to crack down on growth, the Planning Board has said it will not 
approve any new subdivisions, at least not until the town catches up. One 
developer already has sued to challenge the policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The police force has increased from 28 officers in 1980 to 47 in 1993. Without 
that increase, Police Chief Edward Garone said, "I think it would be like the 
Wild West around here." 
</P>
<P>
 The town's evolution has dizzied those who lived in Derry prior to the boom. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Bergeron, owner of Spacetown Auto Body, remembers when his garage faced a 
pasture. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was all cows," he said of the body shop he opened in 1961. "Every once 
in a while, they'd break the fence and come in here." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, he points to the houses around him that have been lost to taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeron, 57, has lived in Derry all his life. He comes from a different era. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew everybody," Bergeron said. But like other longtime residents, he's 
finding that's not true anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph Bonner, 77, remembers how traffic used to be tied up on Route 102 each 
day by Hood cows crossing the road to be milked. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, traffic jams in Derry no longer are caused by cows, but by the cars of 
so many newcomers traveling on a road system that never expanded to accommodate 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonner is president of the town's historical society, headquartered on the 
second floor of a downtown firehouse. He sorts through remnants of Derry's past 
-- photographs of Shepard in his spacesuit, rusting cowbells, a small press 
that embosses the seal of the Derry Grange. 
</P>
<P>
 A deliveryman walked in and asked him how to get to Brian Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonner, who has lived in Derry since 1950, was stumped. There are too many new 
streets in town. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, it's really a city," he said. "They should call it a city to keep people 
from moving in."

LEAVE U.S. WAYS BEHIND, KOREAN PARENTS WARN; ASIA: WHEN THEIR CHILDREN GO WEST 
TO STUDY, FAMILIES HOPE THEY WON'T RETURN CORRUPTED BY VICE AND DISRESPECT. ONE 
SUCH YOUTH IS ACCUSED OF KILLING HIS PARENTS FOR THEIR MONEY. WESTERNIZED 
YOUTHS ARE KNOWN AS THE ORANGE GENERATION, WHICH MAY BE A REFERENCE TO ORANGE 
COUNTY.

<P>
 When their children leave for U.S. colleges, South Korean parents hope America 
will not also teach them vice, gambling and disrespect for their elders that 
can even lead to murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Many South Koreans believe that is what happened to Park Han Sang, on trial 
for stabbing his parents to death and burning their bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 "America is not like Korea," Park said in a confession he later recanted. 
"There, gambling was unrestricted and temptation was everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Insular Korean society not only fears for the approximately 25,000 young 
people who go abroad each year, but is outraged by the intrusion of MTV and 
other American pop-culture influences. 
</P>
<P>
 A generation gap has developed: Westernized youth are known as the Orange 
Generation, which some believe is derived from Orange County, Calif., where 
many South Koreans go to study. 
</P>
<P>
 "The unchecked entry of foreign cultures has resulted in great confusion of 
mores in South Korea as the younger generation grows up accepting foreign 
ideals without questioning their value," said Paik Sang Chung of the Korea 
Social Pathology Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our society will face a great catastrophe unless the current social trend is 
reversed." 
</P>
<P>
 What disasters lie in wait? For many South Koreans, Park Han Sang has become a 
symbol of what can happen in America to a spoiled but harmless boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Park, a chubby 23-year-old, was sent to California to get a college education 
and learn English. After returning to Seoul, according to his confession, he 
stabbed his father, a wealthy herbalist, and his mother with a hunting knife, 
poured gasoline over the bodies and set them afire. The young man inflicted up 
to 90 stab wounds on his parents, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I stabbed my mother, she did not resist, but I had difficulty with my 
father," Park confessed to police shortly after the murders in May. 
</P>
<P>
 In a nationally televised news conference, Park said both the murders and the 
method were the fault of America. He killed his parents to inherit their wealth 
and pay $23,000 in gambling debts he had run up in California, using a method 
learned from an American movie, he said in the confession. 
</P>
<P>
 "The overseas life of . . . Park Han Sang is closely related to the direct 
motive of his alleged crime," said the Korea Times, an English-language daily. 
</P>
<P>
 Violent crime is uncommon in Korea, and crimes against parents are rare in a 
Confucian society that stresses reverence for elders. 
</P>
<P>
 Koreans were shocked by the brutality of the Park murders and by the evidence 
of careful planning. The case led them to question foreign influences and try 
to restrict cultural imports. 
</P>
<P>
 A national newspaper, Joong Ang Ilbo, published articles on the degenerate 
life of Korean students abroad. Newspapers and broadcasts castigated the 
foreign ways of Korean children reared, as they said, on hamburgers and 
Hollywood movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Retribution followed: 
</P>
<P>
 * "Beverly Hills 90210," a hit TV series about American high school students, 
was taken off the air because of fears by watchdog groups that the 
"unwholesome" content would corrupt South Korean youth. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Culture Ministry canceled a concert by All-4-One, an American rhythm and 
blues group. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Korean Broadcasting Commission, a semiofficial censorship panel, banned 
"The Crying Game" from television because it "violates public sensibilities and 
broadcast mores." The movie was allowed in theaters with an adults-only rating. 
</P>
<P>
 * The South Korean version of Penthouse magazine was classified as 
pornographic and the publisher's license revoked. Police confiscated copies of 
the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 * A racetrack and amusement park near Seoul barred men who wore earrings, had 
long hair or peppered their Korean with English words. Police in the southern 
part of the country arrested two women who wore T-shirts and bared their 
midriffs in public. 
</P>
<P>
 Chastity for single women and arranged marriages, both traditions in Korea, 
have been abandoned by the "Orange Generation." Another theory of the name's 
origin, scandalous to the older generation, is that a woman indicates her 
sexual desire for a man by giving him an orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Koreans attended sessions of the Park trial in August to see personally 
what evil America had wrought. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to see him for myself, see if he resembled a human," said a 
middle-age woman with a son of her own. "To kill your parents, how could you be 
human?"

RUSSIAN EMIGRE COMMUNITY ACCUSES NEW YORK POLICE OF HARASSMENT; CRIME: SOME IN 
BRIGHTON BEACH, DISPUTING CRIMINAL IMAGE, HAVE LAUNCHED A NEW MISSION TO 
COUNTERACT WHAT THEY SEE AS RISING DISCRIMINATION AGAINST NEWCOMERS FROM THE 
FORMER SOVIET UNION.

 For Michael Gotlibovsky and his family, the parking dispute should have been a 
shouting match at worst. But when Gotlibovsky's nephew started exchanging angry 
words with a man in red shorts and a T-shirt in a Brighton Beach parking lot, 
the man pulled out a police badge and a hip-pocket radio. 
</P>
<P>
 Within minutes, police flooded the area. Gotlibovsky, his son and his nephew 
were thrown to the ground, handcuffed and arrested for disorderly conduct, 
resisting arrest and obstructing justice. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can they do this?" asked Gotlibovsky as he stood in the battered hallway 
of Brooklyn's criminal court recently. The 54-year-old Ukrainian, who opened 
his shoe repair shop in Brighton Beach when he arrived 18 years ago, spent two 
days in court to have his record cleared. 
</P>
<P>
 After the charges were dismissed, Gotlibovsky said he planned to file an 
official complaint against the officers who arrested him. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident came after a similar fracas in early August that resulted in the 
arrest of five people, including a Russian-speaking man who has run an auto 
repair shop in Brighton Beach for more a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 The sum of these two incidents, plus a number of less dramatic ones, has left 
many longtime residents of this Russian emigre stronghold stunned and bitter 
about what they believe is unfair treatment by police and city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of problems now in Brighton Beach," said Felix Gotlibovsky, 
Michael's 30-year-old son, who was arrested with his father. "Because there are 
criminals coming here now from Russia, they think that all Russians are 
criminals." 
</P>
<P>
 With Russian crime becoming a hot topic in the media and a steadily increasing 
Russian emigre community, law-abiding Russians have begun to feel that 
America's welcome mat is unraveling. 
</P>
<P>
 A Russian accent -- like an Italian name in past eras -- seems to give people 
the instant label as "Mafia," several Russians said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now some prominent Russians have launched a new group whose mission is in part 
to oppose what they see as rising discrimination against emigres from the 
former Soviet Union. "We were not getting our phone calls to the city 
answered," said Valery Weinberg, chairman of the group, which calls itself the 
First North American-Russian Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The group started off with a protest early last month that included Soviet 
veterans wearing their World War II medals, much as they do at similar rallies 
in Moscow. The rally also brought out a few angry participants who were ready 
to chant "American police are KGB." Leaders persuaded the firebrands to carry 
less explosive placards: "We are for police but against police brutality." 
</P>
<P>
 The council showed another dimension of its growing clout when it hosted an 
opening, which featured violins, ice sculptures and speeches by a variety of 
cultural and political figures such as Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.). 
</P>
<P>
 The reception, which drew about 500 people, was held at the council's posh new 
headquarters, a well-appointed townhouse near Fifth Avenue that was once owned 
by Andrew Carnegie. The council will share the site with the Women's National 
Republican Club. Memberships run $3,000 for corporations and $1,500 for 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinberg, who is also publisher of the Russian-language newspaper Novoye 
Russkoye Slovo, said the Russians want to make it clear they are in the United 
States to stay, not just to tap into the country's economic largess and return 
home with their savings. When there are problems, he said, his group wants the 
city to respond quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Lou Carbonetti, director of community assistance in the mayor's office, said 
he has begun working with the First North American Russian Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to find out what is going on there and how to remedy this," 
Carbonetti said. "We are all concerned about proper treatment of them, and we 
will make sure we will help any way possible, as we would in any community." 
</P>
<P>
 Like many other immigrant groups coming to America, the more established 
emigres in the Russian-speaking community in Brooklyn and other areas around 
New York City are suffering in part from the problems brought by the newer 
ones. The Soviet Union has disintegrated, and with its demise the status of the 
Russian immigrant seems to have changed. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of being viewed as brave refugees from a brutal totalitarian 
system, the older immigrants have been supplanted by a newer wave with a far 
less savory reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials, federal authorities and the media have begun to focus on the 
sudden appearance of violent Russian mobsters here with connections to gangs in 
the former Soviet states. FBI Director Louis J. Freeh went to Russia earlier 
this year to help set up an FBI office in Moscow and start a working 
relationship with Russian police to catch mobsters moving over the borders into 
Europe and to the United States. At the same time, the FBI office in New York 
has set up a Russian crime unit with 10 to 20 members, some of them Russian 
speakers. The FBI says it is working on about 40 cases involving Russians here. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kinds of criminals who are coming here now are directly related to the 
economic chaos after the end of communism," said Stephen Handelman, author of a 
new book, "Comrade Criminal: The Theft of the Second Russian Revolution." "This 
new wave includes people who are members of the classic Soviet underworld as 
well as people who are heavily involved in white-collar crime and the drug 
syndicates. Now, they are free to travel." 
</P>
<P>
 One Russian emigre, who asked to remain anonymous, said Russian criminals are 
often more of a problem for fellow Russians than for Americans. He cited the 
case of a friend who set up business, paid his taxes and felt the "pleasure" of 
being "perfectly legal." Then one day last year, a Russian gangster demanded a 
monthly cut. Either the businessman paid or he "must worry about his family 
back home in Russia," the mobster warned. The businessman closed down. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want them, these Russians. But are we the ones who let them into the 
country?" asked Boris Smirnov, Gotlibovsky's nephew, a 33-year-old taxi driver 
who arrived 18 years ago and was arrested with the Gotlibovskys Aug. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 There are by rough estimate 300,000 to 350,000 legal emigres from the former 
Soviet Union in the greater New York area and perhaps another 150,000 who came 
on student or tourist visas and have remained here illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are good people and bad people, and you cannot judge a whole community 
by a few people," Weinberg said. "Yes, there are criminal elements here, but I 
guarantee you that this is not the Cosa Nostra."

 In the middle of a dirt road lined by leafy trees, a father holds a little 
barelegged girl in a gingham dress. She has an arm around his neck, a hand in 
his hand. Her face is serene. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the end of a perfect summer day. She went swimming in the lake in her 
red bathing suit. Later, she fed the chickens. The fields, she remembers, were 
yellow with buttercups, and the musty smell of mushrooms lingered in the air 
from the rain the day before. 
</P>
<P>
 The father's face is unsmiling, but not especially grim. He looks proud of his 
4-year-old daughter. Does he have any premonition of how their world is about 
to be utterly destroyed? 
</P>
<P>
 "From the fields of buttercups suddenly to darkness," Yaffa Sonenson Eliach, 
57, said quietly as she looked at the black-and-white photograph of her father 
holding her, among other childhood pictures scattered on her coffee table. 
</P>
<P>
 The photo was taken 53 years ago -- on June 21, 1941 -- by her grandmother, a 
local photographer. It was taken just before the family left their summer house 
in what was then Poland, and now Lithuania, to return to their nearby home in 
the Polish shtetl of Ejszyszki (Ay-shish'-key). 
</P>
<P>
 That day her family learned of the impending arrival of German tanks. For this 
Jewish child, it was the last summer day for the rest of the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months later, in September, the Nazis massacred all but 500 of the town 
and surrounding area's 4,000 Jews, including her grandmother. Eliach, her 
mother, father and two brothers survived -- although two of them, as well as a 
newborn baby brother, were to be killed during the next several years of 
atrocities. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 500 who escaped the massacre, only 29 survived the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Eliach is a grandmother whose dignity and scholarship inspire deep 
respect and whose sweetness makes her a delightful companion for a cup of tea. 
But her early childhood is always with her. 
</P>
<P>
 Remembering is painful. But Eliach, a Brooklyn College professor who teaches 
and writes about the Holocaust, goes on. Her life's work is pressing; it is to 
give back to the victims of the Holocaust their humanity and, she says, to show 
"the enormity of the life that was lost." 
</P>
<P>
 And for Eliach, that has often meant making her private loss public. 
</P>
<P>
 The picture on her coffee table is part of Eliach's collection of more than 
1,500 photographs of Ejszyszki and its inhabitants that is exhibited at the 
Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, which opened last year. The Tower of 
Faces, as it is called, brings the shtetl vividly to life. There are pictures 
of bar mitzvahs, graduations and weddings, and snapshots of everyday life. 
</P>
<P>
 Eliach wanted the exhibit to re-create the feeling she had when she returned 
to Ejszyszki in 1987 and visited the grave site where women and children had 
been shot and buried. The faces and voices she had known as a child, she 
recalled, surrounded her and almost pulled her away with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Eliach is nearing completion of a 1,000-page history of the shtetl. Her family 
was among its original settlers in 1073 and played a prominent role in its 
history. Ejszyszki is the town's Polish spelling; the Jews spelled it Eishyshok 
(A'-shi-shok). 
</P>
<P>
 The Sonensons were prosperous and educated. They were modern Jews with secular 
educations but religiously very observant. Their house faced onto the center of 
the marketplace, where the town's well-to-do inhabitants lived. Eliach's father 
owned a leather tannery and candle factory, as well as forest and farmland that 
produced honey, mushrooms and silver fox fur. 
</P>
<P>
 The shtetl had no running water but was far from an illiterate backwater, 
Eliach says. Scholarship was highly valued. Families had close contact with the 
United States through relatives. Ed Asner and Lauren Bacall's families came 
from Ejszyszki. 
</P>
<P>
 The end came three months after the Germans arrived. On Sept. 21, 1941, the 
eve of the Jewish New Year, Jews were allowed to attend Rosh Hashana services. 
But Eliach's father was suspicious. He felt it was a ploy to assemble the Jews, 
and suggested the family run away. His wife refused. 
</P>
<P>
 They dressed for services. Yaffa was helped into the powder-blue velvet dress 
with lace collar that she was to wear for the rest of the war. Her parents and 
baby brother, Hayyim, went to synagogue. At the last minute, Yaffa was sent to 
her nanny's house and her 8-year-old brother, Yitzhak, was left with another 
Christian family. 
</P>
<P>
 Frightened and bewildered, Yaffa hid behind the curtains and watched Germans 
loot Jewish homes and pile the stolen goods onto wagons. On top of one cart, 
she saw her own dolls and one of her mother's lamps. 
</P>
<P>
 Nazi killing squads had entered the town and were rounding up the Jews in the 
three synagogues. From there, they were taken to the horse market outside the 
town. The men were led to the old Jewish cemetery, where they were ordered to 
undress, stand at the edge of an open pit and then shot by Lithuanian guards. 
The women and children were shot near the Christian cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 Eliach and her immediate family escaped death, as they repeatedly did during 
the war, she says, because of her father's "sense of somehow always predicting 
the most difficult and most horrible situations." 
</P>
<P>
 He escaped from the synagogue by jumping out a window. Then he persuaded a 
Polish friend to go to the horse market and bribe a Lithuanian guard into 
releasing Mrs. Sonenson and their baby boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, he sent a shepherd to bring Yaffa and her older brother to a 
riverbank where he was waiting. There, for the first time, the little girl saw 
people who had been killed. She remembers wondering why they were sleeping. 
</P>
<P>
 The family eventually was reunited in the Jewish ghetto in Radun. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember the cold," Eliach says. "I remember people being shot. I remember 
the red blood against the white snow. I remember the gallows very well, and the 
hanging bodies. I remember even learning to tell time. At noontime there, you 
had no shadows in the gallows." 
</P>
<P>
 On May 10, 1942, the Germans surrounded the ghetto. They had been ordered to 
liquidate it. Yaffa's father instructed his wife and children to run and hide 
in the carriage house. 
</P>
<P>
 There, in the loft, 16 other Jews, all adults, were already hiding. They 
wanted no children who could easily betray them. Sonenson pleaded, saying the 
baby had been drugged with boiled poppy seeds. 
</P>
<P>
 But when two Germans armed with guns decorated with party streamers entered, 
16 pairs of hands covered the baby's mouth and suffocated him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was sure that I was going to be next," Eliach says. 
</P>
<P>
 The family found refuge on the farm of a Christian family. They spent most of 
the rest of the war in a cave-like shelter under the pigsty, emerging only to 
cook and wash in the farmer's kitchen. Her mother gave birth to a baby boy, 
named Hayyim after her dead son. He was left in a basket outside the home of a 
kind villager. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberation came on July 13, 1944. Yaffa and her family, Hayyim with them, 
returned to Ejszyszki. They moved into her grandmother's house. It seemed like 
summer again. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Oct. 20, 1944, Polish partisans, looking to kill any surviving Jews, 
burst into the Sonensons' home. The family was hiding in a small attic closet 
but a scratch on the polished floor -- from a dresser the father had moved to 
hide the attic door -- gave away their whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother was asking them to kill her first so she would not witness the 
death of her second child," Eliach says. "But they shot the baby first and then 
they shot my mother." 
</P>
<P>
 She counted the bullets: nine for her brother, 15 for her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, no Jews live in Ejszyszki. 
</P>
<P>
 In the following months, Yaffa's father was arrested by the Soviet KGB and was 
exiled to Siberia. Yaffa went to Palestine with her uncle. Her brother stayed 
behind, hoping for their father's release. 
</P>
<P>
 Before they were separated, the children, now ages 8 and 12, each selected 
about a dozen family pictures to take with them. In the bottom of one of her 
shoes, Yaffa placed the black-and-white image of her father holding her on that 
last sunlit day. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1979, Eliach visited former death camps in Europe as a member of President 
Jimmy Carter's Commission on the Holocaust. She was horrified to find that the 
victims were portrayed from the perspective of their executioners; photographs 
showed them as emaciated creatures -- dead or near death -- with bulging eyes 
and skeletal bodies. It was impossible to identify with them, she said, as 
someone's mother or father, sister or brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Eliach vowed to try and return to the Holocaust victims the beauty and grace 
of their lives. She decided to re-create Ejszyszki by assembling the 
photographs of its people and the words that they had written. 
</P>
<P>
 She began with the few photos she and her brother, who now lives in Israel, 
had taken with them three decades ago. Over the next 15 years, she traveled to 
six continents and all 50 American states in an exhausting search for pictures, 
diaries and letters. She spent more than $600,000, taking out loans against her 
life insurance policy and later with funding from a Guggenheim fellowship. 
</P>
<P>
 Eliach turned detective. Her search led her to knock on all 42 doors of an 
apartment building in Jerusalem. She hired security guards to accompany her to 
a rough section of Detroit to visit a Baptist church that had once been a 
synagogue. There, she found a fountain of material from Ejszyszki. 
</P>
<P>
 In Australia, she looked for the descendants of a family whose last name she 
did not know. Her only clue was that they had been known in the shtetl by the 
nickname "The Mice." She mentioned this while on a Melbourne radio station. A 
listener called in with a tip that led her to the family. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ben Shemen, Israel, Eliach found a treasure-trove of letters and 
photographs buried in cans under a palm tree. 
</P>
<P>
 Luck also played a big role in her search. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman in Boston, Rosalind Rosenblatt, recognized a family name, 
Mikolovsky, in Eliach's book "Hasidic Tales of the Holocaust," and contacted 
Eliach for more information. It turned out she had a photo album of 70 
snapshots she had taken as a college graduate in the 1930s with a small $5 
Brownie camera while visiting her grandmother in Ejszyszki. 
</P>
<P>
 Her task also required huge amounts of patience and empathy to convince 
families to part with their photographs -- often their only tangible link with 
a past destroyed -- so she could reproduce them. Many families came to look on 
her as a kind of guardian angel. She arranged for their leaking roofs to be 
fixed. She sent medication from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, the quest for photographs required cash and goods. One photograph 
of market day in the shtetl set her back a VCR, a color TV, a radio, sneakers 
and a jogging suit. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Eliach says she has collected over 8,000 photographs; 6,000 are of 
people who once lived in Ejszyszki. She says the Tower of Faces has pictures of 
92% of the shtetl population killed in the Holocaust. And the collection is 
always growing. Almost every day she receives letters from Ejszyszki 
descendants who have visited the museum. 
</P>
<P>
 When, at last, she found herself alone in the tower at the opening ceremony 
for the Holocaust Museum, Eliach says she felt herself surrounded by the faces 
of Ejszyszki as she had been at their grave site when she returned to the town 
in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, an Ejszyszki survivor came up to her and said, "I don't want to go back 
to New York. I want to stay here. It is home."

 He salutes as cars approach, bows from the waist, then clasps his hands 
together pleadingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the drivers pass on, but some slow down and drop a few bills onto the 
potholed road for 9-year-old Han to scoop up. 
</P>
<P>
 Han is one of half a dozen children who work a stretch of highway 35 miles 
south of Phnom Penh. The children say that they only come out when they aren't 
needed in the rice paddies, and that they make the equivalent of 40 to 60 cents 
each on an average day. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Culnane, manager of a street-children project run by World Vision 
international of Monrovia, Calif., says begging has increased during his two 
years in Cambodia. He estimates Phnom Penh has 7,000 street children who 
survive by "stealing, begging and digging through rubbish." 
</P>
<P>
 Cambodia, one of the world's poorest countries, was devastated by more than 
two decades of war. Its recovery has been slowed by the hit-and-run tactics of 
Khmer Rouge guerrillas, who have scared off foreign investors and tourists.

S. PACIFIC ISLAND HARBORS EGALITARIAN SOCIETY, ANTHROPOLOGIST SAYS; RESEARCH: 
MARIA LEPOWSKY DESCRIBES VANATINAI, BETWEEN NEW GUINEA AND AUSTRALIA, IN HER 
BOOK, 'FRUIT OF THE MOTHERLAND.' 'WOMEN ARE CONSIDERED THE LIFE-GIVERS AND MEN 
ARE THE DEATH-GIVERS, AND LIFE IS MORE IMPORTANT,' SHE SAYS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Maria Lepowsky, anthropologist, set out to find her very own island. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was also interested in a place that essentially was egalitarian, but how do 
you know if you haven't been there? Every coral rock in the Pacific Ocean has 
had an anthropologist on it," she said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Lepowsky spent hours in libraries searching and found her island, Vanatinai, 
between New Guinea and Australia, where men and women lived side by side in an 
almost egalitarian society. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was an absence of male superiority. The only edge was polygamy, but 
that was rarely practiced," she wrote in "Fruit of the Motherland," published 
by Columbia University Press. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a society where gender almost did not exist, which interested her most. 
But, as often as not, the most powerful person in one of the many tiny hamlets 
that dot the 500-square-mile island was a middle-aged woman. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an unusual world. 
</P>
<P>
 Snakes were sacred; sorcery was practiced. A few natives ran into the woods 
when they saw Lepowsky because of the belief that their spirits turned white 
and went to America when they died. Some would brush her skin to see if her 
pale color would rub off. Most just stood around and murmured to each other 
when she arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 She was 27 in 1977 when she first went to Vanatinai, a small remote island of 
2,000 just southeast of New Guinea. On maps it is called Sudest, but the 
islanders' name translates to Motherland. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the largest island of the Louisiade Archipelago, the chain of islands 
that separates the Solomon Sea from the Coral Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Lepowsky, now 43, stayed a few years and went back for two months in 1981 and 
three months in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 She was surprised to find oldtimers who remembered the battle of the Coral Sea 
that raged above their heads in 1942 and teen-agers wearing T-shirts with 
pictures of Bruce Lee or Muhammad Ali, and one man with a shirt that said, 
"Hobie surfboards, Newport Beach, Calif." 
</P>
<P>
 She suffered bouts of malaria, pneumonia and a dental abscess. The nearest 
telephone was 200 miles away and the closest two-way radio 17 miles away. She 
was taken by canoe to a Catholic mission on a nearby island where she was 
injected with anti-malarial drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Lepowsky became attached to many of the people and is planning to return 
during her sabbatical this year from the University of Wisconsin, where she is 
an associate professor of anthropology. 
</P>
<P>
 When she first arrived, few people spoke English and her first chore was to 
learn the language. It was not easy. She was the first outsider to master one 
of the nine or more dialects, which are largely mutually intelligible. The 
language is similar to Polynesian and Indonesian. She could speak one dialect, 
but only understand the others. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the history of the island was primarily an oral one, although 
Lepowsky did find writings from sea captains and other Europeans who sold 
tobacco to extract gold on the island. 
</P>
<P>
 Islanders still pan for gold today, but a mother lode was never found. The 
islanders also differed physically before any foreign influences arrived to 
contaminate them. 
</P>
<P>
 The first Europeans to set foot on the island 140 years ago reported the 
people ranged from very dark-skinned people less than 5 feet in height to 
taller, brown-skinned individuals with long, wavy hair. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a matrilineal society, where men and women perform nearly the same 
tasks. Vanatinai people say the central position of women is taubwaragha, which 
means both "ancient" and "the way of the ancestors." 
</P>
<P>
 While men are in general sorcerers, women are counter-sorcerers. "Women are 
considered the life-givers and men are the death-givers," Lepowsky said, "and 
life is more important." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the islanders believe that all deaths are caused by sorcery. 
</P>
<P>
 Women primarily control the bulk of the wealth of the island, which are the 
yam gardens, and are responsible for the elaborate mortuary feasts. At least 
one woman must stay in total mourning for one year, covering herself in ashes 
and living in nearly total seclusion. It is an honor to be the hostess of the 
feast. 
</P>
<P>
 Lepowsky continued to be amazed at some of the folklore of the island. When 
she returned the second time she was asked by a close friend if she would 
someday die. She suggested the friend prick her skin to see if she bled, the 
same as they did. Still, the notion of her comparative immortality was one she 
never completely overcame. 
</P>
<P>
 The average life expectancy in New Guinea is 48 and Lepowsky assumes it is the 
same on her island. Childbirth, malaria, respiratory disease and pneumonia are 
the most frequent killers. It is a polygamous society, but more often 
relationships remain monogamous. Lepowsky said that one man informed his wife 
he was bringing home a second wife and she announced she was leaving. He 
changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 The delicacy of the island -- the one item the young anthropologist could not 
bring herself to eat -- was a sago grub, a large maggot that islanders pluck 
from trees and eat raw and wiggly. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are delicious fried, but that was as far as I could go," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, AIDS has not hit the island, although there are some isolated cases in 
nearby New Guinea. Given the joyful participation in premarital sex that 
exists, AIDS could devastate the population. 
</P>
<P>
 The island is far more gentle today than it was in times past. In 1910, a 
notorious individual who beat the islanders and stole from them was finally 
slain by the warriors and he was cannibalized. He was boiled and his brains 
were served to the victors. 
</P>
<P>
 The island, first British, then Australian, gained independence in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 Lepowsky is working on a second book about the natives' encounters with 
Europeans, Australians and Americans. They seem to have liked the Americans the 
most because the GIs handed out bed sheets, cigarettes and food. 
</P>
<P>
 The military was not actually on Vanatinai, but on nearby larger islands 
during World War II. Some of the young men of Sudest were conscripted and were 
surprised that some of the GIs were black men. It was the first time they had 
seen a black foreigner. 
</P>
<P>
 The people smoke, but rarely drink. Occasionally beer is brought back from New 
Guinea, but because everything is communal, it does not last long. The people 
are fascinated with America and well-versed in the trips to the moon. They 
believe the landings caused a recent eclipse. 
</P>
<P>
 Who knows? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe a civilization that has survived pirate attacks, aerial battles and 
constant disease has a wisdom beyond that found in books.

SKINHEAD ATTACK FAKED, GERMAN PROSECUTORS SAY

<P>
 German prosecutors said Friday that a woman who said she had been thrown out 
of a streetcar by skinheads after trying to protect an elderly woman had lied. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, whose tale stunned Germany and prompted police to put up a $13,000 
reward for help in finding the skinheads, lied about the attack because she 
wanted free medical treatment, the prosecutor's office in Potsdam said.

<P>
 Since it opened in June, 1993, PhillyPAWS has served 76 clients on its 
shoestring budget. These days, the group serves about 60. 
</P>
<P>
 "Friends and co-workers often stop visiting these people. The animal becomes 
their entire world, sometimes even giving them a reason to live," said David 
Hellman, president and co-founder of PhillyPAWS. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is a nonprofit agency modeled after organizations in San Francisco, 
New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. In all, 17 major cities have similar 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Health Department reported 1,940 new AIDS cases in 1993, raising the 
total number diagnosed since the epidemic began in 1981 to more than 5,700. 
Nationwide, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has 
estimated that about 1 million Americans are infected with HIV, the virus that 
causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have both had lots of personal losses," said Sue Dakin, another co-founder 
who functions as the client coordinator. Like Hellman, she often volunteers 25 
or more hours each week to PhillyPAWS. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we found a niche. This is something we can do in honor of the friends 
we lost." 
</P>
<P>
 In early September, Hellman and Dakin stopped by to visit Daryl Belgrave, one 
of their first clients and the owner of a 1-year-old black and white cat, Miss 
Cutie, Scutie for short. 
</P>
<P>
 Belgrave and her husband, also HIV positive, appeared to be doing well. But 
they could not carry 20-pound bags of cat food and litter, so PhillyPAWS 
volunteers came by once a month to deliver. 
</P>
<P>
 Scutie was also receiving all her veterinary care through PhillyPAWS. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess we'll be needing them a little more and more," Belgrave said, walking 
gingerly across the room to retrieve her feline friend. "It's such a comfort to 
know they'll be there for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Scutie playfully pranced out of reach, her white-tipped black tail swaying 
back and forth. Belgrave laughed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I call that her periscope," she said. "Sometimes when I'm not feeling too 
well and I'm stuck in bed, I'll look over and just see that tail going by and I 
know she's checking on me." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what we'd do without PhillyPAWS," she said. "God bless them. It 
takes a special kind of people to do what they're doing; it truly does." 
</P>
<P>
 The two founders of PhillyPAWS shared a look, both smiling proudly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything I can ever do for you -- you let me know," said Belgrave. 
</P>
<P>
 Dakin, seeing the joy she has helped create, responded tearfully: "You're 
doing it right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Ten days later, Daryl Belgrave died of AIDS complications. 
</P>
<P>
 Neal Belanger is one of 120 volunteers trained this year by PhillyPAWS. 
Three-hour orientation sessions are held about every 10 weeks; new volunteers 
are always welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Three times a week, Belanger walks Rouge and Shredder, a Doberman and a 
Shepherd-mix. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are big, friendly dogs," said Belanger, who, like many others, first 
began volunteering after he lost a close friend to AIDS. "I have fallen in love 
with these animals. Taking care of them really makes me feel good about 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Providing veterinary care for animals like Rouge, Shredder and Scutie is a top 
priority for PhillyPAWS. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Robert Moffatt is the only veterinarian on staff. Most of the time he 
volunteers is spent fielding phone calls from clients seeking his advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a certain ability I can offer and I have a strong desire to help 
people," Moffatt said. "This way I help people and animals at the same time. 
It's a bonus, and I'm glad to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Moffatt's association with the Veterinary Medicine School of the University of 
Pennsylvania is also a bonus. Through him, more than 40 veterinary students 
have donated their time to making house calls, providing rabies vaccinations 
and other non-emergency care.

WRITER USES HUMOR TO SPICE UP HIS WHODUNITS; BOOKS: AUTHOR DONALD WESTLAKE ONE 
DAY FOUND HIS WORK WAS 'COMING OUT FUNNY.' HIS LATEST IS SET IN THE NEW COUNTRY 
MUSIC MECCA, BRANSON, MO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mystery writer Donald E. Westlake, master of the comic caper, thinks of 
himself as a realist. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm one of the very few realists in fiction writing," Westlake said. 
"Everybody else is romantic. If my people are going to rob a bank, there's no 
place to park in front. They have to park three blocks away and walk back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parking conveniently in front of the bank is romantic. My people are 
wire-crossed as opposed to star-crossed. They're not inept. They're just 
unlucky." 
</P>
<P>
 The 61-year-old author of 70 books said he was surprised to be voted a grand 
master by the Mystery Writers of America in 1993. It's an honor for lifetime 
achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Partly, I didn't feel I was old enough," he said. "And I felt I was an 
antibody in the corpus of the mystery field. I'm the smart-aleck. The class 
cutup as valedictorian? It doesn't seem right." 
</P>
<P>
 But Westlake doesn't apologize for spicing his writing with humor. "I think 
the first thing humor does in any genre is to put some tang into the 
conventions," he said. "You're getting some jalapeno peppers into the ordinary 
mix. It can also help characterization. And if what you're writing is a 
whodunit, humor is a very good way to distract the reader." 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake's latest, "Baby, Would I Lie?" released in September by Mysterious 
Press, is set in Branson, Mo., famous for its strip of country music theaters. 
Westlake's wife, author Abigail Adams, calls Branson "an irony-free zone." 
</P>
<P>
 "To fill it with a lot of cynical reporters seemed to me to be a good idea," 
Westlake said. 
</P>
<P>
 The book pokes fun at supermarket tabloid journalism and Branson itself. 
Westlake doesn't think he'll be invited to do a book-signing in Branson. "Of 
course, there's no bookstore," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the story, country singer-songwriter Ray Jones is accused of murdering a 
female cashier in his Branson theater. "I like the character of Ray Jones," 
Westlake said. "He's the opposite of the corporate mentality. Secretly and 
quietly, he's going to work it out himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake also wrote song lyrics for Jones. "I couldn't do a book in which the 
central character was a singer-songwriter and not present songs. While I was 
writing the book, from time to time I'd write another one. A couple of them 
finally actually had something to do with the story line." 
</P>
<P>
 A Nashville composer has set to music "Baby, Would I Lie?" and "If It Ain't 
Fried, It Ain't Food." 
</P>
<P>
 When he was looking for a book title, Westlake thought a country song title 
would be good. "I woke up one morning with 'Baby, Would I Lie?' I realized it 
was a country-Western version of 'Trust Me on This,' an earlier book about the 
same people." It's the first time in years Westlake has used the same 
characters in a second book.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather shoot them than use them in a third book," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 'Trust Me on This,' Sara and Jack work for the Weekly Galaxy. At the end 
of that book, they blackmail their way into working for Trend magazine. That 
book came about because I met an editor who'd worked for the National Enquirer 
who told me stories about that life. I thought it would be really interesting 
to place a murder mystery among people with that short an attention span." 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake, born in New York and reared in Albany, has been writing since 
childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 When he started professionally, he said, "I was writing sensitive slices of 
life, science fiction and Westerns. The first story of mine ever published was 
science fiction. The second was a romantic comedy. After a while, it was 
mystery stories that were getting published. The more they published them, the 
more I wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did five whodunits under my own name. As Richard Stark I was doing 
paperback originals, tough, hard-boiled crime novels." 
</P>
<P>
 Then humor crept into Westlake's writing, starting with his sixth whodunit, 
"The Fugitive Pigeon" in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't supposed to be funny," he said. "I started to do it and I couldn't 
do the mystery conventions straight all of a sudden. I called my agent. 'The 
new book is coming out funny.' He said, 'Don't do that. You'll never get a 
paperback or foreign sale. You can't translate comedy. You're going to cut your 
income in two.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'It's coming along pretty fast. I'll just do this once and get it out 
of my system and I'll go back and do it the right way next time.' 
</P>
<P>
 "It sold twice as many as my previous books and has been published as a 
paperback five or six times over the years. It has been translated into 10 
languages." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Westlake got another idea for an antic caper. "A mob courier died and his 
wife buried him in his traveling suit, in the seams of which are several 
hundred thousand dollars worth of cocaine. A gangster is sent to dig him up and 
the coffin is empty. That was 'The Busy Body.' I was launched and I never 
looked back." 
</P>
<P>
 But two of his recent books have been serious. "Kahawa," Swahili for coffee, 
is an adventure. "Humans" features an angel sent to Earth to arrange the end of 
the human race. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake's approach to humor has changed through the years. "I think when I 
was first doing it, I wasn't entirely sure of what I was doing or that it was 
workable," he said. "Occasionally, there is a scene merely to be funny. After a 
while, I began to trust more the idea that being funny is having an attitude 
and humor is inside the characters. They're never telling us jokes or being 
funny. They are deadly earnest, trying to accomplish something. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stuff that passes for comedy in sitcoms on TV grates on me because it is all 
people trying to find funny remarks. It's just punctuation that goes before the 
laugh track."

WHAT'S GOOD FOR THE GOOSE: A FRIENDLY MISSOURI FARMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Vivion Williams walks over his farm fields, Jasper walks over the fields. 
When Williams walks around his yard, Jasper walks around the yard.When Williams 
goes to the gas station, Jasper does too -- flying behind Williams' pickup. 
</P>
<P>
 Jasper seems to have forgotten that he is a Canada goose. Or is it she? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not right sure whether it's goose or gander," said Williams, who loves 
birds and keeps a small flock of white geese. "I just called him Jasper because 
I thought it was a good name for him." 
</P>
<P>
 A pair of Canada geese stopped at Williams' northwest Missouri farm a couple 
of months ago for a brief rest. A few days later, one was back, and it began 
shadowing Williams and talking to his dog, Lady, in dulcet goose tones. 
</P>
<P>
 When the 78-year-old farmer takes a run to the gas station, Jasper takes wing 
-- flying just over the top, rear or to one side of Williams' pickup. When the 
truck stops, Jasper lands. 
</P>
<P>
 Just to play a trick, Williams once sneaked into his truck and took off. 
Jasper became agitated, honked three times, then took off, flying in widening 
circles around the farmhouse like an enraged model airplane. Finally, he 
spotted the truck. All was well. He landed. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams knows that one day this goose fascination with man and dog will end 
and Jasper will likely fly South with others of his kind. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's free to go at all times," he said. "I never make any effort to cage him 
or pen him or anything. But he's a lot tamer than the domestic geese I have. 
I'll miss him when he goes."

STRUGGLE KEEPS DOOR SHUT AT 30,000 FEET

 An American Airlines jet flying from Dallas to Tokyo landed here after a 
passenger tried to open one of the plane's doors. 
</P>
<P>
 Flight 61 was more than 30,000 feet above Jackson Hole, Wyo., Thursday when a 
man identified as Steven Low tried to force a door open.The flight crew subdued 
him and turned him over the authorities when the plane landed, said Dick 
Thurston, an FBI spokesman in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about a motive, Thurston said, "I think it's safe to say that his 
behavior was probably erratic." 
</P>
<P>
 Low would have needed to know a numerical code to actually open the door of 
the MD-11, American officials told KING-TV. Even then, the difference in air 
pressure between interior and exterior would have kept the door from opening, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The jet was carrying 167 passengers and 19 crew members, the television 
station reported.

AIDS CLAIMS 3RD HEMOPHILIAC BROTHER; MEDICINE: THEY ARE THOUGHT TO HAVE 
CONTRACTED THE VIRUS FROM INFECTED BLOOD PRODUCTS. A FOURTH SON KILLED HIMSELF 
BECAUSE OF PAIN FROM HEMOPHILIA, MOTHER SAYS. FIFTH SON AND THREE DAUGHTERS ARE 
NOT HEMOPHILIACS.

 Near the end, Les Gimmer couldn't bring himself to visit his youngest brother, 
to see him dying of AIDS back in 1990 -- for Les knew that's where he would be 
one day. 
</P>
<P>
 That day came Sept. 23. Les died on the eve of his 40th birthday -- the third 
of four hemophiliac brothers to die of AIDS. The fourth brother committed 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Their mother, Jeanette Gimmer, called Les' death a relief. "That's a terrible 
thing to say, but hopefully this is over now for a while," she said before the 
memorial service in this town of 650. 
</P>
<P>
 Her fifth son and her three daughters are not hemophiliacs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gimmer brothers are thought to have contracted the AIDS virus from 
infected blood products for hemophiliacs in the early 1980s, before screening 
and treatment of blood for the virus became routine. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Donnie Gimmer became the first brother to die of AIDS, succumbing at 
age 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Les and his brother Scott were diagnosed with the AIDS virus on the same day 
in 1985. Scott, to whom Les was particularly close, died a year ago at age 40. 
Their ashes were buried together in a private ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Charlie, Gimmer said pain in his joints -- a common problem for 
hemophiliacs -- and other problems became too much for him to bear. He killed 
himself in 1981 at age 33. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Ken Stuber, who officiated at services for Scott and Les, said he had 
never been close to anyone with AIDS before he came to First Presbyterian 
Church in Kasota 1 1/2 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Les, an aide who worked at a hospital with the mentally ill and retarded, had 
been looking for a church where he would feel comfortable. The two men were the 
same age and shared musical tastes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said to him, 'I don't care how you got AIDS, I just think it's not fair,' " 
Stuber said. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Les' health deteriorated, they would go to movies together or for walks 
at the Mankato State University campus that Les had attended. 
</P>
<P>
 "Les and I put a sermon together a few months after I moved here," Stuber 
said. "I was comparing AIDS to leprosy back in Jesus' day . . . and Les helped 
me with the AIDS part." 
</P>
<P>
 Stuber was on his own after the memorial service, trying to find words to 
comfort Les' friends and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 He played a song, sung by another man who died of AIDS, that Les had listened 
to often during his illness. Stuber then quoted a few lines from the song, 
"Bohemian Rhapsody," sung by Freddie Mercury of the group Queen: 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too late, the time has come, sends shivers down my spine. Body aching 
all the time, I don't want to die." 
</P>
<P>
 For a family that has lived with death and dying for nearly 15 years, it 
wasn't until then that tears flowed unchecked in the tiny, packed church.

PUFFINS, CUTE AS THEIR NAME, ARE NO LONGER ENDANGERED IN MAINE; PRESERVATION: 
RESTORATION EFFORT HAS BROUGHT THE SEA BIRDS BACK -- AND BIRD WATCHERS ALONG 
WITH THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Atlantic Puffins casually mill about this rocky island, looking like 
clowns in tuxedos too content to notice the dozens of tourists who have boated 
out to see them. 
</P>
<P>
 But life hasn't always been easy for these quirky birds -- sometimes called 
sea parrots -- on the islands off the coast of Maine. 
</P>
<P>
 Maine's puffins were nearly wiped out by hunters a century ago. But they're 
returning in record numbers, thanks to an innovative restoration effort by the 
National Audubon Society. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message is that it is possible for people to actively encourage a species 
to establish a colony. People can restore it as well as decimate it," said Dr. 
Steven Kress, director of the society's Puffin Project. 
</P>
<P>
 Kress and his team of researchers launched the recolonization project in 1973, 
transplanting puffin chicks from Newfoundland, where they are plentiful, to 
man-made burrows on Eastern Egg Rock, a desolate island in Muscongus Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it might work if we moved some of them and got them to learn a new 
home. They could take care of themselves after we finished rearing them," Kress 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 950 chicks were transplanted to Maine's islands by 1989, including 
Seal Island, a stark 100-acre site once used for target practice by warplanes 
and warships during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 In a further attempt to lure puffins to the islands -- the most southern 
colony for Atlantic Puffins -- decoys perch atop granite rocks and mating calls 
waft from solar-powered CD players. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're testing the power of social attraction," Kress said. 
</P>
<P>
 It appears to be working. 
</P>
<P>
 This year the puffins, which look like a cross between a penguin and a parrot, 
came back in record numbers. With 19 nesting pairs on Seal Island in outer 
Penobscot Bay, 120 pairs on neighboring Matinicus Rock and 15 on Eastern Egg 
Rock, there were more puffins in the Gulf of Maine this summer than any time 
this century. 
</P>
<P>
 "The puffins are not an endangered species (in Maine), but a rare and 
vulnerable species," Kress said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kress' model for restoring bird colonies is being used to attract other types 
of birds in California, New York, Nebraska, Massachusetts and Hawaii, as well 
as Japan and the Galapagos Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 As the recolonization efforts attract puffins, the puffins attract tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the summer, boatloads of people come to see what has become one of 
Maine's unofficial symbols. In the last six years, about 13,000 bird watchers 
have paid about $35 each to spend a day on an Audubon Society "puffin cruise" 
in hopes of catching a glimpse of the unusual sea bird. 
</P>
<P>
 "The puffins are cute and colorful with human characteristics . . . their 
popularity is like the penguin thing," said Rick Shauffler, the Audubon Society 
supervisor for Seal Island, as he sat in a blind watching birds with 
binoculars. 
</P>
<P>
 The bird's dumpy body and stubby legs make them clumsy on land, but the 
puffins are masters of the sea, where they live when they are not nesting in 
the summer. The pigeon-size birds can dive at least 150 feet deep and hold up 
to 28 fish at one time in their colorful beaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a puffin could lay an egg that floats we'd never see them," Susan Jones, a 
volunteer with the Audubon Society, said on a recent cruise. 
</P>
<P>
 But because the puffins nest for four months in the summer, so does Shauffler. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last four summers, he has been the bearded guardian of this treeless 
island. He lives in a small shack and, along with other field researchers, 
records crucial data on the puffins and Arctic terns. 
</P>
<P>
 He rarely leaves, relying on the puffin cruises to bring him mail and 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 It is an ideal life for Shauffler, 35. Peacefully watching birds most of the 
day and taking breaks to go fishing or haul lobsters, he often ends his day 
with a sunset dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be into it and enjoy the opportunities you have here. . . . You 
can't miss the things you can't have," he said. "It's good for someone like 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 And good for the puffins. A Puffin Primer 
</P>
<P>
 * Puffins live 25 to 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 * It takes puffins five years to mature and begin breeding. 
</P>
<P>
 * The female lays only one egg a year. 
</P>
<P>
 * From the time puffins first leave the nest they may not touch land again for 
two or three years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Puffins can dive at least 150 feet deep. 
</P>
<P>
 * They can hold up to 28 fish in their beaks. 
</P>
<P>
 * The birds are about 10 inches tall. 
</P>
<P>
 * Puffins nest from April to August in colonies in burrows or rock cavities. 
</P>
<P>
 * Eastern Egg Rock in Maine is the most southern Atlantic Puffin colony. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Pacific Puffin is found on the West Coast as far south as California.

EGYPTIAN NOBEL LAUREATE MAHFOUZ STABBED, WOUNDED

 Naguib Mahfouz, winner of the Nobel prize for literature in 1988 and the only 
Arab ever to receive the honor, was stabbed and seriously wounded Friday 
outside his home in a Cairo suburb. 
</P>
<P>
 The motive for the attack on the 82-year-old Egyptian author was not clear but 
police said they suspected Muslim militants, some of whom once declared Mahfouz 
an infidel and put him on their hit list. 
</P>
<P>
 The Interior Ministry said a man attacked Mahfouz with a sharp instrument and 
wounded him in the neck as he sat in a friend's car outside his house in the 
suburb of Agouza. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahfouz, who has written numerous novels about life in Egypt, is now in the 
intensive care unit at the police hospital in Agouza, the sources said. He had 
been bleeding profusely but his condition was now stable and "reassuring," they 
added.

'MIRACLE' HERBICIDE FOR BLUEBERRIES FOUND IN GROUND WATER; MAINE: VELPAR 
TRIPLED YIELDS WHEN IT WAS FIRST USED 10 YEARS AGO. BUT NOW THAT IT'S IN THE 
WATER, GROWERS WONDER WHETHER THEY SHOULD ABANDON IT.

<P>
 The last time Bruce Carter sprayed his wild blueberry fields with the 
herbicide Velpar was four years ago. Now he wonders whether he ever will again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Velpar is going right from blueberry fields and making a beeline to water 
systems. It shouldn't be there," said Carter, as he looked out on blueberry 
barrens spotted with boulders left from the glaciers. 
</P>
<P>
 The herbicide, which kills weeds but spares berries, is credited with tripling 
crop yields on Maine's 58,000 acres of blueberry land since it was first 
sprayed on fields 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 It was touted as the "miracle herbicide . . . like penicillin," said Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was before Velpar started showing up in ground water supplies in 
eastern Maine's Washington and Hancock counties. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't know that it would go into the soil and come out somewhere else," 
said Carter. "Velpar is in places it has no business in being." 
</P>
<P>
 Hexazinone, the generic name for Velpar made by DuPont, has been detected in 
school wells in the towns of Gouldsboro and Aurora. In Franklin, Velpar was 
found at the site where the town plans to drill a new well for the public water 
supply. And the Maine Atlantic Salmon Commission has detected the herbicide in 
more than 40 samples of water on or near the Narraguagus River. 
</P>
<P>
 The amounts of Velpar found in water supplies in Maine range from just traces 
to a high of 32.5 parts per billion -- well below the Environmental Protection 
Agency's health advisory standard of 210 ppb. 
</P>
<P>
 But that standard could soon change, said Al Heier of the EPA. The EPA is 
"reducing it (the ppb standard) dramatically from what it is now, but they 
don't know where it is going to land," Heier said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 12,000 to 15,000 gallons of Velpar are used each year in Maine, 
accounting for less than 5% of all U.S. sales of the herbicide, said Janet 
Smith, spokeswoman for DuPont. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides blueberries, Velpar is used for forest management and on alfalfa, 
sugar cane and pineapple crops in several other states. It has been detected in 
ground water supplies in Florida, Hawaii and North Carolina, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Velpar opponents have tried to link the herbicide with a dramatic 
decrease in clams and salmon Down East and the high breast cancer rate in 
Hancock County. But no evidence has been offered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until we have evidence, the only thing we can do is to speculate. And that is 
no good at all," said Brian Beal, an assistant professor of marine ecology at 
the University of Maine in Machias, who is studying the 90% decrease in 
Washington County's clam population since Velpar was introduced. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Lack, an organic blueberry grower in Whitneyville, collected 280 
signatures for a petition to stop the use of Velpar until more studies are 
conducted to prove that it will not further contaminate the ground water. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not saying that Velpar causes cancer, kills clams, hurts wildlife, but 
we are saying that we don't know and we have too many reasons to be extremely 
cautious about this," Lack said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Smith says DuPont and the EPA have conducted numerous studies which show 
that Velpar in ground water does not pose a health risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is toxic in some dose; this (Velpar) has very low toxicity," said 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Board of Pesticides is now scrutinizing the use of Velpar in Maine. 
The board will decide by Oct. 23 whether to regulate or even ban the currently 
unrestricted herbicide on Maine's blueberry barrens. 
</P>
<P>
 A moratorium on Velpar use would be an economic blow to the state's 
$100-million blueberry industry. 
</P>
<P>
 For decades, Maine's blueberry crop stagnated at 20 million pounds a year. 
After growers used Velpar for a few years, the crop jumped to an average of 60 
million pounds, with a bumper crop of 84 million in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before Velpar there weren't adequate tools to control the competing weed 
species and this (Velpar) has an effect on the yield and the quality of the 
produce. It has an effect on the harvesting," said Amr Ismail, president of the 
Maine Wild Blueberry Co., one of Maine's largest blueberry processors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Velpar is an extremely important tool in the economic production of wild 
blueberries," said Ismail. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without Velpar you'd see a lot of people just get out of the business. There 
is no question that it would be an absolute disaster to the industry," said Ed 
McLaughlin, director of the Maine Blueberry Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Ismail added that because of the controversy over Velpar his company has 
"significantly reduced the amount (of Velpar) used and only when needed." 
</P>
<P>
 McLaughlin, Ismail and DuPont assert that it is OK to drink water contaminated 
with Velpar. "There is an enormous amount of information. It all says very 
clearly that there is no public health or environmental issue," McLaughlin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If somebody is going to have a problem or health hazard from Velpar, it's the 
farmer that is going to be affected first. They're the ones that are handling 
it," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 But Carter doesn't think that way. Carter suspects his well is contaminated 
with Velpar, but that's not what bothers him. He doesn't want to harm his 
neighbors and contaminate their water. 
</P>
<P>
 "A person's right to use a pesticide or herbicide really stops when it enters 
the public's water supply," Lack said.

SCOTT HARRIS: THEY'RE TRUSTING, INNOCENT AND 'ILLEGAL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 "Have you ever interviewed any kick boxers or karate guys?" 
</P>
<P>
 "What's the most favorite story that you ever wrote?" 
</P>
<P>
 "What was your most favorite interview?" 
</P>
<P>
 "What, um . . oh yeah! What was, uh . . . I forgot my question." 
</P>
<P>
 Everywhere, it seemed, another hand was eagerly raised, another bright-eyed 
student with a question. More than 160 students, grades 3 through 5, had 
gathered for a half-hour assembly in the auditorium of John B. Monlux 
Elementary School in North Hollywood. The woman they know as Mrs. Seligson had 
told them they had an important visitor, and at this age children don't just 
trust authority figures, they crave their approval. 
</P>
<P>
 When Mrs. Seligson asked them to quiet down, they quieted down. When it was 
time for questions, they leaned forward in their seats, raised their hands and 
gave that anxious look of "Pick me!" A few students forgot their questions, and 
a couple repeated ones that had been raised moments before. My answers, no 
doubt, mattered less than a moment of attention from someone Mrs. Seligson said 
was important -- someone who actually has his name and his picture in the 
newspaper, even if the picture is out of date. 
</P>
<P>
 It's nice to visit an elementary school, and not just to be a big man on 
campus. It can serve as a kind of reality check, as a reminder of basic values 
that are often lost in the political shuffle of opinion polls, focus groups and 
rhetoric. "Save our state!" goes the rally cry of Proposition 187, an 
initiative that in part seeks to control illegal immigration by tossing more 
than 300,000 students out of California's public schools. How many of these 
kids were sitting in the Monlux auditorium, eager for a different kind of 
attention? 
</P>
<P>
 "I would suspect we have quite a few," said Diane Seligson, the coordinator of 
Monlux's Mathematics, Science and Technology Magnet program. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 173 students in the Monlux magnet, and 593 enrolled in the school's 
standard curriculum. About 60% of the magnet kids are considered ethnic 
minorities, meaning Latino, black or Asian, and about 40% are considered white. 
But these labels are inadequate for describing the diversity. Many of the white 
kids, for example, are recent immigrants from Armenia, Russia and Israel. 
Seligson says that about 25% of the magnet students are classified as having 
limited proficiency in English. Some walk a few blocks to school and some get 
on buses at 6:30 a.m. in communities as far away as Gardena and Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 Seligson, a Northridge resident, has been a member of the Monlux faculty for 
31 years, the last 14 as magnet coordinator. She takes a dim view of a law that 
would expect school officials to look into that auditorium and snitch on kids 
whose parents are "reasonably suspected" of violating immigration laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's say Proposition 187 not only passes, but it somehow survives legal 
challenges. Never mind that the U.S. Supreme Court has already ruled that 
denying education to children of illegal immigrants violates equal-protection 
provisions of the 14th Amendment. Imagine, teachers being asked to do two-faced 
duty as immigration cops. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we'd make good ones here," Seligson said. "I think all children 
should have an education. . . . I think we have to service whoever's here." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawmen such as Sheriff Sherman Block and Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti would also 
be reluctant to crack down on kids. If Proposition 187 becomes law, they warn, 
thousands of children would be removed from the constructive, supervised 
atmosphere of school. On the streets they might be more prone to becoming both 
perpetrators and victims of crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, many Proposition 187 fans don't trust schools anyway. But you'll 
have to take my word for it that inside the Monlux auditorium they would see 
students who were polite and attentive and exhibited only a few signs of what 
Seligson called "the squirmies." Math and science aren't the only subjects 
taught here. 
</P>
<P>
 "We stress manners and we stress following directions," Seligson said. "We 
don't just teach academics. We try to teach them to be good citizens and to 
care for each other." 
</P>
<P>
 She watched while I was interviewed by the Monlux Magnet newspaper staff. A 
girl named Marika asked, "Who's the most famous person that you ever 
interviewed?" 
</P>
<P>
 I thought a moment. "Magic Johnson," I replied. 
</P>
<P>
 The kids oohed and aahed a bit. Mrs. Seligson, speaking their language, 
promptly suggested that a "famous" person might not be a sports hero or a movie 
star. She reminded them of a "most favorite" story I'd discussed earlier, about 
the dangers that firefighters faced during the rioting in 1992. She reminded 
them that I had said my "most favorite" interviews were with extraordinary 
people who aren't well-known -- people who might live in their own 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 We talked about story ideas for the newspaper and the staff artists had a 
couple of suggestions for updating my picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, it's nice to be a BMOC. You meet the children and you don't think about 
Proposition 187 until later. You don't think that some of the children might be 
"illegal." They're just kids, innocent and trusting. And you hope that the 
grown-ups are worthy of their trust.

JAPAN TO DECIDE FATE OF COUNTY CITRUS EXPORTS; AGRICULTURE: GROWERS ANXIOUSLY 
EXPECT WORD WITHIN A MONTH AFTER OFFICIALS INSPECT MEDFLY INFESTATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Japan will decide within a month whether to ban Ventura County's lucrative 
citrus crops because of the Medfly infestation, a high-ranking Japanese 
agricultural official said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Growers are anxiously awaiting the decision, which could mean the loss of the 
county's largest export market. 
</P>
<P>
 At a press conference Saturday in Los Angeles County, the official said the 
announcement will be based in part on a tour he and two other officials took 
last week to get a firsthand look at the infestation and efforts to eradicate 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our main purpose in coming here was to investigate the situation, to survey 
the situation in Ventura County," said Takeo Kocha, associate director of the 
Plant Protection Division of Japan's Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and 
Fisheries. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is my feeling that Japan will, . . . based upon these survey results, be 
able to come to a determination on this issue," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kocha said the small size of the infestation and the state's response to it 
will be factors in the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 But ultimately, the decision will be driven by Japan's determination to keep 
the Mediterranean fruit fly from being imported, Kocha said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any decision will be weighted . . . by that final end -- that the Medfly not 
enter Japan," Kocha said, speaking through an interpreter at the press 
conference in Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 "The economic impact (on Ventura County) must be put aside," Kocha said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County's agricultural officials have estimated the damage to farming 
and related industries could be hundreds of millions of dollars. Only crops 
grown outside the quarantine zone are at stake. Under regulations of the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture, products grown within the quarantine area may not be 
exported, even if treated with pesticide. 
</P>
<P>
 During their three-day visit to Ventura County last week, the delegation 
toured the 84-square-mile quarantine zone by air and met with agricultural 
officials and growers. 
</P>
<P>
 At packing and shipping houses, they inspected the system used to track each 
crate of fruit or vegetables shipped overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 And they witnessed on Wednesday the beginning of a six-month, aerial spraying 
campaign over Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 "The quick action is appreciated . . . by the Japanese government," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kocha described the infestation as a "fairly restricted area," unlike an 
infestation in the early 1980s that began in the San Jose area and eventually 
encompassed 1,300 square miles over eight Northern California counties. As a 
result, large areas were quarantined and crop prices plunged. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with the Cooperative Medfly Project, a state and federal task force 
headquartered in Bell, said traps within the quarantine area continue to be 
checked daily, but the number of finds has tapered off dramatically since the 
first discoveries on Sept. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 "As it stands now, it looks like we've contained the infestation," said John 
Stewart, assistant manager of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 If a ban is announced, most growers would not feel the economic effects until 
next year, Stewart said. The main crops still to be picked this year are 
avocados, which are mostly sold in domestic markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the specter of losing their biggest foreign market still looms, some 
growers tried to remain optimistic about Japan's impending decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this deliberation is a good sign," said J. Link Leavens, who grows 
avocados and lemons in Moorpark. "The Japanese have never acted rashly." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Bean, who grows citrus near Moorpark, said he did not expect the 
Japanese to make a decision hastily. 
</P>
<P>
 "They tend to be super-cautious," he said. "The last thing we want to do is 
upset them." 
</P>
<P>
 But some took a more sober view. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Gene Mabry, a Moorpark lemon and avocado grower: "If they don't accept 
our fruit, it'll be a tragedy."

A WAY OF LIFE; A SOCIETY SET APART; MANY NEEDY PEOPLE CALL VENTURA RIVER BOTTOM 
HOME, BUT A MOVE MAY LIE AHEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ALVAREZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The shantytown pokes out through the brush and the tall grass of a dusty 
riverbed, an old squatters' camp swollen over the years by hard luck and hard 
times into Ventura County's oldest and largest homeless community. 
</P>
<P>
 It stretches more than two miles up the Ventura River, unfolding in a 
collection of plywood shacks and nylon tents housing as many as 200 people 
scratching out their lives in what amounts to an open-air ghetto. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates for the homeless describe this vagabond village as perhaps the last 
of its kind in Southern California, a stubborn holdout in a day when homeless 
encampments elsewhere are being banished and bulldozed. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those who work most closely with the homeless have argued for years 
that Ventura County should do something about this place called the River 
Bottom. But the money for any kind of alternative has never been forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, the homeless advocates have been joined by a new coalition of 
environmentalists and political leaders in Ventura who say they plan to push 
harder than ever for some genuine solution to what they see as a monument to 
decades of community apathy. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists say the homeless are fouling the river's habitat, blocking 
efforts to transform the area into an ecological preserve. Business and civic 
leaders say the homeless are damaging efforts to spruce up downtown Ventura and 
improve its image. 
</P>
<P>
 And Ventura City Councilwoman Rosa Lee Measures is leading the push to pull 
the homeless out of the riverbed and off the city's streets into some kind of 
new campground area -- possibly to be funded with state and federal help. 
</P>
<P>
 "The absence of direction is allowing this to continue," Measures said. "It's 
a depressing, discouraging, sad omen for our society, and I'm committed to 
doing what I can to make the changes where all will benefit." 
</P>
<P>
 As envisioned, the campground would serve as a gathering place for social 
service providers. At the same time, the city would adopt a "zero-tolerance" 
approach to camping on all other public property, in effect outlawing the 
river-bottom camps. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some homeless advocates worry, however, that the new campground proposal could 
turn out to be little more than talk. And beyond the question of whether a new 
campground will ever become reality is the nagging question of how some 
river-bottom residents feel about the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the homeless want to live in the riverbed, and say that they would 
rather stay there than be herded elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people down here probably won't go for it," said Craig, a 32-year-old 
Burbank native who lives in an elaborate lean-to on the river bottom. "I'll 
stay down here as long as they let me. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I could live this way the rest of my life, I would." 
</P>
<P>
 From a distance, it could be mistaken for a city dump: thick piles of garbage 
growing up here and there, rusted shopping carts buried deep in the white sand 
floor. Packs of river-bottom dogs roam the place, picking through the squalor.  
</P>
<P>
 Open campfires cast an eerie orange glow on the encampment at night. 
</P>
<P>
 The shantytown starts at the Main Street bridge and stretches well north of 
Stanley Avenue, parallel with California 33. 
</P>
<P>
 About 40 to 50 camps dot the river floor, barely visible from the highway 
except for an occasional flap of blue tarp poking out from the river-bottom 
brush. This place has been a friend to the homeless since at least World War 
II, a hobo jungle created by railroad tramps below the point where the Southern 
Pacific train trestle straddles the Ventura River. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, homeless advocates say the community is as large as it has ever been, 
making up a significant share of the 2,000 to 3,000 homeless people in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 Theirs is a primitive place. There is no electricity, no plumbing, no running 
water, other than a river polluted by decades of use as a latrine. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a mystery to many who these people are, why they live this way and what 
should be done about them. They are survivors of a societal shipwreck, outcasts 
who have washed up on this stretch of sand only to re-create something that 
resembles civilization. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, despite its tired and tattered appearance, there is order in this 
jungle. Troublemakers are unwelcome and have been run out before. No one person 
or group rules the river bottom, but folks look out for each other. There is a 
sense of community and a code of conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 An old-timer named Pack-Rat is the self-proclaimed "Chief of the River 
Bottom," having made his home in this overgrown nether world for more than half 
of his 55 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lived on every inch of this place," he says, his home now staked out in 
the yawning gap between two concrete slabs holding up the Main Street bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 His real name is Ray Mahala, and he landed on the river bottom when it was 
still primarily home to railroad tramps. He drifted upstream over the years as 
the city pushed the settlers out of the river mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 He has become an institution around this place, in his knee-high leather 
boots, leather pants and jacket and his badger-skin cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of the few places left where a man can just lay down and live," 
Mahala said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But there is a dark side to the old squatters' camp that troubles officials. 
Homeless advocates estimate that 20% to 30% of the residents are mentally ill, 
and maybe half are alcoholics and drug addicts. The drunkards and dope fiends 
and the deranged live together on the river floor with those who are simply the 
down-and-out. And the mix adds an element of constant danger. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Ventura police and fire officials say they have become all too familiar 
with troubles in the riverbed. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters are called at least once a week to put out runaway campfires, 
said Ventura Fire Capt. Myles Smith at Station 1, which handles fire calls on 
the river bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said firefighters no longer respond to reports of open campfires unless 
a large column of smoke is visible. He said firefighters recently responded to 
a call only to find themselves surrounded by a pack of unfriendly river-bottom 
dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I discourage my guys from going down there unless they absolutely have to," 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 And police, though saying they keep no statistics on river-bottom crime, say 
the area has become a haven for drug use and other criminal activity as its 
population has swelled in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the despair and misery that are part of the river bottom, newcomers 
continue to arrive. And one thing is sure, the advocates say: Without some kind 
of community alternative, the river-bottom village will continue to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Only recently, a father and his two sons, 11 and 9, joined the homeless in the 
shantytown, moving into space below the Main Street bridge. The father 
explained that he was out of work and had nowhere else to go. 
</P>
<P>
 And farther upstream, an unemployed construction worker also recently landed 
on the river floor: He now makes his home in a one-man tent on the river's 
shore. 
</P>
<P>
 "The economy keeps getting worse every year and it keeps pushing people over 
the edge," said Bob Costello, a caseworker for Project Understanding in 
Ventura, the homeless agency most directly involved with helping river-bottom 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "More and more people down there are finding themselves in a permanent 
situation, and they know that things are not going to get better anytime soon." 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 The new push for a homeless campground is actually an old idea getting a 
second look. The proposal was first advanced in 1991, when then-City Councilman 
Todd Collart, a member of the city's housing committee, asked city staff to 
look into the issue in response to concerns and complaints about the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 After Collart lost a bid for reelection last November, the idea was shelved 
until new housing committee members were seated. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, newly elected Councilwoman Measures -- who was named to the 
housing committee -- picked up on the idea and created a task force of city 
staff members and homeless advocates to pursue the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 After a series of task force meetings this spring, the Ventura City Council's 
three-member housing committee endorsed the proposal in June -- but noted that 
"resources are very limited at this time to fund any homeless efforts or 
programs in the city." 
</P>
<P>
 While the funding question has remained unsolved, the issue has taken on 
greater urgency because of increased city efforts to improve the downtown 
business district. There is an ongoing effort to lure more tourists, and 
Measures, who campaigned on a strong redevelopment platform, says she has 
received countless complaints from merchants about the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 "This population is growing," Measures said. "The urgency of addressing the 
problem is essential." 
</P>
<P>
 The new look at a homeless campground also has been prompted by the city's 
growing interest in cleaning up the river bottom for ecological reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, Ventura officials earmarked nearly $200,000 for a wildlife 
restoration project on the river bottom that seeks to turn the area into a 
nature preserve, complete with a visitor center and interpretive trails. 
</P>
<P>
 "From a biological standpoint, it's important to not have people living in the 
riverbed on a permanent or semi-permanent basis," said Lawrence Hunt, an 
independent biologist who helped draft a river management plan to guide the 
restoration project. "The problem is they have no place else to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Hunt said water quality in the area is poor and noted that a 1992 flood killed 
a river-bottom resident. "It's not a very safe place to live," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report prepared by the task force created by Measures, officials 
acknowledged the city's lack of money and resources for the homeless. Homeless 
families and single homeless women can find shelter in the city, but single 
homeless men must sleep outdoors or travel to Oxnard for a shelter program. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force called for a campground consisting of fiberglass domes and 
operated by an on-site manager who would assure compliance with the rules. To 
participate, residents would have to enroll in the social service assistance 
programs that would be offered at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 The maximum stay in the campground would be six months, the report said, but 
those making good progress could be extended for up to a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Illegal use of alcohol and drugs would be prohibited, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Homeless advocates say a major provision of the proposal is the creation of a 
"homeless zone" on the outskirts of the campground where the homeless could 
live even if they wanted no part of the more structured program. 
</P>
<P>
 A key to any possible success for the campground proposal would be an 
accompanying get-tough policy on camping by the homeless anywhere else in the 
city, including the riverbed, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cities throughout Southern California have outlawed public camping, starting 
with Santa Barbara in 1979. That law has withstood legal challenges and has 
been the model for ordinances adopted in cities from Long Beach to Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officers already enforce a zero-tolerance policy on city streets and in 
city parks. As a result, police say they occasionally direct street people to 
the river bottom as a place where they can live hassle-free. 
</P>
<P>
 Since June, city staff members have been trying to identify potential sites 
and funding sources for the proposed campground. But so far, no site has been 
found. 
</P>
<P>
 At the city's request, two county supervisors -- John K. Flynn and Susan Lacey 
-- have joined the discussion to determine whether the city can tap into $1.3 
million the county is expected to receive under a Clinton Administration plan 
to reduce homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials and county supervisors are scheduled to meet formally at the 
end of this month to further discuss the issue -- with the city clearly looking 
for financial help for the project. "Our housing committee does believe, as 
well as our study group, that this is a regional issue and that we need to look 
at it regionally," said Loretta McCarty, a city planner who has worked on the 
program off and on since it was proposed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The campground is not a final solution, but it's one piece of the solution to 
providing a healthier living environment for the homeless." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Public pressure already has put an end to some of Southern California's 
largest homeless encampments. In San Diego, for example, the city is 
dismantling a migrant encampment that once sheltered 700 people. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Diablos squatters' camp existed for more than 20 years in the shadow 
of multimillion dollar homes on that city's north end. 
</P>
<P>
 But under pressure from nearby homeowners, the city condemned the encampment 
and is tearing it down, said the Rev. Rafael Martinez, who headed an advocacy 
group that worked with the migrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the end of October it should be all gone," Martinez said. "Some of the 
families have been relocated to housing. But most have simply moved on to other 
camps or are living on their own." 
</P>
<P>
 In Costa Mesa, police say the homeless have been repeatedly flushed out of a 
Santa Ana River encampment but always return. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Riverside, police wiped out a river-bottom encampment several years 
ago, said Arlene Hayes, a worker at a Riverside homeless shelter who led an 
effort to improve conditions for river-bottom dwellers in that city. The 
homeless simply returned to city streets and parks, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura River bottom is now thought to hold the largest collection of 
homeless residents in Southern California outside of the inner city, homeless 
advocates and other authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't think of another camp of that type on that scale," said Gary Blasi, a 
homeless activist and UCLA law professor. "These types of encampments are sort 
of a natural product of people having no place else to go. Whether they exist 
or not is largely the consequence of what the local attitude is about them."  
</P>
<P>
 But whether Ventura's river-bottom settlement will also cease to exist is 
still uncertain. "The river bottom to me has always been a mixed blessing," 
said Project Understanding's Costello. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of out of sight, out of mind, an area where people can live and be 
left alone," he said. "But for a lot of these people it's the start of a 
downward spiral into a cycle of homelessness that's very hard to break out of." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Nazario, who was the county's homeless ombudsman until the job was 
eliminated in budget cuts over the summer, is among those who hope that 
something better is provided. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not a strong advocate for people living on the river bottom, getting 
into fights and drinking themselves to death," she said. "I've been in some of 
the encampments, and I've got a problem with those. I just don't feel very 
strongly about the need to have that kind of thing exist." 
</P>
<P>
 Clyde Reynolds, executive director of the Turning Point Foundation, which 
serves Ventura's mentally ill, said he and other homeless advocates will keep 
supporting the campground plan as long as it is part of a larger push to help 
the river people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think those of us who serve this population are always interested in seeing 
the development of additional resources," he said. "Because until we have 
adequate resources, I think these problems are always going to be with us." 
</P>
<P>
 But Reynolds is not sure the political will really exists to make the 
campground a reality. "I think it's gotten derailed a little bit," he said. "I 
would like to see the city moving much more quickly than they are moving on 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 And then there is Pack-Rat. From his place below the bridge, he sees the tide 
turning against the riverbed village. Against the wishes of the homeless 
themselves, this river-bottom chieftain predicts, some kind of change is 
inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just keep pushing us around," he says. "And now they've got us 
cornered."

ARTS PLAZA PATRON A MYSTERY FIGURE; THOUSAND OAKS: CONTROVERSIAL MAN IN THE 
NORTH RANCH HILLTOP HOME PROMISES TO BREAK HIS SILENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He first caught the city's attention as the incredibly generous local 
philanthropist who had just donated a cool $2 million to the Thousand Oaks 
Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 And then he caught it again just one week later as the central figure in a 
civic controversy over what he can do with his front lawn -- which just happens 
to be a very large front lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 One Civic Arts Plaza official called the $2-million gift "an unparalleled act 
of faith" in the city's new cultural center. 
</P>
<P>
 And one former mayor called the city's handling of the lawn controversy 
"probably one of the most disgraceful days in Thousand Oaks history." 
</P>
<P>
 Through it all, Charles E. Probst remained a man most definitely above the 
fray -- a mystery figure in a hilltop home in North Ranch whom few people in 
town had ever heard of before. 
</P>
<P>
 And Probst made it clear last week that's the way he wants to keep it -- at 
least for now. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid questions about his background and charges and countercharges over the 
timing of his donation, Probst refused to go into detail about himself or what 
makes him tick. 
</P>
<P>
 The soft-spoken businessman said he preferred to keep quiet about such 
matters. He would speak when the time was right. 
</P>
<P>
 Probst donated the $2 million less than a week before the City Council was to 
hear the issue of how he could landscape his front lawn -- specifically a 
request for the city to waive its rule prohibiting construction in open space. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, the Planning Commission had rejected Probst's request to plant 900 
trees and build utility roads and a maintenance bunker on his land at Westlake 
Boulevard and Kanan Road because the estate's previous owner had promised to 
leave the hillside alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that agreement with the city, Probst had scraped the natural growth 
from his front yard and then applied for the waiver. Although it was a 
violation of city policies, the council gave Probst what he wanted Tuesday on a 
3-2 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from his neighbors and Charles Cohen, the lawyer who represented Probst 
in the landscaping battle, practically no one in the city had much knowledge 
about Probst. 
</P>
<P>
 But plenty of curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't even know for sure he was a real person until the council meeting," 
Planning Commissioner Irving Wasserman quipped. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a mystery, there's no question about it," added Cathy Schutz, who fought 
Probst's landscape plans despite never meeting him in person. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Arts officials moved in to defend Probst, saying they had performed with "due 
diligence" in checking out his past. Most of them had to admit, though, that 
they had never met the mysterious donor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what he does, I don't know where he's from, and I'm not sure I 
care," said civic leader Larry Janss, himself a major contributor and 
fund-raiser for the plaza. "It's the classic case of don't look a gift horse in 
the mouth."  
</P>
<P>
 Around Thousand Oaks last week, many people wanted to know more about Probst, 
and rumors swirled about his background. 
</P>
<P>
 Some officials speculated on the deepest of background that he was British 
royalty. Others insistently whispered he was the inventor of a popular type of 
automobile windshield wiper. 
</P>
<P>
 But they were wrong, according to the best available intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 The 51-year-old California native is the owner of a relatively obscure 
telecommunications company based in Calabasas called Bankers Communications Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Before that, Probst worked for his father at Bankers Electric Co., an 
electrical contracting firm in San Marino, according to Anthony Munoz, now the 
president of Bankers Electric. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankers Communications is a consulting business that deals in custom computer 
software systems and has three employees, public records show. It was organized 
in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 According to Cohen, Probst works hard despite his wealth, often heading into 
work as early as 4 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen called his client a very private man. But several of Probst's neighbors 
said he's really not all that private and he's actually a nice guy once you get 
to know him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see him out and about all the time," said one, who asked not to be 
identified. "I think the only reason people think he's a recluse is because 
they don't know him." 
</P>
<P>
 Another North Ranch resident, Patricia Miller, said her late husband knew 
Probst and often ran into him around town. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'd run into Charles at lunch all the time," Miller said. "Charles is quiet, 
but he's a very nice man." 
</P>
<P>
 Probst also had proven himself to be a generous man long before his gift to 
the arts plaza. He just didn't get any publicity about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Optimist Club fund-raiser Rene Rodriguez remembered a day in 1991 when he was 
working to save the Ventura County Sheriff's Department's DARE program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was struggling to raise the funds and Mr. Probst was watching me on TV and 
he called me out of the blue sky," Rodriguez recalled. "He said, 'How much 
money do you need' and I said, '$10,000.' He said, 'Would $20,000 help?' And I 
said 'Yes sir!' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, even those who claim a friendship with Probst can say little about 
where the businessman found his financial success. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's talk at his parties about his owning a patent to some sort of 
telecommunications technology," one neighbor said. "But it's not really clear 
what it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Probst himself says he will break his silence before the arts plaza opens. He 
and another lawyer, Paul Stansen, promised a press conference to answer all 
unanswered questions within the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that the press conference is something a lot of people are anxious 
about," said Richard Johnson, the Civic Arts Plaza's fund-raising campaign 
director. "It promises to be a revealing event for us all."

UNITED WAY DRIVE OFF TO GOOD START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY SAILLANT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just one month into Ventura County's United Way campaign, donations are double 
what they were a year ago, boosting leaders' hopes that the charity will reach 
its $5.35-million goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're off to a reasonably good start," said campaign chairman John Katch 
"It's always nice to be ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the campaign kicked off Sept. 10, the United Way has raised $300,608, or 
6% of its goal. During the same period last year, the organization had received 
3% of the target, Katch said. 
</P>
<P>
 While that lead may narrow in coming months, charity officials said, it is a 
good indication that people may be opening their wallets a little wider as 
Ventura County's economy creeps out of the doldrums. 
</P>
<P>
 That is good news to people like Gary Kasai, director of the county's Easter 
Seals chapter. Contributions to the United Way make up 6% of Easter Seal's 
$1-million budget, Kasai said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every dollar can mean the difference between some kid receiving help or not 
getting it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A drop in charitable giving over the past three years forced Easter Seals 
recently to suspend a program that helped children with neurological and 
physical disorders, Kasai said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like the kids were getting quiche and escargots for snacks," he 
said. "There just wasn't enough money to keep it running." 
</P>
<P>
 United Way directors are continuing their strategy of reporting results from 
individual communities as a way to spur a little "friendly competition," Katch 
said. That focus also helps drive home the point that dollars are raised -- and 
allocated -- locally, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People respond better to neighbors asking for dollars instead of someone they 
don't know from another city," Katch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thermometers charting a community's progress will be posted on signs in each 
region and will be updated frequently, he said. The Times will also publish a 
chart each week in its Sunday edition showing each region's progress. The 
campaign ends March 31. 
</P>
<P>
 The $5.35-million goal is the same as the United Way's 1993-94 target. 
</P>
<P>
 United Way stayed with the same goal this year in part because of the economic 
slump, which has prompted some county businesses to trim their work force, shut 
down and move elsewhere, Katch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, donor gifts fell short of the mark by about $200,000. Therefore, if 
the 1994-95 campaign goal is met, it will represent a 5% increase, said 
campaign manager David Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 Katch said United Way directors came up with the target after evaluating the 
current state of Ventura County's economy and past levels of giving from the 
county's various regions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like any planning exercise," Katch said. "You make your best guess. And 
you often come out too high or too low." 
</P>
<P>
 United Way is not the only charity that has seen donations level off in recent 
years. Kasai of Easter Seals said dollars to his organization have also slowed. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the good 'ole days, we would set our target at 10% greater than the 
previous year," Katch said. "But those days are gone. I don't know any 
nonprofits that are looking for increased donations." 
</P>
<P>
 Contributions to the United Way are funneled to 59 local agencies that serve 
Ventura County residents with dozens of social welfare offerings, including 
psychological counseling, provisions for food and shelter, and rehabilitation 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The demand for such services is strong, said Priscilla Partridge de Garcia, 
the United Way's coordinator for the region covering Camarillo, Santa Paula, 
Fillmore and Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 "I deal daily with people who were laid off in a corporate downsizing, who are 
on welfare or who are returning to the workplace after several years at home," 
said de Garcia, who runs the re-entry center at Oxnard College. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very hard economy and it's very hard to get jobs right now. I tell 
people we all need to pull together to help out."

5 YEARS AFTER LOMA PRIETA'S DEADLY SHUDDER, SIGNS OF RECOVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATALINA ORTIZ, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As you walk along a narrow trail winding through a steep canyon shaded with 
redwoods, firs and oaks, it's hard to believe the earth below once spawned a 
devastating earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 But deep within the ground beneath your feet, a deadly shudder arose on Oct. 
17, 1989. Its shock waves killed 63 people and injured more than 3,700, caused 
$5.9 billion in damage, broke freeways and bridges and destroyed or weakened 
tens of thousands of buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years later, here at the epicenter of the Loma Prieta earthquake, the 
only traces of the destruction are a modest sign and a few fallen trees. But 
you don't have to go far to find other reminders. 
</P>
<P>
 Empty lots gap like missing teeth on main streets in Watsonville, 15 miles to 
the southeast, and Santa Cruz, 15 miles west. In Oakland, 50 miles away, the 
Cypress section of Interstate 880, where 42 people died in a ruin of collapsing 
pavement, has yet to be rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland's landmark City Hall is still closed, undergoing repairs expected to 
last another year, and many downtown businesses remain boarded up.  
</P>
<P>
 In San Francisco, 65 miles away, the devastated Marina District has recovered, 
but timbers still support cracked stone archways in City Hall, and damaged 
freeways have yet to be fixed or replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 "The long-term ramifications of Loma Prieta are being felt far beyond the 
events of October, 1989," said Jim Drago, spokesman for Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
 He and others blame delays on many different things: red tape, essential 
engineering research, the stubborn recession, public resistance to some 
projects and the sheer size of some repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 But they also believe the 15-second quake had at least one positive effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "It helped, I think, to focus our sight on the gallows," said Alan Lindh, a 
seismologist at the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park. "And there's the 
saying that the sight of the gallows concentrates the mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Northern California is better prepared for a major temblor now than it was 
five years ago, Lindh and disaster experts believe. The region, which had not 
had a truly disastrous quake since 1906, really didn't know what to expect 
before Loma Prieta. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since 1989 there's been an immediacy of preparedness. Up until '89 we were 
talking about what might happen. '89 showed us in fact what will happen," said 
Richard Eisner, director of the state Office of Emergency Services' earthquake 
preparedness program. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake taught different governments and agencies how to cooperate during 
disasters and plan for future ones, said Lowell Hurst, mayor of Watsonville. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco's director of emergency services, retired Adm. John Bitoff, said 
cities like San Francisco and Oakland also have greatly improved emergency 
communications systems. "I'm not satisfied yet, but as I told the mayor the 
other day, 'You don't want me to be satisfied,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Loma Prieta also helped ready the region for the Next One through a kind of 
"structural Darwinism," Eisner said. "The earthquake in '89 brought down the 
worst of the hazardous structures," he said. Most were old, unreinforced 
masonry buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Many surviving buildings that were damaged or considered at risk are being 
strengthened. New strengthening techniques are being used that were learned as 
a result of Loma Prieta, Eisner said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the quake, the state required local governments to set up emergency 
plans and let cities and counties impose stricter building standards than those 
required by Sacramento. The state also started a program to evaluate the safety 
of bridges and freeways and began strengthening them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact of the matter is that Loma Prieta started what is really the world's 
most ambitious seismic retrofitting program, period," said Drago, of Caltrans. 
The 6.8 quake in Los Angeles last January, which killed at least 58 people and 
did an estimated $20 billion in damage, only reinforced the commitment to make 
freeways quake resistant, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California freeways and bridges were quickly repaired because they 
were newer, simpler spans, he said. The ones in Northern California were older, 
multilevel constructions that required much research. 
</P>
<P>
 "They tell me that the advance of seismic and structural engineering since 
Loma Prieta would be the equivalent of when we made the advance from the horse 
to the auto," Drago said. 
</P>
<P>
 The epicenter of Loma Prieta -- named for a nearby peak in the Santa Cruz 
Mountains -- is within the Forest of Nisene Marks State Park, near a trail that 
winds along a canyon creek. 
</P>
<P>
 The trail was seldom visited until scientists determined the epicenter's 
location. During Christmas week, 1989, 5,000 people a day visited, said ranger 
Gerry Waggoner.  
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people are disappointed to find there is only a sign there," he 
said. "They expected to find a hole in the ground." The crowds are gone, but 
the trail remains a popular hike, for its scenery as much as its geologic 
significance. 
</P>
<P>
 In a way, it's a metaphor for California -- sometimes perilous, but often 
spectacular. Scientists and disaster experts say quakes can be prepared for, 
and can be considered the price for the region's beauty.

A WAY OF LIFE; THOSE WHO LIVE ALONG THE RIVER; COMMUNITY INCLUDES INDEPENDENT

 The rhythm of the river bottom plays on every day, from daybreak to dark, in a 
way few people see. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It starts early in the morning, when the working poor emerge from the river 
floor and head to jobs, some permanent and others makeshift. It slips into the 
afternoon when the hard-core homeless are still shaking off drinking binges 
from the night before. 
</P>
<P>
 And it cycles into night, when some of the river people take to Ventura's back 
streets, wading waist-deep into dumpsters, hunting for anything that can be 
reused, recycled or resold. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Dodge recently celebrated his 38th birthday on the river bottom, having 
landed here six months ago after fire destroyed the van he was living in. 
</P>
<P>
 Each morning, he draws water from a municipal fountain and scrubs shop windows 
along Main Street. Window washing is his sole source of income. 
</P>
<P>
 He can earn up to $40 a day, more than enough to buy cheap cigarettes, stock 
up on dry goods and put steak on his dinner table. He shuns the food giveaways 
organized by local charities. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally from Kansas, the Vietnam-era veteran moved to California after 
losing his right eye while working construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodge lives just north of the Main Street bridge, in a clearing ringed by 
brush and tall reeds. The walls of his place are made of bamboo-like stalks. A 
rebel flag, fished out of a dumpster, covers one wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just needed to find myself," he explains of his move to the river bottom. 
"I just didn't want to be around other people." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A long line of social workers visited Ted Edwards and Peggy Wallace when they 
decided to raise their daughter, Andrial, on the river bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 The county workers concluded that despite the family's non-traditional 
lifestyle, the 2-year-old is being raised by loving parents in a stable home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if a child lives indoors doesn't mean that his home is stable," said 
Diane Berger, a public health nurse who works with the family. "I think both 
Peggy and Ted have provided stable living conditions. They are good parents and 
they are doing a wonderful job with her." 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards and Wallace, both 40, say they know that some folks question the 
wisdom of raising a child on the river bottom. But it is their choice to be 
here.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a beautiful, healthy daughter," Wallace says. "We've got a solid 
relationship. Neither of us has ulcers. What else can you ask for?" 
</P>
<P>
 The couple never intended to stay this long. When the lease ran out on their 
apartment six years ago, they took all their money, bought new camping gear and 
moved deep into the river-bottom brush. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came Andrial, a bright, rambunctious redhead who holds up an index finger 
on each hand when asked her age. 
</P>
<P>
 The family's income is $1,200 a month, Edwards' reward for 19 1/2 years of 
military service. They figured they could have afforded rent of about $600 a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they tacked together a three-room shack out of old pallets and scrap 
wood. Still, they know they can't stay here forever. Preschool is around the 
corner. 
</P>
<P>
 "We figure we've got a couple of more years, and then we're going to be up 
there where it's mean and dangerous," Edwards says. "No use exposing her to 
that any sooner than we have to." 
</P>
<P>
 It is moving day on the river bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig and Ashley, who have lived here for about a year, were recently invited 
by longtime river-bottom residents to move upstream to a vacant camp near the 
oil fields, about two miles north of their current camp. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is the equivalent of moving uptown. There are less trash and fewer people 
to the north. It is also quieter, the silence broken only by the wind-swept 
vegetation and the swoosh of cars scooting along California 33. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of like homesteading," Ashley explains about river-bottom living, 
"except you don't get to stay forever." 
</P>
<P>
 Their new lean-to is graced by tall wooden doors that open onto a living room, 
carpeted and already furnished with couches. The roof is dirty burlap and blue 
tarp, held in place by exposed beams fashioned out of long oars and old logs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashley is a proud owner, showing the house as if she won it in some 
river-bottom lottery. She has big plans: new carpet here, stairs over there. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig is from Burbank, Ashley is third generation Ojai Valley. They share a 
history of drug use: She spent time in a recovery house, he spent time in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Now both are sober. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lived with lots of money, and I've struggled," Ashley says. "I've had 
everything, and I've had nothing. Right now I have everything." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dennis Ogden is fresh out of jail and at peace on the river bottom. Friendly 
and hard working, he is now among the nocturnal river people who make their way 
in this world by scouring back-street dumpsters while Ventura sleeps. 
</P>
<P>
 Lumber, waste baskets and fan belts. An old pair of boots. A surfboard and a 
set of television trays. Anything that can be traded for food or turned in for 
cash is salvaged. 
</P>
<P>
 "I work hard, I don't steal," says the 42-year-old Santa Paula native. "I meet 
all of my needs straight out of these dumpsters." 
</P>
<P>
 Ogden has lived under the Main Street bridge for six months, introduced to the 
place by a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 With a river-bottom dog named Festus by his side, he pulls a cart from one 
trash bin to the next, going out at night because that's when he can roam the 
streets unmolested. 
</P>
<P>
 He cuts through a freeway fence and uses the Main Street off-ramp to get to a 
Ventura Avenue trailer park. 
</P>
<P>
 With a yellow flashlight clenched between his teeth, he fishes through a 
dumpster and pulls out a half-eaten lemon merengue pie. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's Christmas all over again," he says. "You never know what you're going to 
find."

A WAY OF LIFE; ... AND THOSE WHO COME TO HELP; GOOD SAMARITANS BRING HOPE AS 
THEY MINISTER TO MIND, BODY AND SOUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The good deeds of good Samaritans nurture the riverbed society and keep it 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Food is handed out free every day to river-bottom residents. Clothing is 
available, often dropped in a nearby parking lot for the homeless to pick 
through. 
</P>
<P>
 Dog food is dispensed on Sundays. So is religion. 
</P>
<P>
 A small band of care givers regularly visits the river-bottom homeless, 
delivering help and a measure of hope, ministering to the mind, the body and 
the soul. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Evelyn Burge troops through the riverbed thickets every few weeks to deliver 
health care to the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 The county public health nurse goes down at daybreak when many of the river 
people are just waking up or still sleeping off hangovers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hi, it's Evelyn," Burge shouts toward a hovel built up in a crawl space 
beneath the Main Street bridge. "Who are you?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Leon," the answer comes back after some waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is everything OK? Are you alone? Are you alone, sir?" she asks. 
</P>
<P>
 No response. Finally, an answer like a low moan: "Yeah, I'm all right." 
</P>
<P>
 Burge runs the Homeless Health Care Program, a countywide effort she launched 
in 1990 to deliver medical services to a population in desperate need of them. 
</P>
<P>
 She says alcoholism is the biggest health problem on the river bottom, but 
there are others. Infections, dog bites and sprained ankles come easy and often 
from wilderness living. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuberculosis is a common affliction. A number of river-bottom dwellers have 
the AIDS virus, Burge says. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of these people just want to be isolated," she says. "That's the reason 
they're down here." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Bob Dailey is the last county mental health worker to have regularly visited 
the river bottom. He stopped officially working the area three years ago, when 
he was reassigned to another job. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Dailey says he visits the riverbed as often as he can, checking up on 
old friends and spreading the word about county services. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the kind of job where you can all of a sudden just stop going," 
Dailey says. "You can try to leave them, but they don't leave you." 
</P>
<P>
 Dailey estimates that at least 20% of the river-bottom residents are mentally 
ill, and about half are hooked on drugs and booze. Because of the obvious need, 
he says, he doesn't understand why mental health employees ever stopped going 
to the river bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's disgraceful," he says. "It really makes a mockery out of the mission to 
serve the homeless population." 
</P>
<P>
 Vikki Smith, who runs a homeless outreach program for county mental health, 
says services are available to the entire homeless population, including the 
people who live on the river floor. 
</P>
<P>
 But, she says, she decided not to send caseworkers to the river bottom after 
Dailey was reassigned, fearing for their safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority of people who work here are women, and I don't feel it (the 
river bottom) is a safe place for women to enter," Smith explains. "You just 
sort of adapt. You provide services the best you can."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Each Sunday for the past three years, Pastor Mary Carr has offered her own 
brand of help to the river-bottom homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 In sweat pants and sneakers, she is the spiritual leader of the Outdoor Gospel 
Church. Her flock is anyone who will rise up out of the riverbed and listen. 
</P>
<P>
 Carr, who is executive director of the Ventura County Medical Society, was 
ordained in 1990 at Oxnard's Golden Grain Bible College. The next year, she 
said, she was called by the Holy Spirit.  
</P>
<P>
 "I felt the Lord saying, 'Go to the river bottom,' " says Carr, who started 
the outdoor church in early 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The street preacher opened with prayer on a recent Sunday: "We call forth each 
and every heart you desire to be here this day." 
</P>
<P>
 Fewer than a dozen people attend, though the outdoor service has drawn as many 
as 80. They sit in a circle of mismatched chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 As Carr thunders on, a man drops his head in his hands and shuts his eyes. 
Another strokes his dog. A shoeless man plops down on a chair and loses a fight 
to stay awake. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman with her head down whispers in prayer. Her name is Dede Twyman. She is 
32. And last year about this time she lived on the river bottom. Now she has 
returned to help Carr spread the word. 
</P>
<P>
 As the service ends, the river-bottom dwellers come out in force, knowing that 
food is about to be handed out.  
</P>
<P>
 Carr says she doesn't mind the late arrivals. Food is handed out slowly.  
</P>
<P>
 Fishes and loaves, she reminds herself.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: OAK PARK; JEWS SEEK PERMIT FOR HOME WORSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Members of Chabad of Conejo, an orthodox Jewish group, will ask the Ventura 
County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday to grant them a permit to hold services 
at a house in Oak Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chabad is bringing its appeal to the board after the county Planning 
Commission denied the request for a conditional use permit at its Sept. 8 
meeting.The vote was 2 to 1 in favor, but three votes were required for 
approval. Staff planners had recommended approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chabad asks that the group be allowed to hold services for up to 70 people 
in a house in a residential area three times a week and to have Bible study 
classes at night. 
</P>
<P>
 The request has created tension between the Chabad and its Oak Park neighbors, 
who say it violates the residential nature of the area. The neighbors have 
complained about parking, noise and a lack of privacy.  
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors will consider the appeal at 1:30 p.m. Tuesday, when they meet 
at the County Government Center, 800 S. Victoria Ave., Ventura. JULIE FIELDS

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: OXNARD; FORUM EXPLORES BLACK WOMEN'S HEALTH ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 200 African-American women and teen-age girls gathered in Oxnard on 
Saturday to discuss health, work and other issues in Ventura County's first 
such conference aimed at black women. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the county's Public Health Tobacco Education and Control Program, 
the conference included speeches by writers and college professors, seminars on 
stress and nutrition, and an afternoon fashion show. 
</P>
<P>
 "This type of program offers a wonderful opportunity for all women," said 
Yolanda Hill, a 46-year-old computer analyst from Oxnard. "It not only provides 
us an opportunity to learn and grow, but it also offers something that we can 
identify with and that is our heritage, who we are and where we are going." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeanne Scott, the program's organizer, said the daylong conference at Oxnard's 
Boys & Girls Club was conceived primarily as a way to address the issue of 
African-American women and smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 According to studies conducted by the California Department of Health 
Services, 25% of African-American women smoke, compared to 19% of all women in 
California, Scott said.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the main goal of the program was to help women stop smoking or 
persuade them to never start, the conference also tackled such issues as 
choosing a career and managing relationships, Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Leading a healthy life is important, but you can't have that unless you have 
the means. You need to be educated to have a reliable job and you need to have 
self-esteem. We want to teach women how to achieve them," Scott said. "They 
must learn how to take control of their lives and have goals. A lot of our 
young women today have none of that." 
</P>
<P>
 The keynote speaker at the event was Patrice Gaines, a Washington Post 
journalist whose recently published book details her trials as a single mother 
and drug user who served time in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was impressed with her," said 34-year-old Maria Chandler. "A lot of the 
things she talked about are happening in my life right now, and that gave me 
some perspective."  
</P>
<P>
 Scott said the county hopes to hold a similar conference annually. CHRISTINA

 Five Oxnard residents were arrested on suspicion of selling and using heroin 
at a local motel, authorities said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrests marked the end of a six-week investigation that began when 
neighbors of the E-Z Motel in the 500 block of East Date Street in Oxnard 
complained about blatant narcotic dealing in motel rooms and the parking lot, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrested on suspicion of being under the influence were Alma Rosa Martinez, 
33; Tamara Christine Ervin, 22, and Mona Lisa Mejia, 22, police said. Charles 
Smith, 22, and Jorge Blanco Mendez, 20, were arrested on suspicion of selling 
heroin, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, Ervin and Mejia have been released from Ventura County Jail. Smith 
and Mendez were being held Saturday in lieu of $20,000 bail, authorities said.

ELECTIONS / COUNTY SUPERVISORS; MIKELS, MONTGOMERY SPLIT ON PLANS TO ESTABLISH 
COMMERCIAL AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County supervisorial candidate Judy Mikels says establishing a 
commercial airport at Point Mugu Naval Air Station would go a long way toward 
promoting business growth in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponent Scott Montgomery says a commercial airport could spark runaway 
development of surrounding farmland. He adds that he does not believe the 
county's economic future depends on whether it has an airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of counties, and Ventura County is one of them, that can 
survive if they don't have a commercial airport," said the Moorpark councilman. 
</P>
<P>
 This is one of the primary issues of debate between the two candidates in 
their race for the seat being vacated by Supervisor Vicky Howard. Her 4th 
District covers Simi Valley, Moorpark and the Santa Rosa Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Mikels, a Simi Valley councilwoman, and Montgomery said they support 
efforts to keep Point Mugu operating as a military base. 
</P>
<P>
 Threatened with closure because of continuing defense cutbacks, the Navy has 
offered to share the base's 11,000-foot runway with the county to reduce 
operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
 But while many county officials have jumped on the bandwagon in support of the 
idea, Montgomery said he believes it could send the wrong message to the 
federal government and actually speed up the base's closure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want them to get the impression that it's OK to close it down" 
because the county has found another use for it, said Montgomery, 41. 
</P>
<P>
 Although acknowledging that an airport would offer some economic advantages to 
the county, Montgomery said his main concern is that it would also lead to 
large-scale development on surrounding farmland in eastern Camarillo. Camarillo 
Mayor Ken Gose, who has endorsed Montgomery, has expressed similar concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the economic vitality of the county is integrally linked to a 
commercial airport," Montgomery said. "Sure it would be nice. But for every 
benefit, there's a price to be paid." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Mikels said that the county must act now to protect its options with the 
Navy, even if it means that a commercial airport would not be developed for 
several years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to be more farsighted," said Mikels, 49, a trained pilot. "We need to 
face the fact that in the future we're going to need an airport. And if this 
goes away, what are we going to do? In this day and age, I don't think we're 
going to have an opportunity to site another airport." 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates also take opposing views over a proposal to train county 
firefighters as paramedics. The county is now served by three private ambulance 
companies, which provide emergency care. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery said he supports starting a pilot firefighter paramedic program in 
the city of Moorpark, which has set aside $110,000 to cover the cost of a 
one-year program. Eventually, he said, all county firefighters would be trained 
to provide paramedic service. 
</P>
<P>
 The result would be greatly improved emergency response times because there 
are more fire stations around the county than there are ambulance stations, 
said Montgomery, who has received the endorsement and $1,800 in campaign 
contributions from the county firefighters' union.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Montgomery said the program would not cost taxpayers any additional 
money. He said some money from Proposition 172, a half-cent sales tax, could be 
used to help underwrite the paramedic service. The county, he said, would also 
generate revenues by billing those who use the service. 
</P>
<P>
 Ideally, he said, the county's private ambulance companies would only be 
responsible for transporting patients, thus eliminating the need for these 
companies to hire and train paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
 "In those areas where private industry can provide a more effective way to 
perform a service, then I'm all for it," he said. "But in this area, it has 
been proven that the more effective way to provide the service is for a public 
entity to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Mikels disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never seen a report that proves to me that we need county firefighter 
paramedics," said Mikels, who has received $1,000 in campaign contributions 
from Pruner Health Services, the county's largest ambulance company. "I believe 
if private industry can do the job, let them do it." 
</P>
<P>
 If there are problems with response times, Mikels said the county should take 
steps to improve private ambulance service. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just because it's our job to provide emergency services, it doesn't mean we 
have to operate it or pay for it," Mikels said, adding that a county 
firefighter paramedic program would cost taxpayers money in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
 Another issue the candidates disagree on is who is more qualified to serve as 
supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikels, who operates her own picture frame business, was elected to the Simi 
Valley City Council in 1992 and is a member of several county organizations 
that deal with everything from freeway improvements to economic issues. She has 
been endorsed by Supervisor Howard, Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton and Ventura 
County's top law enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery has served on the Moorpark City Council since 1986 and is also 
chairman of the Ventura County Waste Commission. He has received support from 
the county employees' union and the county firefighters' union. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the June primary, when four candidates were competing for the 
supervisor's job, Montgomery described himself as an underdog because he was 
the only candidate from Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 A city of 26,000, Moorpark is one-fourth the size of Simi Valley, the 
political base of Montgomery's three rivals in the primary. But Montgomery 
finished first in the primary with 33.9% of the vote to qualify for the 
November runoff, while his rivals split the Simi Valley vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikels' supporters say that with the other Simi Valley candidates out of the 
race, her chances of cornering the Simi Valley vote are much greater. They also 
say her experience on the Simi Valley council has better prepared her for the 
job of county supervisor. They point out that she has had to deal with an 
annual budget of $28 million, twice the size of Moorpark's, and a full-time 
staff of 549 city employees, compared to 38 in Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that Scott has really had the experience of managing a large 
government organization," Stratton said. "We need someone who can hit the 
ground running." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark Mayor Paul Lawrason said he believes Montgomery's experience on the 
council is no different than that of Mikels. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problems are the same and the pressures are the same," he said. "I think 
the size and scale of the (two cities) is really a moot point in 
differentiating them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrason said Montgomery's background as a financial consultant who worked 
closely with numerous government agencies has been a great asset to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's head and shoulders above anyone else I've worked with in dealing with 
public financing," Lawrason said. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer a financial consultant, Montgomery designs and sells computer 
software out of his home. He also delivers newspapers for the Ventura Star-Free 
Press, a job he said allows him to spend more time on his council duties. 
</P>
<P>
 Although both candidates describe themselves as conservative Republicans, 
Montgomery criticized Mikels for voting to approve assessment fees for various 
city services and to increase Simi Valley's hotel occupancy tax. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we need is not more taxes, but less government," Montgomery said. "I say 
we already collect enough in taxes. What we need to do is spend what we collect 
more wisely." 
</P>
<P>
 Mikels acknowledged that she has voted for increased assessment fees in the 
past, but that those fees were intended to cover the increased costs of 
providing certain services, not to pad city coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone charges us more for our water, then we raise our rates," she said. 
"I believe in people paying for what they're getting. I don't believe in 
subsidizing." 
</P>
<P>
 Mikels said she also had supported a 2% increase in the city's hotel occupancy 
tax, money she said goes to promote tourism in the city. She noted that the tax 
is charged to guests of local hotels, not residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't consider raising the tax from 8% to 10% either threatening business 
or unfair taxation," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Montgomery vows not to support any tax increase if elected, Mikels said, 
"I'm not going to make promises I can't keep." 
</P>
<P>
 There are some issues on which the candidates agree. Both support the 
development of a new west county landfill and both support granting the 
Ahmanson Land Co. a three-year extension on its development agreement with the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement calls for the developer to turn over two mountain properties 
owned by Bob Hope to park agencies before moving forward with its plans to 
build a $1-billion golf course community near the Los Angeles County line. 4th 
Supervisorial District 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Councilwoman Judy Mikels and Moorpark Councilman Scott Montgomery 
are running for the supervisorial seat being vacated by Vicky Howard, who is 
retiring after one term. The 4th Supervisorial District covers Simi Valley, 
Moorpark and the Santa Rosa Valley.

WORKERS THREATEN TO STRIKE, BUT FARM SAYS DEMANDS COULD CLOSE PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As storm clouds billowed above the Santa Susana Mountains, laborers at 
Muranaka Farms performed what is becoming an almost weekly ritual: They 
marched, waved their red banners and threatened to strike if the company would 
not sign a contract to guarantee pay hikes and health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 And company representatives did what has become their ritual: They kept quiet 
and put off negotiations a few more days. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the workers' bluster and the company's hard line, the possibility of a 
strike looms large for both sides. Both have said this is a fight for survival. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Muranaka, the president of the farming company his father started in the 
1950s, said the union's demands could force him to close his Ventura County 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our long-term viability in the county is threatened because of the stance 
that they've taken," Muranaka said. "That's why we've been focusing on Mexico." 
 
</P>
<P>
 Muranaka would not provide figures on company profits. But the Produce 
Reporter, which publishes a credit and marketing guide for the produce and 
fruit industry, gave Muranaka one of its highest ratings. According to its 1994 
Blue Book, Muranaka Farms could easily qualify for more than $1 million in 
credit. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such robust reports, the number of acres Muranaka farms in Ventura 
County has fluctuated over the last 10 years from a high of 800 a few years ago 
to 450 this year. The farm's acreage in Mexico has steadily climbed from 200 
acres in the early 1980s to nearly 2,500 this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Muranaka said that because of cheaper labor the company can harvest more 
worker-intensive crops in Mexico. For instance, workers in Mexico trim and peel 
onions that are sold for a premium price to markets in England, Muranaka said. 
On the Moorpark farm, labor costs are too high to do similar work, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony is that many of Muranaka's workers immigrated from Mexico to claim 
the jobs that are now going south of the border. That point is not lost on his 
150 Moorpark employees. But they still think Muranaka does not have to shift 
any more crops to Mexico to make a profit. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the field hands and packinghouse workers have labored for the company 
for years. They say they have helped make it profitable, and they want a share 
in that success. 
</P>
<P>
 The workers -- all represented by the United Farm Workers -- have been without 
a contract since 1992, and without a raise since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Fernandez, 36, heads union members at Muranaka Farms. A stocky man with a 
scruffy beard and mustache, Fernandez has worked for the company since 1973. It 
was not until 1988 that he got a raise, he said, and it took nearly five years 
of union pressure to get it. He now earns about $270 a week, harvesting crops 
on a piece rate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've done about every single job there is to do on this farm," he said. 
"There are a lot of workers, like me, who've been here a long time. We have 
expertise that can help keep them profitable, but they don't want us involved. 
They're not interested in what we know."  
</P>
<P>
 The union is asking for salary increases of between 9% and 12% for all the 
company's workers. And they are demanding health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 The workers are in a precarious position. Earning from $12,000 to $14,000 a 
year, none of them have much money to fall back on if they go on strike, 
Fernandez said. Yet they have voted for a walkout if the company does not make 
them a good offer within the next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're ready if we have to," said worker Juan Herrera, 52, during a 
demonstration earlier this month. "All the people are behind striking if that's 
what it takes." 
</P>
<P>
 Herrera, who picks kale and leeks, is a member of a negotiating team selected 
by workers. A father of seven, he does not look forward to a strike. Times are 
tough enough, he said. A strike would be a tremendous burden for his family to 
bear. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping for something positive," he said. "But if it has to be, we will 
strike."  
</P>
<P>
 The union that represents Herrera and his fellow workers has also decided that 
Muranaka Farms is the right place to take a stand. Mario Brito, the union's 
regional manager, said the union is emphasizing its push here because officials 
think a Muranaka contract is attainable. The union now represents workers at 
just five farming companies locally. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a stronghold of support, union membership in Ventura County dropped from 
4,000 in the early 1980s to 500 this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Muranaka has said that the union's focus on his company has hurt business, and 
made him less competitive with farms where workers are non-union. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't go around looking at what other companies pay their workers," 
Muranaka said. "We make that decision based on our own economic situation. But 
we've had several employees leave to work at other companies, and a lot of them 
just end up coming back. That should tell you something." 
</P>
<P>
 Muranaka said his company has always provided year-round employment for its 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's something my father made a point of doing," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Muranaka's biggest competitor in the county, the giant Boskovich Farms, uses 
seasonal workers and labor contractors to harvest its crops. While the pay is 
sometimes better, Boskovich only guarantees three or four months of work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not singling out (Muranaka)," Brito said. "We don't want to break any 
company. We want to help make them profitable. We're just farther along at 
Muranaka. We'll get to Boskovich soon enough." 
</P>
<P>
 All of Muranaka's workers are not behind the strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Muranaka employee Mike Magdelano, now a manager for the company, said he does 
not understand why the workers are threatening to strike.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think they know that this is about the best place for them to work," 
Magdelano said, while checking parsley boxes being loaded onto trucks at 
Muranaka's Moorpark packing plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Magdelano, who has worked for the company for 20 years, said Muranaka takes 
care of its employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's opportunities to move up," he said. "And if it's better everywhere 
else, why do the workers always come back here?" 
</P>
<P>
 But union members argue that current conditions at the plant -- safety and 
cleanliness -- are more a result of their efforts than a reflection of the 
company's good will. Year-round employment was not guaranteed until the union 
negotiated that benefit in the 1980s, Brito said.

COUNT 'EM: 2 TRACKS; IT'S NOT A 'MONORAIL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We must set the record straight on the Ventura Freeway commuter rail 
alignment. The system proposed is not a monorail. It is a standard, two-track 
commuter train. 
</P>
<P>
 The continued use of the term "monorail" is deceptive and well chosen by its 
supporters, I am sure. It brings to peoples' minds a Disneyland/Alweg type 
system, which is nothing like what is being proposed. The proposal calls for a 
Chicago-style elevated train above the freeway. The continued use of the term 
"monorail" is at the least misleading and at the worst unethical. You should 
print a correction every time you print a letter or article using the term 
"monorail." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura Freeway alignment would do nothing for Ventura Boulevard, because 
it is so far away from it for most of its length. It is not within reasonable 
walking distance. The Burbank-Chandler route will serve more people, the 
business and civic centers of the Valley, and be more aesthetically pleasing. 
The "advisory vote" of 1990 is invalid because people voted for a "monorail" 
(thinking Disneyland style) and not what the current proposal is. New studies 
show the cost difference is minimal at best. 
</P>
<P>
 If the people of the Valley were properly informed, and the vote were taken 
again, I am sure the voters would not favor of the Chicago style "El" that is 
the current proposal for the freeway alignment.

 Further proof that the Small Business Administration is still out of touch 
with the real world:

 While rejecting two out of three applications from the Valley's shellshocked 
small-business owners desperately trying to piece their lives and futures back

 Why not take this pork-belly waste of tax dollars and loan it to small

 How could these Washington wonder boys overlook the Van Nuys swap meet, which

8,000 employees?

<P>
 Not to mention more than $250,000 in tax dollars not collected by these stores 
this year, because the swap meet remains closed for lack of SBA approval.

LOCKHEED IGNORED THE WRITING ON THE WALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The recent announcement of Lockheed's departure from Calabasas is not so 
surprising to some of us. You must first understand that this company is one of 
the last holdovers from a dwindling industry -- determined in the face of all 
reason to defy a changing world. I worked for Lockheed for 13 years, and when I 
recognized this futile determination, I jumped ship. 
</P>
<P>
 I had been sent by Lockheed to award a developmental defense contract to a 
company in West Germany (two weeks after the wall came down). There was 
electricity in the air everywhere in Europe. It was evident that Germany would 
be reunited and the Cold War would soon be over. 
</P>
<P>
 When most defense-related companies began to recognize this, they initiated 
efforts to expand into commercial markets. Some defense companies began to 
reapply their defense technology to commercial applications, while others 
acquired commercial companies for the same reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed destroyed the tooling for the L-1011 (its only viable commercial 
program and a superb aircraft) for a quick tax profit. Shortly after this 
event, Lockheed was forced to turn down an opportunity to bid on one of the 
largest aircraft orders it had seen in years because the cost of retooling the 
L-1011 was too high. All the while, Lockheed pushed on steadfastly, acquiring 
other defense companies and consolidating orders to pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
 In this sense, Lockheed is on target, for this is the only way to maintain 
growth in a shrinking market. The question is, "Do visionaries pursue shrinking 
markets?" The employees of Lockheed should be concerned. This company is not 
concerned with the community's interests nor the fate of its employees. It has 
one, and only one, mission -- to hold out until the last defense buck is 
coughed up. 
</P>
<P>
 Echoes of President Eisenhower's departure speech still ring in my ears.

HOME BIRTH EXPERIENCE NOT WITHOUT DANGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was extremely angered by the selfishness of Joanne and Bruce Shannahoff in 
relating their home birth experience ("Couple Finds Birth at Home Empowering, 
Safe and Comfortable," Oct. 4). 
</P>
<P>
 Although this couple was seemingly well-educated and well-prepared, their 
comments in regard to this "empowering" choice reeked of the me-generation. 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, birth is a natural event, but complications do arise and not 
infrequently. Immediate intervention by an obstetrician in a delivery room 
could mean the difference between life and death. 
</P>
<P>
 No place in the article was this most important issue addressed.

RACIAL ISSUES REMAIN STUDY IN INCONSISTENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your editorial regarding Glendale's new human relations panel ("African 
American Representation," Oct. 9) continues to reinforce two major problem 
issues in the area of race relations:  
</P>
<P>
 1. That blacks are the minority group with "the longest and bitterest memories 
of its past."What about the Asian immigrants to this country? The Native 
Americans? 
</P>
<P>
 2. The continued use of term "African Americans," which sets blacks apart like 
no other label could. The article mentions Filipinos, Koreans, Armenians and 
Latinos while using no qualifying adjectives such as Armenian-American. It is 
understood that these groups are Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interest of consistency, it seems that we should refer to whites, 
blacks, asians and so on in lower case or double up for every group in upper 
case as in Korean-American, African-American, Lithuanian-American and 
Anglo-American to name but a few.

'DEAD ZONE' RESULT OF PAST MISTAKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm afraid that once again the residents of Sherman Oaks are being misled by 
The Times: "A Good Idea Hits the Street" (Valley Perspective, Oct. 9.) 
</P>
<P>
 Once again we are being told that the planned development at Woodman Avenue 
and Ventura Boulevard will rescue that block from the blight it has suffered 
for the past six years. A "dead zone," to quote the editorial. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times' logic reminds me of the old story about the child who murdered his 
mother and father and threw himself upon the mercy of the court because he was 
an orphan. 
</P>
<P>
 The block was not blighted until the current developer had all the tenants 
evicted from their thriving stores so he could build an edifice that would 
stretch the limits of building density whether the neighborhood wanted it or 
not. No one was dissatisfied with the stores on that street, which included the 
popular Scene of the Crime bookstore, Mary's Lamb restaurant, an English import 
shop and others. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not blighted until the builder made it so. Now he wants to charge in on 
his bulldozer, paid for by a generous city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 What The Times did not report was that when the owner of the property finally 
decided that it would be in his best interests to rebuild the stores that were 
originally there, the city in its infinite wisdom demanded the kind of changes 
to Ventura Boulevard that are now being asked of the proposed high-density 
contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 Does that make sense? Only to elected officials who have to find the way to 
pay for their next election. Not to the residents. After all, we are only the 
voters. And we don't seem to matter in campaigns where now money talks louder 
than votes.

PRO-OSTRICH ARGUMENT IS FOR THE BIRDS; DESPITE OWNER'S CLAIM, THE CHATSWORTH 
HERD INDEED CONSTITUTES A COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The legal pendulum has swung against ostriches in the northwest Valley, and 
it's probably for the best. 
</P>
<P>
 The case involved a property owner in Chatsworth's exclusive Monteria Estates 
whose herd of ostriches and emus sometimes numbered upward of 800. 
Statistically speaking, that is enough ostriches and emus to fill every seat on 
two Boeing 747s. 
</P>
<P>
 Breeding the birds is in vogue nowadays: Ostriches are depicted as giant 
schmoos ready to save the world with wonderful meat, great leather, feathers, 
etc. In earlier generations, folks dreamed of wealth from chinchillas and 
earthworms. 
</P>
<P>
 But ostriches' strong points do not include neighborliness, and their 
proliferation among human populations is creating conflicts. The people in 
Chatsworth objected to the noise and smell, which they described in vivid 
detail. Zoning officials ordered the big-bird population cut to zero. 
</P>
<P>
 The case, now evidently headed for court, turns partly on the distinction 
between agricultural use, for which the land is zoned, and commercial use, 
which brings it under the law against nuisances. Property owner David Mohilef 
claims he is non-commercial because he merely houses the birds for eight 
months, observing them for desirable traits. Then they are shipped off to grow 
to breeding size. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials rejected the argument on reasonable grounds. Mohilef's place is 
part of the far-flung world of ostrich commerce, and he is part owner of the 
birds. Given their size and number, the operation sounds as if it has resembled 
a feedlot with an R & D wing more than a biology lab. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking the long view, the dispute has a familiar ring. 
</P>
<P>
 The writer Catherine Mulholland remembers that not long after World War II, 
before Monteria Estates acquired its name and guarded gate, the actor known as 
Sabu the Elephant Boy lived there with one or more elephants. "You could hear 
them trumpeting all over Chatsworth." 
</P>
<P>
 Another resident, Virginia Ditto, remembers that the elephants went away after 
Sabu's neighbors objected, probably by writing polite notes. 
</P>
<P>
 "In those days," she says, "people cared what the neighbors thought."

187: IT'S A RISKY PROPOSITION; HAZARDS OF IMMIGRATION MEASURE DWARF POTENTIAL 
BENEFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some of the people who say they are going to vote for Proposition 187 claim 
that it is a worthy way to stage a protest over illegal immigration, and that 
it will be an effective way of showing their anger over government inaction. 
</P>
<P>
 We're talking about the so-called "Save Our State" initiative on the November 
California ballot. This measure proposes to prohibit state and local 
governments from providing education, non-emergency health care and other 
social services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Its supporters include the San Fernando Valley's United Chambers of Commerce. 
Proponents say that government services entice many people into entering 
California illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, as protest votes go, those cast in support of this measure figure to be 
costly indeed, in many ways. We reiterate our strong opposition to Proposition 
187, and urge a no vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Illegal immigrants are drawn here not by hopes of citizenship and certainly 
not by welfare opportunities, but by jobs. Also, illegal immigrants are not 
generally eligible for welfare grants, except for some health-care services 
available to poor people and some child-welfare services or foster care. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that fact, supporters still claim that Proposition 187 will save the 
state considerable sums of money and will "strike a blow for the taxpayer that 
will be heard across America." It may indeed be heard across the nation . . . 
for reasons that would make Californians sorry they ever supported it. 
</P>
<P>
 In all honesty, the fiscal impact of the measure can only be roughly estimated 
and would be subject to legal interpretations. Consider all of the 
possibilities, however, and the risks created by Proposition 187's passage are 
simply too great. 
</P>
<P>
 Savings from denying benefits and services, for example, have been estimated 
at $200 million annually. OK, for the sake of argument, let's consider that 
possibility. But 187 also requires state and local agencies, hospitals, clinics 
and even the schools to take Draconian steps to ferret out and report suspected 
illegal aliens. 
</P>
<P>
 Those agencies and schools might incur potential first-year costs of more than 
$100 million to verify citizenship and enforce the measure. As one of the 
companies in the long-distance telephone wars is fond of saying: There goes 
your big savings. 
</P>
<P>
 More importantly, the state's nonpartisan legislative analyst says that the 
measure might place at risk an estimated $15 billion annually in federal 
funding for education, health and welfare programs due to conflicts with 
federal requirements. That's much too much of a risk to take to send a message. 
</P>
<P>
 We are referring here, in part, to the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Plyler 
vs. Doe that states it is a violation of the federal Constitution to exclude 
the children of illegal immigrants from elementary and secondary public 
schools. And there are other problems with this badly worded measure. 
</P>
<P>
 FERPA, or the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, generally prohibits 
schools that receive federal funds from disclosing information in student 
records without parental consent. That doesn't simply protect illegal aliens. 
It protects all of us, and Proposition 187 is in direct conflict with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the state's medical community opposes the measure on other grounds, 
particularly for the problem of communicable diseases that might escalate as a 
result of turning away sick people for illnesses that can be treated at 
relatively little cost. 
</P>
<P>
 And there is the law-enforcement opposition to Proposition 187. "It will deny 
thousands of kids the right to attend school," says Los Angeles County Sheriff 
Sherman Block, "and put them out on the streets, where they will be more 
vulnerable to turn to crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Are you really willing to take such great risks with the health and fiscal 
welfare of our state?

AHMANSON LAND DEAL: NOT EVERYONE AGREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every word of Susan Genelin's Valley Commentary article "Offer By Ahmanson 
Land Co. Is No Bargain" (Oct. 2) is true. 
</P>
<P>
 We need a Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy that works for the environment, 
not for developers. In the cases of the Ahmanson and Micor developments, our 
community is being asked to pay for these supposed "free" parklands, not only 
with public funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the Ahmanson project become a reality and Thousand Oaks Boulevard be 
connected to Las Virgenes Road, the stream of traffic from North Las Virgenes 
Road all the way to Malibu beach will be endless. Thus the real costs are the 
negative impacts of traffic and pollution that result from your increased 
density. We and future generations will pay for this every single day of our 
lives. And to lose our irreplaceable ecosystems as well makes this a bad deal 
for people and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Our community is with the conservancy 100% in its struggle to recover our 
neighboring land, currently owned by Japan-based Soka Corp. In this case, it is 
clearly working to obtain parkland, with the community and the environment both 
the beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservancy's mandate is to conserve the mountains! Many volunteers out 
here will help it fulfill that mandate without destroying the mountains in the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 JOAN H. KAY 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas 
</P>
<P>
 Kay is a board member of the Coalition to Preserve Las Virgenes * As a 17-year 
resident of the Conejo Valley and a 28-year resident of Ventura County, I must 
challenge the accuracy of the article by Susan Genelin, which suggested the 
Ahmanson project is a drain on the taxpayer. 
</P>
<P>
 I've followed this project from its inception, and this well-planned community 
certainly does not rely on public funding or the taxpayers' dollars. The 
development agreement indicates that no public funding is to flow to Ahmanson. 
It is a "developer-pays-all" contract including the cost of the remaining open 
space. 
</P>
<P>
 The accompanying cartoon, which cast Ahmanson as a company that is in the 
taxpayer's pocket, was an insult not only to the Ahmanson people but to all 
those readers who are aware that through the last 50 years Ahmanson has been a 
generous and responsible member of the community. It has made significant 
contributions to charities and institutions throughout Los Angeles and Ventura 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
 I suggest that you check on the facts before printing inflammatory and 
misleading information. Remember that Ahmanson Ranch will bring many, many 
benefits to the region, including the preservation of over 11,000 acres of open 
space.

HIDING OUT IRKS MURDER CASE WITNESS; MOTHER: WOMAN WHO TURNED SONS IN AND FLED 
HER HOME IN FEAR SAYS SHE NEEDS A JOB. SHE CALLS THE COUNTY'S PROTECTION 
PROGRAM INADEQUATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After turning in her two teen-age sons to police for murder and fleeing her 
home early this year because their gang member friends vowed to kill her, 
Marilyn Ross seems to have found the good life. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Azusa woman brought her young daughter back from hiding out of 
state and the two now live rent-free in a roomy home with a back-yard pool. 
Movie producers have phoned to discuss deals.  
</P>
<P>
 The William Morris Talent Agency represents her, and an attorney is working to 
get a book written about her story. 
</P>
<P>
 But the picture is far from idyllic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need a job," Ross said recently as she opened the door on her nearly empty 
refrigerator. So far, all she has been able to find are temporary stints. 
</P>
<P>
 Her footsteps echo on the bare wooden floor of her sparsely furnished living 
room. She points to a mattress on the floor in a corner of one room that serves 
as her bed.  
</P>
<P>
 She has had to fend off criticism from people who questioned her motives and 
whether she has been a fit mother. And she has nightmares of being murdered 
herself -- tracked down like the hunted person she is, to be shot and killed on 
the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ross counts herself luckier than most crime witnesses who go into 
hiding, she figures that much of the help came from her own persistent 
scrambling and from sympathetic strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's witness protection program, set up to aid crime witnesses facing 
threats, is woefully inadequate to the task, Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought they were going to hide me," she said. "I thought they were going 
to protect me."  
</P>
<P>
 Instead, she had to abandon her misperceptions, as others have before her, and 
face the reality of the sparse help available. Under the county's witness 
relocation program, only first and last month's rent on a new apartment are 
paid. 
</P>
<P>
 And outside help has been narrowed, Ross believes -- although some people 
familiar with her case disagree -- by a state Assembly bill that takes effect 
Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The Right to a Fair Trial bill prohibits crime witnesses from receiving 
payment for information about a crime for one year after the date of the crime 
or until a final court judgment is reached.  
</P>
<P>
 The bill was prompted by revelations that some witnesses in the O. J. Simpson 
case had sold their stories to the media, and will cut off outside help that 
crime victim-witnesses might use to sell their stories, Ross said. By 
prohibiting payment, the state is "asking you to come forth and put your life 
on the line." she added. 
</P>
<P>
 The crime that changed Ross' life occurred about 9 p.m. on Feb. 5 when Raj 
Kumar Sharma, 40, of Covina, a clerk at an Azusa market, was robbed, shot and 
killed for $72 in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross said that five days later, after an argument with his mother, her eldest 
son, Nicholas, 16, confessed to her that he and his younger brother had killed 
Sharma. Dumbstruck and fearful, Ross went to police and her days in hiding 
began. For six months, she called a hotel room home. 
</P>
<P>
 But after her story was published in The Times, a dizzying number of calls 
poured in from television talk shows, movie producers and talent agents, 
seeking interviews and possible story deals. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross was flown to New York City to appear on the nationally syndicated Rolonda 
Watts television show. On camera, she was confronted by her angry mother, Elsie 
Newman, 61, the boys' care giver for most of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Newman insisted that her grandsons are innocent, called Ross a negligent 
mother and accused her of abandoning her sons years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross has not been in touch with her sons' father since the boys were infants. 
</P>
<P>
 After initial interest, the movie deals dried up, said Rick Rosenthal, an 
attorney representing Ross. Producers who came forward wanted to pay Ross only 
a small sum and then shop around her story to the major studios on speculation, 
Rosenthal said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that Ross' race -- she is African American -- adds to her difficulty, 
limiting the commercial appeal of her story. Rosenthal said television 
producers prefer stories about perfect "Brady Bunch" families. Stories about 
minorities are a harder sell, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, hotel staff and others who had helped Ross said they began 
to resent her and accused her of making too many demands. They questioned her 
credibility and motives. 
</P>
<P>
 Some talked of money they lent Ross, which she never paid back. Some called 
her ungrateful and complained of the star attitude she seemed to take on in 
response to media coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sheriff's Sgt. Rey Verdugo, the detective assigned to the Azusa murder 
case, attributes Ross' behavior to stress. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime witnesses "suffer indignities, threats, having to relocate, get a new 
job, and all they've done is follow the law and do the right thing," he said. 
"And, suddenly, the whole world turns upside down for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Ross finally escaped her prolonged hotel stay when an ex-social worker heard 
her story on a news radio show and offered to put her up temporarily in a 
vacant rental home the person owned. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cops were going into their own pockets to help her, and there was nothing 
in place for someone who had done the honorable thing," said the former social 
worker, who requested anonymity. "I decided to see if I could help." 
</P>
<P>
 Ross now has a temporary job and her daughter is enrolled in school. She hopes 
to find a permanent job to begin paying rent when her free stay ends in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, her younger son, a 15-year-old, was convicted June 9 in Pomona 
Juvenile Court of the Azusa murder and robbery. He was sentenced to confinement 
in the California Youth Authority until age 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Her elder son, Nicholas, is scheduled to be tried as an adult later this 
month. Ross will probably be a key witness against him, said Verdugo and the 
county prosecutor assigned to the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Cary Rudman, an attorney in Sacramento who helped fashion the crime victim 
payment bill for Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, said Ross will be able to 
receive money for her story because the new law will probably not apply to her. 
Ross' involvement with the criminal justice system began before the law was 
proposed and goes into effect, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he said he sympathizes with someone in Ross' situation, he added that 
testifying in court should not be a paid financial arrangement but a basic 
responsibility of citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 "Testimony is voluntary," he said. "It's not designed to be a quid pro quo, 
predicated on money." 
</P>
<P>
 Her role as a witness and the threats against her life made her eligible for 
help from the county's witness relocation program. Ross, like many others, 
mistakenly thought the program would bring comprehensive help: personal 
security guards, a legal change of identity, relocation in a place far away, 
help with housing, food and a job. 
</P>
<P>
 But the program provides only first and last month's rent, usually in an 
apartment in Los Angeles County. Yearly, only about 120 people qualify for even 
this limited help countywide, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The system doesn't make allowances for the business of day-to-day life," 
Verdugo said. "The state, the feds, the county, the local government, no one is 
set up to pay those bills or to say, 'Let me get you a job.' . . . The 
reciprocity is not there." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Ross was luckier than most. 
</P>
<P>
 For six months, Compton police kept her in a city-owned hotel with free room 
service. Police Chief Hourie Taylor said Ross knew someone on the Compton 
police force who put her and her daughter in the hotel for a night. Compton 
police then agreed to extend her stay as a favor to the Sheriff's Department, 
which was investigating the Azusa murder, Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the days stretched into months, Ross said, when repairs to her disabled 
van came to a standstill. The county witness relocation program paid two 
months' rent on a new apartment for her. Sympathetic acquaintances in the hotel 
paid for her daughter's air fare out of state. But without transportation, Ross 
said, she was unable to move from the hotel and lost the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Ross said she was down to $100 in cash and all her belongings -- 
pots and pans, clothes and a personal computer -- piled in her non-working 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the threats against her, she said she feared returning to her 
apartment, her family and her former job as a real estate manager. Friends who 
knew of her plight were reluctant to help, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said, 'Gee, Marilyn, you can't come here. They might shoot up my house. 
Can I send you 10 dollars?' " Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
 To get by, Ross did odd clerical jobs and eventually landed a temporary job 
working on a political campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, no one knows her past in the quiet, suburban community where she lives. 
She said she walks in anonymity to the grocery store and feels safe. 
</P>
<P>
 But still she worries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I dreamed I got shot," she said, recalling the nightmare in which a gunman 
appeared as she was unloading groceries.

IT'S ACADEMIC: SCHOOL SUCCESS STARTS AT HOME; CUTTING KIDS' TV TIME AND MAKING 
THEM DO HOMEWORK MAY NOT BE POPULAR, BUT IT'S UP TO PARENTS TO IMPROVE THEIR 
CHILDREN'S EDUCATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD KAHLENBERG, Richard Kahlenberg of North Hollywood writes regularly 
for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. education secretary, Richard W. Riley, was out on the stump recently, 
trying to get parents involved in their children's education. He has been 
citing data gathered from various studies concluding that what happens at home 
is critical to how well young people learn. 
</P>
<P>
 I have a couple of reactions to that. I'm angry at the idea that national 
education policy now tells parents, "Hey, it's your problem" if kids don't 
learn anything at schools which we are required to support. At the same time, I 
suspect there is a lot of truth in what Riley is saying. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought of Riley's crusade recently when I heard that a house guest of a 
fellow resident of North Hollywood had been leading four red-blooded American 
kids in an unusual course of study. 
</P>
<P>
 The man is Jonathan Gift, a filmmaker who was born in the United States and 
educated here, in England and in France. He is staying at the home of a friend 
named Michael Hoggan, a film editor and single parent with four children in 
public schools. Starting last spring, Gift became something like a prefect, or 
upperclassman-taskmaster, for the Hoggan children. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Gift arrived, the kids were frittering away time they should have been 
using to do homework. Gift remembered that at the British prep school he 
attended, older students were made responsible for seeing that younger ones did 
their work. 
</P>
<P>
 He and Hoggan started a regime of "structured time" after school. For 90 
minutes the children now do something that would make Education Secretary Riley 
very happy -- their homework. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids weren't learning to work in school," Hoggan says. "We could never 
get child care that could make them work. They didn't set up time for 
homework." 
</P>

 When summer came and there wasn't any homework, Gift made his own assignments 
to Jaron, 6, Clinton, 9, Matthew, 12 and Joanna, 13. All summer, Monday through 
Friday, from 9 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., books got read, essays written, pianos played 
and artwork created. Afterward came playtime and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 The lesson is simple. Adults who are able and willing to take the time and 
exercise some authority can bring drastic changes to kids' mental lives. 
</P>
<P>
 And how much did the Hoggan kids love it? 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate structured time," teen-ager Joanna Hoggan says of her summer. But she 
adds, "it's good for Clinton." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, a fourth-grader at Toluca Lake Elementary School, actually agrees -- 
kind of. "I kind of like structured time," he says. "It helps me." Then he 
launches into a detailed account of the books he read. Asked if he feels the 
household's regime in any way got him ahead of the other fourth-graders, he 
reflects, "It didn't push me way ahead, but it pushed me ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 Jaron denounces structured time as boring, but this is an independent thinker. 
He also hates Barney and "Sesame Street." In an energetic display of a 
6-year-old's logic, he confesses to liking reading and discloses that on his 
first day in first grade, "The kids read slow, but I read fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Matthew, who started at Walter Reed Junior High this fall, has an interesting 
spin on things. "I think quiet time helps, but it would've probably been better 
two years ago," when he was closer to Clinton's age. "I loved jumping around 
and still don't like reading. Structured time forces us to do something we 
don't want to do. But we need to do it, so we should do it." 
</P>
<P>
 By now Secretary Riley would be doing high fives with the kid. 
</P>
<P>
 The dictum he has been delivering in speeches is that "controllable home 
factors account for almost all the differences in average student achievement 
across states." Also that "reading is more dependent on learning activities in 
the home than is math or science." He says this finding helps explain why the 
verbal scores in Scholastic Aptitude Tests have stubbornly resisted efforts to 
reverse decades of decline, while schools have improved in math. Nobody today 
reads to their kids. There's no time in a two-career day, or no books in the 
house, or too much TV. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to having become a stressed-out, overworked country, we have 
become indifferent to reading and writing. They are not seen as fashionable or 
profitable. The Hoggan children are careful when telling their peers about how 
they spent their summer. They emphasize the killjoy aspect, seeking sympathy. 
Clinton, an exception, says, "I tell my friends about reading and studying. I 
think it's interesting." But other kids don't seem impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton lives in the real world of the Valley today, not the one Jonathan Gift 
brought into the Hoggan household with his international luggage. Maybe few 
parents are really ready to limit their kids' TV time, make them do their 
homework and hone their kids' wits for international competitiveness. But I 
hope a lot of them are. I think that until the schools undergo a true 
revolution, it is the parents' problem, whether they like it or not.

TIME FOR CONTRACTORS TO BUILD A RAPPORT WITH CLIENTS; A HOMEOWNER HAMMERED BY 
THE NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE DISCOVERS THAT MANY SO-CALLED PROFESSIONALS WON'T 
EVEN RETURN A PHONE CALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA HECHT, Andrea Hecht of North Hills is a free-lance writer and owns a 
public relations firm.

<TEXT>
<P>
 I think the major miracle in my life, in addition to finding a man who'll put 
up with my idiosyncrasies, was that my West Valley condo survived the January 
quake. A bigger miracle would have been finding professional repair people to 
fix the damages or estimate a job or just return calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Like my friends and neighbors, I had badly damaged walls, ceilings and floors. 
So I figured I'd start with a painter. 
</P>
<P>
 The first painter I called never answered any of three messages I left. I 
moved on. The next three painters each made appointments to visit and price the 
job. Only one showed up. She said she'd mail me the full estimate. Maybe she 
thought I lived in the Big Valley, because her estimate never made its way to 
my North Hills mailbox. Thoroughly frustrated, I started chasing 
turpentine-scented trucks down Balboa Boulevard, seeking the phone number of 
any painter in a moving vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 I started to get that familiar sinking feeling of needing a salesperson in 
Target while three self-involved employees stand blindly by, discussing 
potential Saturday-night dates. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, after lots of false starts, I found a painter. But it hadn't been 
easy. So the prospect of hunting down someone to hang wallpaper started to make 
me nauseated. I put that mission on hold. 
</P>
<P>
 After my own less-than-entertaining episode with the painter, I began asking 
around. I discovered from friends and neighbors that, earthquake or not, 
recession or not, this seems to be the way the majority of repair and 
construction people operate. It's a search to find professionals who may or may 
not want your job, who may or may not ever show up on your property more than 
once, if that. 
</P>
<P>
 These professionals, who until recently were suffering through California's 
lengthy recession, do not appear grateful for the earthquake's impact on their 
collective bottom line. Does charging $50 for an estimate sound appreciative? 
It felt like an insult to me. 
</P>
<P>
 And estimate problems are just the tip of the hammer. Some experts show up 
with their attitude in hand, too. My friend Jackie needed to replace three 
cinder-block walls. A block-wall expert arrived at her Northridge home and 
seemingly would have preferred an anesthetic-free root canal to answering her 
questions. When she inquired about cinder-block versus wood walls, this expert 
said, "I must be wasting my time here if you don't even know what you want." 
Guess Mr. Cinder Block missed the course on interpersonal communication. 
</P>
<P>
 In truth there are such communication courses at six universities in 
California, offering a bachelor's degree in construction management. The chair 
of that department at Cal State Chico, Rovane Younger, says its graduates must 
take classes in marketing a construction business (i.e., building a referral 
business) and interpersonal communication skills in business. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stereotype of the tough-man construction guy cracking heads to get it all 
done is archaic," Younger says. "First of all, more and more women in the 
business are improving their people skills in the profession. Secondly, 
graduates today understand how the bottom line is affected, up and down, by 
developing and using these learned abilities." 
</P>
<P>
 Younger says the peculiar aspects of the construction and repair environment 
in the Valley right now might account for some of the problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's on the same timetable because the damage happened to everyone at 
exactly the same time," he says. "This means all the professionals in the area 
may not be able to meet this enormous demand." 
</P>
<P>
 Younger says he also thinks there simply are not enough companies in the 
immediate area to meet the huge needs of local residents, who have received 
more than $7 billion in insurance payments and nearly $670 million in funds 
from the Federal Emergency Management Agency for repair work. They are eager to 
begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Thacher of Thacher Construction says, "I think certain contractors who 
manage their work efficiently are spread thin because they are in the greatest 
demand." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, I can never find the experts who are efficient and in demand. I 
locate the confused people, who bring along their attitude instead of their 
tape measure. Most days I simply don't know what to do. I understand the law of 
supply and demand; I would like to remind the repair community of the Law of 
Nothing Lasts Forever, but I'm not sure how. 
</P>
<P>
 Younger has some advice for people like me. "Be demanding and precise in what 
you want," he says. "Get names and references from friends or relatives who are 
happy with their work. And I say if someone doesn't call back, drop him or her 
and find someone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Another suggestion is finding strength in numbers. "Form groups with families 
in your area and contact experts slightly out of your area where business is 
not so booming," he says. "There are many good companies a short distance away, 
like in Orange County, who would probably be glad for the opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 For me, the solution to my earthquake repairs is very easy. I'll just wait for 
the new graduates from Cal State Chico to arrive. I bet they'll return my phone 
call.

RHETORIC ON IMMIGRATION IS SHAMEFUL; ELIMINATING AUTOMATIC CITIZENSHIP FOR 
BABIES BORN IN THE U.S. WOULD ACCOMPLISH NOTHING BUT THE CREATION OF A NEW 
LEGAL UNDERCLASS IN AMERICA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON TASOFF, Ron Tasoff is an Encino attorney specializing in immigration law 
and a former chairman of the Southern California Chapter of the American 
Immigration Lawyers Assn. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As the November election draws close, illegal immigration has emerged the No. 
1 issue in the polls. In tune with what appears to be public sentiment, 
Democratic Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (Woodland Hills) and his Republican 
challenger in the 24th Congressional District, Richard Sybert, have tried to 
outdo each other in attacking illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Their positions may be "good politics," but they have deprived voters of a 
chance to debate the merits of various anti-immigration proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most extreme positions that both candidates have adopted is support 
for repealing the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, 
which provides that a person born in the United States and subject to its 
jurisdiction is a U.S. citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 They argue that repeal would eventually reduce governmental costs by 
eliminating some legal benefits that state and local governments are required 
to provide to its citizens. More significantly, they say, it would remove the 
presumed incentive for pregnant women to come here illegally to give birth and 
make their babies eligible for government benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, eliminating automatic citizenship would dissuade few people from 
coming here illegally. Benefits are a motivation only for a small proportion of 
illegal aliens. The prime motivation is jobs. Having a child who is a citizen 
does not qualify the mother or father for benefits, and the child must be over 
21 before he or she can help the parents gain legal status. The mighty lure of 
relatively high-paying jobs and a better life would remain. 
</P>
<P>
 The public funds actually saved would be insignificant. The U.S. Supreme Court 
ruled in Plyler vs. Doe that all children in the United States, regardless of 
immigration status, are entitled to primary education. Under long-established 
government policy, aliens even illegally in the United States are entitled to 
emergency medical assistance. There are far more effective methods for reducing 
governments' fiscal burdens. For instance, Washington could reimburse border 
states for these expenses and reform the welfare system. 
</P>
<P>
 The Citizenship Clause was adopted after the Civil War to ensure citizenship 
to the former slaves, in effect "forced immigrants," and to prevent the 
creation of an underclass living on American soil without the basic rights of 
citizenship. This was no radical idea at the time. The analogous legal doctrine 
of jus soli goes back to the feudal times, which obligated those born on the 
lands of the lord to owe allegiance to that lord and ultimately the king. This 
ancient rule of citizenship has been adopted in many countries. Both Canada and 
Mexico have similar provisions in their law. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the contrary legal doctrine of jus sanguinis, which grants derivative 
citizenship through parentage, is not universally followed. Each country 
decides when to extend citizenship to children born abroad. U.S. law is 
typically complex, with a child's right to citizenship based on his or her 
birth date and the parents' citizenship, marriage status and place and length 
of residence. 
</P>
<P>
 Deportation of an alien residing illegally from the United States requires a 
country willing to repatriate the individual. In countries that do not grant 
automatic citizenzhip at birth, many children are born stateless. It would be 
naive to think that other countries, such as Mexico, would accept a growing 
mass of unwanted people born here solely because U.S. immigration officials 
claim their parents came here illegally. These children would become America's 
problem, whether we like it or not.  
</P>
<P>
 Amending the citizenship clause would accomplish but one thing: It would 
create a new legal underclass in America. Like the former slaves, this 
underclass would probably be made up of people of minority races and the poor. 
They would not qualify for non-emergency medical care, education beyond 
secondary levels or jobs. And they would not be deportable to their parents' 
country of nationality. They would be illiterate, destitute, sick and homeless 
and a burden to the communities in which they lived. 
</P>
<P>
 History dictates that it is far wiser to enfranchise those on the edge than to 
exclude them politically and face the consequences of what can happen when 
people have nothing to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 Make no mistake. This is a radical and extreme proposal. It would not reduce 
illegal immigration. Its only purpose is to help candidates win office by 
scapegoating a group that cannot vote for problems that require unpopular 
solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no silver bullet that will stop illegal immigration. Mass migration 
of people is a phenomenon that stretches back to the beginning of our species. 
It is not a problem that can be "fixed" by some magic cure. It must be managed 
by an intelligent, coherent and flexible policy. It is a shame that those who 
want to lead us in Congress have shied away from a serious debate on 
immigration policy and instead have adopted simplistic rhetoric aimed to please 
those most likely to vote.

HISTORIC HILLVIEW MAY BE RAZED; LANDMARKS: OWNERS SAY COST IS TOO HIGH TO 
REPAIR THE HOLLYWOOD APARTMENT HOUSE, WHICH WAS DAMAGED BY THE JANUARY 
EARTHQUAKE AND RECENT SUBWAY WORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some of the elderly tenants at the Hillview Apartments have lived or worked in 
the landmark building long enough to remember when trolley cars rattled past on 
Hollywood Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The historic Hillview, at Hudson Avenue and Hollywood Boulevard, could soon go 
the way of the streetcars, leaving a couple of dozen low-income senior citizens 
hunting for a new home. 
</P>
<P>
 The southernmost third of the pink stucco, Mediterranean revival building was 
red-tagged by the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety after the Jan. 
17 earthquake. The rest of the building is considered safe. 
</P>
<P>
 But building owners say recent damage caused by Metro Rail subway construction 
along Hollywood Boulevard may result in demolition of the apartment house, 
which was built by movie mogul Jesse Lasky in 1917 for movie actors and is 
listed on the National Register of Historic Places. 
</P>
<P>
 A Metropolitan Transportation Authority spokesman said a cursory inspection by 
a private structural engineer found no damage directly related to subway 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 However, according to the Hillview's owners, about 12 tenants have been living 
in a local hotel since mid-August when gas service was interrupted as a result 
of Metro Rail construction. Last week, one of the owners told the remaining 10 
or so tenants to move within 20 days, ostensibly to prepare the way for 
demolition, a move that has drawn opposition from Los Angeles City Councilwoman 
Jackie Goldberg. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because it's so badly damaged, we can't afford to fix it," said D. V. 
Hanneken, one of the building's owners. "There's not enough income from rentals 
to run it." 
</P>
<P>
 Leif Hetland, representative of a trust that owns half of the Hillview, 
confirmed that he and the other owners are seriously considering demolition and 
are also planning to file a claim against MTA for unspecified damages from 
subway construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Hetland said the owners have not yet applied for a demolition permit from the 
city. Because of the building's historic status, the proposed demolition would 
be subject to an environmental review. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg, who hopes to save the building, is objecting to the landlord's 
action on grounds that the city's rent control ordinance requires a 30-day 
notice and $5,000 relocation subsidies to elderly tenants in the event of 
demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have an elderly person who's been in an apartment for a long period 
of time, evicting them is tantamount to a death sentence," said Rod Field, a 
lawyer at the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles, which is advising tenants. 
"You're taking them out of their world, a place where their family is each 
other." 
</P>
<P>
 Field and others said the tenants would probably have a hard time finding 
other affordable housing in Hollywood. Rents at the Hillview start at $375 for 
a single apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 For 21 years, Margaret Vargo has lived alone in a small, second-floor 
apartment at the Hillview. The 80-year-old retired bookkeeper said she has no 
plans to leave, even though she's packed a few of her belongings just in case. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's cool here in the summer, and nice and quiet, at least when the windows 
are closed," she said one evening last week. "Some of the old things should be 
preserved, shouldn't they?"

SOME MUST PAY FEE TO USE PARKS; RECREATION: GROUPS FROM OUTSIDE CLAREMONT MUST 
BUY PERMIT TO GATHER IN CERTAIN AREAS. DETRACTORS SAY POLICY IS RACIST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Rejecting charges of racism, the Claremont City Council decided last week to 
charge large groups and out-of-towners for reserving prime park spots to 
guarantee their access to them. 
</P>
<P>
 For two years, the city has been crafting a policy to give Claremont residents 
primary access to the city's 15 parks after complaints from constituents that 
their parks were being overrun by large groups and outsiders. The majority of 
large groups using the picnic spots come from out of town, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But some residents have labeled the action as "institutional racism," saying 
the largely white college town is trying to exclude people from the 
surrounding, mainly minority, communities. Claremont is 76.1% white; its 
southern neighbor, Pomona, is 71% minority, according to the 1990 U.S. Census. 
</P>
<P>
 The fee system requires any large group -- defined as 50 or more people -- 
that uses designated prime areas such as picnic tables to have a city permit or 
face ejection. Those without a permit will be given a warning until next July. 
City residents must pay $35 for a permit; non-residents must pay $80. 
</P>
<P>
 For smaller gatherings, residents can reserve a spot at no charge; 
non-residents must pay $45. The smaller outside groups can use the space free 
if they don't reserve it, but must take the chance that it will be open. 
</P>
<P>
 Claremont is not the first to take such steps. Similar practices prevail at 
Arcadia's Wilderness Preserve and San Marino's Lacy Park; La Verne is 
considering such a policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a separatist action of institutional xenophobia," said Robert Herman, 
who lives next to Memorial Park. "We're going to go over to a group and say: 
'You can't be here. You have to go over to that part of the park.' 
</P>
<P>
 "That's uncivilized. It's like saying to someone: 'Go and sit in the back of 
the bus. . . .' It's Jim Crow all over again with leave the good table for us." 
</P>
<P>
 But several council members said residents were paying for the parks through 
landscape and lighting assessments and increasingly were being kept from using 
them because more large groups from outside the city were using the most 
desirable spots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard some anecdotes of small families from Claremont who've gone to a 
park and found outside people have taken over the park," Mayor Algird G. Leiga 
said. Leiga dismisses the charge of trying to keep minorities out as spurious 
and said the policy really concentrates on large groups. "If a large group 
comes from Beverly Hills, Arcadia or wherever, we are going to charge." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 67 large groups that the city knows used Claremont parks from May, 
1993, to May, 1994, 51 were from out of town, according to the city Parks 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Judy Cody said large areas of the parks will require no 
reservations and will be open to the public.

A LATE BLOOMER BLOSSOMS; PAINTING: IT WAS NOT UNTIL JESSE ETAYO ENROLLED IN A 
COLLEGE ART CLASS FIVE YEARS AGO THAT HE LEARNED TO EXPRESS HIMSELF AS AN 
ARTIST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA FELDMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Watercolor artist Jesse Etayo has this advice for people who, like himself, 
bloom a little late in life: "Older people should express themselves and not be 
afraid of ridicule. No matter what you do or how, be yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 Etayo, 65, speaks with authority. It was not until he enrolled in a community 
college art class five years ago that he learned how to express himself as an 
artist. 
</P>
<P>
 And he has not faced ridicule or reproach. His paintings, Impressionist sorts 
of works that usually depict nature scenes, have sold for $200 to $950 at art 
shows. He recently sold 20 watercolors in a one-man show at the Santa Monica 
Main Library. 
</P>
<P>
 Etayo was born in Lagrono, a small city in the north of Spain. He was the 
youngest of 13 children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was the end of the tale. I was both neglected and overwhelmed with 
affection," he said from his studio in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 The family left Spain during that country's civil war in the 1930s and settled 
in Venezuela, where Etayo grew up. Both parents died when he was 18, and he 
decided to begin a new life. 
</P>
<P>
 He arrived in Baton Rouge, La., with $150, not knowing a word of English, 
without a job, a family or an idea of what he was going to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew one thing: I was going to explore and learn the American way of life. 
I instantly engaged and knew this was going to be my place," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He enrolled in an English-language course and three months later had enough 
money for a train ticket to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 A friend had tried to persuade him to go to Minneapolis, but he says he 
checked the weather conditions and chose California. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, he finished high school, attended community college while doing odd jobs 
and was drafted during the Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
 When he returned, he went to UCLA, graduated with a bachelor's degree in 
general science, earned a master's degree in Portuguese and Spanish literature 
-- he hopes to someday write and illustrate children's books in Spanish -- and 
spent the next 30 years managing chemical tests in a medical laboratory at 
UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 During that time, he married his wife, Madeline, and raised a son -- along 
with six nieces and nephews. 
</P>
<P>
 Every step Etayo took -- from learning the language of his new country, to 
getting an education, to marrying and raising his own family and the children 
of his brothers and sisters -- helped secure his future. 
</P>
<P>
 Since childhood, however, he had always wanted to be an artist. So throughout 
his life, he has taken art courses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew eventually I wanted to be an artist, but I had all the 
responsibilities. I think it was my destiny because I had it on my mind since I 
was a child," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not until he was 60 and enrolled in a watercolor class at Emeritus College in 
Santa Monica did his artistic talent blossom. 
</P>
<P>
 Etayo credits Emeritus College with nurturing his talent and giving him the 
opportunity to associate with other artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Marilyn Hall, assistant dean of special programs and director of Emeritus, 
said: "It's always nice to see the connections between our classes, students 
and the community, and Jesse's work does that -- it's the epitome of what 
Emeritus is all about." 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't imitate nature, but I could create with my own fantasies what I 
saw," Etayo said. 
</P>
<P>
 And so the purple trees he paints make a lot of sense to him and anyone else 
who has ever resented being told when they were young that there's no such 
thing as purple trees.

 "Everyone has a way of expressing their own charm and beauty, and sometimes 
you think other people won't see it, but they do if it's authentic," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Etayo says he is serious about his work but does not want to be part of the 
competitive art world. He's going to leave that responsibility to Madeline. 
</P>

 "Somebody has to manage that part, because the artist works from the heart," 
she said.

ARIZONA IS ONE KICK BETTER, 10-7 
</P>

<P>
 Arizona and Washington State played in a Pacific 10 Conference showdown 
Saturday that lived up to its billing. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense, defense and more defense.  
</P>
<P>
 That's what was expected and that was what was played as Arizona held on to 
defeat the Cougars, 10-7, to take sole possession of first place in the Pac-10 
before a standing-room-only crowd of 37,600 at Martin Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 In a game that saw Arizona's Matt Peyton and Washington State's George Martin 
combine for 20 punts, the Wildcats survived a last-minute field-goal attempt 
for the second consecutive year when the Cougars' Tony Truant missed what would 
have been the game-tying kick from 44 yards with 16 seconds to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew going into the game that it was going to come down to a field goal," 
said Arizona kicker Steve McLaughlin, whose 27-yard field goal in the third 
quarter proved to be the difference. "Just look at the two teams and their 
defenses, plus how the games ended the last two years, and you had to figure 
that a kicker would decide the outcome." 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Aaron Price missed a 49-yarder on the final play of the game in 
the Wildcats' 9-6 victory at Tucson. Two years ago, Price made a 47-yarder with 
31 seconds left to give Washington State a 23-20 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona, which started the game ranked No. 14, is 3-0 in the Pac-10 and holds 
a half-game lead over USC and a one-game lead over Washington State and 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 With a 5-1 overall record, the Wildcats control their own destiny in their 
search for the first Rose Bowl berth in school history, and they can thank 
their defense for their success. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona, which started the game with the nation's No. 5 scoring defense, shut 
down the Cougars for all but one play, sacked Washington State quarterback Chad 
Davis seven times and limited the Cougars to five yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew that we had to come here and just shut them down," Wildcat linebacker 
Sean Harris said. "We knew that we couldn't let them get started and gain any 
confidence. We had to take it to them for the whole game, and that's what we 
did." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington State did gain 224 yards in total offense, thanks to Davis -- who 
completed 15 of 30 passes -- but the Wildcats stopped the Cougars when they 
needed to, except for one big play in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 After two possessions that ended in punts to start the game, Washington State 
scored first on a first-down pass from deep inside its territory. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when Davis pump-faked to lure Arizona cornerback Spencer Wray forward 
and then lofted a deep pass to Albert Kennedy, who outfought Wray for the ball 
to complete an 85-yard scoring play with 5:24 remaining in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 For a while, the Cougars, who began the game with the No. 1 scoring defense in 
the nation, gave Arizona's offense problems with an eight-man defensive front 
that shut down the Wildcats' running game. 
</P>
<P>
 With linebackers Mark Fields and Ron Childs playing almost at the line of 
scrimmage, Arizona tailback Ontiwaun Carter -- who had averaged 141 yards 
rushing a game -- scarcely found room to run early as he gained only 37 yards 
in 15 first-half carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona turned things around when it forced Washington State to punt from its 
goal line to start the second quarter. With good field position for the first 
time in the game, the Wildcats took three plays to drive to Washington State's 
34. 
</P>
<P>
 On a third-down and inches, Arizona caught the Cougars sleeping when 
quarterback Dan White faked an inside handoff to fullback Jason Patterson over 
right guard and passed to a wide-open Tim Thomas down the left for a 34-yard 
touchdown to tie the score, 7-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, a senior walk-on tight end, could not have picked a better time to 
make the first catch of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dan looked right first and then he looked right at me," Thomas said. "I knew 
I was open. . . . I just didn't want to drop the ball. But once I caught it, 
there was no way I was not going to get into the end zone." 
</P>
<P>
 McLaughlin's field goal with nine minutes remaining in the third quarter made 
it 10-7 and from there it was a matter of ball control on offense and 
bend-but-don't-break defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington State can now only hope for help to reach Pasadena on New Year's 
Day for the first time since 1931. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to win so bad that at times, I know I was trying to score myself," 
said Washington State defensive end Dwayne Sanders, who had two sacks and three 
pass deflections. "It's frustrating, because we felt that this is our year to 
go to the Rose Bowl."

IN THE END, IT PROVES TO BE NO CONTEST -- AUBURN WINS; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: TIGERS 
CAPITALIZE ON MISMATCH IN FINAL MINUTE AND BEAT NO. 1 FLORIDA, 36-33. WINNING 
STREAK REACHES 18. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 They stopped short of calling Florida's coaches stupid, but not by much. The 
words formed on their lips, the temptation to rip never more appealing than 
after the Tigers' last-minute 36-33 shocker over the No. 1-ranked Gators on 
Saturday at Florida Field. 
</P>
<P>
 Why, asked Auburn's players with a smirk, did some Gator rocket scientist in 
the coaches' booth -- a.k.a. defensive coordinator Bob Pruett -- decide free 
safety Michael Gilmore could cover the Southeastern Conference's third-best 
wide receiver, Frank Sanders, one on one? 
</P>
<P>
 Gilmore is listed at 5 feet 11, 180 pounds. He was a Rhodes Scholar finalist 
last year but is not to be confused with anyone who can actually jump. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders is 6-2, 200 pounds, and the player Florida Coach Steve Spurrier had 
identified earlier in the week as Auburn's go-to player, especially on lob 
passes. 
</P>
<P>
 So what happened? With 36 seconds to play, Auburn trailing by four points, the 
ball on the Florida eight-yard line, Sanders trotted into position and saw 
Gilmore poised in front of him. Worse yet for the Gators, Auburn quarterback 
Patrick Nix saw him too. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders sprinted for the end zone. Nix lofted the ball toward the left corner. 
Gilmore and the Gators died. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to question their defensive strategy on that one," said Nix, who 
completed 28 of 51 passes for 319 yards and three touchdowns. "They put 
(Gilmore) over Frank and blitzed us . . . on the eight-yard line. We can't 
throw the ball too far down the field, so I don't know why they blitzed." 
</P>
<P>
 It was one of nearly two dozen crucial mistakes the Gators made. 
</P>
<P>
 The Florida Flop in detail: five interceptions (four by former Heisman Trophy 
candidate Terry Dean, who was mercifully benched midway through the third 
quarter), one fumble, nine penalties, five sacks given up and one of the 
strangest defensive calls you ever will see. 
</P>
<P>
 "They gave Frank man-to-man coverage, and as soon as we saw it, it was like 
little kids at Christmas," Nix said. "It was there and we both knew it was 
there. As soon as we got up to the line of scrimmage I knew it was going to be 
a touchdown." 
</P>
<P>
 The victory ended Florida's stay atop the polls, its dreams of an undefeated 
season and, possibly, its chance at a national championship. Now the Gators 
(5-1) will have to depend on the kindness of strangers -- in other words, 
anyone who plays still-unbeaten Auburn (7-0), Nebraska, Penn State and 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 Also gone was Spurrier's string of 15 consecutive home victories against 
Southeastern Conference opponents, to say nothing of his pregame contention 
that No. 6-ranked Auburn was something of a pretender, that the Tigers' 
schedule was almost laughable.  
</P>
<P>
 "I told our team we didn't coach our best game and a lot of players did not 
play their best game," said a slightly humbled Spurrier, whose trademark visor 
had grass stains from all the times he slammed it to the turf. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean was nine of 17 for 126 yards, one touchdown and the four interceptions, 
two of which resulted in a field goal and a touchdown for Auburn. A fumbled 
snap by Dean accounted for another Tiger field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida's offensive line couldn't handle Auburn's front four, and Florida's 
defensive line couldn't sack Nix. That might explain why Nix, pulled earlier in 
the season by Auburn Coach Terry Bowden, had career highs Saturday in attempts, 
completions and yardage. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was especially sweet for Bowden, whose team had listened to 
Florida's staff and players issue assorted slights against the Tigers, who 
extended their NCAA-best victory streak to 18. The schedule was soft. . . . 
Auburn's 38-35 victory over Florida last year was a fluke. This would be 
different, Florida vowed. 
</P>
<P>
 So much for vows. Four of Spurrier's last five defeats have come against the 
Bowden family, two against Terry, two against Terry's father, Florida State 
Coach Bobby Bowden. In all, Spurrier is 1-5 against Terry and Bobby. 
</P>
<P>
 "We come down here, 16-point underdogs, and beat them again," said Terry 
Bowden, whose team is ineligible for postseason play because it is on probation 
for NCAA violations. "You tell me, should we be No. 1? I say yes." 
</P>
<P>
 The Gators couldn't stop anybody when it counted. They botched the coverage 
against Sanders in the waning moments and were fooled in the second quarter 
when Sanders ran a 28-yard reverse for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was Tiger tight end Andy Fuller, who entered the game with two 
receptions for 41 yards. Against Florida, Fuller had seven catches for 115 
yards and one touchdown. Wide receiver Thomas Bailey had 10 for 117 yards and a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ain't caught that many passes in high school or Pop Warner ball," Fuller 
said. "I figured after the second time they would probably pick up on it." 
</P>
<P>
 They didn't. Florida was a mess all day -- and still the Gators had a 33-29 
lead with 1:45 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 But for reasons still not clear, the Gators decided to pass on third and 15 
from their 29-yard line. They could have run, knocked precious time off the 
clock, forced Auburn to use its second of three timeouts and then punted and 
forced the Tigers to drive 70 or so yards for the winning touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Spurrier, who prides himself on calling the plays, instructed Danny 
Wuerffel to throw for the first down. Wuerffel had played well in relief -- 
completing 10 of 13 passes for 171 yards and three touchdowns -- but this time 
made his only mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 With no Florida receiver in sight, Wuerffel threw anyway and then watched as 
free safety Brian Robinson made the interception, his third of the day. The 
Tigers started at their 45-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were not trying to lob it down the middle again, I can assure you of 
that," Spurrier said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers had 1:20 and two timeouts to move 55 yards. Nix found Sanders for a 
13-yard gain. Later, on third and 10 at the Florida 42, Sanders dropped a pass 
that hit him in the hands. 
</P>
<P>
 With 51 seconds to play and no choice but to try for the first down, Nix found 
Bailey for 14 yards. By then the Tigers were out of timeouts. So chaotic was it 
on the Auburn sideline that Nix was lobbying for one play while someone in the 
Tiger coaching box was sending down another. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, assistant coach Jimbo Fisher told Nix to run the play sent from 
upstairs. Nix did, but not before changing the formations at the last moment. 
</P>
<P>
 It worked. Nix passed to Willie Gosha for 20 yards to the Florida eight. Next 
came the Sanders-Gilmore matchup. 
</P>
<P>
 "All you can see is the rotation on the ball and a once-in-a-lifetime chance," 
Sanders said. "Everybody's waiting for you to make something happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders did his part. Afterward, while walking back to the team bus, Sanders 
stopped in the painted end zone and pointed to the exact spot he caught the 
winning pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right there . . . on that Florida," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It figures.

WALTERS FUELS USC, 27-20, PAST STANFORD; TROJANS: SOPHOMORE CARRIES 31 TIMES 
FOR 234 YARDS AND TWO TOUCHDOWNS. ROB JOHNSON SUFFERS ANKLE INJURY AGAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Shawn Walters doesn't look much like Marcus Allen, but his numbers are 
starting to.  
</P>
<P>
 The USC sophomore tailback had another 200-yard-plus game, including a 61-yard 
touchdown run in the waning moments, a play that would prove decisive in a 
27-20 Trojan victory over Stanford before 60,345 on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 USC (4-2 overall, 3-1 in the Pacific 10) has now won two in a row on the road, 
both games decided in the final minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 This was another expensive victory, however. 
</P>
<P>
 The sprained right ankle that kept senior quarterback Rob Johnson out of last 
week's victory at Oregon State was injured again, and once again his relief 
man, sophomore Brad Otton, came on to become the winning quarterback.  
</P>
<P>
 Johnson was injured when hit by linebacker Jason White with 8:40 left in the 
second quarter. At that point, he had completed seven of 10 passes for 109 
yards and a touchdown.  
</P>
<P>
 Otton, the 6-foot-6 sophomore transfer from Weber State, was 10 for 20 for 114 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford (1-4-1, 0-3), lost despite a 27-for-44, 344-yard night by its senior 
quarterback, Steve Stenstrom. It was a night when Stenstrom, Rob Johnson's 
former El Toro High teammate, became Stanford's all-time passing yardage 
leader, passing John Elway by 277 yards in reaching 9,626. 
</P>
<P>
 But Stanford lost, for the fourth consecutive game.  
</P>
<P>
 And the man most responsible for that was Walters, the six-foot, 220-pound 
tailback from Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 He had 31 carries for 234 yards, the most for a Trojan runner since Allen had 
243 against Cal in 1981. And when USC needed a big play at the finish, he ran 
with speed he hadn't yet shown. 
</P>
<P>
 With USC leading by 20-13, the Trojans had a first down on their 39 with 3:56 
to play after linebacker Erroll Small intercepted Stenstrom.  
</P>
<P>
 Walters' play was a sweep to the right.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was just trying to get that first down," he said afterward.  
</P>
<P>
 "But when I got around that first guy, I thought I had a chance to take it all 
the way." 
</P>
<P>
 Walters, who woke up last Saturday morning with flu and largely gave way to 
backup Rodney Sermons at Oregon State, came back emphatically in USC's 13th 
victory over Stanford in the last 15 games.  
</P>
<P>
 Walters is closing in on a 1,000-yard season. He now has 712, already 
surpassing the 641 he had as a freshman last year.  
</P>
<P>
 "Shawn was an absolute star tonight," Coach John Robinson said. "He was a 
dominant player. 
</P>
<P>
 "This team is showing spark and spunk; I think it'll be around for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Walters said his job Saturday was to take the pressure off Johnson, and then 
Otton.  
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to take the pressure off the quarterbacks by getting first downs on 
the ground, and we did that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford took a 10-0 lead, but the Trojans went ahead by 17-10 lead with 17 
seconds left in the first half on Cole Ford's 17-yard field goal. Earlier in 
the second quarter, Walters' four-yard touchdown gave the Trojans a 14-10 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third quarter, USC's defense stopped Stanford fullback Adam Salina on 
fourth and goal at the Trojan two. After the Trojans went 92 yards in 5 minutes 
39 seconds, Ford kicked a field goal from 23 yards to make the score 20-10 with 
2:33 to go in the quarter. Otton was five for eight passing during the drive, 
the big play a 23-yard play to Keyshawn Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford's Eric Abrams kicked a 32-yard field goal to make the score 20-13 
late in the third quarter, and then Walters' long run seemed to put it out of 
reach.  
</P>
<P>
 But Stenstrom wasn't finished. Throwing eight consecutive times on a 77-yard, 
10-play drive, he connected with Brian Manning on a four-yard play at the goal 
line to make the score 27-20. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford, with 2:02 to play, tried an onside kick that was recovered by USC 
freshman Larry Parker at the Trojan 45. USC stalled and John Stonehouse had to 
punt with 24 seconds to go. 
</P>
<P>
 He kicked a 40-yarder and the game ended with Stenstrom throwing long passes 
that fell incomplete.  
</P>
<P>
 It was nearly a thousand-yard game. USC finished with 489 total yards, 
Stanford 494. Stanford Coach Bill Walsh said his defense might have wobbled in 
the stretch.  
</P>
<P>
 "Four or five of our defensive guys played the whole game. . . . There may 
have been some fatigue," he said. "We played extremely well at times and 
self-destructed at others." 
</P>
<P>
 Said USC defensive coordinator Don Lindsey: "Those skill people in that 
Stanford offense are all seniors and they really know how to execute. We gave 
up a lot of yards, but we also had a lot of big plays when we needed them too. 
Our young guys are growing up fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Walters had 127 yards in 16 carries in the first half. When he gave USC its 
first lead, 13-10, he did it on a four-yard run over the left side, as Johnson 
was circling the track on a cart bound for the locker room, two bags of ice 
taped to his ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans' go-ahead score came after Stanford was penalized for having too 
many players on the field on a USC punt. Set up with a first down at the 
Stanford 42, Otton got USC to the Stanford four on a pass to Keyshawn Johnson 
and Walters took it in from there. Coming On Strong

UCLA SINKS TO NEW LOW IN 23-14 LOSS; BRUINS: FIFTH CONSECUTIVE DEFEAT -- THIS 
ONE TO OREGON STATE -- LEAVES DONAHUE'S TEAM IN THE CONFERENCE CELLAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's still a four-speed offense with third gear missing, and, because of that, 
UCLA is looking up at the rest of the Pacific 10 Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins lost for the fifth consecutive week, this time to Oregon State, 
23-14, in a game at the Rose Bowl on Saturday that matched teams that were 
winless in the conference and looked like it. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's mission was not necessarily victory, but avoiding a loss, which is not 
so much a matter of semantics as of approach to offense. The Beavers (2-4, 1-3) 
run the wishbone, seeking to grind out yardage on the ground. They did so 
because quarterback Don Shanklin was able to pick the UCLA defense apart. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was Oregon State's first win in the Rose Bowl ever," said Beaver Coach 
Jerry Pettibone. "This was probably one of the biggest victories in our 
school's history. Shanklin had a good game. He executed our offense well, but 
it was not just one player who gave us this win." 
</P>
<P>
 No, Shanklin had plenty of help, but he was the catalyst. 
</P>
<P>
 He finished with 159 yards in 17 carries, including a 72-yard play that was 
the sixth-longest by an opponent in UCLA history and a five-yard run for the 
game's final touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 When he wasn't carrying the ball, he was pitching it to J.J. Young, who scored 
the game's first touchdown on a 16-yard run and finished the night with 157 
yards in 23 carries; fullback Sedrick Thomas, who bulled 12 times for 56 yards; 
and Cameron Reynolds, who scored on a one-yard dive to make it 16-6 and blocked 
all night for Young. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were desperately trying to get our season turned around tonight," said 
UCLA Coach Terry Donahue. "Shanklin played a real sound game, and they played 
well early on defense to keep us from scoring touchdowns. We're just having a 
tough time getting the ball in the end zone." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA (2-5, 0-4) had a couple of long pass plays, Wayne Cook completing 17 of 
32 passes for 270 yards and a touchdown, and hitting Kevin Jordan on gains of 
46 and 52 yards, but most of the night the Bruins sent Sharmon Shah on forays 
into the Beaver line. Shah rushed 25 times for 131 yards, his third 100-yard 
effort of the season but his first since the Bruins were 2-0 after beating 
Southern Methodist. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the last time they won or, for that matter, led a game. 
</P>
<P>
 They came close, to within 7-6 with 7:29 to play in the third quarter on Bjorn 
Merten's 22-yard field goal, which closed out an 87-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beavers answered on Randy's Lund's 34-yard field goal with 2:03 to play, 
finishing a 48-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Successful twice after missing six of his last eight field-goal attempts, 
Merten was called upon again in the fourth quarter, but missed from 32 yards 
after Shah's three-yard touchdown run was nullified because of a holding 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 To make things more difficult for the Bruins, Oregon State then embarked on a 
touchdown drive of 80 yards, Reynolds leaping the final yard to make it 16-6 
with 10:32 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 To add insult to injury, Shanklin's five-yard touchdown run finished off a 
90-yard Oregon State drive that used 16 plays and ate time that UCLA needed to 
mount a last-ditch effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Too little, too late, the Bruins did score with 17 seconds to play, Cook 
finding Jordan on a five-yard touchdown pass, and running for a two-point 
conversion, the game's final points. 
</P>
<P>
 In a game of two teams trying not to lose, it appeared for much of the first 
half that neither would. UCLA's Darren Schager and Oregon State's Doug Stuckey 
engaged in a punting duel that Schager won, but the Bruins' field position 
advantage seemingly had no value. 
</P>
<P>
 Schager's best punt, a 38-yarder to the Oregon State two-yard line, seemed to 
offer the best hope for the UCLA defense, but Shanklin took care of that. 
</P>
<P>
 He gave to Reynolds for 10 yards to offer breathing room, then took off on his 
own, ducking between the Bruins' Brian Willmer and Abdul McCullough, then 
splitting the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Guidry prevented the touchdown, chasing Shanklin out of bounds on the 
UCLA 16 after a run of 72 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 It set up the next play, a 16-yard pitchout, from Shanklin to Young, who 
followed Reynolds' block to the right and scored with 3:15 to play in the first 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gave them momentum," Donahue said. "We had a good punt, and when you have 
them backed up like that, you've just got to keep them backed up. It was a 
great job by Oregon State, getting that ball out and going the distance with 
it. It was a huge drive in the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Seemingly trying to match Oregon State run for run most of the night, the 
Bruins tried to match the Beavers score for score, moving 60 yards in 10 plays 
before stalling. Merten's 21-yard field goal cut the Beaver lead to 7-3 with 19 
seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an ugly scoring drive, including an intentional grounding call when 
Cook threw a pass earthward because Daron Washington was covered on a screen 
pass; and a holding penalty that cost 13 yards. But it also included Cook 
completing six passes in a row after the grounding call. 
</P>
<P>
 He found Avery Anderson with a pass of 27 yards on third and 24 from the Bruin 
22 and added passes of 18 yards to Jordan and 20 more to Anderson, the last 
moving the ball to the Oregon State seven. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook then hit Washington, but Tongue had him shadowed for no gain. Cook 
scrambled for no gain, and then a gain of three yards before the Bruins opted 
to have Merten kick the field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an option that Donahue eschewed earlier in the half, seeking a first 
down on a fourth-and-three play from the Oregon State 29. Running from the 
shotgun, Washington was stopped for no gain and the ball went over to the 
Beavers.

ABORTED TRADE IS NOT FORGOTTEN, BUT KEMP BECOMES A RICH SONIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY HENRY, THE EVERETT HERALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Do you really think $46 million can buy happiness? Do you really think it can 
make a person feel secure? 
</P>
<P>
 Do you really think it can salve old wounds? 
</P>
<P>
 We'll see, won't we? We'll see as the rest of Shawn Kemp's basketball career 
unfolds. 
</P>
<P>
 Given a one-year contract extension worth $20 million that pushes the value of 
his total contract to more than $46 million, Kemp reported to the Seattle 
SuperSonics camp last Monday, three days late. 
</P>
<P>
 Better late than never, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 Was the re-writing of his contract done to bring it in line with what power 
forwards in the NBA are being paid or was this a way to try and take the hurt 
out of his bruised ego from the draft day trade that wasn't made: Kemp for the 
Chicago Bulls Scottie Pippen? 
</P>
<P>
 It was no doubt meant to serve both purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 But do you really think Kemp is going to get over the trade that wasn't 
consummated anytime soon? 
</P>
<P>
 Put yourself in his shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 You're a star in the NBA. The guy on your team. Loved by the hometown fans. 
Respected by your NBA peers. A fixture on the Sonics. Or so you thought. 
</P>
<P>
 Then one day you wake up and hear that they're trying to trade you. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to get rid of me? A great player like me? What'd I do to deserve 
this? Don't they love me anymore?" 
</P>
<P>
 If Shawn Kemp were 34 years old and on the decline, he might be better able to 
accept a trade. But Kemp is 24 and not even in the prime of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 You bruise more easily when you're young than when you're old and near the end 
of your career. 
</P>
<P>
 When you're young, you are the greatest. You are indispensable. 
</P>
<P>
 Trade me? Perish the thought. I'm the straw that stirs the drink. 
</P>
<P>
 Trade me and the fans would revolt. 
</P>
<P>
 Trade me and the franchise would fold. 
</P>
<P>
 Trade me and . . . what's that? They want to trade me? For Scottie Pippen? 
That no-account deadbeat who refused to come off the bench in the final seconds 
of a crucial playoff game last season? 
</P>
<P>
 What's that say about me? 
</P>
<P>
 Haven't I done everything they asked? Haven't I played hard? Haven't I played 
well? Haven't I been an All-Star? Haven't I behaved off the court? Haven't I 
signed autographs? Haven't I made those critics choke who criticized the Sonics 
for drafting a 19-year-old kid who hadn't played college ball? 
</P>
<P>
 And this is how they thank me? 
</P>
<P>
 It's not like failing to make the cut for the eighth-grade team. No, it's 
several million times worse than that. 
</P>
<P>
 When you're cut as an eighth-grader, only your family and friends are aware of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 When they want to ship you from one city to another in the NBA, everybody 
knows about it. 
</P>
<P>
 It's enough to make a guy want to slip into seclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 You'd want to rip your phone out of the wall and go hide under the covers. 
</P>
<P>
 To try and keep his mind off the reported trade, Kemp stayed busy. Yeah, that 
might do it. Until you were alone late at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it would have to gnaw at you. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemp might say all of that is behind him. Forgotten. A dead issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Baloney. 
</P>
<P>
 It's there and it'll be there for a long time. It doesn't matter how much new 
money is written into his contract or how much Sonic management says they love 
him or how much they claim he means to the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Shawn Kemp will remember. 
</P>
<P>
 Will he ever forgive the Sonics for even thinking about wanting to trade him? 
If you were he, would you? 
</P>
<P>
 Not that it's solace, but Kemp ought to remember one thing. He isn't the first 
star ever involved in trade rumors, or to be traded. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm almost sure he's heard of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. And Wilt Chamberlain. 
</P>
<P>
 And how about Babe Ruth? The Yankees got him from Boston for $125,000 and a 
$300,000 loan to Red Sox Owner Harry Frazee. 
</P>
<P>
 At least the Sonics were demanding a warm body for Kemp, not cold, impersonal 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Kemp will get the cash. But will he get to stay in Seattle. And 
even if he does, will he ever feel secure? Or every time he sees Coach George 
Karl and President Wally Walker disappear into a room and close the door, will 
he wonder: Are they talking about me? 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-six million dollars will buy you a lot of Mercedes. 
</P>
<P>
 But it won't buy you peace of mind.

MORNING BRIEFING: NBA DIDN'T HAVE THAT MUCH TO POUND ITS CHEST ABOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Feinstein in Inside Sports: "Years from now when historians look back at 
the 1990s, they will be remiss if they do not pause and pay tribute to the 
marketing job done by the NBA. Never has so little been made into so much. 
</P>
<P>
 "Consider the playoffs last season. There was no Magic, no Bird, no Michael. 
Shaquille O'Neal lasted three games, David (the Admiral) Robinson four. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sir Charles Barkley was gone after two rounds. How many of you get excited 
watching John Starks go two for 11, then pound his chest when he happens to 
make one?" 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who holds the Raider record for most yards rushing in a season? 
</P>
<P>
 Eastern expert: George Vecsey in the New York Times: "The delightful irony is 
that Green Bay (population: 100,459) could wind up having one more football 
team than Los Angeles (population: 3,489,779). "The Raiders may be headed back 
where they psychically belong, to Oakland, and the Rams, who should never have 
left the Coliseum for the uninteresting sprawl of Orange County, may be headed 
eastward." 
</P>
<P>
 Considerate: According to Mark Kram's article on Arizona Cardinal Coach Buddy 
Ryan in Esquire, a charity "roaster" in Philadelphia said of the former Eagle 
coach:  
</P>
<P>
 "I was in the hospital and given six months to live. Buddy sent me an Eagles 
calendar. And he took the time out to remove the months I didn't need." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoopla: Purdue football Coach Jim Colletto assessing his team after it had 
beaten Minnesota, 49-37, on Oct. 8: "We didn't shoot free throws very well." 
</P>
<P>
 Right on: Rachel Shuster in USA Today: "If Michael Jordan returned to the NBA 
at his $3-million salary, how could those untested multimillion-dollar rookies 
look him in the eye? 
</P>
<P>
 Bottom line: Cincinnati Bengal Coach Dave Shula: "Right now, at 0-5, everybody 
who is a part of this organization has the same report card. It's an F. It 
stinks." 
</P>
<P>
 Tough standard: Mike Lupica in the Sporting News: "This is nine seasons now 
for (Lou) Holtz at Notre Dame. He has won one national championship. That is as 
many as Dan Devine won, one more than (Gerry) Faust. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe one is all Holtz has in him. Sometimes you wonder how much time Holtz 
has left at Notre Dame." 
</P>
<P>
 Add Holtz: On why he calls plays instead of his quarterbacks:  
</P>
<P>
 "We have had a lot of success with a dumb person calling plays. I am hesitant 
to have a smart one calling them." 
</P>
<P>
 Reality: ESPN's Beano Cook: "Coaches say there's a lot of pressure. They make 
$400,000, $500,000 a year. If they don't want pressure, work at Wendy's."  
</P>

 Trivia answer: Marcus Allen, with 1,759 yards in 1985.

AUTO RACING; EARNHARDT IS LUCKY, AS WELL AS SKILLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE MACENKA, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dale Earnhardt, who is closing in on his seventh Winston Cup championship, 
knows from experience that driving skill isn't the only factor in determining a 
winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Luck also plays a part. 
</P>
<P>
 Earnhardt has had his share of problems in the past three events, but each 
time, he's managed to dust himself off and move on as if nothing had happened. 
</P>
<P>
 At Martinsville, Va., Earnhardt did a 360-degree spin early in the race but 
came back to finish second, right behind Rusty Wallace. 
</P>
<P>
 At North Wilkesboro, N.C., Earnhardt fought problems all day and wound up two 
laps off the pace, in seventh place. But once again, he kept Wallace in his 
sights; Wallace was fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 And last week at Charlotte Motor Speedway, Earnhardt again was involved in an 
early wreck that could have been devastating. Instead, he rallied for a 
third-place finish, a whopping 34 spots ahead of Wallace, who broke a timing 
chain. 
</P>
<P>
 With three events left, Earnhardt enjoys a 321-point advantage over Wallace. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've really dodged some bullets these last three races," Earnhardt said. 
"I've jumped right in behind the target and hollered boo, but they haven't hit 
me yet." 
</P>
<P>
 NO COMMENT: Almost immediately after winning the Mello Yello 500 at Charlotte, 
Dale Jarrett was bombarded with questions about his future. 
</P>
<P>
 Jarrett has emerged as a leading candidate to take over the driving duties for 
Robert Yates Racing in 1995 should Ernie Irvan not recover in time. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked what his plans are for next year, Jarrett responded: "To go Winston 
Cup racing. I'm not even thinking about '95 right now. I'm thinking about 
finishing these last three races of '94 and trying to win some more. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time for some new headlines other than the ones that have been written." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Gibbs, Jarrett's car owner, concurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Dale's right," he said. "We want to concentrate on this victory and 
not spend a lot of time worrying about next year." 
</P>
<P>
 BODINES THEY AREN'T: Darrell and Michael Waltrip definitely shouldn't be 
mistaken for the feuding Bodine brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 Brett and Geoff Bodine had a very public wreck during the running of the 
inaugural Brickyard 400, and the two subsequently admitted that they're not 
exactly close. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not the case with the Waltrips. Michael lost control of his car coming 
out of the second turn at Charlotte with less than two laps left last week. As 
his car slid toward the retaining wall, older brother Darrell just happened to 
be in the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hugged each other and everything's fine," Darrell said after wreckers had 
hauled away the remains of their two cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was my fault," Michael said. "I overdid it." 
</P>
<P>
 FAMILY AFFAIR: Dale Jarrett, son of Hall of Fame driver Ned Jarrett, isn't the 
only family member with a victory to his credit this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Jarrett's son, Jason, a sophomore at Lenoir-Rhyne College, got his first 
Limited Sportsman victory Oct. 1 at Hickory Motor Speedway. The younger Jarrett 
also was named the season's top rookie in his division. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Jarrett was on hand to see his son's victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really impressed to see him come as far as he has," the elder Jarrett 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Jarrett took the checkered flag, "He keyed the mike and hollered all the 
way back to the start-finish line," his father said. "When he got out of the 
car, he tried to stand on the door and nearly fell off. It was exciting to see 
him so happy." 
</P>
<P>
 NO PLACE LIKE HOME: Almost all of the teams on the Winston Cup circuit have 
their shops somewhere in the vicinity of Charlotte Motor Speedway. If they're 
not within a few miles of the track, then it's only a town or two away for most 
of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Darrell Waltrip, however, may have them all beat. 
</P>
<P>
 After most crashes at Charlotte, a wrecker will haul the car back to the 
team's garage, where the remains then become the team's responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 But after his car was wrecked at the end of Sunday's race, Waltrip had the 
wrecker tow it directly back to his shop, which is located just beyond the 
speedway's second turn. 
</P>
<P>
 BUSY RICK: The Mello Yello 500 must have seemed anticlimactic for Rick 
Hendrick. 
</P>
<P>
 The race marked the end of a busy week for Hendrick, one of the nation's 
largest automobile dealers and the owner of Winston Cup cars driven by Jeff 
Gordon, Terry Labonte and Ken Schrader. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the week, Hendrick broke ground for a 45,000-square-foot addition 
to his motor sports complex and announced a new sponsorship agreement with 
Budweiser for Schrader's car. 
</P>
<P>
 And last Saturday, Hendrick entertained about 3,500 employees at the Busch 
Grand National race at Charlotte. The 3,500 were responding to Hendrick's open 
invitation for all employees to attend an open house at Hendrick Motorsports, 
eat lunch at the track and attend a race. 
</P>
<P>
 GROWING BONUS: The Unocal 76 Challenge, a $7,600-per-race bonus that goes to a 
driver who can win an event from the pole, will be $60,800 at the AC Delco 500 
in Rockingham. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward Burton, the pole-sitter at Charlotte, crashed early and failed to collect 
a $53,200 bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 The bonus has gone uncollected for eight races, since Geoff Bodine's victory 
Aug. 21 at Michigan International Speedway.

SALAAM LEADS COLORADO, 45-7; BIG EIGHT: HE RUNS FOR 161 YARDS AND SCORES FOUR 
TIMES IN THE FIRST HALF AGAINST OKLAHOMA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rashaan Salaam ran for 161 yards and four first-half touchdowns and No. 4 
Colorado overwhelmed No. 22 Oklahoma, 45-7, Saturday night for its 10th 
consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Salaam moved ahead of Washington's Napoleon Kaufman into the national rushing 
lead at 175.7 yards per game and also solidified his position as the nation's 
leading scorer, increasing his total to 16 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado, 6-0 overall and 2-0 in the Big Eight, posted its highest point total 
ever against the Sooners (3-3, 1-1), who averted a shutout with 23 seconds left 
on Garrick McGee's nine-yard touchdown pass to P.J. Mills. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buffaloes scored on four consecutive first-half possessions, with Salaam 
capping each series with a scoring run -- the first three from seven yards out. 
</P>
<P>
 Salaam's 36-yard run set up his touchdown around left end as Colorado went up 
7-0 midway through the first period. Late in the quarter, he ran seven yards 
off the right side to culminate a 41-yard drive that followed Oklahoma's 
inability to move beyond its own five. Quarterback Kordell Stewart kept that 
drive alive, scrambling for a nine-yard gain on third and eight. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buffaloes turned two second-quarter turnovers into touchdowns. McGee 
fumbled at the Sooners' 18 and Colorado linebacker Matt Russell recovered, 
setting up Salaam's third consecutive seven-yard scoring run, this time up the 
middle. 
</P>
<P>
 Three minutes later, safety Donnell Leomiti intercepted McGee's pass at the 
Colorado 39. Wide receiver Michael Westbrook ran 40 yards on a reverse, and 
Salaam romped nine yards up the middle to give Colorado a 28-0 advantage with 
7:19 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 The first-half outcome might have been worse except for two fumbles by 
Colorado punt returner Chris Hudson. The first, following a 54-yard return, 
turned the ball back to Oklahoma at its four. The second fumble, at the 
Colorado 28, gave Oklahoma its only serious scoring threat of the half, but 
Hudson atoned with an end-zone interception four plays later. 
</P>
<P>
 Oklahoma had only 11 yards in the first quarter and 64 at the half, compared 
to 251 for Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 Salaam's third-quarter replacement, freshman Herchell Troutman, accounted for 
all of the yardage on Colorado's four-play, 51-yard drive for a 35-0 lead. 
Troutman started the drive by turning a short pass into a 39-yard gain, then 
finished it with a four-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buffaloes extended the lead to 38-0 on Neil Voskeritchian's 32-yard field 
goal early in the final quarter. Backup quarterback Koy Detmer's 59-yard pass 
to Westbrook set up the kick. 
</P>
<P>
 Detmer took the Buffaloes 65 yards in seven plays for their final score -- a 
one-yard run by freshman Lendon Henry with 3:27 left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sooners, victimized by five turnovers and a sputtering offense, mounted a 
desperation drive in the closing minutes, and Mills made a sliding catch on 
fourth down to avoid Oklahoma's first shutout in 126 games.

NEBRASKA'S DEFENSE DELIVERS; BIG EIGHT: WEATHER ALSO PLAYS ROLE IN KEEPING 
WILDCAT QUARTERBACK CHAD MAY UNDER WRAPS.

<P>
 A strong defensive performance and the running of Lawrence Phillips helped No. 
2-ranked Nebraska defeat No. 16 Kansas State, 17-6, in a Big Eight showdown on 
a dreary, rainy Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas State quarterback Chad May, a transfer from Cal State Fullerton, threw 
a 29-yard touchdown pass to Mitch Running early in the second quarter, but rain 
that started falling after halftime took away his passing game and he finished 
with 249 yards on a 22-of-48 day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of them slipped out of my hands," said May, who had passed for a Big 
Eight-record 489 yards against Nebraska last year. "But I can't make excuses. 
They had a very good pass rush. It's kind of hard to throw with guys in your 
face." 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska clung to a 7-6 lead until a 15-yard run by Jeff Makovicka with about 
11 minutes to play broke the game open. The Cornhuskers won their 21st 
consecutive regular-season game and beat Kansas State for the 26th consecutive 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our secondary really played outstanding because they have got a great 
quarterback," Nebraska defensive coordinator Charlie McBride said. "If you 
would have told me we'd hold them to six points, I wouldn't have believed you. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard some guy in the hotel say last night that we were OK, but that our 
only problem was the secondary. Well, today it wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips ran for 126 yards in 31 carries for his seventh consecutive 100-yard 
game and scored the first touchdown of the game. The Nebraska defense made it 
stand up until Makovicka burst through a big hole in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my first touchdown of the season. I guess it was a good place to get 
it," Makovicka said. "We came into their lair and they played well against us. 
But it was the offensive line who opened the hole. I just happened to have the 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are called the pipeline. We have the best offensive line in the nation. 
There's a feeling at Nebraska that if we stay in the game until the fourth 
quarter, we're going to win. I had that feeling on the sidelines today." 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore walk-on quarterback Matt Turman started the game and played most of 
the first half, spending his time handing off to Phillips. The Huskers (7-0, 
2-0) had only 18 passing yards by the end of the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Brook Berringer played the final series of the first half and the second half 
as the Huskers try to replace Tommie Frazier, out for the season with blood 
clots in his leg. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huskers blocked Martin Gramatica's extra-point try after holder Matt 
Miller fumbled the snap following the only touchdown by the Wildcats (4-1, 
1-1). 
</P>
<P>
 "We had problems with penalties and that put us in a hole," Kansas State Coach 
Bill Snyder said. "We also had difficulty running the ball. Our field position 
in the second half was terrible. 
</P>
<P>
 "All losses are painful. I just told our players that the more investment you 
put in the game, the greater the loss." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats, using four and five wide receivers throughout, outgained the 
Huskers most of the game, but mistakes and poor field position conspired to 
keep them out of the end zone after the lone score and they remain winless at 
home against Nebraska since 1959.

BYU TAKES FIGHT OUT OF IRISH; NONCONFERENCE: WALSH, DEFENSE LEAD 21-14 VICTORY 
THAT LEAVES HOLTZ WITH ONLY QUESTIONS.

 The biggest day of John Walsh's career at Brigham Young has Notre Dame Coach 
Lou Holtz looking for answers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is probably the best win that I've ever had," said Walsh, who passed for 
216 yards and one touchdown as BYU stopped Notre Dame twice inside the 10 on 
the way to defeating the 17th-ranked Irish, 21-14, on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody gave us a chance in this game, but we believed in ourselves and that's 
all that matters. We came out here and put the fight to them and came out with 
the win," said Walsh, who had Notre Dame's defense guessing most of the 
afternoon as he completed 17 of 30 passes while increasing his career passing 
yardage to 6,702. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irish (4-3) also missed three field goals and were held to 115 yards 
rushing by an aggressive BYU defense that produced four sacks for 45 yards, 
recovered one fumble, had an interception and seven tackles for 21 yards in 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've made some teams awfully happy in the past few weeks," said Holtz, whose 
club was beaten, 30-11, by Boston College last week. "We got beat by a football 
team that controlled the line of scrimmage and protected the passer -- two 
things we didn't do." 
</P>
<P>
 Brigham Young (6-1) overcame near disaster at the start of the game to defeat 
the Irish, who hadn't lost so many games this early in a season since going 5-6 
in Holtz's first season in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "Please don't ask me for any answers. I don't have any," Holtz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh moved his team 77 yards in 13 plays for the winning score with Jamal 
Willis plunging over the middle of the line from two yards out. Walsh then 
threw to Hema Heimul for the conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame moved 62 yards in six plays after the opening kickoff to score on 
Randy Kinder's 41-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame wasted an opportunity after BYU's Jason Cooper fumbled the ensuing 
kickoff and Bill Mitoulas recovered at the 11. After two rushes netted five 
yards, Ron Powlus pitched wildly to Kinder who managed to fall on the loose 
ball at the 19. Stefan Schroffner attempted a 37-yard field goal, but the snap 
was bobbled and the kick was short and to the right. 
</P>
<P>
 Brigham Young, which won a nonconference road game for the first time since 
1989, scored the next 13 points. David Lauder booted field goals of 49 and 48 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Powlus, who was sacked twice and fumbled two snaps in the first half, gave the 
Cougars the ball on their 45 after the second fumble. Six plays later, Walsh 
connected with Willis on a short toss to the 16 and Willis went into the end 
zone by eluding Jeremy Sample's tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the third quarter, Notre Dame drove from its 15 to a first-and-goal 
at the BYU three. But Marc Edwards was stopped for no gain on first down and a 
sweep by Kinder also produced no gain. On third down, Powlus was sacked for an 
18-yard loss by Jon Pollock on a safety blitz and Scott Cengia's 39-yard 
field-goal attempt was blocked by Chad Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 Powlus was injured late in the game and Tom Krug took over on the last Irish 
possession at the Notre Dame 23. He gained 30 yards on two pass completions, 
but Notre Dame's bid ended at the BYU 47 after four incomplete passes and the 
Cougars ran out the final 57 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got banged up a little during the game," Holtz said of Powlus. "What's the 
extent of that injury, I do not know."

EAST ROUNDUP; WEST VIRGINIA BLOWS 25-POINT LEAD BUT RALLIES TO BEAT PITT, 47-41 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<P>
 Chad Johnston threw two touchdown passes in the final 1:32 after West Virginia 
had blown a 25-point lead, rallying the Mountaineers to a 47-41 victory over 
Pittsburgh in a Big East game Saturday at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 In another wild game in the 100-year-old rivalry, Johnston threw to walk-on 
Zach Abraham on a decisive 60-yard touchdown pass play with 15 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 23 seconds before, Pitt backup John Ryan's touchdown pass and quarterback 
sneak on a two-point conversion appeared to have climaxed a dramatic rally by 
the Panthers from a 31-6 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 A rare two-point defensive conversion gave West Virginia (3-4, 1-2) a 33-12 
lead, but the Mountaineers didn't score again until Johnston, who threw for 396 
yards and four touchdowns, teamed with Rahsaan Vanterpool on an 81-yard 
touchdown pass play with 1:32 remaining. That gave West Virginia a 40-33 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan, who replaced ineffective starter Sean Fitzgerald, threw for 433 yards 
and four touchdowns in barely 2 1/2 quarters, but also was intercepted three 
times -- one for a touchdown -- and lost a fumble for Pitt (1-6, 0-3). 
</P>
<P>
 Pitt's rally was reminiscent of similar comebacks against West Virginia in 
1970, when the Panthers trailed, 35-8, before winning, 36-35, and 1989, when 
they trailed, 31-10, with 10 minutes remaining before gaining a 31-31 tie. West 
Virginia also beat Pitt, 63-48, in 1965 in what was then the highest-scoring 
Division I game. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 24 Boston College 45, Temple 28 -- The Eagles (3-2) overwhelmed the Owls 
(2-4) in the first half behind quarterback Mark Hertsell, then survived a 
second-half collapse to win at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston College, coming off a 30-11 upset of Notre Dame, cruised to a 35-0 
halftime lead. But Henry Burris ran for two touchdowns and threw for another as 
Temple cut the lead to 38-28 with 5:17 left in the game. However, Temple's 
hopes died when Burris threw his third interception, and Eric Shorter returned 
it 35 yards for a touchdown with 2:04 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Rutgers 14, Cincinnati 9 -- Ray Lucas, after missing last week's game against 
Army because of a dislocated shoulder, returned to the lineup and threw two 
touchdown passes and safety Mark Washington stopped two late drives with 
interceptions as the Scarlet Knights (4-3) defeated the Bearcats (0-5-1) at 
Piscataway, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati proved to be a much tougher homecoming opponent than expected for 
Rutgers, drawing within five points on Eric Vibberts' 49-yard touchdown pass 
play to James Scott with 1:12 to play. After a two-point conversion pass 
failed, Rutgers linebacker Alcides Catanho recovered the ensuing kickoff and 
the Scarlet Knights ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Army 30, Louisville 29 -- Joe Ross caught a 10-yard touchdown pass from Ronnie 
McAda with 3:17 left at West Point, N.Y., and Kurt Heiss kicked the first three 
field goals of his career as the Cadets finally won a close one. 
</P>
<P>
 Army (2-4) ended a four-game losing streak, but not before being stunned by 
two Louisville touchdowns and two two-point conversions in a 34-second span in 
the fourth quarter that wiped out a 23-13 lead. The Cardinals fell to 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy 7, Lafayette 0 -- The Midshipmen (1-4) ended a 10-game losing streak, 
using an uncharacteristic strong defensive effort and an early touchdown run by 
Patrick McGrew to beat winless Lafayette (0-6) at Annapolis, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-game losing streak matched Houston's as the longest in the nation among 
major colleges. Navy's last previous victory was also against a Division I-AA 
school, 31-3 over Colgate last season. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Andy Glockner kicked four field goals as Penn wore down stubborn Columbia, 
12-3, in an Ivy League game at Philadelphia. Glockner's kicks of 32, 28, 21, 37 
yards tied a school record as the Quakers (4-0, 2-0) extended Division 1-AA 
football's longest winning streak to 15 games. Columbia fell to 2-2-1, 0-2. . . 
. Jerry Singleton's 22-yard scoring pass to David Shearer and Pete Oberle's 
two-point conversion run with 3:01 remaining lifted Dartmouth (3-2, 1-1) to a 
14-13 Ivy League victory over Yale (3-2, 0-2) at Hanover, N.H. Singleton, from 
Escondido, and Oberle are transfers from Colorado State. Singleton became the 
starting quarterback after Ren Riley broke his wrist last week. . . . Backup 
quarterback Steve Kezirian ran for two fourth-quarter touchdowns as Harvard 
(3-2) rallied for a 35-27 victory over Colgate (1-5) at Boston. Kezirian took 
over after Vin Ferrara was shaken up late in the third quarter. Kezirian 
carried seven times for 69 yards and completed five of seven passes for 45 
yards. . . . Bill Jordan, who rushed for 119 yards in 20 carries, scored on a 
two-yard run with 9:08 remaining to give Princeton (4-1) a 27-20 victory over 
Fordham (0-4) at New York. . . . Jason McCullough threw three touchdown passes 
and Paul Fichiera rushed for 199 yards in 31 carries as Brown (3-2) kept Holy 
Cross (0-6) winless with a 20-18 victory at Providence, R.I. Fichiera, playing 
in place of the injured Marquis Jessie, had his second 100-yard game in three 
weeks. . . . John Rodin's 41-yard field goal with 11 seconds remaining lifted 
unbeaten Cornell (5-0) to a 29-28 victory over Bucknell at Lewisburg, Pa. 
Cornell is off to its best start since 1971.

ALABAMA GETS JOB DONE AGAIN; SEC: OFFENSE DOES BARELY ENOUGH AS DEFENSE REIGNS 
IN 17-13 DEFEAT OF TENNESSEE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<P>
 Alabama's struggling offense squeaked by again on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The No. 10 Crimson Tide drove 80 yards to a winning touchdown on Sherman 
Williams' four-yard run with three minutes remaining for a 17-13 victory over 
Southeastern Conference foe Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a super drive. Jay (Barker) was making the right decisions and most of 
it was running the football, and that's what we needed to do," Alabama Coach 
Gene Stallings said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the kind of win we really needed. I felt we needed to play a good, 
tough team away from home in a hostile environment, and I thought our players 
handled it well." 
</P>
<P>
 As it has done all season, the Tide (7-0, 4-0 SEC) led with its defense and 
counterpunched with barely enough offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennessee (3-4, 2-3) can look at its ninth consecutive failure to beat Alabama 
as another case of what might have been. The Volunteers fumbled away one 
scoring opportunity at the Alabama two in the first half, and drove to the 
Alabama seven in the waning moments only to come away empty. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made the key plays defensively when we had to," Stallings said. "Nothing 
came easy, but that's all right. We knew it wasn't going to be easy." 
</P>
<P>
 Tennessee Coach Phillip Fulmer said he thought his defense did enough to win, 
but the offense couldn't close the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Again, costly errors, especially in the first half, were the difference," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt going in we had to run, and we did that. We felt we needed to stop 
the run, and we didn't do that as well as we should. And we knew we couldn't 
have turnovers, and we did." 
</P>
<P>
 The Crimson Tide was outgained 385 yards to 336, but its defense refused to 
let the team lose. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennessee had two first-and-goal situations that resulted in no points. The 
first ended when Tommy Johnson forced a fumble from James (Little Man) Stewart 
and John Tanks recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 The second came at game's end. After Williams' touchdown put Alabama ahead, 
Tennessee drove to the Alabama seven. Michael Rogers flicked away a potential 
touchdown pass on third down, and a fourth-down pass fell incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt confident the whole game," said Alabama defensive end Dameian 
Jeffries. "Not to say I wasn't nervous. I'd like a couple of blowouts. These 
games have been too close for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams finished with 142 yards in 26 carries for Alabama. Barker, limited in 
practice this week because of a sore throwing shoulder, completed 10 of 19 
passes for 128 yards and a touchdown.

DUKE FINDS NEW WAY TO WIN; ACC: FARMER BLOCKS PUNT, RECOVERS IT IN END ZONE FOR 
19-13 VICTORY AS BLUE DEVILS IMPROVE TO 6-0. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the motivational slogans at Duke asks: "If I don't do it, who will?" 
Well, try Ray Farmer. 
</P>
<P>
 For the eighth time in his career, Farmer blocked a kick on Saturday. This 
time, he recovered the block in the end zone with 3:37 left, giving the 
25th-ranked Blue Devils (6-0, 3-0) a 19-13 Atlantic Coast Conference triumph 
over Clemson. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory assured Duke, 6-0, 3-0 in the ACC, of its first winning season in 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I had it when I cleared the (blocking back)," Farmer said of the 
block. "The punter had just gotten the ball and I was already back there. All I 
had to do was keep my eyes on it like coach said and run through it, put my 
hands down and take the ball off his foot. That's all I concentrated on." 
</P>
<P>
 Farmer, who earlier blocked a field-goal attempt, charged in and blocked 
Nelson Welch's punt into the air. Ray Wright's rush actually occupied two 
blockers, and Farmer got around the remaining blocking back. 
</P>
<P>
 The ball caromed into the end zone, where Farmer recovered it for the 
clinching score. Tom Cochran missed the point-after kick, leaving Duke's 
defense to hold off the Tigers one more time. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmer has three blocked kicks this season. This time, there was a game on the 
line and all he wanted to do was find the ball once he'd deflected it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew the ball was coming back from the angle I blocked it. I really 
couldn't find it at first," Farmer said. "I saw it in the end zone and it was 
just a foot race to the ball and I got on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Clemson (2-4, 1-3) started freshman Nealon Greene at quarterback in hopes of 
awakening a once-potent offense, which had scored only seven touchdowns in five 
games. Greene often escaped the Duke defenders by running the option offense, 
and it helped produce Raymond Priester's 23-yard touchdown run late in the 
second quarter that tied the score 7-7. 
</P>
<P>
 However, while the Tigers might have found a quarterback for the rest of the 
season, they didn't have a hero this weekend. Greene managed three passes to 
Antwuan Wyatt that helped move Clemson from its 20 to the Duke 44 after 
Farmer's play. The Blue Devils called a timeout to stem the momentum, and that 
seemed to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Greene gained one yard on a keeper, then missed two passes for Wyatt. On 
fourth-and-nine at the Duke 31, Zaid Abdul-Aleem and David Hawkins combined to 
sack Greene for a 10-yard loss. The Blue Devil defense hasn't allowed a 
touchdown in the first or the fourth quarter this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke matched its 6-0 start of 1952 and ensured a winning season for the first 
time since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question was not whether we'd be 6-0, but whether we would have a winning 
season," Farmer said. "That was our first goal we set. We accomplished it 
today. Clemson was in the way and we had to go out there and beat them. I think 
we did a good job overall in getting the victory." 
</P>
<P>
 Clemson has lost only two of the last 14 meetings with the Blue Devils. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought our team improved as the game went along," Clemson Coach Tommy West 
said. "There's not a whole lot more you can say other than we played hard, 
which is great. But we've got to come up with a win and we can't make mistakes 
like that and win the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Welch kicked a pair of field goals in the third period, making him the ACC's 
career leader with 61.

SEC ROUNDUP; VANDERBILT OVERCOMES ZEIER IN UPSET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Quarterback Ronnie Gordon ran Vanderbilt's option offense to perfection 
Saturday, rushing for a career-high 126 yards and three touchdowns and throwing 
for a touchdown as the Commodores stunned Georgia, 43-30, in Athens, Ga., 
despite another record passing day by the Bulldogs' Eric Zeier. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanderbilt tailback Jermaine Johnson also had a career-high rushing day, 
running for 177 yards in 27 carries, including a 45-yard touchdown run as the 
Commodores (3-3, 1-3), who led the Southeastern Conference in rushing with 228 
yards per game, had 415 on the ground and 480 total in dominating the Bulldogs 
(4-3, 2-3). 
</P>
<P>
 Although Georgia outgained Vanderbilt 501-480, the Commodores dominated time 
of possession, controlling the ball for nearly 42 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeier completed 23 of 54 passes for 441 yards and three touchdowns with three 
interceptions en route to setting his 15th SEC record, this one for career 
completions. He has 744, breaking the previous mark of 721 set by Shane 
Matthews of Florida from 1989-92. 
</P>
<P>
 He also moved into eighth place on the NCAA Division I career passing list 
with 10,096 yards, passing Glenn Foley of Boston College (1990-93), who had 
10,042. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was Vanderbilt's first in Athens since 1961 after 15 consecutive 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Mississippi State 41, South Carolina 36 -- Chris Jones caught a 26-yard 
touchdown pass from Derrick Taite with about a minute left as the Bulldogs 
(4-2, 2-2), who squandered a 21-point lead, beat the Gamecocks (4-3, 3-2) in 
Columbia, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Taneyhill threw three second-half touchdown passes and a successful 
two-point conversion pass for South Carolina, which took a 36-35 lead after 
trailing, 35-14. 
</P>
<P>
 Taite needed less than two minutes to direct a six-play drive that ended when 
Jones beat cornerback Corey Bell to the left corner of the end zone with 1:04 
to go. 
</P>
<P>
 LSU 17, Kentucky 13 -- Freshman quarterback Melvin Hill came off the bench to 
throw two touchdown passes and rally the Tigers (2-4, 2-3)) past the Wildcats 
(1-5, 0-4) in Baton Rouge, La. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, who replaced struggling starter Jamie Howard, completed 10 of 17 passes 
for 129 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 After throwing his 13th interception, Howard played one series in the second 
quarter, throwing threw three incomplete passes before being pulled in favor of 
Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Arkansas 31, Mississippi 7 -- Defensive ends Marcus Adair and Steven Conley 
came up with turnovers that led to 10 quick points and helped the Razorbacks 
(3-4, 2-3) beat the Rebels (2-4, 1-4) in Fayetteville, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
 Arkansas led, 14-7, early in the third quarter when linebacker Don Bray 
deflected Josh Nelson's pass. Adair intercepted and returned it 20 yards to the 
four. Marius Johnson's fourth-down touchdown from the one made it 21-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Five plays later, David Sanders hit Nelson from behind, and Conley grabbed the 
ensuing fumble at the Mississippi 30. It led to Lance Ellison's 31-yard field 
goal.

 Randy Neal returned an interception 77 yards for a touchdown and Tiki Barber 
ran for 123 yards and a score as Virginia won its fifth in a row in beating 
Georgia Tech, 24-7, in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Neal's interception opened the scoring. Barber's touchdown came on a 
three-yard run, capping an 80-yard second-quarter drive that gave the Cavaliers 
(5-1, 3-1) a 17-7 lead. It was the fourth loss in a row for the Yellow Jackets 
(1-5, 0-4). 
</P>
<P>
 It was Virginia's third victory in a row in the series and the fifth Cavalier 
triumph in the last six visits to Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia shut down Tech's offense, sacking Tommy Luginbill six times. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia's other scoring came on a 28-yard field goal by Rafael Garcia in the 
opening minute of the second quarter and on Charles Way's one-yard run, capping 
a 60-yard drive in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Tech's only score came on a 65-yard drive after Garcia's field goal gave 
Virginia a 10-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Punter Will Bice also helped keep Tech in the hole, once punting out of bounds 
on the Yellow Jackets' one and later booming one 78 yards to the 12 with a 
stiff wind at his back. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 15 North Carolina 41, Maryland 17 -- Jason Stanicek passed for one 
touchdown and ran for one as the Tar Heels (5-1, 2-1), running the ball at 
will, beat the Terrapins (2-4, 1-4) in Chapel Hill, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina rushed for 335 yards on 58 carries and scored on seven of eight 
possessions in defeating the Terrapins for the fifth time in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew after every play they couldn't stop us," said offensive lineman Roge 
Purgason. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you get up there on first down and make a nice little 8-yard gain right 
up the middle and the Maryland guys are on the ground and you are picking them 
up and they are shaking their heads, it takes the momentum out of their 
defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanicek had a 39-yard scoring pass to Marcus Wall in the first quarter and a 
two-yard keeper in the second period as the Tar Heels built a 24-10 halftime 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina then took to the ground to preserve its lead, adding 10 points 
on its first two drives of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina State 34, Wake Forest 3 -- Freshman Tremayne Stephens ran for 
189 yards, including a 52-yard score, to spark the Wolfpack (5-1, 3-0) to a 
rout of the Demon Deacons (2-5, 0-4) in Raleigh, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolfpack scored 20 unanswered points in the first half and used 
fourth-quarter touchdown runs of one and two yards by fullback Rod Brown to 
bury the Deacons. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfpack split end Eddie Goines caught five passes for 67 yards, helping set 
up two scores and becoming N.C. State's career reception and yardage leader 
with 136 for 2,204, passing Naz Worthen in both categories. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephens reeled off two runs of 52 yards in the opening quarter, the first for 
his first collegiate touchdown and a 7-0 lead. He had 145 yards by halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 N.C. State rolled up 419 yards and held the Deacons to just 187.

 Virginia Tech got scoring from its defense and the offense defended a 
fourth-quarter lead as No. 19-ranked Virginia Tech held off East Carolina, 
27-20, on Saturday at Greenville, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Maurice DeShazo scored the game-winning touchdown on an eight-yard quarterback 
draw with 57 seconds left in the third quarter, then threw a two-point 
conversion pass to Jermaine Holmes. 
</P>
<P>
 DeShazo engineered a five-minute drive in the fourth quarter that kept the 
ball from East Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hokies' defense scored 2:51 into the game when Cornell Brown burst into 
the East Carolina backfield to disrupt a handoff, causing a fumble that 
Lawrence Lewis returned 60 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Hokies, who have always had trouble with the Pirates in Greenville, 
trailed, 20-19, after Marcus Crandell tossed a 15-yard touchdown pass to Larry 
Shannon with 6:59 left in the third quarter. East Carolina missed a two-point 
conversion pass.

Fresno State (4-3, 2-1) recorded a 38-24 victory over Wyoming (3-4, 1-2) at 
Fresno. The Bulldogs held a 24-0 lead with five minutes left in the first half 
when Wyoming starting quarterback Jeremy Dombek was replaced by backup John 
Gustin, who finished 20 of 27 for 397 yards and two touchdowns. For Fresno, 
sophomore Richie Donati completed 13 of 30 passes for 331 yards and two 
touchdowns, both to Charlie Jones, who had seven catches for 235 yards.

 Sophomore quarterback Billy Blanton, starting for the first time this season 
because Tim Gutierrez suffered a broken collarbone against Utah last week, 
completed seven of his first eight passes and led San Diego State to a 20-13 
victory over New Mexico in a WAC game. San Diego State (3-4, 1-3) snapped a 
four-game losing streak and a string of seven consecutive WAC losses, the 
longest in school history. New Mexico (1-6, 1-3) lost to the Aztecs for the 
11th year in a row. . . .

Southern Mississippi (3-4) ended a three-game losing streak with a 43-20 
nonconference victory over Southwestern Louisiana (3-4) of the Big West at 
Hattiesburg, Miss. Graham, who replaced 30-game starter and senior Tommy Waters 
a week earlier in a 14-6 loss at Alabama, completed 16 of 25 passes for 182 
yards. . . . Matt Wells' seven-yard touchdown reception in the first quarter, 
along with a last-play fumble at the two by Louisiana Tech quarterback Jason 
Martin, was all that Utah State (2-4, 1-1) needed for a 7-3 victory over the 
Bulldogs (1-5, 0-3) in a Big West game at Ruston, La. . . . Jason Jacoby

in the conference standings. Cody Ledbetter led a second-half comeback that 
pulled the Aggies to 28-24 with 14:56 to play. But Ledbetter, who completed 26

TEXAS A&M EXTENDS HOME STREAK TO 24; SWC: PULLIG LEADS NO. 7 AGGIES OVER 
BAYLOR, 41-21, FOR 25TH CONSECUTIVE CONFERENCE VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Texas A&M's "wrecking crew" defense usually wins games at Kyle Field. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, however, the Aggies' offense overpowered Baylor, 41-21. Corey 
Pullig threw two touchdown passes and kept Baylor off balance with his 
play-calling as No. 7 A&M notched its 25th consecutive Southwest Conference 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "The offense won the game for us today," A&M defensive coordinator Tommy 
Tuberville said. "The defense was mighty proud of the offense today." 
</P>
<P>
 The Aggies (6-0, 3-0) extended the nation's longest home winning streak to 24 
before 70,111 fans at Kyle Field while Baylor, which hasn't defeated A&M since 
1985, dropped to 5-2 and 2-1. A&M's last non-victory at Kyle Field was a 20-20 
tie with Baylor in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aggies scored on every possession in the second half except the last to 
overwhelm the Bears. It was the most points A&M had scored against Baylor since 
a 48-0 victory in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
 "Corey did a great job of putting us in the right play," offensive coordinator 
Steve Ensminger said. "It was amazing we didn't punt the ball in the second. 
This is the best offense we've played." 
</P>
<P>
 Ensminger, who came to A&M from the University of Georgia, said: "This was one 
day when we established both the run and the pass. Corey did a good job of 
reading the defense and audiblizing into the right play." 
</P>
<P>
 Pullig completed 15 of 27 passes for 269 yards and Rodney Thomas gained 108 
yards in 14 carries and Leeland McElroy got 105 in 22 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a long afternoon for our defense," Baylor Coach Chuck Reedy said. "We 
just couldn't stop 'em. They took the fight to us in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hoping it was going to be a low-scoring game. I felt if we could score 
17 or 21 points, it might be enough to win the game. Then they get 31 points in 
the second half and never have to punt." 
</P>
<P>
 Pullig said Baylor showed an eight-man front against the Aggies. 
</P>
<P>
 "That meant single coverage on our receivers. We hurt them deep several 
times," Pullig said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reedy said: "A&M has the best quarterback in the conference. He makes great 
decisions and throws the ball well. I didn't know they were a physical 
offensive team too. They physically whipped us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Aggies led by only three points at halftime. But on their first possession 
of the third quarter, Pullig made a good play-action fake and found wide 
receiver Chris Sanders 10 yards behind the Baylor defense for a 75-yard 
touchdown pass play, and A&M was in control after that.

DEFENSE COMES THROUGH FOR UTAH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Utah's offense might have been peeking ahead to next weekend's showdown with 
Colorado State. The defense, however, had its mind on business Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank God for the defense," Coach Ron McBride said after the No. 21-ranked 
Utes defeated Hawaii, 14-3. "Our defense made very few mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 That was fortunate for Utah, 6-0 overall and 3-0 in the Western Athletic 
Conference, because the offense was less than dominating. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed like our heart wasn't in the game," said Sylvester Cooperwood, who 
ran for a touchdown and set up one with a long run. "It was cold and wet, but 
mostly we just weren't working hard enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite all that, we came through in the end. We made a couple big plays." 
</P>
<P>
 Cooperwood bounded six yards with 13:54 left to play for the game's first 
touchdown. Six minutes later, the sophomore fullback took a swing pass from 
Mike McCoy 46 yards to get Utah inside Hawaii's 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Three plays later, McCoy lobbed an 18-yard touchdown pass to Curtis Marsh. 
</P>
<P>
 McCoy finished 19 of 29 for 250 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 McBride said he told his players to be "happy where you are 6-0 but don't be 
satisfied. You're going to face the best team you've seen next week." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawaii (2-5, 0-5) got its only score on Carlton Oswalt's 37-yard field goal 
with 8:08 remaining. It came after Utah's Ernest Boyd knocked away what would 
have been a third-down, 19-yard touchdown pass from John Hao to Brannon 
Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a lot of dropped passes," Hawaii Coach Bob Wagner said. "We came close 
to scoring . . . but the bottom line is you need to make the plays." 
</P>
<P>
 On Rice Stadium's artificial turf left wet and slippery by pregame rainfall, 
the teams struggled through three scoreless quarters. But while Hawaii expected 
-- and got -- little from a Utah defense ranked fourth nationally and yielding 
only 12.4 point per game, the Rainbow defense was surprisingly effective. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah's balanced offense, ranked seventh nationally and tops in the WAC at 
476.8 yards a game, managed only two field-goal attempts, both unsuccessful, 
against the scrambling Rainbows. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawaii's most sparkling defensive effort came late in the third period when 
the Rainbows held the Utes on four downs from inside the nine, stopping Rob 
Hamilton's fourth-down dive only inches short of the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
 On a nine-play drive highlighted by Charlie Brown's 25-yard run, McCoy marched 
the Utes to a second-and-three at the Hawaii 31. But two runs yielded only a 
yard, and Dan Pulsipher's 47-yard field goal try was no good. 
</P>
<P>
 After Hawaii punted, McCoy found Marsh for 17 yards, then hit Deron Claiborne 
on consecutive passes of 16 and 21 yards to put Utah at the Rainbows' 20 less 
than a minute before the break. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a holding penalty killed the drive, and three plays later Pulsipher 
missed a 37-yarder wide right with 25 seconds left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawaii, meanwhile, managed to penetrate Utah territory only once in the first 
three quarters. With a first down on the Utah 40 midway through the second 
quarter, consecutive fumbles and an incomplete pass forced the Rainbows to 
punt. 
</P>
<P>
 Hao, making his second start for Hawaii, completed only eight of 25 passes for 
119 yards and was intercepted once. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rainbows did little better on the ground, picking up only 84 yards to 
Utah's 152 yards.

STAGE SET FOR SHOWDOWN; COLORADO STATE DOESN'T LET UP AND ROUTS UTEP, 47-9 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Colorado State Coach Sonny Lubick was concerned his No. 13-ranked Rams would 
take Texas El Paso lightly while looking ahead to next weekend's big showdown 
with No. 21 Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 He also feared his team might come out flat after last weekend's 21-16 upset 
of Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Lubick could have saved himself the worry. Anthoney Hill threw for two 
touchdowns and E.J. Watson scored twice on short runs as the Rams defeated 
UTEP, 47-9, on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, 7-0 overall and 5-0 in the Western Athletic Conference, racked up 
585 yards and throttled UTEP's budding ground game, permitting Toraino 
Singleton only 27 rushing yards, 98 less than average. 
</P>
<P>
 "Going into the game, I had talked to the team about guarding against a 
letdown," Lubick said. "But that wasn't a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 "We concentrated a whole bunch this week on this team. We knew we had to beat 
this team to go on to the next week," said Jeremy Burkett, who caught a 
touchdown pass from Hill and gained 51 yards on two reverses. 
</P>
<P>
 Lubick was pleased the Rams had no turnovers, controlled the line of scrimmage 
and gave Hill time to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the first time we kind of had an easier time winning the game," Lubick 
said. "We had to play almost everyone that suited up." 
</P>
<P>
 UTEP Coach Charlie Bailey said, "We couldn't get anything going on offense. 
They whipped us up front basically. And their little quarterback, he made some 
big plays." 
</P>
<P>
 UTEP quarterback Shawn Gray said the wet playing field -- it drizzled much of 
the game -- made it hard for his receivers and Singleton to make their cuts. 
But he said Colorado State's blitzing defense left no holes to run through, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill said beating UTEP allows Colorado State another week to think about a 
possible undefeated season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not very many teams win all their games, and hopefully we're headed that 
way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 David Napier added three field goals and the defense came up with two 
safeties, including one on the opening kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Standifer set the game's tone when he tackled UTEP's Sam Rogers in the 
end zone on the opening kickoff for a safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Hill connected on 13 of 28 passes for 223 yards and two touchdowns -- a 
13-yard pass to Burkett and a three-yard toss to Steve Hodge, both in the first 
half. He led the Rams on first-half scoring drives that produced three 
touchdowns, a pair of field goals and a 28-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall Young's 40-yard field goal with 35 seconds remaining in the half 
provided the first points for the Miners (3-4, 1-3), but they did not score 
again until Cedric Johnson blocked Matt McDougal's punt and ran it in from the 
three with 10:33 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third quarter, Watson scored his second touchdown after Raymond Jackson 
picked off Gray's pass at the UTEP 42. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams scored in four plays. 
</P>
<P>
 After Napier's third field goal, Colorado State scored again on a 47-yard run 
by Renard Carn. A holding penalty nullified Greg Myers' 72-yard punt return.

DUCKS DON'T WADDLE, THEY RUN PAST BEARS; PACIFIC 10: WHITTLE RUSHES FOR 177 
YARDS, PHILYAW FOR 130 IN OREGON'S 23-7 VICTORY.

<P>
 Oregon ran California out of a share of the Pacific 10 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Tailbacks Ricky Whittle and Dino Philyaw had the best rushing games of their 
careers Saturday as the Ducks defeated the Bears, 23-7, snapping Cal's string 
of five consecutive conference victories dating back to last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittle, who sat out the last two games because of a pulled hamstring and had 
been bothered by injuries much of the season, rushed for 177 yards in 24 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can run against any team," he said. "It's not just Cal because they were 
ranked, what, second in the league, and we went out there and showed up." 
</P>
<P>
 Whittle wasn't there last week when the Ducks managed 27 yards rushing against 
Washington State, a statistic skewed by 10 sacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Philyaw gained 130 yards in 21 carries, including a 62-yarder that was 
Oregon's longest run in two years. The Ducks gained 304 yards rushing against a 
Cal defense that had been giving up 98 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks, 4-3 overall and 2-1 in the Pac-10, dominated on defense after 
spotting the Bears an early 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 California (3-3, 2-1) managed only 162 yards, including only 43 rushing. Kerry 
McGonigal completed 11 of 32 passes for 119 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 McGonigal had riled the Ducks' defenders with his comments about how he 
welcomed the Oregon blitz because he'd be getting up to see one of his 
receivers standing in the end zone with the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "He might be an all-right guy, but the guy hadn't played hardly any Pac-10 
downs and he's coming in talking like that?" Oregon safety Chad Cota said.

HUSKIES USE OTHER WEAPONS; PACIFIC 10: ARIZONA STATE HOLDS KAUFMAN TO 80 YARDS, 
BUT HUARD HAS BIG DAY IN 35-14 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Washington proved it isn't a one-man team against Arizona State and Napoleon 
Kaufman didn't mind. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sun Devils focused on stopping Kaufman, the nation's leading rusher, on 
Saturday. Damon Huard concentrated on beating Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time they want to put eight guys up on the line and take Napoleon away, 
we're balanced enough to take advantage of it," Huard said after passing for a 
career-best 268 yards and three touchdowns in a 35-14 Pacific-10 victory for 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman was held to a season-low 80 yards. He also had 80 yards at Miami, 
where Washington also got a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you go out and beat the . . . . out of somebody, it doesn't matter how 
many yards you get," Kaufman said. "We blew them out, what else do you want?" 
</P>
<P>
 No. 9 Washington (5-1, 2-1) notched its fifth victory in a row on a day when 
Kaufman's longest run was 26 yards. He still managed to become the fifth 
running back in Pac-10 history to record three consecutive 1,000-yard rushing 
seasons. The others were Charles White and Anthony Davis of USC, Darrin Nelson 
of Stanford and Russell White of California. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had to do it again, I'd still try to stop Napoleon Kaufman first," Sun 
Devil Coach Bruce Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Sun Devils focusing on Kaufman, Huard threw scoring passes of 34 
yards to Ernie Conwell in the first quarter, 17 to Eric Bjornson in the third 
quarter and 22 to Mark Bruener in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman, Washington's career rushing leader, was held to no gain or thrown for 
losses on six of his 18 carries. He scored on a seven-yard touchdown run in the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an especially frustrating first half for Kaufman. He appeared on his 
way to an 80-yard touchdown after catching a screen pass from Huard in the 
second quarter. But center Frank Garcia, trying to cross behind Kaufman in an 
effort to make a block, tripped up Kaufman after a 41-yard gain at the Arizona 
State 39. The Huskies did not score on that series. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I was the only one who could have tackled him (Kaufman) in the open 
field," Garcia said sheepishly. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman, who was averaging 184.8 yards a game, was coming off a career-high 
254-yard rushing day against San Jose State last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Huard completed 20 of 33 passes and was intercepted once. His previous career 
best was 247 passing yards against San Jose State last season. Bjornson caught 
nine passes for 119 yards and Kaufman had a personal-best six catches for 61 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "The NFL wanted to see Napoleon catch more balls," Washington Coach Jim 
Lambright said. "I guess this helps that evaluation." 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona State (2-4, 2-2) averted a shutout when backup quarterback Jason 
Verdugo scored on an 11-yard run with 4:24 to play. Verdugo passed two yards to 
Matt Nelson for a second touchdown with 1:58 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington's defense intercepted three passes by Jake Plummer and recovered 
two fumbles by Chris Hopkins. Ink Aleaga returned one of the interceptions 23 
yards for a touchdown with 1:18 left in the opening half. 
</P>
<P>
 Aleaga, a sophomore linebacker, also recovered a fumble and led the Huskies 
with 15 tackles. He had 1 1/2 sacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington led, 16-0, at halftime after Aleaga's 23-yard return of a screen 
pass by Plummer intended for Hopkins. It was Aleaga's first career touchdown 
and interception. 
</P>
<P>
 It might have been the most important, giving Washington a comfortable lead at 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that point in time, I felt we were kind of low and everything picked up 
from there," Aleaga said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huskies converted a fumble and a pass interception in a span of only 1:36 
for a 10-0 lead in the game's first 4 1/2 minutes.

COMMENTARY; FRANK MCGUIRE WAS MAYOR OF BASKETBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE LUPICA, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He was made for big occasions. There was a basketball night in 1985 when 
Georgetown and St. John's were the two best teams in the country, and they were 
playing against each other at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank McGuire was back at the Garden in those days as director of college 
basketball, and a college ticket was the toughest in the whole town again. 
</P>
<P>
 So he was in the middle of action that he had only known for 50 years, going 
back to when he was a sophomore guard at St. John's in 1934. That is when they 
first put a college doubleheader in the old Garden, St. John's against 
Westminster College in the first game, then NYU against Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 Now there was another doubleheader at the Garden, a huge night, and McGuire 
had filled out the program with his own sense of class and history. The opening 
game was CCNY against NYU. Because there was a time when CCNY against NYU in 
the Garden was even bigger than Georgetown against St. John's in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why did I schedule the game?" Frank McGuire said. "I scheduled it because I 
wanted to see CCNY and NYU play to a full house at the Garden just one more 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 He was 71 years old then. He wore a tailored suit and a diamond ring on his 
pinkie and most of the hair on his head was still red. He still spoke in his 
wonderful downtown accent. He was the son of a Greenwich Village cop and he 
came off 11th and Bleecker and took New York and New York basketball with him 
wherever he went. He is as big and important a figure as the city ever has 
produced in basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 He touched so many basketball lives, players and coaches and just people along 
the way, they will run out of newspaper space trying to list them all. He was 
80 years old when he died Tuesday (October 11) at his home in Columbia, S.C., 
and had suffered for too long. McGuire knew all about suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 His first wife, Pat, died of cancer and his son, Frankie, born with cerebral 
palsy, finally had to be institutionalized. A few years ago, there was a fire 
at his Columbia home and everything was destroyed -- photographs and statues 
and basketballs and jerseys -- all the way back to Xavier High School, New York 
City, all the accumulated history of an extraordinary basketball life. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank McGuire never complained about that because he never complained about 
anything. This was a life of tremendous style. In the whole marvelous history 
of basketball in New York, there never has been anyone like him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frank was always the main cog," the great Archbishop Molloy coach Jack Curran 
told me once. "Somewhere along the line, and it was an amazing line, Frank 
seemed to touch us all." 
</P>
<P>
 Curran was part of the line. His mother worked as the secretary to police 
commissioner Bill O'Brien. Curran was a basketball and baseball player at All 
Hallows High, on East 164th. He was, in his words, "looking around for a 
college." His mother mentioned something to the police commissioner, who made a 
call to Frank McGuire, the son of a cop. One day Mrs. Curran's phone rang. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your son will be going to St. John's to play for me, dear," Frank McGuire 
said, and that was that. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Brown, now coach of the Pacers, was recruited out of Long Beach High for 
North Carolina by McGuire, right before McGuire left Chapel Hill. Those were 
the days when McGuire was taking New York City kids down there and changing the 
Atlantic Coast Conference, and college basketball, forever. I asked Brown once 
about how McGuire recruited him. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Brown smiled and said, "He didn't recruit me. He recruited my mother." 
</P>
<P>
 So Larry Brown is part of the line that began on 11th and Bleecker. So are Al 
McGuire and Dick McGuire, who came out of Far Rockaway to play for McGuire at 
St. John's. 
</P>
<P>
 So was Solly Walker out of Boys High, the first black player at St. John's. 
And put Looie Carnesecca in there, too. When he was a kid at St. John's, he 
watched every move McGuire made in a gym, even serving as a volunteer assistant 
coach. It began a friendship of 50 years. They used to go to the Final Four 
together every year. That stopped when the strokes began to hit McGuire, but 
when the Final Four was in Charlotte last spring, McGuire managed to make it 
from Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was in a wheelchair, but that was the only thing that had changed," 
Carnesecca said. "After 50 years of my life, sitting next to Frank was still 
the best seat anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there was all his basketball history down south, after he left St. 
John's in 1952. There were the North Carolina players of the spring of 1957, 
led by a 5-11 center named Tommy Kearns, who somehow beat Wilt Chamberlain's 
Kansas team in triple overtime to win the NCAA championship. 
</P>
<P>
 The winning points were scored by a kid named Joe Quigg, whose father was a 
teller at Federation Bank and Trust, 34th Street and 8th Avenue, New York City. 
Kearns, who had the ball last, was from St. Ann's Academy. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Dunleavy, out of the Little Flower Parish in East Flatbush, played for 
McGuire at South Carolina. Bobby Cremins, who grew up on Southern Boulevard and 
went to St. Athanasius in the South Bronx and played his high school ball at 
All Hallows, the same as Curran, also played for McGuire at South Carolina. Now 
Cremins is coaching Georgia Tech. When it came time for Molloy's Kenny Anderson 
to choose a college, he chose Cremins and Georgia Tech. And when that happened, 
maybe Kenny Anderson was part of the line, too. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Holiday Festival last December, there was an afternoon when Cremins 
finally started telling stories and it did not take very long for the stories 
to get around to Frank McGuire. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was in college," Cremins said, "Coach always loved to bring us to New 
York. Of course, three-quarters of the team came from New York in those days. 
We came up one time to play the NIT right before the St. Patrick's Day parade. 
Coach told us to make sure to enjoy New York. He even sent us to a friend's 
restaurant. When the bill came, we just signed Coach's name. The next day, 
Coach told us he'd had better teams than ours, but nobody ever enjoyed New York 
quite as much as we had last night." 
</P>
<P>
 In the old days, when he was still at St. John's, McGuire liked to walk all 
the way back to the Village from the Garden, talking about basketball and 
talking about New York, knowing all the bartenders along the way by their first 
names, and all the cops. 
</P>
<P>
 "Walking with Frank was always like walking with a politician in the St. 
Patrick's Day parade," Carnesecca said Tuesday. "He knew everybody. And 
sometimes it felt like he took care of everybody. Nobody ever accused Frank of 
having short arms. His whole life, Frank McGuire had the longest arms you ever 
saw." 
</P>
<P>
 He is in the Basketball Hall of Fame. He always felt like the mayor of 
basketball in New York.

 Orlando's Anfernee Hardaway, who made the NBA all-rookie team last season but 
stayed away from training camp in a contract dispute, Saturday signed a 
nine-year deal with the Magic that makes him one of the NBA's highest-paid 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract, estimated at $70 million, includes an option year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm more nervous about this contract than I was about the first one," said 
Hardaway, who had had a 13-year, $65-million deal that contained a clause that 
allowed him to become a restricted free agent after one year. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-7 guard averaged 16 points, 6.6 assists, 5.4 rebounds and 2.3 
steals in his rookie season. He was six votes behind Golden State's Chris 
Webber in rookie-of- the-year voting.

 Welcome to hell. Feel privileged for the invitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, when the heat is so intense coming off the black asphalt that some 
have painted the bottoms of their shoes white in hopes of deflecting at least a 
few degrees, when the 50 m.p.h. gusts whip in the face during the 112-mile bike 
ride, feel privileged to be able to feel anything besides that I.V. needle in 
the arm. 
</P>
<P>
 "You go through a lot of times during the day saying, 'Why didn't I just take 
the job at 7-Eleven?' " said Paula Newby-Fraser, who has been to you-know-where 
and back 10 times now. 
</P>
<P>
 There are more grueling ways to see what gives out first, the body or the 
mind, like those double ironmans that last two days. And for pure course 
difficulty, the race in Lanzarote, Canary Islands, is much more brutal, the 
hills in Penticton, Canada, far more unforgiving. But none are more glamorous, 
more prestigious than the Gatorade Ironman Triathlon, the world championship on 
the Big Island's Kona Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1,500 competitors have been culled from 20,000 hopefuls during 20 
qualifying domestic and international races, making this an elite gathering for 
the sport, with all but 185 having earned a spot through performance. They come 
here to win or finish the Ironman, not win or finish a mere triathlon. 
</P>
<P>
 The heat that reaches 110 degrees on the pavement and the 85% humidity more 
than make up for those places where the course might be relatively gentle. They 
hate the 2.4-mile ocean swim, the 112-mile bike ride and the 26.2-mile run -- 
all within 17 hours -- so much they love it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mile markers on the highway," said Mark Allen, who won the previous five 
titles before taking a sabbatical this year. "When the wind blows hard, you see 
every single one. One hundred and twelve miles can go by very slowly. 
Twenty-six miles goes by very slowly. It's like time expands." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Newby-Fraser, an Encinitas resident who has won the race the last four 
years and seven times in all: "You sort of have to make your peace with the 
island. The wind blows so hard and it's so unpredictable. It takes the 
strongest of people with the most resolve and absolutely crumbles them." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, isn't it great. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Greg Welch of Australia, who became the first non-American to win the 
men's division: "That's the heart of it all. That only one thousand five 
hundred people get to maybe wreck their bikes." 
</P>
<P>
 Welch finished in 8 hours 20 minutes 27 seconds, Newby-Fraser in 9:20:17. 
</P>
<P>
 It has a different appeal to Jon Franks, a chiropractor from Venice. Making 
good on a vow made a few days after he lost the use of both legs in a 1985 
motorcycle accident, he became the first wheelchair athlete ever in the event, 
which started in 1978. That doesn't count 1988, when he crashed the start by 
beginning his swim off to the side, only to drop out before the bike ride 
because he realized it would be impossible to continue to dodge security. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no sneaking around this time, not with television cameras tracking 
his progress. He started the swim three minutes after the pack, using a plastic 
brace to keep his legs straight out, a weblike glove to help as he backstroked 
the 2.4 miles and a wet suit, prohibited for other competitors, to help his 
buoyancy. He practiced by swimming between the piers in Manhattan Beach and 
Hermosa Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 His bike looked like a wheelchair, only closer to the ground and powered by 
his arms and shoulders through a hand crank in front of his chest, with a 
choice of 21 gears. He would have to zigzag up some hills that were too steep 
to attack straight on without a significant loss of speed. The wheelchair he 
used in the marathon-distance "run" had one gear -- his hand slapping on the 
rims. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (onlookers) will see that somebody in the wheelchair is not some little 
decrepit, deaf, dumb and blind leper," said Franks, who was still on the course 
late Saturday night. "They'll see that somebody in a wheelchair is able to 
compete in a big-time event. And if I get a little respect for everyone in a 
wheelchair, that's great." 
</P>
<P>
 He was wrong about getting a little respect -- he got a lot of respect and 
admiration from fellow competitors. The part about being in a big-time event, 
that he was right about.

SENIOR TENNIS; CONNORS DEFEATS KRIEK, ADVANCES TO FINAL

 Each player battled himself as much as his opponent in the semifinals of the 
Digital PC Champions tournament Saturday night, with Jimmy Connors beating 
Johan Kriek, 7-6 (7-4), 7-5, before a sellout crowd of 2,600 at the Sherwood 
Country Club in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Kriek struggled early, then regained control of his serve and forehand as the 
match wore on.However, he could not stop Connors from advancing to today's 1 
p.m. final against Jose-Luis Clerc, a rematch of last week's final at the Coral 
Champions tournament in Hilton Head, S.C.  
</P>
<P>
 "Johan can be off and then switch it right around," Connors said. "In the 
beginning he was missing shots he had no business missing, and later on he was 
making shots he had no business making." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Kriek: "The first four games I was in la-la land. But Jimmy has the best 
energy of any player even if he's not playing well. He's no different than 20 
years ago."  
</P>
<P>
 Connors advances to face Clerc, who upset second-seeded Bjorn Borg, 7-6 (9-7), 
7-5, in the day's first match. Clerc and Peter Fleming beat Borg and Mel 
Purcell, 6-2, 6-3, immediately thereafter, and will face Mansour Bahrami and 
Larry Stefanki in today's doubles final. Bahrami ad Stefanki beat Tim and Tom 
Gullikson, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Clerc beat Borg by frequently pinning him to the baseline with booming serves 
and textbook groundstrokes, while the five-time Wimbledon champion looked tired 
and earned most of his points at the net.

CONNORS ADVANCES TO FINAL; TENNIS: HE BEATS KRIEK, 7-6 (7-4), 7-5, AND WILL

<P>
 The sour look your mother told you to get rid of as she sent you upstairs to 
bed found a home on the faces of Johan Kriek and Jimmy Connors Saturday night 
in the semifinals of the Digital PC Champions tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Each player battled himself as much as his opponent, with Connors prevailing, 
7-6 (7-4), 7-5, before a sellout crowd of 2,600 at the Sherwood Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Kriek struggled early, then regained control of his serves and forehand as the 
match wore on. However, he could not stop Connors from advancing to today's 1 
p.m. final against Jose-Luis Clerc, a rematch of last week's final at the Coral 
Champions tournament in Hilton Head, S.C., that was won by Connors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Johan can be off and then switch it right around," Connors said. "In the 
beginning he was missing shots he had no business missing, and later on he was 
making shots he had no business making." 
</P>
<P>
 Kriek lost the match on unforced errors that had him disgusted -- and that 
seemed to be catching, as Connors began to struggle late in the first set. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first four games I was in La-La Land," said Kriek, a two-time Australian 
Open champion. "But Jimmy has the best energy of any player even if he's not 
playing well. He's no different than 20 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Connors agreed, saying his mental approach to tough match situations is the 
same as it's always been. 
</P>
<P>
 "I missed a few and I sure didn't like it, but as long as I'm in the trenches 
and don't hear those three nasty words 'game, set, match' I can work it out," 
said Connors, who won a 7-4 tiebreaker to lock up the first set. 
</P>
<P>
 Clerc upset No. 2-seed Bjorn Borg, 7-6 (9-7), 7-5, in the day's first match. 
</P>
<P>
 Clerc and Peter Fleming downed Borg and Mel Purcell, 6-2, 6-3, immediately 
after, and will face either Tim and Tom Gullikson or Monsour Bahrami and Larry 
Stefanki in today's doubles final in mid-afternoon. Clerc upended Borg by 
frequently pinning him to the baseline with booming serves (13 winners) and 
textbook ground strokes. Borg, a five-time Wimbledon champion, earned most of 
his points at the net.

VALLEY RIDDLES MOORPARK WITH AERIAL ASSAULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Perhaps Valley College quarterback Jim Arellanes hadn't heard that Moorpark 
had the top defense in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Arellanes completed 29 of 51 passes for 379 yards and three touchdowns to lead 
the Monarchs to a 28-14 victory over Moorpark in a Western State Conference 
interdivisional game Saturday night at Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs (6-0, 6-0 in conference play), ranked No. 5 in the state, racked 
up 529 yards against a defense that went into the game allowing an average of 
only 152.5 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a bitter defeat for Moorpark (3-2, 3-1), which last week upset 
Bakersfield, then ranked No. 1 in the state and No. 2 in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders had 316 yards on offense, including 147 passing by Damian Delfino 
and 103 rushing by Gary Clemons, but most of those yards were hard-earned. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley receiver Brian Comer, who caught touchdown passes of 14 and 82 yards, 
finished with 12 receptions for 225 yards. His second score came on a halfback 
option pass from Davis Delmatoff midway through the fourth quarter and sealed 
the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore wide receiver Jason Leonard had three receptions for 101 yards and 
scored on a 26-yard pass from Arellanes in the third quarter that gave Valley a 
21-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 It looked at first as if Moorpark was going to give the Valley defense a rough 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders took the opening series of the game 62 yards in 13 plays and 
reached the end zone on a one-yard run by halfback Gary Clemons for a 7-0 lead. 
Clemons also scored the other Moorpark touchdown on a two-yard run early in the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs scored their first two touchdowns on exceptionally thrown passes 
by Arellanes in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The first was a 24-yard toss to receiver David Eastham with six minutes to 
play in the half. Arellanes rolled left, threw off balance and hit Eastham on 
the left corner of the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 With nine seconds remaining before intermission and the ball on the Moorpark 
14, Arellanes connected with Comer for a 14-7 advantage.

MATADORS CAUGHT FLAT, 20-10; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: NORTHRIDGE TURNS IN AN 
UNINSPIRED PERFORMANCE IN LOSS TO ST. MARY'S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bob Burt, angry at his football team for just about everything imaginable, 
slammed his cola can to the ground outside the locker room, fizz spewing 
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 His Cal State Northridge players fizzled, too. They had no pop whatsoever. If 
they were soda, they'd have been diet. No caloric value whatsoever. 
</P>
<P>
 "We stunk," Burt said. "They played their best game and we played our worst. 
We stunk in every facet except punting." 
</P>
<P>
 And for that, he's kicking himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors stumbled at both ends of the field and lost a nonconference game 
to St. Mary's, 20-10, on Saturday before 3,070 at St. Mary's Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge (3-3) entered the game on a two-game winning streak and walked away 
wondering what went wrong. Actually, it would be easier to list what went 
right. 
</P>
<P>
 Not much. 
</P>
<P>
 The running game was held to 62 yards and quarterback J.J. O'Laughlin threw 
for only 196 yards and no touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Burt was close to livid afterward, even though the Matadors had a late shot at 
winning despite themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't flat, we just didn't give an effort," he said. "We were ready to 
play; we had a good week of practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't explain it. If I could, I'd be a millionaire." 
</P>
<P>
 This one was bust, almost from the beginning. The offense was held to a season 
low in yardage and was outgained, 359-258.  
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors hadn't been held below 19 points in five games and three times 
had scored 40 or more. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every offense needs to find a rhythm," said senior lineman Edvin Babayova, a 
team captain. "It didn't happen today. We just never did find it. We had too 
many breakdowns." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Laughlin was sacked four times and was banged around repeatedly by St. 
Mary's defensive front. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had way too many three-and-outs," O'Laughlin said. "We just weren't 
clicking." 
</P>
<P>
 And the clock was ticking. Somehow, Northridge managed to mount a threat in 
the second half, but it came up short. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 20-10, Northridge sophomore Matt Ornelaz, who had kicked a 
career-long 44-yard field goal with 10:42 left in the second quarter, missed a 
41-yard attempt with 6 minutes 12 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors' next possession stalled at the St. Mary's 20 when O'Laughlin 
misfired on fourth and eight with 1:27 left. Northridge got the ball one more 
time -- and O'Laughlin was sacked to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole day we were off," said O'Laughlin, who completed 19 of 40 passes 
and had one intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Mary's (6-1) took a 17-3 lead with 9:23 left in the third quarter on a 
seven-yard run by freshman tailback Ed Williams, a 1994 Canyon High graduate 
who gained 116 yards in a school record 38 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Laughlin scored on a one-yard sneak on fourth down with 3:36 left in the 
third to close to within 17-10, but it was as close as the Matadors would get. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Antongiovanni kicked a 27-yard field goal with 8:53 remaining to extend 
St. Mary's lead to 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither team burned up the field in the first half. Having failed in its 
attempt to beat down the front door, the St. Mary's offense went through the 
side window with a gadget play that caught Northridge flat-footed. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Coley Connelly, coming off a three-game suspension after an arrest 
on burglary charges, didn't take long to find the groove -- though there was a 
proviso. 
</P>
<P>
 With St. Mary's on the Northridge 19-yard line, Connelly lined up at tailback 
on his first play of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 He took a pitch from freshman quarterback Sean Laird, then rolled right. 
</P>
<P>
 Laird, meanwhile, cruised toward the left sideline. Connelly lobbed a pass to 
Laird over cornerback Vinnie Johnson and the Matador secondary for an easy 
touchdown and a 7-3 lead with 4:42 left in the half.

THE HIGH SCHOOLS / MIKE HISERMAN: ARANGO'S HIGHLIGHT COMES WITH A CATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cameras were rolling at the Kennedy High football field Friday night, most of 
them aimed in the direction of a receiver who hadn't caught a pass all season. 
</P>
<P>
 They came to capture the talents of Charlie Arango, and he didn't disappoint. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third quarter, the Birmingham High senior was on the receiving end of a 
14-yard pass for a first down. 
</P>
<P>
 The catch wasn't a big play in the game, which Kennedy won, 35-21. But in the 
context of at least one young man's life it was huge. 
</P>
<P>
 Arango was born without a left hand, making his athletic career more 
challenging than most. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was great," Arango said. "When I caught it, a lot of pressure left my 
body." 
</P>
<P>
 Arango estimates he had been the intended target of four other passes this 
season, all of which fell incomplete. His teammates were happy for him, but at 
the same time remained measured in their congratulations. 
</P>
<P>
 To act too excited would have been a slap at Arango's talent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like normal, an everyday thing," said Birmingham wingback Tony 
Nichols, one of Arango's closest friends. "Tony makes that catch all the time 
in practice. It's not like we didn't know he could do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Arango's catch was captured on film by three local television camera crews. 
KCBS showed the play on its sportscast Friday night. Arango, who was the 
subject of a feature story in The Times last month, was the focus of segments 
aired by KNBC and KMEX on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, if only that play would have gone for a touchdown. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "That's my only dream, my only goal that's left," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stay tuned. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Lopez, Sylmar High's free safety, has the size college recruiters like 
to see in a defensive back. He is a tall and sinewy 6-foot-2, 190 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 A converted quarterback, Lopez also possesses the requisite mental attributes 
for the job. He anticipates passing routes. His coach says he "has a tremendous 
nose for the football." 
</P>
<P>
 And he has speed. You want to talk about speed? We take you into the coaches' 
office at Sylmar and roll some film. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar vs. Reseda, second quarter: 
</P>
<P>
 The Reseda quarterback is scrambling for his life. Lopez, dutifully patrolling 
the secondary, mistakenly comes up to protect against a run. The quarterback 
pulls up and lofts a pass toward tight end Alonso Arreola. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez is beaten. He has Arreola ahead of him, the ball sailing above him and 
10 breathless teammates, who are watching in horror. Sylmar hasn't allowed a 
point in 16 consecutive quarters or a passing touchdown all season. Arreola has 
about a five-yard advantage as he pulls in the pass -- a lead that quickly 
disappears. Lopez hauls him down at the seven-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 In the midst of his furious sprint, Lopez said one image dominated his 
thoughts -- Sylmar Coach Jeff Engilman, his face contorted with rage. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he scores, I didn't want to have to face coach," Lopez said. "He was not 
going to score." 
</P>
<P>
 And so he didn't. And neither did Reseda. A few plays later, Arreola -- 
perhaps still winded -- was wide right on a 22-yard field-goal attempt. The 
scoreless streak, now up to 19 quarters, was saved. But not Lopez. He still got 
an earful from Engilman once he made his way to the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 Fear is such a wonderful stimulant. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two scary scenes. Two false alarms. Two fortunate young men. 
</P>
<P>
 Eyan Schreibman of El Camino Real and Steve McKeon of Hart were taken from 
their respective Friday night football games by ambulance. Schreibman, a 
running back and defensive back, stayed stretched out on the field for an 
extended period because of a neck injury. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon, the quarterback for Hart, experienced dizziness, a headache and chills 
after guiding the Indians to a 42-19 victory over rival Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Both were fine by Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino Real Coach Bob Ganssle said Schreibman was released shortly after 
being examined at Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Woodland Hills. The injury, 
which limited Schreibman's head movement, turned out to be a mild muscle 
strain. He is expected to be practicing in a couple of days. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon's injury also appeared worse than it was. His father, Joe, said doctors 
diagnosed a mild concussion.

OAK TREE AT SANTA ANITA; THE GOODWOOD PROVES ELIXIR FOR BERTRANDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don't write off Bertrando yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Reunited with rider Gary Stevens, the 5-year-old Skywalker horse ran off to a 
clear lead, looked finished when passed by Dramatic Gold and Tossofthecoin, 
then came back to win Oak Tree's $214,400 Goodwood Handicap at Santa Anita on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Buried by Holy Bull in the Woodward Handicap on Sept. 17, a little more than a 
month after being beaten by 34 lengths in the Pacific Classic, Bertrando 
bounced back to his best form. 
</P>
<P>
 In winning for the fourth time in nine starts at Santa Anita, the 7-2 third 
choice might have earned a third shot at success in the Breeders' Cup. Second 
to Arazi in the 1991 Juvenile and second to 133-1 shot Arcangues in last year's 
Classic, Bertrando is a possibility for the $3-million Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 He would have to be supplemented for $360,000 and co-owner and breeder Ed 
Nahem said he will discuss the matter with Marshall Naify, the Cal-bred's other 
owner. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to be vindicated," Nahem said. "Everybody had this horse all dead 
and buried. In that one race with all the speed (the Pacific Classic), no horse 
would have stuck around, and in New York, it was a drying out kind of track and 
he really didn't get a hold of it right." 
</P>
<P>
 Now a winner of nine of 20 starts, Bertrando finished a neck in front of 7-5 
favorite Dramatic Gold in a stakes record 1:46 3/5 for the 1 1/8 miles on a 
dry, windy afternoon. Tossofthecoin, the longest shot in the field at 20-1, was 
a length back in third. His rider, Alex Solis, claimed foul against Stevens and 
Corey Nakatani, Dramatic Gold's rider, for alleged interference in the stretch, 
but it was quickly dismissed by the stewards. 
</P>
<P>
 Riding the horse for the first time since the loss to Arcangues, Stevens said 
it was like old times. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the same old Bertrando, a lot of heart, a lot of determination," Stevens 
said. "He's really an easy horse to ride. I just let him do his thing. He rates 
himself and when he feels the pressure, he puts on the afterburners. Today, he 
felt no different than the horse I rode last year. He was just super, super 
impressive." 
</P>
<P>
 Favored on the strength of recent improvement and a victory in the Molson 
Million a month earlier at Woodbine, Dramatic Gold appeared home free 
approaching the stretch. Nakatani was sitting still on the 3-year-old Slew O' 
Gold gelding and he had moved up on the outside as though he was going to 
cruise on past. 
</P>
<P>
 Dramatic Gold did get the lead, but he couldn't hold on, suggesting the 1 
1/4-mile distance of the Breeders' Cup Classic won't help his cause. 
</P>
<P>
 "He ran great, but I probably waited too long to go to Bertrando," Nakatani 
said. "I know I'm on a better horse than Bertrando. It was a matter of 
circumstances today. The track hasn't been playing speed all day, and since 
he'd be going 1 1/4 miles in his next race (the Classic), I tried to see if my 
horse might wait a little longer (to make his move)." 
</P>
<P>
 Lykatill Hil, the 5-2 second choice, was beaten by nearly nine lengths in 
finishing fourth. Stuka was fifth, a head in front of Fastness, who ran last in 
his main track debut. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Exchange might not be the only member of the Bill Spawr stable to participate 
in the Breeders' Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Saratoga Gambler might also be headed to Churchill Downs after his 
three-length victory in the $107,500 Ancient Title Breeders' Cup Handicap on 
Saturday. The longest shot in the field, he paid $71.40 while completing the 
six furlongs in 1:08 2/5. 
</P>
<P>
 Uncaged Fury was second, a neck in front of 3-1 favorite Concept Win, who had 
a bad start. Defending Ancient Title and Breeders' Cup Sprint champion 
Cardmania rallied to finish fourth in his first start since he suffered a 
broken cannon bone in February. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the first stakes victory for the 6-year-old Saratoga Six gelding and 
his first victory since he was claimed for $100,000 by Spawr for owner Ken 
Porter on Feb. 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Laid off since he finished second as the favorite in the Arapahoe Sprint at 
Arapahoe Park in Colorado, Saratoga Gambler drew away in the final sixteenth 
under Martin Pedroza. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll talk to Ken (Porter) about (the Breeders' Cup)," Spawr said. "He had to 
run real good today to make us do it. He ran very well, so we'll talk about it 
and see if he has enough (eligibility) points (to get into the field). 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody wanted to ride him (today). He was 34-1, but we felt confident that he 
could run well, but I'm surprised that he won the way he did." Horse Racing 
Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Corrazona is the 4-5 morning-line favorite against five rivals in the $100,000 
Las Palmas Handicap at 1 1/8 miles on turf, one of two stakes on today's card. 
Laffit Pincay Jr. will ride her for trainer Richard Mandella, and he will also 
be aboard 6-5 favorite Journalism in the $100,000 Col F.W. Koester Handicap at 
one mile on grass. . . . Santa Anita will offer simulcast wagering on the 
$300,000 Spinster Stakes from Keeneland between the second and third races. 
Among those entered in the 1 1/8-mile race are Miss Dominique, Phone Chatter, 
who will be ridden by Nakatani, and Twice The Vice.

VILLAGE CHRISTIAN WINS, 9-6, ON BRACHE'S LATE FIELD GOAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Ignacio Brache kicked a 26-yard field goal with three seconds remaining to 
give Village Christian a 9-6 victory over Kilpatrick in an Alpha League opener 
Saturday at Kennedy High. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our high-powered offense kicked in at the end," Village Christian Coach Mike 
Plaisance said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Brache, who accounted for all of the Crusaders' points, tied it, 6-6, midway 
through the fourth quarter with his second 40-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Village Christian's defense forced Kilpatrick backward on the ensuing drive. 
Bret McLeod came up with two consecutive sacks of Kilpatrick quarterback Cesar 
Cuevas, and the Mustangs were forced to punt from their 15-yard line on fourth 
and 25 with 1 minute 30 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Village Christian quarterback Chris Coleman, who replaced an ineffective Cory 
Reisner after halftime, led the winning drive, which started at the Crusaders' 
37-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 Kilpatrick penalties -- 14 in all -- helped keep the drive alive. Two 
consecutive pass-interference calls got Village Christian to the Mustangs' 
20-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 Village Christian improved to 3-3, 1-0 in league play. 
</P>
<P>
 Kilpatrick (4-2, 0-1) had a three-game winning streak snapped. 
</P>
<P>
 Kilpatrick opened the scoring in the first quarter on Cuevas' 48-yard 
touchdown pass to Henry Flowers.

 Chris Savoie recovered his own team's fumble in the end zone for a touchdown 
with seven seconds to play, giving Faith Baptist High a 38-32 victory over 
Masada in a nonleague eight-man football game Saturday at Brentwood High. 
</P>
<P>
 The game, which pitted No. 1-ranked Faith Baptist (6-0) of the Large Schools 
Division against No. 2-ranked Masada (4-2) of the Small Schools Division, was 
tied five times before Savoie's recovery broke the 32-32 tie.

first touchdown, a two-yard run by Johnson. Eric Ruhle intercepted a pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell-Jeff 21, Pius X 7 -- Danny Hughes rushed for two touchdowns and 54 yards 
as the Guards (3-3, 2-1) routed winless Pius X (0-6, 0-3) in a Santa Fe League

AWARD-WINNING PERFORMANCE COMES WHEN SERAPHS NEED IT; FOOTBALL: WITH RUNNING 
MATE INJURED, RUELAS GAINS CAREER-HIGH 158 YARDS TO LEAD ST. BONAVENTURE, 7-0.

 St. Bonaventure High senior Steve Ruelas rushed for a career-high 158 yards in 
30 carries as the Seraphs beat Fillmore, 7-0, in a Tri-Valley League opener 
Saturday at Ventura High. 
</P>
<P>
 For his efforts, Ruelas was given the Jerry Dann memorial award, a perpetual 
trophy given to the top player in each year's game between the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Dann, a former varsity coach and teacher at St. Bonaventure and a one-time 
junior varsity coach at Fillmore, died in 1983 at the age of 48. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruelas' big game picked up the slack for St. Bonaventure (3-3, 1-0) after 
fellow running back Topi Sanchez left with a hip pointer in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Also helping fill the void left by Sanchez, who gained 47 yards in six 
carries, was Ruelas' twin brother Greg, who rushed four times for 14 yards 
during the only scoring drive of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore quarterback Teohua Sanchez scored on a one-yard keeper with 5 
minutes 17 seconds to play, capping a 14-play, 55-yard drive by the Seraphs 
after Sal Germann recovered Fillmore's second fumble. 
</P>
<P>
 Teohua Sanchez completed seven of 14 passes for 50 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Flashes (1-5, 0-1) turned the ball over three times, including twice in 
St. Bonaventure territory, and finished with just 112 yards of offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback James Cummings rushed for 40 yards in eight carries and Danny 
Lomeli added 35 yards in nine carries.

HARVARD-WESTLAKE WINS EASILY IN CAMINO REAL DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Harvard-Westlake High made its Camino Real League debut with an impressive 
31-6 victory over Cantwell-Sacred Heart on Saturday at Harvard-Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard (4-1-1), voted out of the Division III Mission League after last 
season, dominated Cantwell (2-4), a favorite to contend for supremacy in the 
Division IX Camino Real League. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard's defense allowed only 19 yards passing and did not allow a touchdown. 
The Cardinals scored on a 26-yard interception return by Andrew Ybarra in the 
first quarter and did not threaten again. 
</P>
<P>
 For Harvard, which amassed 223 yards, the victory came one week after an 
emotional upset of Mission League power Notre Dame, the school's first victory 
over the Knights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I half-expected the kids to not be very sharp after last week," Harvard Coach 
Dave Bennett said. "We did show a little bit of a letdown. We didn't seem to 
execute as well as last week." 
</P>
<P>
 Junior tailback Abed Abuszleh scored a pair of touchdowns on one-yard runs, 
and junior Merlin De Martinis added a pair of touchdowns, the first on a 
22-yard interception return to open the scoring three minutes into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Abuszleh, who rushed for a game-high 83 yards in 18 carries, left midway 
through the third quarter because of an injured left shoulder.  
</P>
<P>
 De Martinis replaced him and ran 11 yards for a touchdown to close out the 
scoring with two minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior quarterback Derek Lemkin completed seven of 17 passes for 79 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Kevin Goldfein caught five passes for 41 yards.

WILLIAMS PROVES YOUTH PREVAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Follow the blockers or follow the signs. Easy directions, even for a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 When tailback Ed Williams of St. Mary's gets through banging heads on the 
field, he heads to the sidelines, where his place in the pecking order also is 
well-scripted. 
</P>
<P>
 Every offensive starter has a folding chair placed near the team bench, each 
with the player's position taped to the back. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so we can go over our plays and mistakes," Williams said. "So guys 
aren't wandering over here and over there." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams wandered plenty Saturday, setting a school single-game record with 38 
carries as the Gaels hung on for a 20-10 nonconference victory over Cal State 
Northridge at St. Mary's Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who graduated in June from Canyon High, finished with 116 
hard-earned yards -- a personal high -- and carried on all but eight of the 
Gaels' running plays. He also caught three passes for 43 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 He broke the mark of 31 carries set by Daryl Rogers against Santa Clara in 
1990. St. Mary's has played football, off and on, since 1892. 
</P>
<P>
 Heavy work indeed for Williams, a guy charitably listed at 5-foot-9, 160 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm fine now," Williams said, 15 minutes afterward. "I'm ready to go get 
something to eat." 
</P>
<P>
 Like a side of beef. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams wasn't sure how many times he carried. A week earlier, he set 
personal highs with 30 carries for 115 yards, so busting marks has become a 
mundane event. Told of the numbing number, he beamed broadly. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a lot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In terms of running style, Williams doesn't blow anybody away with pure speed 
or a blinding cutback. He picks his spots, slides around, and works all the 
angles to make tacklers miss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try not to get too down on myself," he said. "If guys see me getting after 
it, it starts a chain reaction and that's when we make the big play." 
</P>
<P>
 His longest gain on the ground was 17 yards. He had 15 carries that went for 
one yard or less -- seven resulted in losses.  
</P>
<P>
 "They were the toughest-hitting team I've ever faced," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm definitely bruised." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge (3-3) considered signing Williams last season and scouted a couple 
of his high school games. But the Matadors didn't sign a freshman running back 
to a scholarship in 1994.  
</P>
<P>
 "He's a good little back," Northridge Coach Bob Burt said. "He's quick and he 
plays hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams broke loose for 17 yards around left end and scored on a seven-yard 
run on the next play to give St. Mary's a 14-point early in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge didn't recover.

 Quarterback Jamie Sander passed for three touchdowns and ran for another as 
San Bernardino Valley College hammered host Antelope Valley, 34-14, Saturday 
night in a sloppily played Foothill Conference game. 
</P>
<P>
 The visiting Indians (3-2-1, 3-0-1 in conference play) wasted little time in 
setting the tone for the night. On the first play from scrimmage, tailback 
Norman Clarke raced 39 yards to the Antelope Valley 21. On the next play, 
Sander connected with wide receiver Damond Wilkins for the first of their two 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley (1-5, 1-3), which managed only 45 yards rushing, briefly 
pulled even when running back Roosevelt Miller bolted 72 yards for the tying 
score midway through the first quarter.

GLENDALE DEFENSE FINALLY BENDS, BUT VAQUEROS STILL WIN, 19-10 
</P>

<P>
 The scoreboard was on the blink Saturday when Glendale College visited West 
Los Angeles for a Western State Conference interdivisional game. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents don't have much use for a scoreboard anyway when facing the 
Glendale defense. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vaqueros held the West L.A. offense without a touchdown, limiting the 
Oilers to 182 yards while posting a 19-10 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Glendale defense has allowed one touchdown and three field goals in three 
games. The Vaqueros (3-2, 2-2 in conference play) went more than six quarters 
without giving up a point before the Oilers' Omar Moreno kicked a 38-yard field 
goal late in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
 West L.A.'s only other points came on the ensuing kickoff when Cedrick Ledet 
scooped up Dylan Washausen's fumble and raced 30 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale's Hector Valencia led all rushers with 109 yards in 21 carries, and 
Ilan Zilberman added 93 yards in 21 carries, scoring on a 20-yard run on the 
Vaqueros' first series. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaquero quarterback Jose Delgado, who sat out the last game with a bruised 
shoulder, returned to complete nine of 18 passes for 124 yards, with one 
interception. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale's Tim Hilton had three receptions for 68 yards.

VENTURA HOLDS ON IN THE WIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With swirling winds wreaking havoc throughout, play was downright ugly at 
times during Ventura College's football game Saturday at Compton. 
</P>
<P>
 The passing statistics for both teams took a beating, and it was a game 
probably nobody will want to commit to memory. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was one significant bright spot for Ventura: The Pirates withstood a 
late Compton rally to hold on for a 23-16 Western State Conference 
interdivisional victory.  
</P>
<P>
 That didn't stop Ventura Coach George Rosales from lecturing his team after 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't consistent at all," Rosales said. "We did some real stupid things. 
We just didn't play well. But we won and that's the most important thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Barely. Compton (3-2, 2-2) drove 51 yards in slightly more than a minute and 
reached the Ventura 17-yard line with 11 seconds remaining. Quarterback Jimmy 
Perry scrambled for an apparent touchdown on the next play, but it was called 
back because of a holding penalty. Perry then tried a desperation pass into the 
end zone that fell short as time expired. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura (4-1, 3-0) led the entire game, including 23-10 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 John Patton, who rushed for 142 yards and a touchdown in 10 carries, sat out 
the second half because Rosales said he violated an undisclosed team rule.

SOUTHWEST THWARTS PIERCE ON DESPERATION PASS, 26-25

 Colorado-Michigan this game wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Just the same, on the three-week anniversary of one of college football's most 
amazing plays, L.A. Southwest quarterback Akili Roberson celebrated by 
completing a desperation pass of his own Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing the part of Colorado's Michael Westbrook was John Carter, who caught 
Roberson's 36-yard prayer between two defenders with 10 seconds left to give 
host Southwest a 26-25 victory over Pierce in a Western State Conference 
interdivisional game. 
</P>
<P>
 And it was Roberson, of course, doing his best Kordell Stewart impersonation. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Dave Muir sparked what had been an inept offense with 149 passing 
yards in the fourth quarter as Pierce erased a 20-3 deficit. Muir's 20-yard 
touchdown pass to Reggie James put Pierce ahead, 25-20, with 5 minutes 36 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brahmas (1-4, 1-3) scored a touchdown on their first three possessions of 
the fourth quarter, but Southwest (2-4, 1-4) came up with the one that 
mattered. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberson's game-winning pass put an exclamation point on a two-minute, 93-yard 
drive. Roberson passed for 179 yards and three touchdowns; Muir completed 21 of 
40 attempts for 267 yards and two touchdowns.

SANTA CLARITA VALLEY INVITATIONAL; SUDDENLY, PALMDALE'S ARCE ROMPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After opening the season with a disappointing performance, Antonio Arce of 
Palmdale High is starting to shift gears. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest evidence came Saturday when the Falcon senior won the Division I 
boys' race of the Santa Clarita Valley Invitational at College of the Canyons. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Arce's time of 15 minutes 39 seconds over the 2.9-mile course was not 
particularly fast by his standards, the suddenness in which he blew the race 
open made it obvious he had plenty in reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 As one observer put it, "When he decided to go, the race was over in 20 
yards." 
</P>
<P>
 Arce was content to share the lead with his brother, Mario, and Hoover 
sophomore David Lopez for the first two miles, but when he pushed the pace 
shortly thereafter, neither of them could respond. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez finished second in 15:45 and Mario Arce, a junior, was third in 15:53. 
The Arces' 1-3 finish propelled Palmdale to a 61-88 victory over Reedley. 
Hoover edged Belmont, 92-94, for third. 
</P>
<P>
 Arce said he used the race as a tuneup for Saturday's Mt. San Antonio College 
Invitational. "I just wanted to run with the leaders and help my brother for 
the first two miles," he said, "and then just take off up that last hill." 
</P>
<P>
 Arce, the runner-up in the 3,200 meters in the State track and field 
championships in June, finished a well-beaten fourth in the season-opening 
Seaside race in Ventura. However, he has won four of five races since. 
</P>
<P>
 His only loss during that streak came at the Stanford Invitational on Oct. 1 
when he finished third behind Mike Stember of Sacramento Jesuit and Brett 
Strahan of Hart, but he avenged the defeat to Stember by winning the Clovis 
Invitational a week later. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Arce, the Canyon girls' team is also improving as the season progresses, 
and placed five runners among the top 12 finishers to run away with the team 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon, led by the third-place finish of sophomore Julie Harris, totaled 40 
points. Clovis placed second with 81 and Rio Mesa was third at 120. Harris 
timed 19:27 over the 2.9-mile course to finish behind Hoover's Lorien 
Cleavinger (19:15) and Glendale's Rhaina Echols (19:24).

CAL LUTHERAN AGAIN FOLDS IN FOURTH QUARTER, FALLS TO REDLANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL LAZARUS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The frustration level is rising for the Cal Lutheran football team. 
</P>
<P>
 For the fourth consecutive week, the Kingsmen entered the late stages of a 
game with a great opportunity to win. Saturday against Redlands, an 
interception and two second-half fumbles by Cal Lutheran helped the host 
Bulldogs to a 23-7 victory in a Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic 
Conference game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now it's almost laughable," Cal Lutheran Coach Joe Harper said. 
"There's no question they are trying hard to win, but they might be trying too 
hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 10-7, early in the fourth quarter, Cal Lutheran (1-4, 1-3 in 
conference play) drove to the Redlands 27-yard line but Ryan Huisenga's pass 
was intercepted by Chad Freese. 
</P>
<P>
 "We drive the field all day and we got seven points the whole game," Huisenga 
said. "Ninety-five percent of the time we play well, but that last five we make 
mistakes and it kills us." 
</P>
<P>
 Three plays later, Matt Figueroa ran untouched 67 yards to give the Bulldogs 
(3-1-1, 2-0) a 17-7 lead with 8 minutes 40 seconds to play.  
</P>
<P>
 Any chance Cal Lutheran had for a comeback disappeared when Chad Valousky 
muffed a punt return and Freese recovered at the Kingsmen two-yard line. 
Figueroa scored on the next play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulldogs took the lead for good midway through the third quarter when 
Redlands linebacker Joe Kelly recovered a fumble by Terrence Thomas at the 
Kingsmen six-yard line. Tomek Mikler's 23-yard field goal gave Redlands a 10-7 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas led Cal Lutheran with 111 yards in 24 carries but had two fumbles. 
Huisenga completed 21 of 38 passes for 225 yards to give the Kingsmen a 
balanced attack. Receiver Billy Parra caught six passes for 98 yards and 
fullback Ivan Moreno had five receptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Redlands took a 7-0 lead midway through the first quarter when quarterback 
Bobby Hendrix and receiver Mark Manuel connected on a 66-yard play.  
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran responded late in the quarter with a six-play, 62-yard drive to 
tie the score. Huisenga and Parra connected on a 30-yard play to put the team 
in scoring position, and Parra caught a seven-yard touchdown pass with one 
second left in the quarter.

GOLF ROUNDUP; ELS HOPES TO MATCH OPEN WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four months ago, Ernie Els beat Colin Montgomerie in an 18-hole playoff to win 
the U.S. Open. Today, the two will meet again, this time over 36 holes, to 
determine the winner of the World Match Play Championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Els, repeatedly bailing himself out of trouble in the morning round, recovered 
to defeat a limping Jose Maria Olazabal, 2 and 1, while Montgomerie finished 
with two birdies to beat Vijay Singh, 1 up, in Saturday's semifinals at 
Virginia Water, England. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomerie and Singh were tied after 18 holes, but Montgomerie chipped in at 
the 23rd to go 2 up in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Estes took another step toward his first PGA Tour victory as he put 
together the lowest 54-hole score of the year and stretched his lead to four 
strokes in the $1-million Texas Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Estes shot a four-under-par 68 at Oak Hills Country Club in San Antonio for a 
54-hole total of 18-under-par 195. That's two shots better than the previous 
three-round low this year, set by Lennie Clements in the Bob Hope Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 Gil Morgan shared second with Don Pooley at 199, and Brian Kamm was next at 
68-200. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Eichelberger shot a three-under-par 69 to take a three-stroke lead into 
the final round of the Senior Gold Rush tournament at Rancho Murieta. His 
two-day total is seven-under 137. 
</P>
<P>
 Chi Chi Rodriguez and Bob Murphy were tied at 140, with Jim Albus and Al 
Geiberger another shot back and Simon Hobday and Tom Wargo two behind. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Elaine Crosby shot a three-under 69 and opened a three-stroke lead over an 
elite field in the World Championship of Women's Golf at Naples, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Crosby had four birdies and one bogey on her third trip over the Naples 
National Golf Club. Her 11-under 205 gave her a three-shot edge over Laura 
Davies and a four-shot margin over Beth Daniel and Dottie Mochrie.

OVERLOOKING RAPE OF UNITED AIRLINES FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After reading your article on the United Airlines Shuttle start-up ("Shuttle 
Launch," Sept. 29), it would appear that one of the big problems with the 
airline is completely overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
 I refer to the very large multimillion-dollar buyout of its former CEO, 
Stephen Wolf. And as I read in the Wall Street Journal, one of their top 
executives was forced out of his position in a European company. I wonder how 
long it will be before UAL buys out its present top executives. How long will 
this rape of UAL funds go on?

GAMBLING AGAINST TRIP TO VEGAS BY GREYHOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Sept. 24 I was foiled in my attempt to buy a ticket to Las Vegas from 
cash-strapped Greyhound ("A Sick Puppy," Oct. 4), due to a complete lack of 
crowd control at the L.A. bus station. Customers entering the station didn't 
know if they should stand under one of four signs ("Southbound," "Eastbound," 
"Westbound," "Northbound") or if they should stand in one long line to buy 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 The security guard was instructed to bring the tail end of one long line of 
people to a newly opened ticket counter. As a result, some customers got served 
immediately and others waited an hour to buy tickets. By the time I got served, 
I was told that there were no more tickets to Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 I think I'll spend a little more money and fly to Vegas in a new Airbus 
jetliner (round-trip on America West: $78) instead of an old, smelly Greyhound 
bus.

WHY CAN'T WE GET CARE WE'VE BEEN PAYING FOR? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "Lost Health Insurance Deduction Is a Bitter Pill for Self-Employed" (Sept. 
7) contained the astounding information that corporations tax-deduct 100% of 
the cost of providing insurance for their employees. Self-employed persons were 
allowed a 25% tax deduction, which costs the Treasury $500 million a 
year.Expanding that to 100% would cost $2.5 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
 So the message is loud and clear: Who has been footing the bill for health 
care in America? Include Medicare, Medicaid, health care research, medical 
school subsidies, other health care tax deductions, and you can readily see 
that our federal government pays most of the $1 trillion to support our health 
care industry. So if Americans are paying for all that health care, why can't 
we get what that $1 trillion should buy? 
</P>
<P>
 We must ask the health insurance companies who spent our own premium dollars 
to defeat any attempt at a health care reform program in Congress. What a 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why it is most important we address this major problem of who pays and 
who profits from health care.

THE SUNDAY PROFILE; A GREATER POWER; HIS TALENT MAY BE MATCHED ONLY BY HIS EGO. 
BUT AARON CHANG STILL BOWS TO THE OCEAN THAT MADE HIM A STAR AMONG 
PHOTOGRAPHERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT WARSHAW, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Aaron Chang arranges a backdrop at the far end of his studio and moves back to 
his camera. The oversized room, a warehouse in the '30s, is stripped down to 
brick walls, hardwood floors and a high, curved wood ceiling. Chamber music 
plays on a stereo. The atmosphere is practical, understated and elegant, just 
as Chang would have it. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's project is to shoot portraits of local poets for a city lifestyle 
magazine. The first of six, a superannuated hippie in bare feet, jeans and a 
baggy vest, sits in three-quarter profile. Chang reaches out to adjust his 
subject's arm, composing his shot the easy way. The hard way is to do it while 
floating on an air mattress deep in the maw of a 12-foot wave at Sunset Beach, 
Hawaii, in hopes of nailing pro surfer Bruce Raymond as he floors it through 
the tube. 
</P>
<P>
 Being the world's top surf photographer, as Chang was throughout the '80s, 
requires a calculating mind. But on that day in 1983 his calculation failed 
completely: A Zeppelin-size ball of white water snuffed surfer and 
photographer, bouncing them off the rock bottom. Raymond was hospitalized with 
torn tendons in his knee. Chang floated in the channel for two hours as a huge 
bruise spread across his hip, unsure if he could kick his way to shore but 
wondering all the time if he had gotten the shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Working in far safer conditions, Chang smoothly clicks off three more 
exposures of the barefoot poet, then says, "That's it." Later that day, he 
considers his career, pointing out the obvious in a soft, factual voice: "I'm 
productive. I'm reliable. I'm bankable." Then, reflecting on poets and surfers, 
bikini models and Nobel scientists, elephants in the Namibian bush and his 
hundreds of other subjects: "And I'm pretty versatile too." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chang shifted his attention to mainstream commercial and editorial work five 
years ago, with good, if not earth-shaking, results. He shot a Nike swimwear 
catalogue. His image of a love-struck couple at Hussong's Cantina became the 
best-selling poster of 1989 and did well for three years. His work has appeared 
in Newsweek, Sports Illustrated, GQ, People, US and Elle. 
</P>
<P>
 But he has stayed active in surfing, partly for love and money and partly 
because, after grinding away as a cog in the huge corporate 
advertising/editorial machine, he can still, at his convenience, walk the 
beaches of the surf world as a genuine star. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is as it should be. More than anyone else in the past 15 years, Chang 
has shaped the artistic and business boundaries of surf photography. "When 
American Photographer (magazine) put Chang on the cover," says Jeff Divine, 
photo editor of Surfer magazine, recalling the July, 1985, issue that also 
featured a 16-page Chang portfolio, "it was a big thing for all of us. 
Massively big. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finally, the world had a real look at what we do. Here it is, surf 
photography: It's beautiful, it's difficult, it takes years of training. Maybe 
somebody else could have stepped in and had their work shown off in a similar 
way. But Aaron was the one. He deserved it." 
</P>
<P>
 Divine then offers an explanation for Chang's success: "You know, it's not so 
much that Aaron is versatile. . . . It's that he's driven. I don't know where 
it comes from, but he's really driven -- to where it's almost scary." 
</P>
<P>
 At least part of that drive comes from the relentless teasing Chang says he 
got about the shape of his eyes at school in Imperial Beach, in the 
southwestern corner of San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a big part of my growing up. Really destabilizing," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Chang dismisses the idea that the childhood taunts helped fuel his 
career, then changes his mind. "It made me angry, definitely, and it made me 
want to be better than these kinds of people. So, yeah, actually, I think it 
has been an important factor in my success so far." 
</P>
<P>
 The ocean, Chang says, was his saving grace. He got his first surfboard at age 
11 and soon became a regular at the Imperial Beach break, "where there was no 
racism, just ability." One of the hottest local surfers, Chang recalls, was 
Filipino. Another was Mexican American. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he competed as a swimmer through high school and did schoolyard 
athletics, surfing moved him in a different way. It still does. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are moments when I enter the water," Chang says, articulating what he'd 
once found impossible to explain, "that I really do feel the presence of God. 
And those moments are very important to my psychological stability. 
Particularly in Hawaii, where you're surrounded by these tremendous currents of 
energy, to a point where there just is no denying this force greater than your 
own. You have to resign yourself to this greater power. Or at least I have to, 
or I can't do what I have to do." 
</P>
<P>
 On a temporal level, he loves the physical challenge of surfing, the way it 
lends itself to travel, and the idea that dedicated surfers can refine their 
technique well into middle age. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years before Chang took up surfing, his father had given him a Kodak 
camera for Christmas. He got a Super 8 movie camera a few years later and began 
shooting anything that moved -- including his friends riding waves.  
</P>
<P>
 His entry into professional photography, as Chang explains it, was little more 
than a means by which he could continue to surf full-time. After high school 
and two semesters of junior college photo classes, he moved to the North Shore 
of Oahu, center of the surfing universe, and for three years scraped by with an 
occasional photo sale to Surfing magazine. "Basically," Chang says, "my life in 
Hawaii was surfing and starving." 
</P>
<P>
 By 1977 Chang had found an informal mentor in Dan Merkel, then Surfing 
magazine's top gun. One afternoon, as they floated side by side on an air 
mattress at Sunset Beach, Chang asked Merkel how much money he made. The 
answer, $600 a month plus expenses for a near-constant series of surf 
adventures, stunned Chang. "This was absolutely amazing to me," he says. "The 
idea that a person could travel the world, surf the best places, get cover 
shots, and put away that kind of money. Yeah, I just went for it. Completely. 
And did it for 10 straight years, totally stoked." 
</P>
<P>
 Chang hit the high spots in Australia, South Africa and Bali, as well as 
Madagascar, Namibia and Peru. In winter he would be back at the North Shore, 
where the best surfers return, as they have for the past 40 years, to ride the 
strongest and best-shaped big waves in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Chang's rise as a photographer corresponded with a steady upswing in the surf 
industry. The money got better and better. In 1989, at age 33, he had a $40,000 
annual retainer from Surfing magazine and was billing $20,000 for free-lance 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The non-surfing world had also taken note of his work. In 1983, Chang's photos 
appeared in a coffee-table book titled "A Day in the Life of Hawaii," and he 
contributed to the ensuing series on Spain, Canada, Japan, America and the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 He had hit his full artistic stride when the American Photographer feature 
came out. His portraiture was well composed and technically perfect, his 
land-based images found new angles on done-to-death places, and his water 
photography, built on his still-formidable swimming ability and knowledge of 
waves, was deep and tight. 
</P>
<P>
 Chang helped perfect a technique in which the photographer, holding a 10-pound 
camera and housing in both hands and adjusting his water position via 
kick-strokes, allows himself to be pulled vertically up the face of a wave just 
as it curls. As the surfer rides by, the photographer, now positioned near the 
ceiling of the wave, swings his camera toward the rider, hits the shutter, then 
ducks out through the back. The resulting image puts the viewer at ground zero. 
The surfer should seem close enough to touch, the crashing wave close enough to 
feel. 
</P>
<P>
 Other surf photographers were doing excellent work too. Don King swam as well 
as Chang, if not better, and often got even deeper into the tube. Portrait 
shots by Art Brewer and Jeff Hornbaker had more of an edge. Surfer magazine's 
Divine and Craig Fineman did impeccable work from the land. Still, nobody was 
quite as impressive as Chang. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that separates Aaron from the rest of the pack," says Larry Moore, 
Surfing magazine's photo editor since 1977, "is that he always makes the right 
decisions: what lens to use, where to set up, what exposure, what film. Some 
guys, even some of the good guys, never completely master all the variables. 
Aaron does that stuff as easy as breathing." 
</P>
<P>
 Pro surfer and big-wave specialist Brock Little, who has known Chang for 10 
years, calls him the ultimate surf photographer. "His intensity carries," 
Little says. "It's motivating. Other guys are laid-back, cruising. I do what I 
want, and they get the shot or they don't. Aaron likes to take charge." 
</P>
<P>
 If Chang also has earned a part in the surf photographers' "personality freak 
show," as another pro surfer puts it, it is a minor one. Although the sport has 
been tremendously well-served by its visual historians since the mid '30s, when 
Hermosa Beach dentist John H. (Doc) Ball built a wooden water housing for his 
Graflex and paddled out at Palos Verdes Cove to shoot his friends steering 
their 11-foot, 100-pound redwood planks toward shore, the ranks have been 
filled with societal fringe-dwellers.  
</P>
<P>
 One of Surfer magazine's top photographers of the '60s never fully recovered 
from a long series of acid trips and disappeared into the Hawaiian tropics, 
never to be heard from again. In 1987, Angus Chater, a young Englishman whose 
work had just been featured in an eight-page Surfer magazine spread, ran a tube 
from his car's exhaust pipe to its driver's side window, turned the key and 
asphyxiated himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then you have the garden-variety manic-depressives and alcoholics," says Rob 
Gilley, photo editor for the quarterly Surfer's Journal, "and the drug addicts, 
the suspected pedophiles, the guys who call at 3 in the morning to check if 
their latest stuff has arrived, on and on. It's not quite as strange today as 
it used to be. But going down the line of surf photographers, man to man, it's 
incredible how many head cases you find." 
</P>
<P>
 Low pay, artistic sensitivity, too much travel, too much competition -- nobody 
knows exactly why so many of them wander off. 
</P>
<P>
 Chang is unlikely to be remembered as a head case, but rather as one who takes 
a lordly view of his position in the surf world. "Chang," says pro surfer 
Little, "is one arrogant bastard." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, Chang told Surfing magazine that the growing number of photographers 
on North Shore beaches had turned the area into a "maggot scene." As Gilley 
recalls, "Some of the best guys in the business today were just getting started 
when Aaron said that, and (they) still haven't forgotten. It left a lingering 
bad taste in a lot of mouths." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chang thinks a moment about his reputation as he strips off his wet suit after 
a mid-morning surf at Black's Beach in La Jolla. He and his wife of two years 
had arrived an hour earlier, driving a short distance from their home in the 
just-completed Chateau Village tract in Del Mar. ("About as First World as it 
gets," he says with quiet disdain. "One of the compromises of married life.") 
</P>
<P>
 Erika, 24, is still out bodyboarding. Later, she will go to work two doors 
down from her husband's studio, marketing Aaron Chang Photoactive Wear, a line 
of T-shirts and sweat shirts featuring black-and-white reproductions of the 
photographer's work. 
</P>
<P>
 Chang looks out at the small autumn waves. He understands the charges of 
arrogance but writes them off as a misinterpretation of what he calls a 
disciplined work ethic. It's a convincing argument until Chang undermines it: 
"Quite often, I'd be making decisions and not following anybody. I work on this 
different level. Those guys, the other surf photographers, would be hanging 
around, chummy with each other. And I was really serious. A lot of people don't 
understand the process of being the best." 
</P>
<P>
 If he can be highhanded on occasion, quiet confidence is the rule. His 
thoughts emerge well-structured and balanced. In a recent interview on KPBS, 
San Diego's National Public Radio affiliate, Chang spoke without a trace of 
SoCal beach inflection and remained composed when his questioner brought up the 
sexism issue: the photographer's seven-year contribution to Surfing's annual 
swimsuit issue, or, as a mid '80s cover blurb put it, "Bikinis! Bikinis! 
Bikinis!" 
</P>
<P>
 "I've thought a lot about the sexism argument," he says later, "and this is 
what I've come up with. I think I have a healthy love of women. I think I'm a 
product of my environment. And I think my sexuality, in some ways, is as 
contradictory as it is for society at large." After a three-year hiatus, Chang 
will do Surfing's 1995 swimsuit issue. "But the magazine can't use the work 
bikini ," he says with a touch of rationalization. "And I want to show the 
girls in the water surfing, not just posing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chang gave up full-time surf photography in 1990, just before the surf market 
crash that cut San Clemente-based Surfing's size in half, to about 100 pages 
monthly. 
</P>
<P>
 A long-running feud with Jeff Hornbaker, who lived with Chang in Hawaii in the 
early '80s and collaborated with him on photo projects, had something to do 
with the decision, Chang says. So did the drain of hanging around with the 
perpetually stoked, although Chang makes allowances for hyper-focused young 
surfers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I relate to what they do, I understand it, I dig the enthusiasm. It's the 
guys in their mid or late 20s, or older, who still haven't learned how to look 
outside of surfing -- those guys bring me down. Surfing is strange that way. On 
one hand it's this great force, this physical and spiritual thing, but it can 
also be a real block to growth. People get sucked into it and don't come back 
for a long, long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Chang set up shop in San Diego in 1992 with two other studio photographers, 
already well into his transformation from surfing specialist to mainstream 
utility man. His "Kiss" poster series, variations on the best-selling Hussong's 
poster of 1989, was an early success. He did the American Cancer Society annual 
report in 1992, and photographed Joni Mitchell for US magazine. Chang's 
earnings this year, he says, will be more than $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aaron's doing well with the mainstream stuff," says Divine of Surfer 
magazine, "but . . . he's just got his foot in the door." 
</P>
<P>
 Chang's self-assessment: "I'm a rookie. I'm a rookie who shows a lot of 
promise. These," he says, gesturing to the framed "Kiss" posters on his office 
wall, "are like rookie home runs." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he no longer tours the world's best breaks, Chang stays close to the 
beach and surfs almost as often as he did as a teen-ager. In May, 1993, in 
two-foot waves at Imperial Beach, he flicked his board up and away at the end 
of a crummy ride and landed upside down in his own wake in shallow water. The 
top of his head hit the sand, producing fissures along his seventh vertebra. 
</P>
<P>
 Chang's right shoulder and arm were paralyzed. The first doctor recommended 
immediate surgery. A second said wait a few weeks and see. Chang agreed, 
leaving the hospital the next day with a neck brace and wheelchair. The 
paralysis lasted for three weeks, a period so confusing and full of fear that, 
after two or three minutes' worth of false starts, he gives up trying to talk 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, after 10 months' rehabilitation, Chang went back to Imperial Beach 
with his water housing and camera, swam out in the pre-dawn light and took a 
series of high-action -- and highly therapeutic -- surf shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Physically, I'm completely healed," he says. "But I have a sense of mortality 
that wasn't there before. I'm not afraid of dying. But I'm afraid of pain, and 
afraid of these imagined moments of impact. I have moments of fear, 
particularly in traffic, that just grip me completely." 
</P>
<P>
 An assistant enters the office and hands Chang a coffee-table book, "Golf: the 
Greatest Game," and he is happy to change the subject. "Wow, look how far I've 
come," Chang says deadpan, slightly amused that a still-hard-core surfer did 
the cover of a golf book, a shot of a player watching his ball disappear into a 
rainbow. 
</P>
<P>
 He's much more interested in talking about the North Shore big-surf season, 
which begins next month. It's a comeback year, although Chang doesn't use the 
phrase. The crowd of photographers, again, will be his biggest obstacle. The 
only way around it, he says, will be to go out when the waves are so big, thick 
and gnarly that the rest of the pack retreats.  
</P>
<P>
 He pulls out some old surf magazines, thinking out loud about his approach 
this year, that if conditions allow he could engineer something new. "I don't 
need to be wildly productive. I've done that. The challenge for me in surf 
photography is to be creative again." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked which of his shots he's most proud, Chang is silent, turning pages. 
Without looking up, he answers. "It's too early to ask that question. The 
strongest phase of my career is ahead of me." The residual fear of neck injury 
is out of his mind now, and Chang's quiet voice is confident, bordering on 
arrogant. Aaron Chang 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 38. 
</P>
<P>
 Native?: No; born in Arizona, raised in Imperial Beach, now lives in Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 Family: Married for two years to Erika Chang. 
</P>
<P>
 Passions: Surfing, reading, traveling. 
</P>
<P>
 On his father: "He served in World War II, got in on the GI Bill, and went to 
school in Ohio because he wanted to see Middle America. He's a very adventurous 
person. I think I got a lot of my wanderlust from him. He went to the 
University of Mexico for a year, in the late '40s, to study bullfighting. I've 
seen a picture of him in a suit of lights, before he fought his first bull." 
</P>
<P>
 On the challenge of water photography: "Because of the interaction with 
surfers and with the ocean, and because it's so physical, it can be very 
exciting. Most photography is passive. Water photography is almost a sport in 
itself." 
</P>
<P>
 On productivity versus creativity: "Productivity really does quash the 
creative drive sometimes. Creativity is stronger at the outset of your career, 
when you don't really know any better. You're so enthusiastic that you'll 
devote two or three hours to a single shot."

SOCIAL CLIMES: SAY ADIOS TO THE CLASSROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK EHRMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a Sunday afternoon at the Cafe Tropical in Silver Lake, while the espresso 
machine sputters its endless stream of coffee and steamed milk, a small group 
of students lounges on couches in the back room, sipping cafes con leche and 
learning la importancia del pasado.  
</P>
<P>
 The importance of the past tense. 
</P>
<P>
 "? Que desayuno? " (What did you have for breakfast?) teacher Luis Vega asks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Desayune mahi-mahi," answers Casey Coss, a Sherman Oaks businessman. 
</P>
<P>
 Unusual, but grammatically correct. "Mahi - mahi es muy exotico, " Vega 
observes. 
</P>
<P>
 On various weekend afternoons and weekday nights for the last five months, 
Vega, a former Berlitz teacher, has turned what is normally a gallery and 
billiard room into a kind of Cafe Lenguaje. Here, students, assembled based on 
the similar careers, interests and language level they share, can learn Spanish 
in a milieu more relaxed and less stultifying than the typical classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Vega, 33, who also works as a translator and a consultant for businesses that 
have monolingual Latino employees, chose the Cafe Tropical because "I've been a 
frequent customer and I like the atmosphere. I realized a lot of the customers 
speak some Spanish and really wanted to learn the language in a more realistic 
environment." The approach seems to work. Coss has been taking Spanish classes 
here for 10 weeks. "This concept and this approach really suited my situation," 
he says. "I own property in Silver Lake, so I'm in this community very often 
and that's how I learned of the class and the Tropical." 
</P>
<P>
 Another draw for many students is the intimate class size. Vega says he tries 
to keep it down to four students, never more than six. An added homey touch is 
that the coffee and the Tropical's guayaba con queso pastelillos (guava with 
cheese pastries) are free. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely been the most worthwhile language-learning experience I've 
ever had," says Liz Pruyn, a marketing director for a bilingual foundation. "I 
wanted something that would be more casual and more fun than taking classes at 
UCLA Extension or something like that.  
</P>
<P>
 "(Those classes are) not as fun and you don't get the attention, because 
you're in a huge class full of people. Here it's like it's just him and he 
corrects you every single time you get something wrong, so it's much more 
reinforced." 
</P>
<P>
 And for those members of the class who are Cafe Tropical regulars, the 
instruction continues even when the lessons are over. "We come in and get 
coffee sometimes, separate from the class," Pruyn says. "And the guys at the 
counter will only speak Spanish to us. (Vega) tells them to." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Cafe Tropical, 2900 Sunset Blvd., Silver Lake.  
</P>
<P>
 Price: $25 for each two-hour class.  
</P>
<P>
 When: Times and levels vary. Luis Vega: (213) 644-0137.

SOCIAL CLIMES / THE BUZZ: ANNOUNCING THE 6-FIGURE MEAL DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Wilshire, certainly one of the most deluxe condominium towers in town, is 
offering as a perk to those who buy a unit a catered, private dinner party for 
six.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, we don't know if a meal in one of the Wilshire Corridor building's party 
rooms would entice you to spend between $600,000 and $5.6 million on a condo, 
but just in case, here are the details. 
</P>
<P>
 The building's head of security, Derek Chadwick, reportedly a trained, cordon 
bleu chef, plans the menu while the Splendid Feast, a catering company in 
Tarzana, does the cooking. Up until now, the bonus dinners were held at the 
Peninsula Hotel, but this must be so much cozier. 
</P>
<P>
 While we would never profess to have our finger on the pulse of L.A. real 
estate, it appears that you may have some time to ponder the offer -- 40% of 
the building's 97 custom-designed units are still available. 
</P>
<P>
 Refined Sense of Smell: Speaking of deluxe, the Regent Beverly Wilshire just 
completed the $5-million renovation of its ballroom -- a room, we might add, in 
which we've spent many an evening.  
</P>
<P>
 Besides installing state-of-the-art acoustics and lighting, ball-goers will 
notice a massive new Venetian glass central chandelier surrounded by satellites 
of smaller chandeliers, a deep blue velvet valance on the stage, new 
Aubusson-patterned carpeting and jewel-colored upholstery.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, if you had spent all that money redecorating, would you invite 2,000 
cigar lovers to stink up the place? On Tuesday, at one of the first events in 
the new ballroom, Cigar Aficionado magazine sponsored its "Big Smoke" gala with 
cigar samples, cigar-rolling demonstrations and displays of cigar-related 
paraphernalia. (Proceeds of the event, you might want to know, went to the AIDS 
Action Foundation.)  
</P>
<P>
 A Super Salad: It's our Saturday ritual. Manicure at Jessica's, Chinese 
chicken salad at Chin Chin on Sunset.  
</P>
<P>
 We were happy to learn that we are in good company, speaking strictly of the 
salad. Supermodels Iman, Claudia Schiffer, Beverly Johnson and Christy 
Turlington all order the same thing.  
</P>
<P>
 The other good news for all of us: The salad contains only 400 calories.

WHAT'S HAPPENED TO SHAME? IT'S VANISHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bravo for Robin Abcarian's "Whatever Happened to Good Old-Fashioned Shame?" 
(Sept. 25). 
</P>
<P>
 Abcarian is correct regarding the disappearance of appropriate shame.By 
appropriate I mean the species of feelings that once followed the commission of 
egregious acts against others.  
</P>
<P>
 Feeling shame is the first step in accepting responsibility for a bad deed. 
This does not occur in a vacuum. Some semblance of priorities, values and 
morals must be instilled before shame unfolds. 
</P>
<P>
 Since many parents are not teaching priorities, values and morals to their 
children, a drastic change must occur. Schoolteachers are in an ideal position 
to role-model and teach these qualities to young children. The three Rs just do 
not cut it anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 JAN FERRIS 
</P>
<P>
 North Hills 
</P>
<P>
 Robin Abcarian wonders, "Whatever Happened to Good Old-Fashioned Shame?" and 
later asks "Have these people no shame?" 
</P>
<P>
 No. There is no shame, and these people have none. The concept of shame 
vanished from our lives when ethics were banished and laws were rendered 
impotent.  
</P>
<P>
 Fame and fortune are the orders of the day. Fame might be in the form of 
infamy and fortune could come as loot or booty, but that is OK. They can be 
euphemized and made legitimate.

A SURFING FAN MAKES WAVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re your article "A Shadow on the Waves" (Sept. 26): Like many other surfers of 
the older generation, I surfed with Bob Simmons. Bob was a genius but, to say 
the least, a very difficult person. 
</P>
<P>
 I was one of a group, along with the Stabler brothers, who first surfed "Three 
Mile" outside of Carpinteria, which is now known as Rincon. My family had a 
house at Malibu, so I also surfed there in the '40s.  
</P>
<P>
 Bob and his friends, unfortunately, set the tone of the sport when Bob 
invented light boards. Most of us were still riding Balsa redwood 110-pound 
boards, which were much slower than the new Balsa fiberglass boards. I can 
remember Bob yelling, "Coming down!" which really meant, "If you don't get out 
of my way, I'll take your head off." 
</P>
<P>
 If surfing had remained a gentle sport, I think many of us would still be 
surfing. Because of the pattern set by Bob and others like him here and in 
Hawaii, surfing is not a fun sport. It is dangerous competition every time you 
paddle out.

NON-KUDOS TO DRIVERS OF MTA'S BUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm writing in response to Jeannette K. Multer of Los Angeles, who commends 
the Metropolitan Transit Authority drivers ("Kudos to the Drivers of MTA's 
Buses," Letters, Oct. 2). 
</P>
<P>
 I am 14 and don't have a driver's license, so I depend on the buses.Many times 
when I've had to take the MTA to school, I'm standing at the bus stop waving my 
money in the air, thinking the bus will pick me up. To my surprise, the bus 
goes right past me. The next bus doesn't come for another hour. 
</P>
<P>
 I am outraged about how these MTA drivers can be so careless. I don't know 
what part of Los Angeles Jeannette K. Multer is from to have courteous MTA bus 
drivers, but where I live, these drivers are very rude and unfriendly.

WESTSIDE WATCH: LOBSTER'S FANS PROTEST HIS DINNER-PLATE FATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The latest celebrity on Sunset Boulevard: Spike -- a live, 12 1/2-pound 
lobster awaiting his fate at Gladstone's 4 Fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees and patrons of the restaurant, concerned the crustacean will soon 
become supper, are pleading for his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came in and saw him last Friday, fell in love with him and just kind of 
adopted him," said waitress Julie Gleason. 
</P>
<P>
 Spike is believed to be about 65 years old, but his days may be numbered. His 
date with fate is Nov. 1, when he will be given away during a drawing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope whoever gets him doesn't kill him," Gleason said. "I mean, he's 
survived (several) wars."

 WRONG NUMBER: A volunteer for state Assembly candidate Sheila James Kuehl, a 
Democrat, wasted a bit of energy recently when she hit up former Santa Monica 
Mayor Christine Reed for a campaign contribution. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed is campaign manager for Kuehl's Republican opponent in the 41st Assembly 
District race, Michael T. Meehan. 
</P>
<P>
 Meehan, a political newcomer, is the underdog in the race to represent the 
far-flung district, which sweeps from Santa Monica north to the Ventura County 
line.

 But, Reed reports, Kuehl's volunteer said her candidate "desperately needed" 
to raise $420,000 to ensure a victory. So far, Kuehl, a women's rights attorney 
who could become the first openly gay member of the state Legislature, said she 
has raised about $120,000 for the general election campaign.

<P>
 That's three times the amount Meehan has raised for both the primary and

 COP TALK: The coveted endorsements from Santa Monica's men and women in blue 
are in: Hedging its bets, as usual, the Santa Monica Police Officers Assn. 
split its City Council endorsements between the town's two political factions. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent Councilman Robert T. Holbrook and one of his running mates, Los 
Angeles prosecutor Ruth Ebner, got the nod from the police rank and file. They 
are running on a slate with Matt Kanny, backed by a group called the Coalition 
for a Safe Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 The police association's endorsement for the third council seat up for grabs 
on the November ballot went to Planning Commissioner Pam O'Connor, a member of 
the rival Santa Monicans for Renters Rights ticket. Her two running mates, 
Councilman Tony Vazquez and Bruria Finkel, were snubbed by the police group. 
</P>
<P>
 Police association President Steve Brackett said Vazquez "has consistently 
voted against police law-and-order issues that have come before the council." 
</P>
<P>
 Vazquez responds that the officers' group is taking a narrow view that 
enforcement crackdowns are the primary solution to lawlessness. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate move, the Fire Department union got behind all three members of 
the Coalition for a Safe Santa Monica ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates value the police and fire union endorsements because the two groups 
issue campaign mailings touting their choices to voters.

7 CITIES MAY LOBBY EDISON FOR DISCOUNTED ELECTRIC RATES; UTILITIES: MAYORS HOPE 
TO FORM JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY TO PRESS THEIR DEMAND. BUT STATE AGENCY MUST 
FIRST BE CONVINCED THEIR REQUEST IS JUSTIFIED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Seven local cities have tentatively agreed to join forces and demand lower 
rates from Southern California Edison. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayors of Culver City, Hawthorne, Gardena, Lawndale, Lomita, Inglewood and 
Carson are discussing the possibility of forming a joint powers authority that 
the mayors believe will lead to lower electric bills. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, group members agreed to seek support for the effort from their 
respective city councils and to schedule a public meeting on the matter in two 
weeks. If the plan becomes a reality, it would mark the first time California 
cities have banded together to demand lower electric rates, said Kyle DeVine, 
spokeswoman for the California Public Utilities Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, the cities would form a joint powers authority. The umbrella 
organization would bargain with Edison for lower rates and -- if, as some 
expect, the electric utility market is deregulated -- buy power from the least 
expensive provider. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading the charge is Culver City, which for the past year has been debating a 
proposal -- supported by Mayor Albert Vera -- to take over local electric 
service from Edison in hopes of reducing rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed joint powers authority, unofficially named the South Bay 
Joint Powers Commission, the seven cities would negotiate with Southern 
California Edison for a 25% discount on their cities' utility bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the cities could receive any discount on their rates, however, they 
would first have to convince the Public Utilities Commission, which approves 
utility rates, that the reduction is justified. So far, the commission appears 
skeptical. Said DeVine: "I'd be curious as to the reason why their rates should 
be lower." 
</P>
<P>
 Vera estimates that Edison annually sells $44 million in electricity to Culver 
City's 40,000 residents at a rate 40% more than that set by the Los Angeles 
Department of Water and Power. Edison charges 13.9 cents per kilowatt hour for 
its average residential customers, while the Department of Water and Power 
charges slightly more than 10 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 All of Edison's customers in the utility's coastal zone, where all seven 
cities are located, pay the same PUC-approved rate. The Los Angeles City 
Council sets the DWP's rates, which as a municipal utility is not governed by 
the Public Utilities Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison officials, who have not commented in detail on the joint powers plan, 
say the disparity shouldn't be surprising. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure the (DWP's) rates are lower -- they don't pay taxes and other things 
that investor utilities have to pay," said Margo Wells, manager of tariffs for 
Southern California Edison. 
</P>
<P>
 In the long term, the joint powers group would buy electricity in bulk if the 
power industry is deregulated, which is now under discussion in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Under deregulation, cities could operate their own municipal utilities and 
then form groups to buy power from a single provider, such as Edison or the Los 
Angeles DWP, instead of negotiating prices individually. 
</P>
<P>
 Vera contends that some large industrial power users already receive rate 
discounts based on the large amount of electricity they use. "If (Edison) can 
do it for them . . . they can do the same for us," Vera said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vera says the joint powers proposal grew out of a preliminary study Culver 
City conducted earlier this year that showed the city could save up to $10 
million if it took over Edison's distribution system. Edison has bitterly 
fought the takeover idea, which is still under discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, Culver City officials notified Edison that it must buy a 
business license to operate in the city. Edison has refused, although Vera said 
he has threatened to revoke Edison's right to operate there. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayors say they are convinced that economies of scale will work in their 
favor in the purchase not just of electricity, but also of other products and 
services ranging from automobiles to copying machines. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Hawthorne Mayor Larry Guidi: "If we stuck together . . . we could start 
quoting our own costs."

FOOTBALL CLASSES; WOMEN TACKLE BASICS OF BAFFLING 'GUYS' SPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY MOORE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For many women, watching a football game is about as much fun as tinkering 
with a car. Many say they just don't get the attraction of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why do guys get all excited about this game? You know, they start jumping up 
and down and yelling," said Laura Loftsgaarden, a postal worker in her early 
30s who lives in Los Angeles. "You know how it is when you're watching 
something that you don't understand and everyone else does?" 
</P>
<P>
 Loftsgaarden is one of about 100 people, almost all of them women, who have 
sought to solve at least part of the mystery recently at one of the Learning 
Annex's three-hour lectures, "Understanding Football." For $39, students were 
taught the basic rules and strategies of the game -- though some discovered 
that to know football is not necessarily to love it.  
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it would be more complicated," said Loftsgaarden, who attended the 
lecture last month. "It's kind of a silly thing to get so worked up over." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the class opened her eyes to football, Loftsgaarden's new 
understanding actually has closed doors with some of the men she meets. 
</P>
<P>
 "They clam up, like they don't want you to know how much they know, and they 
want to know how much you know before they'll say anything," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The lecture is offered several times -- before and during the football season 
-- and attracts about 20 students each time. (The last one for this season will 
be held Tuesday in Culver City.) A handful of men, mostly immigrants, have 
taken the course, but more than 90% of the students are women, said Steve Shia, 
who has been teaching "Understanding Football" for the two years the Learning 
Annex has offered it. 
</P>
<P>
 Shia played semipro football for nine years and had several tryouts in the 
1970s with National Football League teams, including the Cardinals, Redskins, 
Colts and Bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a teacher, Shia's goal is to show his students that football is more than 
a group of helmeted men in tight pants running amok on a field after an oblong 
ball. By the end of the class, most seem to understand that teamwork and 
survival skills are critical to winning a game, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women don't learn these skills at an early age, but men are picking it up in 
midget football and Pop Warner," Shia asserted. "I figure there is a spouse or 
a significant other they want to spend time with, and that's why they want to 
know about the game." 
</P>
<P>
 The notion of standing by her man led 52-year-old Renee Spinak to take the 
class in August. She is dating an avid UCLA football fan and, for her, 
"Understanding Football" was a form of relationship therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard enough to make any relationship work -- the more you have in 
common, the easier it is to get along," she said. "I can't think of too many 
women who like football who weren't inspired by a man." 
</P>
<P>
 Her boyfriend, Jim Snodgrass, is a member of the UCLA alumni band, which plays 
during tailgate parties before UCLA's home games. That means that Spinak has 
spent many weekends during the football season at the Rose Bowl, but now the 
games are less boring for her, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She seems to understand what's going on, but I'm not sure she understands the 
intricacies of the game," Snodgrass said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to Shia, Spinak and other students at least have the answers to 
rudimentary questions they have pondered for years. Spinak's biggest surprise 
was finding out that each football team has both an offensive squad and a 
defensive squad. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the punter and the quarterback were the same person," said Mary 
Hixson, 47, a chiropractor in Lawndale for the past 15 years. "I can't believe 
the punter is just there to kick." 
</P>
<P>
 She seems to be an exception to the rule in Shia's classes. Most women say 
they attended so that they can share interest in football with the men in their 
lives, but Hixson said she simply was tired of being isolated from the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was married, my husband and I would have people over to watch the 
game, and I would stand in the kitchen cooking, wondering what's going on," she 
remembered. "There would be women there, too, but they'd be like me, just 
sitting there not knowing anything and just cheering when the men did." 
</P>
<P>
 Shia encourages the students to think of a football game as if it were a war. 
Both have the same purpose, to gain land, and there can be only one winner and 
one loser, he explains. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the slang is similar, Shia pointed out. "There is 'a battle in the 
trenches,' quarterbacks are the 'field generals,' the teams use 'offensive 
weapons' and apply 'tactics,' and the players throw 'bombs,' " he recited. 
</P>
<P>
 Shia elaborates on this war analogy as he describes the players, the kickoff, 
first downs, defensive and offensive strategies, and special teams. 
</P>
<P>
 After gaining an understanding of the game, some graduates said, football 
reminds them more of real life than of a battlefield. The tactics that football 
players use on the field are similar to the skills needed to succeed in 
business, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you hit first, you've got an advantage, but if you wait, you're going to 
get hurt," said Leslie Nadell, the mother of a 13-year-old son who plays on a 
Pop Warner league team and is aspiring to play in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 It's too bad girls do not learn the basics of football at an early age, Hixson 
observed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They might be better equipped to survive in the working world," she said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: MALIBU; CITY OFFICIAL QUITS FOR LONG BEACH JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Planning Director Robert Bernard has announced his resignation to become a 
zoning officer with the city of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard, who has been Malibu's planning director since its incorporation in 
1991, made the announcement Monday.Among significant achievements during 
Bernard's tenure was his integral role in helping Malibu establish rebuilding 
guidelines and procedures for the 268 residents who lost their homes in the 
November, 1993, firestorm. 
</P>
<P>
 "As terrible as the disaster was, it did a lot to mature Malibu as a city and 
gave the staff the opportunity to do what the staff is hired to do . . . 
quickly," said Bernard, 43. "It was good for the city because it put the 
authority with the people who had to be most interactive with the residents." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard began his career as a planner with Long Beach in 1973 and spent 13 
years there before taking jobs in the planning and building departments of 
Manhattan Beach and Rancho Palos Verdes. He will begin work in Long Beach on 
Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Malibu Senior Planner Joyce Parker-Bozylinski has been appointed interim 
planning director until a new director is hired, said City Manager David N. 
Carmany.

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A summary of selected City Hall actions last week that affect the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
<P>
 * OFF-RAMP CLOSURE -- Initiated proceedings to have the Waterford Street 
off-ramp on the southbound San Diego Freeway closed because of a high number of 
accidents and low usage.The California Department of Transportation will make 
the final decision on the off-ramp, which is between Wilshire and Sunset 
boulevards. The ramp exits into a neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 STREET CLOSURE -- Approved the closure of Sunset Boulevard between Gardner 
Street and Olive Drive on Nov. 13 from 7 to 10 a.m. for a 5K run/walk. The 
event is sponsored by Project Angel Food, a nonprofit organization that 
prepares and delivers hot meals to home-bound people with AIDS. HOW THEY VOTED 
</P>
<P>
 * CHILDREN'S CENTER -- Approved the establishment of the Westside Children's 
Center at 12120 Wagner St. in Mar Vista. The facility will provide care for up 
to 50 children in a 9,800-square-foot, two-story building. Several neighborhood 
residents were against the center, in part because of the increase in traffic 
it would cause. Proponents contended that the increase would be slight and 
argued that it was a small price to pay for the center. 
</P>
<P>
 Passed: 14-0 
</P>
<P>
 Voting yes: Marvin Braude, John Ferraro, Ruth Galanter, Jackie Goldberg, Nate 
Holden, Mark Ridley-Thomas, Zev Yaroslavsky. 
</P>
<P>
 * ATTRACTING BUSINESS -- Authorized the director of planning to accept a 
$1.2-million grant from the federal government to fund a study of ways to 
create incentives for businesses to locate near bus and subway stops. 
Increasing business traffic around those stops presumably would increase public 
transit ridership. 
</P>
<P>
 Passed: 12-0 
</P>
<P>
 Voting yes: Braude, Ferraro, Galanter, Goldberg, Holden, Ridley-Thomas, 
Yaroslavsky. MICHAEL KRIKORIAN

COVER STORY; TECHNO-EDUCATION; AREA SCHOOLS ARE SEEKING TO EXPAND 
COMPUTER-ASSISTED INSTRUCTION 
</P>

<P>
 On the first day of school, a bilingual robot greets second-graders in teacher 
Audrey Swartz's class, handing out stickers to "good listeners" and pointing 
out maps and puppets in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hello boys and girls. Buenos dias. Welcome to Room 15," says the 2-foot-tall 
robot, called Robie, its mouth blinking and eyes glowing like headlights. 
</P>
<P>
 Swartz used the robot to introduce her sneakered charges to the world of 
educational technology. Within a few weeks, her class at Linwood E. Howe School 
in Culver City will be programming the robot, creating multimedia reports on a 
personal computer, and studying the human body and nature by scanning bar codes 
into a laser disc player. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to be on the cutting edge," said Swartz, 49. "I know that the kids 
are fascinated by it." 
</P>
<P>
 In Culver City and numerous other schools on the Westside, technology is 
taking root in classrooms, from kindergarten to 12th grade. A move to equip 
schools with computers stalled in the late 1980s and early 1990s because of 
funding shortages, red tape and scarcity of teacher training. Today, many 
schools have developed creative ways to purchase technology and use it to 
benefit education. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an uneven picture to be sure. Some schools have barely moved beyond Apple 
II labs, but others are installing high-speed data transmission cables to link 
classrooms and access the Internet, the worldwide information network. 
</P>
<P>
 But educators agree that an important new phase of the technological arms race 
has begun in earnest. With high-tech skills now critically important in the job 
market, they say, computer technology -- once considered a luxury -- is viewed 
as a dire necessity. And educators increasingly value computers as a new way to 
reach students. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is their future," said Lynne Culp, an English teacher at University High 
School who is taking part in a pilot project to connect schools to the 
Internet. "Technology can be a route to stimulating learning." 
</P>
<P>
 Not long ago, computers were considered exotic in schools. A computer lab 
usually was reserved for the use of a few gifted mathematics students -- the 
"nerds." 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-1980s, more schools created bigger labs, mostly with a few 
first-generation Apple computers. The late 1980s brought the advent of on-line 
computer services and interactive CD-ROM software that features graphics, 
photographs and video footage, and the appeal of technology rapidly grew. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, however, most local schools were confronting budget problems. Many 
gave up on expanding computer technology programs in the late 1980s and early 
1990s, while others struggled to maintain what they had. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, California ranks between 44th and 48th in the nation in average 
student-to-computer ratio, about 20 to 1, according to the state Department of 
Education. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that ranking, however, there are signs that Westside schools are once 
again making technology a priority. This time, they're doing it far more 
deliberately. In many cases, districts are putting far greater emphasis on 
planning, teacher training and raising money through parent booster clubs, 
local businesses and special grants. 
</P>
<P>
 All the Westside's school districts -- Santa Monica-Malibu Unified, Beverly 
Hills Unified, Culver City Unified and Los Angeles Unified -- have either 
recently completed or are beginning to draft comprehensive technology plans. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica and Beverly Hills districts have both hired technology 
coordinators, people who will trouble-shoot and train teachers in the use of 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Culver City district sets aside more than $100,000 a year to buy 
technology, such as multimedia carts, featuring an overhead projector, liquid 
crystal display panels, Macintosh computers, CD-ROM drives and speakers, for 
every school. Ultimately, every classroom will have its own cart. The district 
is currently equipping each classroom with cable television and telephone lines 
for voice and modem communications. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica, meanwhile, boasts the Westside's most technologically advanced 
high school library, with several CD-ROM databases, an on-line periodical 
service and a computerized card catalogue. One of its elementary schools, 
Rogers, plans to link all its classroom computers by November so that students 
can collaborate on projects and communicate through electronic mail. 
</P>
<P>
 The district also has begun equipping all classrooms with ethernet data 
transmission lines, which transmit information faster than regular telephone 
lines but not as fast as fiber-optic lines. Next year, Santa Monica High School 
plans to open a career technology lab that will include computer-aided design 
equipment, a computer-controlled lathe and an experimental wind tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Some districts are just turning the corner. Beverly Hills, for instance, 
hasn't moved far beyond the late 1980s technologically. It has labs at all its 
schools, but new technology is sparse. The district also has an antiquated high 
school library where students still thumb through a card catalogue. Beverly 
Hills does, however, have plans to make technology a priority again, with hopes 
of wiring schools for faster data transmission over the next two years through 
use of a recently approved bond measure. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The picture is wildly uneven in the Los Angeles Unified School District, with 
some schools on the cutting edge technologically and others far behind. LAUSD 
clearly lags behind other Westside districts in plans for installation of data 
transmission cables. District officials say it will be up to each school to 
arrange for data transmission hookups, and there's no funding yet for internal 
classroom wiring, which district officials estimate will cost $100 million 
district-wide. 
</P>
<P>
 As much as it is financially feasible, the goal in most districts is to move 
away from the computer lab approach of the 1980s and toward the goal of a 
multimedia classroom -- something like Swartz's class in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 "Playing with a computer should be as natural an act for any child in the 
United States as using a toothbrush," said Tina Harris-Rouquette, an instructor 
at Edison Elementary School in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Such classrooms are scattered throughout the Westside. Swartz's is one 
example. Although she only has two computers in the classroom, she makes sure 
that all the students get scheduled periods at the keyboard. Often they work in 
pairs, using software that she has tailored to go with each lesson. She links a 
liquid crystal display panel to an overhead projector so students can compose a 
class newspaper as a group. As Swartz taps computer keys, the students bark out 
instructions on everything from layout to content. 
</P>
<P>
 Other schools are taking their first steps in this direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris-Rouquette, for example, wants to introduce more students to technology 
in her school by creating a schoolwide bilingual newsletter at Edison, which is 
in Santa Monica's poorest and most ethnically diverse neighborhood. In her 
program, she hopes to have gifted students work with students who struggle with 
basic reading and writing. She wants Spanish-speaking parents to brainstorm for 
newsletter topics and study English through the computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Using an $11,500 state technology grant and a district computer literacy 
grant, the school will get new computers with desktop publishing capabilities, 
and computers will go into every fourth- and fifth-grade classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the technology brings for us is the opportunity for growth that is 
multiplied a million-fold," Harris-Rouquette said. 
</P>
<P>
 Technology is also being used to reach some students who thus far have not 
been motivated to do schoolwork. Across town, at Olympic Continuation High 
School, English teacher Jack Casey has literally surrounded students with more 
than 20 computers. During four periods each day, about 90 youths, classified as 
at-risk by school officials, pass through his laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 In many cases, the technology has interested these students in schoolwork for 
the first time. When the students are not reading, they work on the computers 
-- practicing keyboard exercises, keeping personal journals, writing essays, 
connecting with the city's electronic bulletin board or looking up facts on a 
CD-ROM encyclopedia. 
</P>
<P>
 One recent morning, Sean Syphers, a restless 18-year-old who has had trouble 
concentrating on schoolwork, drew a perfect likeness of the cartoon character 
Yosemite Sam on a computer. Another student listened to a Beethoven string 
quartet through headphones. 
</P>
<P>
 Casey says the computer has freed these students from years of frustration 
with penmanship and essay revision. The students write essays about their 
lives, and Casey displays these often emotionally wrenching pieces on a 
bulletin board in the hallway. Principal Ben Villa said he still gets chills 
when he recalls the essay written by a girl who witnessed the stillbirth of her 
godchild. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the absolute joys in my life is to see the excitement in their eyes 
when they hit the 'print' button. . . . They can't believe that they've done 
all this," Casey said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Beverly Hills, sixth-graders at Hawthorne School use a special 
computer-friendly camera and a Macintosh to construct family trees. They 
incorporate photographs of their family members into the charts along with 
short descriptions of each person. 
</P>
<P>
 In Malibu, Joe DiMercurio, the librarian at Malibu High School, hopes that as 
his school goes on-line in the next year with the new ethernet 
classroom-to-classroom wiring, students can collaborate with peers from other 
schools, states and countries on science and social studies projects. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Hollywood area, students at Santa Monica Elementary School watch 
science and language lessons that are beamed into a satellite dish and taped 
for classroom use. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Pacific Palisades, Ryan Hill, a severely disabled 13-year-old with 
cerebral palsy, has single-handedly introduced countless teachers and peers to 
computer technology during his lifetime. Limited to the use of only one finger, 
he is able to "speak" and do class work only by tapping the keys of a talking 
computer attached to his wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother, Diane, illustrates how parents have become crucial in raising 
money for school computer projects. In 10 years, she has written about 30 
grants, winning about $60,000 for her son's schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way we knew anything was going on was through the computer. There 
was a lot of person in there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For all the success stories, there are plenty of examples of stalled progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost is a big factor. Hardware and software expenses are high enough, but 
schools also must contend with the costs of teacher training and technical 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 Stories abound of state-of-the-art labs that gather dust for a year or two 
because no one knows how to use them. 
</P>
<P>
 Another problem is bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Teacher Lynne Culp spent a couple of years on a fellowship learning about the 
wonders of the Internet. When she returned to University High last year, she 
says, she learned that Los Angeles Unified would charge her school $650 to have 
a technician install a phone line so the school could hook up to the network. A 
private telephone company would do the same job for about $50, she protested. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials say they're forming a focus group to study the $650 figure, 
which they say also covers future charges for telephone service. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the problem of "techno-phobia" among teachers, many of whom are 
reluctant to use a tool that their students understand better than they do. And 
training isn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
 It's particularly difficult in Los Angeles Unified, where many teachers are 
frustrated by salary cuts, strike threats and overcrowded classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of people who feel like, 'Don't bother me with this stuff,' " 
said Beverly Taylor, librarian at Hollywood High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, large districts appear to have a harder time gearing up 
technologically than do smaller ones. Los Angeles Unified has so far been 
unable to spread computer technology uniformly across its estimated 600 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's instructional technology office is small, with five specialists 
who tend to the demands of all the schools. Each specialist usually has a 
waiting list of five or six schools seeking assistance with technology. 
Maintenance requests take at least a week to handle. Teacher training occurs at 
training centers that teachers attend on their own time. Last year, only 1,100 
teachers out of 30,000 received technology training. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a drop in the bucket," said Vic Placeres, director of the school 
information systems branch. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is that, in Los Angeles Unified, schools are very much on their own 
as they try to enter the technological age. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Westside, Los Angeles Unified's student-to-computer ratio in 1993 
ranged from an outstanding 2-to-1 ratio at the Open School, a magnet elementary 
school in West Los Angeles that has been adopted by one of Apple's top 
executives, to a dismal 83-to-1 ratio at Selma Elementary in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Selma had suffered numerous break-ins and thefts over the years. Lucky for 
Selma, the school was completely rebuilt recently and equipped with a burglar 
alarm system. And Principal Doris Dent is using some of the reconstruction 
money to buy new computers. She also plans to apply to the state for technology 
grants. 
</P>
<P>
 "With our class sizes, it's important to have things that kids can look 
forward to," Dent said. 
</P>
<P>
 Playa del Rey Elementary, a school with a 67 to 1 student-to-computer ratio, 
hasn't been so fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Sharon Langman says the school booster club in her working-class 
neighborhood cannot raise much money. Her students don't qualify for federal 
funding for the poor and disadvantaged because income levels aren't low enough. 
Such funding would enable them to purchase computers. And there hasn't been 
anyone on staff who has the expertise to write an application for a technology 
grant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid that things are changing so fast that we won't be able to keep up 
with it," Langman said. "If our children are to compete in the 21st Century, 
they need to have the latest technology." 
</P>
<P>
 One of Los Angeles Unified's bright spots is the Pacific Palisades complex of 
schools, where teachers and parents have been invigorated by winning charter 
school status, a step that gives the schools more autonomy in budgeting and 
decision-making, said Christine Maxwell, a longtime technology teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many Los Angeles Unified schools, Pacific Palisades has its share of 
antique Apples, but it also has a high-tech library with everything from a 
CD-ROM encyclopedia to an on-line atlas. 
</P>
<P>
 In Pacific Palisades, as in other Westside communities with successful 
computer programs, officials say the key in recent years has been consistent 
support from the schools, the parents, business people and others. 
</P>
<P>
 That backing, says Culver City Unified's Audrey Swartz, has been good news for 
her students. 
</P>
<P>
 "We live in the age of technology and that seems to be the way we learn," 
Swartz said. "It seems like they will definitely be prepared for the future."

CONSERVANCY: PLAN TO PURCHASE ACREAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wider attention should be given to the rhubarb in Pacific Palisades over 
parklands and the conservancy's renewed attempt to move or buy out the 
Presbyterian Synod Conference grounds, which sit near the entrance of the new, 
expensively built Temescal Canyon Gateway at Sunset Boulevard and Temescal 
Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 There's been no word from the Synod.The YMCA has questioned the proposal 
because it believes the sale will affect its arrangement with the Synod 
regarding not only the Y's use of the pool, but also the eventual building of a 
new Y, which is desperately needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Money for the purchase of the Temescal acreage would come from Proposition A 
funds earmarked to "offer 'at risk' elementary school children" the enhanced 
positive values to be found in a camp experience. 
</P>
<P>
 What disturbs me is that no one asks what is the responsibility of the 
conservancy. Is its plan in Temescal Canyon proper use of Proposition A funds? 
Wouldn't it be better if the school board or private agencies with interests in 
youth development operated such camp facilities? Why can't the Synod or Y 
operate them, saving millions in land-purchase costs?

SANTA MONICA: DUTY TO HELP THE HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It sure is comforting to see that Bob Myers is back lecturing to the Santa 
Monica City Council about their constitutional duty to let the homeless roam 
our streets (Westside Watch, Sept. 11). 
</P>
<P>
 Myers should clearly take pride in all the help he and his Lawyers Guild chums 
provide for the homeless: keeping them on our streets running rampant over the 
rights of the majority to enjoy public property it maintains by payment of 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, yes, the homeless "advocates" will provide anecdotal comment that the 
homeless pay taxes, too. And that's what it is . . . anecdotal. 
</P>
<P>
 Few and far between pay any taxes and in no sense is it reality; in fact, 
those who do occasionally work do so "off the books" in the underground 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers and his arrogant "out-of-town" cohorts at the Lawyers Guild are 
interested only in punishing those who are living responsibly. Armed with their 
law degrees, they use the courts to lord over the political process, demanding 
that we feed, clothe and shelter every last person who they identify as needy 
-- even if it costs a small community like Santa Monica a billion dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 They will tell us (the voters) what we must do -- making a mockery of 
"representative" government, setting themselves up as constitutional 
aristocracy with the help of judges in an effort to solve every social 
pathology that arises in a society where everyone is a victim and personal 
responsibility is assessed about as often as baseball is being played these 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 In exerting their authority, these dictators of virtue care less about the 
safety of the majority of people in Santa Monica -- particularly our most 
vulnerable members, the elderly and the children. 
</P>
<P>
 How utterly moral. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's so helpful to those who refuse our public shelters and aimlessly 
wander our streets, isn't it?

HER MORTGAGE CHECK WON'T BE IN THE MAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the last business day of 1989, I did a very stupid thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Not realizing (who did?) that real estate was at its delirious peak, I signed 
the mortgage papers for my first house, a vintage two-bedroom bungalow in North 
Long Beach, one of the "affordable" areas of the city I'd lived in for several 
years. I put 10% down on the $165,000 purchase price and was delighted to snag 
a 30-year mortgage at 9.75%. 
</P>
<P>
 I've since come to the conclusion that living far from friends, night life and 
good bookstores is a drag, that maintaining a big back yard I never use is a 
nuisance and that my homeowner's tax benefits essentially are eaten up by my 
high monthly payments ($300-$400 or more than I'd be paying in rent) and 
property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 I can't rent out my house because my mortgage payment is twice as much as 
monthly rents in my neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 So I decided to sell. After having been turned down for refinancing last year 
because I had no equity in the house, I thought I had few illusions about the 
market. But I had no idea how bad things were. 
</P>
<P>
 Although I still owe about $144,000, similar houses in my area are selling for 
between $125,000 and $130,000. Add selling costs and the agent's 6% commission, 
and I'd have to pony up something like $27,000 simply to get rid of my house. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, I don't have that kind of money -- most of my savings went into the down 
payment and some early fix-up projects -- and even if I did, I'd be loathe just 
to throw it away. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd heard that many people actually were walking away from "upside-down" loans 
like mine. But letting the bank foreclose on my property sounded frightening -- 
a black mark on my good credit rating that might have awful repercussions in 
the future. Wasn't foreclosure just for deadbeats or for people who have lost 
their jobs? 
</P>
<P>
 After talking to several experts, I've concluded that most of the options for 
homeowners in this situation have major drawbacks in the current market, while 
foreclosure may not be the dread animal it appears to be. 
</P>
<P>
 The most frequent recommendation from experts is a "short sale," which permits 
the homeowner to work out an arrangement with the lender to sell the property 
at less than the remaining loan balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Some lenders say they are unlikely even to discuss this possibility with you 
until you stop paying your mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 At Home Savings, however, homeowners facing financial problems are encouraged 
to let the bank know "as soon as possible," according to public relations chief 
Mary Trigg, rather than waiting until they are no longer able to make their 
monthly payment. (In some hardship cases, Home Savings has allowed mortgage 
holders to skip several payments, which were then tacked onto the loan 
balance.) 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line, however, is that bankers will negotiate for a short sale only 
in situations of unavoidable hardship, such as loss of your job, unexpected 
business reverses or heavy medical bills. If you just want out, banks likely 
will foreclose. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's a good offer and a good possibility that the property will end in 
foreclosure two months from now," said Petra Vazquez, foreclosure administrator 
at First Interstate Bank in Los Angeles, "most investors will consider the 
offer. . . . (But) hardship and the loan type play a big role. We had one 
instance where the homeowner couldn't stay in her (crime-infested) 
neighborhood, but financially she had no problem." Her request for a short sale 
was denied. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each case is different, so there are no set rules," Trigg emphasizes. But, 
she adds, "if there is any rule of thumb, it is that you have to have a 
documented economic hardship." 
</P>
<P>
 If you have private mortgage insurance (PMI), as do most homeowners who put 
less than 20% down, it will protect 15%-25% of the loan, says Rick Alkire, 
owner of Mountain View Financial in Hemet, but the PMI agency has to agree to 
the short sale as well as the primary lender. 
</P>
<P>
 Some desperate homeowners may be tempted to sell their title to a company that 
promises to urge the lender to accept a short sale. The company pockets 1% of 
your note as a processing fee, and the property becomes a company investment 
rather than a personal residence. You are told that any losses would be claimed 
by the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound too good to be true? Richard Pittman at Consumer Credit Counseling in 
Los Angeles, a HUD-certified agency, warns that these companies don't tell 
consumers about their potential for tax liabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Say the bank is owed $150,000 but the value of the home has slid to $100,000. 
The bank can let it be sold at $100,000 and take the $50,000 loss, but 
according to IRS laws, that $50,000 is income earned by the seller -- income 
that should be taxed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, the IRS says they're not sure (how they will rule on such cases)," 
Pittman said. "This is the first year we're seeing these things pounce on the 
marketplace. It's an unknown element. If this client bails out of their house, 
they could have a tax lien looming down the road. Whether they (subsequently) 
rent or manage to buy another house, (the consumer who negotiates a short sale) 
is in grave jeopardy while the IRS is considering their position." 
</P>
<P>
 Two other commonly cited strategies -- a deed in lieu of foreclosure and a 
wraparound mortgage -- are not viable homeowner options in today's market. 
</P>
<P>
 A deed in lieu of foreclosure involves signing your deed back to the bank, 
thus eliminating the foreclosure process. This tactic is much more common in 
commercial properties, when more money is at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a normal tract home, you're not going to have any luck" pursuing this 
strategy, said Jay W. Deverich, a real estate attorney with Call, Clayton & 
Jensen of Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, Alkire adds, since the deed is a county-recorded document, your 
credit can still be damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 A wraparound mortgage marries a seller with a low-interest mortgage to a buyer 
unable to find a mortgage at a comparable rate. Common in the '70s and early 
'80s, when interest rates suddenly shot up, this scheme has been thwarted by 
non-assumable loans. Most deeds of trust issued during the past decade have 
"due on sale" clauses, meaning that any time you wish to sell, the lender can 
demand payment of the balance in full. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there is foreclosure, an initially daunting procedure that seems to 
be the best way out of my own dilemma. After researching this article and 
weighing the pros and cons, I decided to stop paying my mortgage in December. 
Conservatively estimated, that will give me until late spring to hang on to my 
house and bank the monthly payments before the property is repossessed. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, friends have reacted with astonishment and even indignation 
("Isn't that fraud?" someone asked me sternly). And, yes, I do worry about the 
inevitable blot on my credit rating. But I figure that the quality of my life 
has to be more important than the temporary status of my credit file. Life's 
too short to feel so frustrated, too short to hang on to a piece of property in 
the feeble hope it will substantially appreciate a few years from now. 
</P>
<P>
 As Deverich explained, if you have defaulted only on the original "purchase 
money" loan with which you bought a house with one to four units and it is your 
personal residence, then your loan is considered "non-recourse" under 
California state law. That means your lender cannot pursue your personal assets 
if the bank forecloses on your home. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some exceptions, Deverich says, relating to fraud (you told a lie to 
get the loan) and a murky area called "bad faith waste." For example, as a 
final angry gesture, you maliciously damaged your house. 
</P>
<P>
 But if you refinanced your house, as hundreds of thousands of homeowners did 
the past three years, Deverich said, "all of a sudden the magic purchase money 
protection goes away." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there is hope. If the loan is secured by a deed of trust on the 
property -- as is usually the case -- the lender has two options: a judicial 
foreclosure (a lawsuit to foreclose the deed of trust) or a non-judicial 
foreclosure (also called a trustee's sale). 
</P>
<P>
 Happily, non-judicial foreclosures are by far the most common. They take about 
four months and involve publishing notices of default and sale in a newspaper. 
You lose your property, of course, but under California law your lender can't 
sue you personally (unless you have committed fraud or bad faith waste). So you 
don't lose your credit cards, your wages, your car, your savings or other 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
 As the name implies, a judicial foreclosure involves a lawsuit. For the most 
part, lenders are loath to get involved in this time-consuming and expensive 
process. They prefer simply to resell the property. At First Interstate, 
Vazquez said to her knowledge the institution has never initiated a judicial 
foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, Deverich said, the only reason the bank would pursue a borrower 
through judicial foreclosure would be "if they're owed a whole bunch of money 
and the property isn't (worth) even close to what they're owed." To justify the 
time and expense involved, the lender also would have to be fairly certain the 
borrower had sufficient assets to execute against. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have an FHA mortgage, Consumer Credit's Pittman said, "by their 
regulations, they have (the) right to go after deficiencies for all loans. But 
their theory is, if a person didn't have enough to work with and had to get a 
FHA mortgage, what's the chance there'll be anything to recover?" 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Pittman pointed out that a judgment is good for 10 years, and it can be 
extended for another 10-year period. So if your career takes an upswing a 
decade later or you inherit money, you may still be liable for that loan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be interesting to see, as more lenders are facing more foreclosures and 
short sales, whether they'll consider judicial foreclosure," Pittman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deverich echoes these sentiments. Not only has the court system in California 
speeded up in recent years, but property values have dropped significantly, "so 
the potential deficiency that lenders are looking at having to swallow is 
growing compared to past years," he said. "The incentive is increasing for them 
to consider chasing the borrower who has assets. They're not so adverse to 
doing that anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 If you have a second or third deed of trust on your home, the situation is 
more complicated. The rule is that if the first deed of trust forecloses, it 
will wipe out the second (and any additional deeds of trust). In legalese, the 
second lender becomes a "sold-out junior," meaning they no longer hold the 
junior deed of trust. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news is that the borrower who signed the "sold-out junior" second is 
not protected against a lawsuit. "Unless there's just a tiny amount of money at 
stake or the lender knows the borrower has no assets, there's no reason why 
they wouldn't bring that lawsuit," Deverich said. In such a case, the borrower 
might need to file bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Deverich advises homeowners contemplating foreclosure to consult a 
knowledgeable mortgage broker. Still, he says he believes "99.9% of homeowners 
probably wouldn't have to worry" about being sued in connection with a 
foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 "My personal opinion is that banks would probably not do that for your normal 
type of home loan just because there's not enough money at stake. Your normal 
tract house loan is not going to generate enough of a deficiency." 
</P>
<P>
 In calendar terms, you have about six months of breathing room from the day 
you stop paying your mortgage until the day the bank sells your house. 
</P>
<P>
 At First Interstate, Vazquez said there is an average of three months before a 
delinquent loan is referred to the foreclosure department. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there are some other considerations (such as unemployment or illness), we 
work with people," she said. "Sometimes, while waiting for their proposals, we 
will (hold off) for maybe another two or three months." 
</P>
<P>
 After that three-month period, a notice of default -- the first legal action 
-- is recorded and mailed to the homeowner, who then has 90 days to reinstate 
the account or sell the property. If it's still in default, the bank will 
advertise the sale of the property, which happens four weeks after the 90-day 
period ends. So the entire process takes about 120 days. 
</P>
<P>
 But "there are always exceptions to the rules," Vazquez said. "We would rather 
have the property sold through escrow than foreclosure." Again, however, bear 
in mind that the "exceptions" are created by hardship cases. 
</P>
<P>
 What about that rule you always hear -- that you have to wait seven years to 
buy another house after going through a foreclosure? It turns out the waiting 
period, if any, is "strictly up to the lender," according to Pittman. 
</P>
<P>
 But you don't get a free ride. "You won't get the low-cost mortgage," he 
cautioned. "You'll be paying premium rates. You better have a larger down 
payment. And you better not have any other credit problems." 
</P>
<P>
 What about renting? That depends on the landlady or management company. "Some 
areas are begging for anybody who can come up with a half-month's rent," 
Pittman said. "(But) if you want be on top of the knoll looking over the ocean, 
forget it. . . . You have to be realistic." 
</P>
<P>
 If you do opt to rent, try to bank the difference between your old mortgage 
and your current rent, Pittman advised. Then, when you want to get a car loan 
three years from now, you can explain to your banker, "Yes, I walked away from 
my house because it was a losing proposition. But I started saving $500 a month 
and now I'd like to put $15,000 down on that $20,000 car."

HOT PROPERTY: SIMON SELLS TURF ON SURF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright NEIL SIMON, whose new play "London Suite" 
opened in Seattle last week, has sold his Malibu beachfront home of seven years 
for $4.5 million, sources say. The house had been on the market at $4.95 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon, whose play "Laughter on the 23rd Floor" ended its Broadway run in 
August, owns a home in Bel-Air and a penthouse on Park Avenue in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
 He sold his five-bedroom, nearly 5,000-square-foot Malibu home, with 80 feet 
of beach frontage, to Martin and Susan Loughman. Her father is Roy E. Disney, 
Walt Disney's nephew. 
</P>
<P>
 The Loughmans, who were married in 1988, were living in a Denver suburb when 
he was named, two years ago, as president and chief operating officer of 
Shamrock Broadcasting, a unit of Burbank-based Shamrock Holdings, which is 
wholly owned by the Roy E. Disney family. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon, 67, won a Pulitzer prize and a Tony for his 1991 play "Lost in 
Yonkers," which was turned into a film last year. His play "Biloxi Blues" also 
won a Tony. 
</P>
<P>
 A former staff writer on the early television comedy series "Your Show of 
Shows," Simon became one of Broadway's most prolific playwrights, with many of 
his plays -- including "Barefoot in the Park," "The Odd Couple" and "The 
Sunshine Boys" -- turned into films. 
</P>
<P>
 The Malibu house is next door to the lot Simon sold in early September for 
slightly more than $2 million to actor Robert Redford, who has a home on the 
other side of the lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Computer software king PETER NORTON and his wife, EILEEN, have put their 
10-bedroom, Santa Monica home overlooking the Riviera Country Club on the 
market at $8.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In what is believed to be the biggest single-family home sale in the history 
of Santa Monica, they bought the home in 1992 for $8 million, but they have 
expressed some misgivings. 
</P>
<P>
 In a June 12 feature story in The Times, Eileen Norton said, "It's great for 
displaying art, and it sings when there are hundreds of people around. But 
there are only four of us -- two adults and two kids. Who needs all this?" 
</P>
<P>
 She had been an elementary schoolteacher, and he had been a computer 
programmer before he turned a $30,000 investment into a net worth of $200 
million to $400 million by creating Unerase, which allows personal computer 
users to retrieve lost data, and the Norton Utilities program, which is used to 
solve a wide range of PC problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Before they bought the house, they had decided to end what they called their 
"money acquisition phase" to become philanthropists. They held many 
fund-raisers in the house but felt uncomfortable living in such grandeur, 
according to the June article. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're ordinary," he was quoted as saying. "We'd be living in Torrance with 
crabgrass if it weren't for a bit of luck." The Nortons are moving to a smaller 
home near their Santa Monica estate, said listing agent Linda Janger of Pace 
Properties in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nortons' estate includes a 13,000-square-foot main house and a 
2,200-square-foot guest house, all on about 1.5 acres, with a secret garden, 
tree house and tennis court. The gated home also has a two-story library and a 
kitchen with three ovens and two refrigerators. 
</P>
<P>
 PAUL SIMMS, a writer and executive producer of the Emmy-winning "Larry Sanders 
Show," has purchased an award-winning Bel-Air home that was designed by the 
late architect Charles Moore, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore, a Post Modernist guru who died last December, also designed the Sea 
Ranch redwood condos near San Francisco and the Beverly Hills Civic Center with 
its ornate public library. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1979, the home that Simms bought has three bedrooms and a two-story 
guest house. There is an ocean, canyon and city view from almost every room, 
and there are two wildlife pools and an organic orchard on the nearly 
three-acre site, registered as a wildlife preserve. 
</P>
<P>
 The home, once listed at $2.7 million, sold for close to $1.75 million, 
sources say. Steve Mirman of Fred Sands Realtor represented Simms, and Bob 
Hurwitz of Hurwitz & Associates represented the sellers, described as 
financiers based in Northern California.  
</P>
<P>
 The MILBANK MANSION, a Los Angeles city historical monument, has been listed 
at $1.2 million. The 12-bedroom, 11,300-square-foot house, which needs work, 
was built in 1913 for Isaac Milbank, a mill company magnate who subdivided 
Country Club Park, just south of Hancock Park and west of Koreatown. 
</P>
<P>
 The mansion, on 1.5 acres with a tennis court, is co-listed by Patricia Cross 
of RE/MAX, Beverly Hills, and Robert Villanueva of Fred Sands Estates, Santa 
Monica.

RENT WATCH: TENANT MAY NOT CONDUCT BUSINESS OUT OF APARTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PROJECT SENTINEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: For the past few years, I have been working out of my apartment. I 
am a fashion consultant, and in the course of my work fashion models come to 
the apartment for interviews, on average, about one visit per week. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the resident manager started poking around. "Who are those people? 
They dress funny." "They are models," I made the mistake of saying. So this 
week I received a notice that according to the rental agreement, I can't 
conduct business out of my apartment, and I am to cease and desist. What can I 
do? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: Unfortunately, your landlord is correct, and there is very little that 
you can do, except to attempt to renegotiate the terms of your rental 
agreement. You are entitled to have as many friends drop by as you like, but 
business dealings are regulated by the agreement. A rental housing mediation 
program may help you explain to your landlord that your business visitors do 
not generate more traffic than personal guests, and that in this day and age, 
many people work at home. Nonetheless, your landlord can enforce the terms of 
the contract and that means no business, as your rental agreement states. 
</P>
<P>
 An exception to this rule has been made for day-care. A tenant may operate a 
small-home day-care facility in a rental property, and a landlord cannot 
interfere with that right. How to File Discrimination Suit Against Neighbors 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Can I file a housing discrimination complaint against my neighbors? My 
husband and I and our three children rent a three-bedroom condominium in a 
complex that is mostly owner-occupied. The homeowners association has decided 
to fine the owner of our condo because anonymous neighbors have filed several 
unjustified complaints against us. We have heard anti-Chinese remarks from time 
to time, but we were willing to ignore them. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, we are scared. We fear that our landlord, who has been very supportive, 
will find that we are a liability. It would be impossible for us to find 
another three-bedroom unit in our price range and we don't want to pull our 
children out of their school. We don't want to get our nice landlord in 
trouble; it's just the neighbors who cause the problems. What can we do? 
</P>
<P>
 A: You can file a discrimination complaint against your neighbors. The Federal 
Fair Housing Act offers you protection from discrimination in housing due to 
your national origin. The act specifically protects you and your family against 
coercion, intimidation, threats or interference in the enjoyment of your rights 
to fair housing (sec. 818,42 U.S.C. 3617). Because the discriminatory remarks 
by your neighbors and the impending threat to your housing appear to be linked, 
you may want to call the Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity office of the 
Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) (800) 347-3739 or 
California Department of Fair Employment and Housing at (800) 233-3212. What 
You Can Do When Tenants Don't Pay Rent 
</P>
<P>
 Q: When I rented an apartment to new tenants during the last week of the 
month, I collected only one week's rent plus a security deposit equal to one 
month's rent. It's now the 10th of the month and I have not been paid the 
current month's rent. I don't think the new tenants want to pay, nor do they 
seem to want to move. How can I avoid this in the future? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Make sure that your rental agreement clearly states when the rent is due. 
If you wish to allow a grace period, this should also be stated in the rental 
agreement. If your tenants don't pay the rent within the allotted time, you 
should give them a 3-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit. By giving a formal notice, 
you are following good business practices and are reminding your tenants that 
you will enforce the terms of your contract with them. 
</P>
<P>
 One way to avoid this problem is to have your new tenants pay a full month's 
rent before occupying the apartment, regardless of when they move in. If they 
move in on the 15th of the month, they pay to the 15th of the next month, and 
payments are due in the future on that date. If you like to have your rents due 
uniformly on the first, collect a full month's rent on the 15th, and on the 
first of the next month, collect for another 15 days. In the future, all 
payments are due on the first. Does Wood Stove Meet Local Heating Code? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I rent a studio apartment where the only source of heat is a wood-burning 
stove. I wonder if this is legal, and if so, who is responsible for providing 
the wood? 
</P>
<P>
 A: You can check with your local building inspector's office to see if this 
type of heating meets current codes in your area. Under the Uniform Housing 
Code, the heat source must be capable of maintaining a room temperature of 70 
degrees F at a point three feet above the floor in all habitable rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 If your rental agreement does not specify who buys the wood, this is probably 
a negotiable item. There is probably a good argument that whoever is now 
responsible for the other utilities such as electricity and water will also be 
responsible to supply the wood. 
</P>
<P>
 The mounting concern over air pollution may make this academic. It is possible 
that the daily use of wood-burning stoves will be prohibited in the 
not-too-distant future. Landlord Enters Unit Without Giving Notice 
</P>
<P>
 Q: While I was at work, my landlord entered my apartment without giving me 
notice. He installed a hook in the living room ceiling and hung my new Italian 
racing bike from it. When I got home, my bike was lying on the floor, damaged. 
Can my landlord enter my place whenever he wants and without notification? And 
is he responsible for the damage to the bike? 
</P>
<P>
 A: If the damage to your bike was caused by your landlord, he is definitely 
responsible, even if his entry was motivated by good intentions -- such as 
providing you with more floor space or storage. In fact, it is not wise for a 
landlord to handle tenants' personal property. You should speak with your 
landlord and discuss how much reimbursement would be appropriate. You might 
want to show him a couple of bids from bike shops for the repair. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the California Civil Code (sec. 1954) allows a landlord to enter a 
dwelling to make repairs or alterations, it also requires him to give at least 
a 24-hour notice of this intention. The only exception is if there is a real 
emergency, such as burst pipes, a fire and so on. Hanging your bike from the 
ceiling is not an emergency. Inform your landlord that you have a right to 
privacy, and that he should be more considerate of that right in the future. 
Contact your local housing mediation program for assistance if the problem 
continues.

YOUR MORTGAGE; WHAT HIGHER RATES MEAN FOR HOME BUYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIAN HYMER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What are the most important things to consider when shopping for a home loan? 
</P>
<P>
 Last year at this time shopping for financing was relatively easy. Most buyers 
took fixed rate loans, so it was merely a question of finding out who offered 
the best interest rate with the lowest points (loan origination fees). 
</P>
<P>
 Recent interest rate increases have changed the home financing market 
significantly. More and more buyers are opting for adjustable rate mortgages 
(ARMs). Some buyers are looking into hybrid loan products that combine features 
of fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
 To add to the confusion, lenders are competing aggressively for new business. 
Some lenders will pay part of your closing costs. Others charge no points at 
all. Some will pay your mortgage insurance for a period of time. Others will 
overlook blemishes on your credit report. 
</P>
<P>
 On ARMs, lenders are variously offering low start ("teaser") rates, low 
margins (the spread between the index and the consumer's interest rate) and low 
lifetime caps (maximum upper interest rate limit), to stimulate business. 
</P>
<P>
 Your first basic decision is: Do you want a fixed-rate loan or an ARM? If you 
can't qualify at today's fixed rates, this decision could be made for you. If 
you can qualify for a fixed-rate loan, but wonder if an ARM is a better deal, 
consider how long you plan to own the house. If you think you'll move again in 
five or fewer years, you'll probably save money by taking an ARM or a 
"two-step" loan. 
</P>
<P>
 A two-step loan is one that has an initial interest rate that's set for a 
period of time, usually 3, 5, 7 or 10 years. The initial rate is lower than the 
rate you'd pay on a fully amortized 30-year fixed-rate loan. After the initial 
interest rate expires, in 3 to 10 years, the interest rate adjusts to a rate 
that's set for the remaining term of the loan. 
</P>
<P>
 First-Time Tip: Don't let sales come-ons be the deciding factor in selecting a 
home loan. Remember that you have to live with the loan for a period of time. 
So consider the merits of the loan itself, not just the upfront incentive 
that's offered in exchange for your business. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the cost of the loan (interest rate and points), you'll want to 
find out the following information from each lender you talk to: 
</P>
<P>
 What upfront fees are charged? When are these fees paid? Are any fees refunded 
if you're denied a loan? Is private mortgage insurance (insurance to protect 
the lender in case the buyer defaults) required? What will it cost? Is an 
impound account required? How long will loan approval take? Does the loan have 
a prepayment penalty? Is the loan assumable by another qualified buyer? Will 
the lender issue a written commitment when your loan is approved? Will the 
lender require that termite work be completed by closing? 
</P>
<P>
 Find out if the lender will lock-in (guarantee) an interest rate for you, and 
how much this will cost. If you do decide to lock in a rate, try to negotiate a 
"float down," which entitles you to a lower interest rate if rates drop between 
the time you lock-in and closing. Some lenders will give you a rate-lock (a 
guaranteed rate for a period-usually 30 days) even before you've found a house 
to buy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Closing: Make sure to check references before you commit to a specific 
lender or mortgage broker. Good service is is worth a lot. A hungry loan agent 
who makes big promises, but who can't deliver on time, will cause you nothing 
but trouble.

FORECLOSURES RISE 19% STATEWIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The number of real estate foreclosures in California is up by more than 19% in 
the first eight months of 1994 compared to the same period last year, according 
to TRW REDI Property Data. 
</P>
<P>
 In a survey of a selected number of counties in the state, TRW Redi found that 
lenders foreclosed on more than 42,000 residential and commercial properties 
between January and August of this year with a combined mortgage value of $8.6 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the number of distressed property owners is still increasing in many 
parts of the state, the rate of increase has slowed significantly from the 
prior years, TRW REDI reported. Between 1992 and 1993, foreclosures jumped by 
more than 70%. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southland continues to fare worse than the other regions. In the 
five-county Southern California region, the number of repossessed properties 
was up by 21% compared to 6.5% in the San Francisco Bay Area and the Central 
Valley region. 
</P>
<P>
 These most recent figures indicate that so far this year, the Northridge 
earthquake apparently has not had an impact on foreclosure activity in Los 
Angeles County. In the city of Northridge, TRW Redi recorded a total of 432 
foreclosures in the January-August, 1994, period -- a jump of 35% from the same 
period last year but substantially below the 123% increase between 1992 and 
1993. Southland Foreclosures

 Q: I'm so desperate trying to sell my house I'm thinking about seller 
financing. How does that work? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Buyers who don't have 20% to put down on a home often are attracted by 
seller financing.This type of financing involves a second loan from the seller 
to the buyer at terms and an interest rate that both sides agree to.  
</P>
<P>
 These special circumstances must be acceptable to the lender who makes the 
first mortgage on the property. The necessary paperwork is prepared by the 
title or escrow company, according to George Devine, in "For Sale By Owner," 
Second California Edition, Nolo Press, Berkeley, 1993.  
</P>
<P>
 Experts advise sellers to thoroughly evaluate the credit-worthiness of the 
buyer first. Indeed, fear of default makes many sellers reluctant to take back 
a second.

 "You may want to get all your cash out of the house, particularly if you are 
buying another home," Devine writes. "This 'I won't take a second' position can 
change, however, if you find it difficult to sell your house at a decent price 
otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides bringing a better price, seller financing offers these advantages, 
according to William H. Pivar, "Real Estate Investing from A to Z," Probus 
Publishing Co., 1993: -- Taking payments allows the seller to avoid making a 
large outlay for capital gains taxes all at once.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Interest rates on seller carry-back financing are usually significantly 
higher than the owner can get from investing the sales proceeds in a 
certificate of deposit, government bonds or a money market account.

BORERS KILL FRUIT TREE BRANCHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK E. CHRISTENSEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 a peach, a plum and a nectarine (all big and mature) -- were beautiful and 
full of fruit last year, but this year major branches have died back, and the 
bark on the upper surface of these branches is brittle and falling off. There 
is also some jelly-like material oozing out of the bark in spots on live 
branches. What happened, and can I save my trees? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: It sounds like you have a classic case of peach tree borer -- grubs 
that eat away the growing tissues under the bark of stone fruit trees, and, if 
unchecked, soon kill the trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Treatment includes picking away the sloughing bark to find active grubs and 
kill them; summer spraying of the entire tree -- trunk, branches and all -- 
with Sevin (carbaryl) or Malathion three times at three-week intervals starting 
about Mother's Day, and an annual winter application of "dormant spray." 
</P>
<P>
 While it may yet be possible to save your trees, I'm afraid that with the 
demise of some major branches they will probably be misshaped for years to 
come. 
</P>
<P>
 This late in the season you might still find some grubs under the bark, but 
it's useless to spray until the trees lose their leaves. Then saturate them 
completely with dormant spray, and plan on spraying after next Mother's Day. 
</P>
<P>
 For those with healthier stone fruit trees, the recommended winter and spring 
sprays will prevent these nasty and devastating creatures from taking hold. 
Where to Find Pecan Trees in the Southland 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I'm desperate for pecan trees and have looked for them for many years 
without success. Where in Southern California can I go to buy them? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I checked with California's two main suppliers of pecan trees and found a 
few retail nurseries in the Los Angeles and Inland Valley areas (but none in 
Orange County) that handle pecans. The main varieties they carry are 'Western 
Schley' and 'Mohawk,' which are both excellent in this area. You might check 
with one or more of them to see if they still have any in stock or to verify 
that they will have them this winter: 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Area Gardena: Moneta Nursery Newhall: Green Thumb International 
(several other cities, too) Sylmar: Cooper's Hardware Topanga: Sassafras 
Nursery Walnut: Sunshine Growers (several other cities as well) Woodland Hills: 
Boething Treeland 
</P>
<P>
 Inland Valley Area Ontario: Sunshine Growers (several other cities too.) 
Riverside: Cherry Valley Nursery. Upland: Mt Fuji Nursery. Yucaipa: Newell 
Nursery. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps there are others, but these are the ones the suppliers identified for 
me. What's Causing Aloe's Nauseating Odor? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Last fall we moved into a new residence that had a very large Aloe plant in 
the rear yard. We repotted it and now find that it has developed a very 
nauseating odor when cut. No one seems to know what went wrong, or if there's a 
cure. I would greatly appreciate an answer before purchasing a new plant or 
destroying the old one. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Aloes are succulent plants that easily tolerate drought, but they cannot 
endure damp or poorly drained soil. Your plant's symptoms sound like the result 
of root damage due to excessive moisture. Be sure the container has drainage 
holes and that the soil mix is porous. Let the soil dry thoroughly before 
re-watering. Unfortunately, if the newer leaves are showing these symptoms, the 
damage may have gone too far already, and the plant may not recover. If you 
obtain a new one, just remember that Aloes practically thrive on neglect!

CHLORINE CONTRIBUTES TO OZONE DEPLETION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I find it astonishing that you were able to devote so much space to the 
chlorine issue ("No More Green Hair" by Joan Bolton, Sept. 25) without so much 
as a single mention of the most important argument against using chlorine in 
swimming pools and drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
 According to many scientific studies, worldwide chlorine production is the 
single largest contributing factor to the depletion of the ozone layer. Green 
hair and burning eyes are minor issues compared to the ecological disaster that 
chlorine is causing to our planet.

SELLERS CAN'T WARRANT WHAT THEY DON'T KNOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The growth of "as is" sales is the result of two observable truths in the 
1990s Southern California residential real estate arena: 
</P>
<P>
 (1) Most foreclosures are the direct result of buyers walking away from recent 
loans where their property is now worth less than their loan debt. Many of 
those losers that stay and don't walk away from their devalued home, come up 
with another approach.They find fault, create a problem to sue the seller so 
they can both keep the home and get some of the market loss back. 
</P>
<P>
 (2) As a result, "as is" has risen out of the ashes of probate procedures 
(absentee sellers) to become the new protection against often frivolous 
lawsuits from those recent purchasers seeking recovery from their dramatic 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Alerted sellers are now saying in effect, "I will not pay for any repairs or 
alterations after escrow closes. Caveat emptor (Let the buyer beware). You 
cannot charge me after the fact with what I do not know." 
</P>
<P>
 Sellers simply cannot warrant what they have no knowledge of. Therefore, 
sellers want buyers to agree in advance that the product sold is not perfect.

IT'S 'WHATEVER THE MARKET WILL BEAR' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Kenneth R. Harney's Sept. 25 article entitled "Loan Scams Target Homeowners 
With Equity," a mention is made of a certain gentleman who needed $100,000 in 
cash quickly. In other words, time was of the essence.It was mentioned that the 
net fee for this quick cash, which came out of, presumable, a secondary 
mortgage against his home, initially came to $25,000, thus requiring him to 
ultimately pay back a total of $125,000 for the privilege of borrowing $100,000 
in a real big hurry. 
</P>
<P>
 What is inherently wrong with this? Why does this transaction fall under the 
heading of "scam?" 
</P>
<P>
 The fact of the matter is that this gentleman needed that $100,000 in cash 
right then and there. Furthermore, a number of types of transactions are exempt 
from usury laws. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, broker-arranged loans are exempt. In the example cited in the 
article, it appears that that loan was broker-arranged. The standard on exempt 
transactions is "whatever the market will bear." In that case, that market 
dictated the terms of that loan. I see nothing illegal or improper about it, 
based on the facts as presented.

CHILD'S PLAY FOR CHARITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From child's play can come big results. 
</P>
<P>
 Take, for instance, Project Playhouse, an annual charity event where Southland 
home builders create fanciful children's playhouses that are sold at auction to 
help the estimated 12,000 homeless in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 In its two years of existence, Project Playhouse has auctioned off nine 
playhouses to raise $185,000 for HomeAid, the Orange County building industry's 
nonprofit program that builds and renovates shelters for the transitionally 
homeless. Last year's playhouses sold for prices ranging from $2,500 to 
$16,000, raising $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 And this year, nine more architect-designed delights will be sold to the 
highest bidders at auction Saturday, Nov. 12, near the Hard Rock Cafe at the 
Fashion Island shopping center in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Festivities will begin at 5 p.m. with a party at the Hard Rock Cafe. Tickets 
to the event are $15, including dinner. Children 12 and under are free. 
</P>
<P>
 The houses, including Mickey Mouse's Toontown house, a thatched cottage, a 
lighthouse and a fairy-tale castle, are on display now at Fashion Island. One 
of the playhouses will be given away in an opportunity drawing Nov. 12. Tickets 
are $1 and are available at the center. 
</P>
<P>
 The Project Playhouse '94 builders and their creations are Centex Homes 
(English thatched cottage), California Pacific Homes (California bungalow), 
Fieldstone Co. (an Eastern Seaboard-themed cottage), Greystone Homes (Victorian 
house), Presley of Southern California (Mickey Mouse House), TriMark 
Development Co. (Hard Rock Cafe, as a jukebox), Warmington Homes (lighthouse), 
Chicago Title/J.M. Peters (castle) and Telikos Corp. (storybook cottage). 
</P>

HANDYMAN Q&A: WILL LENGTHENING CURING PROCESS ADD STRENGTH TO NEW CONCRETE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By POPULAR MECHANICS, FOR AP SPECIAL FEATURES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: I've been told that new concrete should be kept moist for at least 
three days while curing. I'm wondering just how much stronger can it get, and 
how long should it cure for maximum strength? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: Keeping concrete moist helps the curing process. Concrete hardens as a 
result of a chemical reaction, called hydration, between cement and water, not 
because it dries. The hardening, or curing, continues as long as moisture 
remains in the concrete. If too much water is lost from the concrete through 
evaporation, hydration -- and the hardening process -- slows down or ceases. 
</P>
<P>
 Concrete continues to gain strength after pouring for as long as it retains 
moisture, but the longer it moist-cures, the slower the rate of strength gain. 
Moist-curing concrete for 20 days more than doubles its strength compared with 
four days of moist-curing, which is considered a minimum. Although the greatest 
gain is in the first week or two after pouring, the curing process continues 
for several months. 
</P>
<P>
 Concrete that is not moist-cured at all dries too rapidly, and reaches less 
than half its potential design strength. It will also have a greater number of 
shrinkage cracks. 
</P>
<P>
 The most frequent moist-curing method is to spread moisture-retaining fabric, 
such as burlap, over the concrete after it has hardened enough to prevent 
surface damage. The fabric should be kept thoroughly soaked with a garden hose 
so a film of water remains on the entire surface of the concrete throughout the 
curing period. Checking Water Tank Vents for Obstructions 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I just replaced my gas hot water tank. The tank was not leaking, but I was 
afraid it would leak soon. The instructions for the new hot water tank 
recommend that at least once a year I perform a visual inspection of the 
venting system to look for obstructions, damage and rust. I checked the visible 
portions of the vent, but most of it runs through interior walls. Is there an 
alternate way to check the venting system other than through visual inspection? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The vent system for a water heater should discharge exhaust gas harmlessly 
outside and not "spill" them back into the utility room. In addition to a 
visual inspection, you should check the area by the draft diverter (at the base 
of the vent pipe) for escaping exhaust gas. Put your hand close to the opening 
at the top of the water heater. If exhaust gas spills out of the diverter, you 
will feel hot gases blowing across your hand. This is a condition that must be 
corrected because the gas contains carbon monoxide. This colorless, odorless 
gas is poisonous and can cause asphyxiation. 
</P>
<P>
 Another way to check for faulty venting is to hold a lighted match at the 
draft diverter opening. If the exhaust gases are escaping into the utility 
room, they will blow out the flame. If the vent system is functioning properly, 
the flame will be sucked into the draft diverter hood. 
</P>
<P>
 Checking the integrity of the concealed portions of the water heater flue can 
be done by a heating contractor using a smoke test or a combustible gas 
detector. However, this is generally not necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, as a safety precaution, I recommend that homes with fuel burning 
heating systems or hot water systems be equipped with one or more UL-listed 
carbon monoxide detectors such as the one manufactured by First Alert. These 
are available at home centers and hardware stores and cost from $40 to $60. 
Track Down Sources of Household Drafts 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We are trying to tighten up our home for the winter and are tracking down 
and eliminating sources of drafts. The doors and windows were no problem, but 
we noticed a bad draft coming from our clothes dryer vent. What's the best way 
to handle this situation? 
</P>
<P>
 A: An open dryer vent leading to the outside of the house can be a significant 
source of drafts in winter and windy weather. If yours is an electric dryer, 
check with a heating expert about the possibility of connecting the dryer vent 
to the furnace return duct, thus saving the heat generated by the dryer, which 
is otherwise wasted out the vent. Do not vent the dryer directly into the 
laundry area, as dryer air is damp and you risk an indoor condensation problem. 
Gas dryers should remain vented to the outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 To seal off the dryer vent permanently or for occasional use, merely 
disconnect the flexible dryer exhaust pipe from the wall opening and pack the 
opening with fiberglass insulation. Enclose the insulation in a small muslin 
sack if it is to be removed often. Remove the insulation and reconnect the pipe 
each time you use the dryer.

WHEN YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO SELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Letting the bank foreclose on your house is a drastic, although not invariably 
disastrous, step you can take if you want to get rid of your house and cannot 
afford to sell it. 
</P>
<P>
 But suppose you really want to keep your house and are in a financial bind? 
Ironically, many lenders won't talk to you until you fall behind by three or 
four payments. 
</P>
<P>
 "More lenders are not foreclosing at two, three or four months like the old 
days, but at six, eight and 10 months," said Richard Pittman at Consumer Credit 
Counseling, a nonprofit group approved by HUD for real estate counseling. "Then 
you try to come up with eight payments for a mortgage and it's not practical. 
It's a self-fulfilling prophecy of defeat." 
</P>
<P>
 Pittman advises consumers to come in for free, confidential counseling before 
they start missing mortgage payments. You will be asked to bring documentation 
of your current income and expenses and a list of creditors. The staff will 
develop a budget and debt repayment plan or -- if you haven't enough money 
coming in to pay your debts -- a debt management plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We figure out the problem and the options -- where the client needs to go 
next," Pittman said. "Is this a situation that will pass? Can a payment plan be 
offered? 
</P>
<P>
 "When a client is in default, we sit down with them and find out: How much 
(money) is available, based on income? How much are they willing to cut of 
their daily spending to give the house the priority it deserves -- which is No. 
1? 
</P>
<P>
 "If they're short with all their other obligations, there's nothing to offer 
the lender. Then the lender will see this is going down into foreclosure." 
</P>
<P>
 When you call your lender, Pittman advised, "Go through the ranks. Don't try 
to jump. (A senior vice president will say), 'Why should I talk to you if you 
haven't given the collection staff a crack?' 
</P>
<P>
 "Most important: Make sure it's all in writing. Whatever your proposal is, 
make sure you can document it to a T. (For example, 'Here is what my income is, 
not only now but at the time of default.') . . . A lender may ask for two years 
of 1040s. If you were laid off, they (will ask) what happened to your two-month 
reserve. If you were out on disability, you need a statement from your doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is where the motivation of the client comes out so clearly. Suppose he 
asks if the interest rate could be reduced. Then (the lender) pulls the credit 
bureau (information) and find out he just bought a new car. They're not going 
to give the client the time of day. 
</P>
<P>
 "We peel back layers of problems to find out about more problems," Pittman 
said. "The average client we counsel owes $12,000 just on credit cards, without 
(taking into account) car payments, student loans, a mortgage. (The problem) 
does not begin when loan goes into default. . . . Extended families may be part 
of problem -- (money goes to ) help parents and grandparents." 
</P>
<P>
 Pittman impresses on clients the importance of maintaining a businesslike 
relationship with the lender: keeping good records and not flying off the 
handle on the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also important that you understand whether the lender has sold the 
mortgage, Pittman said, and to what sort of institution. Has it been sold to 
another bank? A holding company like the Federal National Mortgage Corp.? A 
finance company? 
</P>
<P>
 "If they've sold it to a finance company, the level of cooperation (you can 
expect) is almost nil," Pittman said. "Their game is pure numbers." 
</P>
<P>
 How do you find out whether your lender is servicing your loan? Ask. ("Are you 
an in-house servicer or an outside servicer?" Or: "What constraints keep you 
from considering my repayment proposal?") 
</P>
<P>
 If there's an investor, you can ask for their name and phone number. The loan 
servicer is not obligated to give you this information, but even noncooperation 
can be leverage if you keep good notes. If you have an FHA or VA loan and you 
can show that it is being improperly serviced, Pittman said, they will stop 
foreclosure proceedings until your file is reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd much rather go down kicking and fighting than lose everything," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The ideal client tells the lender, "Here's my documentation. Here's my budget. 
I've cut every possible corner and come up with a plan of action -- steps I've 
taken, steps I'm contemplating, a list of times I've contacted you, letters 
I've sent you, actions I'm following up on. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that I've showed you everything I have done to keep my house, what have 
you done for me and what will you do in the future?"

<P>
 Of course you want to take a vacation here. But where to stay? 
</P>
<P>
 There are 176 hotels in the naked city (so says the convention and visitors 
bureau, anyway), and in the last two months I've seen 58 of them. I've also 
heard a few things, the way a nosy lodger does. 
</P>
<P>
 The hottest property with the rich, famous and discrete? The Sherman House, 
say several cabbies and others. The Sherman, an immaculate old mansion on Green 
Street, was converted into a luxury lodging 10 years ago, and the cheapest of 
its 14 rooms fetches $190 a night. 
</P>
<P>
 The best new hotel? Given the shortage of openings in these recent 
recessionary years, the answer is easy: the modern but understated Hotel 
Milano, which opened May 8 on Fifth Street near Market.

 What does a typical visitor pay for lodging in the city? $103.17 nightly, says 
PKF Consulting, a hotel market research firm that calculated an average after 
surveying actual rates paid (not the higher "rack rates" that are often 
published) at four dozen "representative" properties over the first half of 
this year.  
</P>
<P>
 I came up here in August and September to gather and measure nuggets like 
this, in an utterly subjective sort of way. Having come to know several hotels 
in San Francisco over the last few years, I slept in half a dozen that were new 
to me, and took careful looks at public and private rooms in more than 50 
others. I now have shampoo and matchbooks to last me years, and some good news: 
San Francisco, long celebrated for the volume, charm and variety of its hotels, 
is still well worth celebrating -- plenty of high style and good value, but 
also their opposites, and more than a few mysterious quirks. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorting through all this, a guest forms more than a few opinions. (For my 
top-10 lists, read on.) 
</P>
<P>
 The single most handsome room, public or private, in any San Francisco hotel? 
I'd say the Garden Court off the lobby of the Sheraton Palace, where an 
iron-and-stained-glass skylight ceiling constructed in 1875 arches over a 
dining area half the size of a football field. Crystal chandeliers dangle. 
Potted palms throw frond shadows on floral carpet. And last month, each table 
wore a purple exclamation point -- an iris in a vase. (Sunday brunch there is 
$39 a head; go instead for afternoon tea: $15.95 for tea, sandwiches, pastries 
and scones.) 
</P>
<P>
 The most disarming elevator notice: the brass plaque in the tiny lift of the 
budget New Abigail on McAllister Street. Though the property was renovated four 
years ago, the elevator dates to 1925, an old-fashioned metal cage with 
accordion doors, and the plaque reads this way: "Hi, I'm Elliott the elevator. 
I'm one of the Abigail's most unusual antiques, but I'm quite sensitive. So, if 
you have something bad to say about me, wait 'til you've exited me. Enjoy your 
stay!" 
</P>
<P>
 Other subjects are thornier. Why, for instance, are L.A. music industry types 
so smitten with the 5-year-old Phoenix Hotel on Eddy Street? Yes, the design is 
tropically funky and shrewdly promoted (by its owner Joie de Vivre hotels, the 
same company that runs the New Abigail, as it happens), and it houses a tasty, 
colorful Caribbean restaurant, Miss Pearl's Jam House. Yes, rock stars stay 
here (rack rate: $89 a night). But it remains an only semi-rehabilitated grungy 
old motel in the crime-ridden Tenderloin area, with outdoor hallways, minimal 
privacy and 44 rooms of ticky-tacky furniture lined up around a pool and 
courtyard. On many nights, I suspect, the Phoenix's guests are the only people 
in that neighborhood as the result of choice and not unfortunate circumstances. 
I say it's The Emperor's New Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 And, while I'm complaining, what sort of hotel would welcome a new guest by 
leaving (deliberately or inadvertently) a list of "Acne Do's and Don'ts" in his 
bathroom? Answer: The Hotel Diva on Geary Street, an 
old-building-gone-modernist near Union Square. The room was 210, the guest was 
me on Sept. 20, and tip No. 1 was "Don't squeeze . . . " Call me crazy, but I'd 
prefer they just left the chocolates on the pillow and let me worry about the 
consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 For most visitors to the city, the first stop is Union Square, where the I. 
Magnin, Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue, Bullock & Jones, and Polo Ralph 
Lauren shops are, where the cable cars begin their round-trip route to 
Fisherman's Wharf, and where the city's greatest concentration of hotels is 
found. Traffic on the streets and sidewalks is heavy, noise at night can be an 
issue, and the numbers of homeless grow greater as you draw closer to Market 
Street, but there's no more all-around convenient location. Average nightly 
rates, the analysts at PKF say, hover around $105. 
</P>
<P>
 That's cheaper than the Financial District, where weekday business travelers 
push average rates to about $150, and a bit more costly than the Fisherman's 
Wharf area, where T-shirt shops are threatening to overwhelm the maritime 
atmosphere and seafood restaurants, and room rates run around $87. In the Civic 
Center area, convenient to the Opera House and Symphony Hall but marred by 
crime and grime, average rates are down around $73. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking out hotels with distinctive style, I paid most attention to amenities, 
design and service, but kept the size of the tariff in the back of my head. In 
searching for value, I paid more attention to price than to the packaging of 
the soap in the shower. (Some distinctively designed mid-range properties, most 
obviously the Hotel Triton and the Milano, could have fit onto either list.) On 
both lists, the order of hotels is alphabetical, not preferential. 
</P>
<P>
 Exclusion from these lists is not a condemnation. On Nob Hill, for instance, 
the venerated Huntington, the Stouffer Stanford Court and the Mark Hopkins 
Intercontinental hotels looked grand as ever (the Fairmont remains in demand, 
as well, though its borderline-garish lobby made me think of an aged performer 
trying to look young by using more makeup), but the newer Ritz-Carlton outshone 
them for me. (It did the same for readers of Conde Nast Traveler magazine, who 
last year ranked the Ritz-Carlton fourth-best hotel in the United States. The 
other San Francisco property in its top-10 was Campton Place on Stockton 
Street, ninth.) 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, though the Sherman House and the Majestic are the only low-profile, 
smallish historic properties listed among the most stylish hotels, travelers 
can find similarly intimate historic lodgings at the Archbishop's Mansion (15 
rooms near Alamo Square Park) and the Queen Anne (49 rooms near Japantown). 
Other caveats: These lists omit properties with fewer than 14 rooms, and 
generally lean toward one-of-a-kind hotels and away from familiar chains such 
as Hilton, Holiday Inn and Hyatt. 
</P>
<P>
 Readers should also keep in mind that, notwithstanding the shortage of new 
properties, the city's hotel landscape is constantly changing. In November, the 
beloved but much-trampled Westin St. Francis near Union Square begins a 
yearlong, $50-million renovation of its rooms. In January, the Four Seasons 
Clift, one of my favorites, is expected to lose the "Four Seasons" in its name 
as part of a change in ownership and management. (The new management will be 
Grand Heritage Hotels, which also operates the Georgian in Santa Monica and the 
U.S. Grant in San Diego among its 13 U.S. properties.) 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby on Powell Street, meanwhile, the bedraggled 417-room Sir Francis Drake 
has been bought by the Kimpton Group, operator of 12 justly celebrated, and 
much smaller, San Francisco "boutique" properties. (The Drake reopened in April 
after renovation. Unfortunately, the fresh paint, new fabric and even new 
furnishings in the Drake's rooms seem like Band-Aids on a property tired to the 
bone, and hotel officials are asking off-putting rates of $140 nightly and up.  
</P>
<P>
 That's more than Kimpton asks at most of its other, more inviting properties, 
such as the Juliana and Vintage Court on Bush Street, and the Villa Florence on 
Powell. Maybe the Drake will brighten when the property's still-closed 
restaurant and rooftop nightclub re-open -- but hotel officials can't say 
exactly when that will be.) TOP 10 FOR STYLE * Campton Place. For those who 
want luxury but don't need a sprawling, glimmering lobby in the St. 
Francis/Fairmont tradition. Intimate, hushed atmosphere, lots of marble, beige 
and brown (new carpeting and linens arrived this past summer), 117 rooms and a 
well-regarded restaurant. Convenient to, but not besieged by, Union Square and 
its crowds. Created from two old hotels in 1983, and until this year managed by 
the Kempinski chain. Now independently managed. Rack rates: $195-$330. 
Weekends: $195-$270. 340 Stockton St.; telephone (800) 426-3135 or (415) 
781-5555. 
</P>
<P>
 * Four Seasons Clift Hotel. Two blocks from Union Square in the heart of the 
theater district. Old-world formal setting and service. The lobby may seem an 
uneasy truce among mirrors, flowers and wood paneling, but it leads to the Art 
Deco splendor in the Redwood Room bar and the chandeliers and traditional 
flourishes of the French Room restaurant (jacket required). Five stars (Mobil) 
and five diamonds (AAA). Hotel dates to 1915. 329 rooms. Rack rates: $225-$370. 
Weekends: $195-$265. 495 Geary St.; tel. (800) 332-3442 or (415) 775-4700. * 
The Inn at the Opera. Located to suit music and dance lovers (opera, symphony 
and ballet venues neighbor the building), and obviously designed and operated 
with them in mind. Impeccable furnishings and dim, dramatic lighting, 
especially in the hotel's downstairs Act IV restaurant. A grown-up place. 48 
rooms. Rack rates: $125-$170, $110-$165 on weekdays. 333 Fulton; tel. (800) 
423-9610 (from California) or (415) 863-8400. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Inn at Union Square. Not much space, but miles of style. 30 rooms on six 
floors. The tiny lobby, wedged between storefronts, is decorated with trompe 
l'oeil bookshelves. All else is upstairs (each floor has its own 
sitting/breakfast room and fireplace). Georgian furniture. Rack rates: 
$120-$180. 440 Post St.; tel. (800) 288-4346 or (415) 397-3510. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Majestic. Built in 1902 as a hotel and full of elegant old furnishings, 
including a mounted butterfly collection under glass in the Cafe Majestic bar. 
(Cafe Majestic serves dinner and is open to the public.) 57 rooms, 30 with 
fireplaces. Many of those rooms have four-poster beds and claw-footed tubs, 
too. Only drawback for most travelers is location -- relatively far from all 
the usual tourist destinations. But for others, that's a plus. Rack rates: 
$125-$160. 1500 Sutter St.; tel. (800) 869-8966 or (415) 441-1100. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mandarin Oriental. In the Financial District, a promising but 
often-overlooked possibility for upscale-but-not-filthy-rich leisure weekend 
travelers. The 7-year-old hotel (lone U.S. property of the widely admired, Hong 
Kong-based Mandarin Oriental hotel group) occupies the ground floor and the 
38th through 48th floors of the First Interstate Center skyscraper. Thus, its 
158 rooms, decorated in canary yellow, have spectacular views of the bay and 
skyline, including the city's signature TransAmerica building a few blocks 
away. California Street cable car line runs within half a block. The Silks 
offers East-West cuisine downstairs. Rack rates: $260-$395. Weekend rates: 
$149-$299. 222 Samsone St.; tel. (800) 622-0404 or (415) 885-0999.  
</P>
<P>
 * Hotel Milano. Opened in May. Stands next to the Nordstrom-anchored San 
Francisco Shopping Centre, a few blocks from both the Yerba Buena Arts Center 
(new home of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art) and Union Square. 
Contemporary Italian design, so calm and stark (unlike the similarly priced and 
sized Triton) that it feels vaguely Japanese. (The Nintendo game tucked away in 
every room could also be a factor.) 108 rooms. The restaurant, Bistro M, which 
opened in August to admiring notices, is run by erstwhile Angeleno chef Michel 
Richard. Rack rates: $120-$160. 55 Fifth St.; tel. (800) 398-7555 or (415) 
543-8555. 
</P>
<P>
 * Petite Auberge and the White Swan Inn. They're unusually close siblings, so 
I'm counting them as one. Petite Auberge is the French country twin; the White 
Swan Inn, two doors down the street (a locksmith shop separates them), is its 
English counterpart. Both have 26 rooms and are run by Four Sisters Inns, which 
has three other "romantic country inn" properties around the state. This 
location is unbeatable, above Union Square and below Nob Hill. Cozy fireplaces, 
unexpectedly spacious breakfast and sitting areas; 18 of Petite Auberge's rooms 
include fireplaces, and sitting room decor includes stuffed animals. White Swan 
has a library and a fireplace in every room. White Swan Inn (rack rates of 
$145-$250), 845 Bush St.; tel. (800) 999-9570 or (415) 775-1755. Petite Auberge 
(rates of $110-$220), 863 Bush St.; tel. (800) 365-3004 or (415) 928-6000. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Ritz-Carlton. Nob Hill. The old headquarters of the Metropolitan Life 
Insurance company, built in 1909, took on its new life as a 336-room luxury 
hotel in April, 1991. Antique furnishings, subdued lighting, big sprays of 
flowers. Well-regarded Dining Room and Terrace restaurants and high standards 
for service. It lacks the broad city views that many of its Nob Hill neighbor 
hotels offer, but youth and vigor compensate. Dominated on weekdays by high-end 
business folk. Indoor pool. Rack rates: $240-$425. Weekends: $200-$345. 600 
Stockton; tel. (800) 241-3333 or (415) 296-7465. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Sherman House. Built in 1876 for an arts patron named Leander Sherman, 
this French-Italianate mansion (written up in Architectural Digest soon after 
its 1985 opening) and its carriage house now house six one-bedroom suites and 
eight guest rooms, all but one with fireplaces. Antique furnishings, brocaded 
fabrics. The location is isolated in a high-toned residential street, so expect 
to drive, use cabs or walk a great deal . White exterior and a snazzy 
checkerboard floor in a well-regarded nine-table restaurant that is generally 
open to guests only. Member of the exclusive Relais & Chateaux luxury hotel 
organization. 14 rooms. Rack rates: $190-$375 for rooms, $575-$825 for suites. 
2160 Green St.; tel. (800) 424-5777 or (415) 563-3600. 
</P>
<P>
 Honorable mention: Between Union Square and the theater district, adjoining 
the much-admired Postrio restaurant, stands the sophisticated, comfortable 
Prescott Hotel (166 rooms at 544 Post St.; tel. 800-283-7322 or 415-563-0303), 
asking rack rates of $165-$195 and offering a "Winterfest" discount at $125. If 
you're intent on staying in the touristy Fisherman's Wharf area, but you want a 
distinguished hotel there is the Tuscan Inn (221 rooms at 425 N. Point St.; 
tel. 800-648-4626 or 415-561-1100) with the very good Cafe Pescatore 
downstairs, rack rates of $138-$178, and a "Hot Toddi" seasonal special rate, 
Nov. 1-March 31, of $105 nightly. TOP 10 FOR VALUE * Andrews Hotel. If ever you 
wondered where the smallest bathrooms in San Francisco hoteldom are, this could 
be your answer. But they're clean, and the small rooms to which they're 
attached are adeptly put-together. The hotel, 15 years old in its current 
incarnation, is well located two blocks west of Union Square. 48 rooms on six 
floors. Fino bar and restaurant downstairs. Rack rates: $82-$106. Seasonal 
discount Nov. 15-Jan. 8: $79-$106. 624 Post St.; tel. (800) 223-0888 or (415) 
563-6877. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hotel Bedford. Built in 1929 and renovated top-to-bottom (that's 17 stories) 
last year, the Bedford is sensibly furnished and run by amiable staff. 144 
rooms. Rack rates: $109-$119, but special rates of $89 can be had when demand 
is low. 761 Post St.; tel. (800) 227-5642 or (415) 673-6040. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Carlton Hotel. One of the Kimpton 13 -- which is to say, it's clean and 
displays a little style and European sensibility, despite its low price. 
Convenient to Union Square. 158 rooms. The Oak Room Grill serves breakfast and 
dinner. Rack rates: $114. "Winterfest" discount rates Nov. 5-April 30: $59. 
1075 Sutter St.; tel. (800) 227-4496 or (415) 673-0242. * Chancellor Hotel. 
Near Union Square on the Powell Street cable car route. 140 rooms. Behind a 
modest public face, brass fittings, dark wood wainscoting and other nice 
touches (renovated earlier this year). Chancellor Cafe serves three meals 
daily. Rack rates: $114. Winter special, Nov. 15-April 30: $89. 433 Powell St.; 
tel. (800) 428-4748 or (415) 362-2004. * The Fitzgerald and the Hotel Sheehan. 
(Close siblings under the same ownership.) A hotel site since the 1920s and 
idle for several years, the Fitzgerald opened in August, 1993. It's got no 
pretentions ("The People's Court" was on the breakfast room TV when I looked 
in), but is clean and convenient to Union Square. Pub on premises, and access 
to the nearby Hotel Sheehan's indoor pool. 47 rooms. The Fitzgerald (rack 
rates: $69-$109) is at 620 Post St.; tel. (800) 334-6835 or (415) 775-8100. The 
Hotel Sheehan, two blocks from Union Square, has 71 simple, tidy rooms, 10 of 
which have shared toilets. Formerly a YWCA (which explains the indoor swimming 
pool), the hotel was redone and re-opened six years ago. Rack rates: $85-$99; 
"economy" rooms with shared baths, $50-$60. 620 Sutter St.; tel. (800) 848-1529 
or (415) 775-6500. 
</P>
<P>
 * Golden Gate Hotel. Simple, but cozy, and very well located just above the 
bustle of Union Square, with a cable car line running less than a block away. 
23 rooms, 14 of which have private baths. 1913 building, handsome wicker 
furniture. Helpful staff. Rack rates: $89; with shared bath, $59. 775 Bush St.; 
tel. (800) 835-1118 or (415) 392-3702. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Hostel at Union Square. The bottom end. Certainly not for everyone but 
eminently affordable -- and convenient to Union Square. Opened in 1992 and 
managed by Hostelling International. About 225 beds in about 70 rooms. Young, 
backpack-wielding clientele. Alertly managed. Typically two to six people per 
room. Larger rooms (about one-third of total) have private toilets. Guests, an 
estimated 80% of whom are from outside the United States, stay up to 14 nights. 
Any age over 18 accepted (children with guardians OK). Rates: $18 per person, 
$15 for dues-paying members of Hostelling International. Reservations accepted. 
312 Mason St.; tel. (415) 788-5604.(The other hostel in town, which I didn't 
get to, is Fort Mason International Hostel, Building 240, Fort Mason; tel. 
415-771-7277,which offers 155 beds in 21 rooms, charges $14 per person and 
accepts reservations.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Hotel Nikko. Good value, if you can get the $119-a-night rate. A 7-year-old 
great white slab of a building. Lots of white marble, many international 
businessfolk, indoor sky-lit pool. 522 rooms. Japanese restaurant Benkay 
upstairs, California-flavored Cafe 222 downstairs. Rack rates: $215-$275. 
Holiday package available Nov. 13-Dec. 30: $119 (rate also often available 
October. 222 Mason St.; tel. (800) 645-5687or (415) 394-1111. 
</P>
<P>
 * San Remo Hotel. A 1906 Italianate Victorian hotel. I was skeptical, largely 
because 61 of the 62 rooms share bathrooms (also, the handsome tin-ceilinged 
restaurant space downstairs is idle and up for sale), but the atmosphere is 
tidy and endearing (stained-glass skylights, redwood wainscoting, narrow 
hallways), and if you're willing to sacrifice the privacy, you gain a little 
charm and save. Interesting neighborhood, too: at foot of Russian Hill, near 
North Beach and not far from Fisherman's Wharf. Rack rates: $55-$65. (The room 
with private bath goes for $85 and books far in advance.) 2237 Mason St.; tel. 
(800) 352-7366or (415) 776-8688. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hotel Triton. Could just as easily be listed among the most stylish -- but 
the prices are too good. Wiggly chairs, polychromatic walls, black pillows with 
purple buttons, a meeting room labeled "Creative Zone" and a young, energetic 
clientele. Opened in 1991 to a swell of publicity, and on Sept. 14 grabbed a 
bit more by unveiling a Jerry Garcia suite, featuring designs by the lead 
guitarist of the Grateful Dead. Adjoined by the inviting Cafe de la Presse 
newsstand-cafe, with gate to Chinatown across the street. 140 rooms. Rack 
rates: $119-$169. Seasonal "Winterfest" special Nov. 5-March 31: $89-$149. 342 
Grant Ave.; tel. (800) 433-6611or (415) 394-0500. 
</P>
<P>
 Honorable mention: The Marina Inn (40 rooms at 3110 Octavia St. in the Marina 
District, tel. 800-274-1420 or 415-928-1000) is plain but affordable at 
$65-$85. Same goes for the Millefiori Inn in North Beach (16 rooms at 444 
Columbus; tel. 415-433-9111) at $85, though a room renovation and modest rate 
increase are scheduled at Millefiori in the next month. The Stanyan Park Hotel 
(36 rooms at 750 Stanyan St.; tel. 415-751-1000) in Haight-Ashbury is a safe, 
reasonable choice (though service is uneven) in a popular but crime-troubled 
neighborhood; rack rates of $78-$96. Back in the Union Square neighborhood, the 
Spartan but up-to-date Hotel David (56 rooms at 480 Geary St.; tel. 
800-524-1888or 415-771-1600) offers free parking, free full breakfast at 
David's (the city's most famous Jewish deli) and asks $99-$109. San Francisco

 Los Angeles, Calif. 90053 A Few Words About Room Rates 
</P>
<P>
 The prices quoted here, unless otherwise noted, are "off-the-rack" rates -- 
the amount hotels extract from unquestioning travelers who don't know any 
better -- for a room for two people. Travelers can almost always pay less by 
following one or more of the following strategies: 
</P>
<P>
 Reserve through a wise travel agent. Book through a discount reservation 
service such as San Francisco Reservations (telephone 800-677-1550) or Discount 
Hotel Rates (tel. 800-576-0003), both of which routinely shave 20% off "rack" 
rates. Use a 50%-off nationwide hotel discount coupon book such as those sold 
by Encore (tel. 800-638-0930; $49 a year) or Entertainment Publications (tel. 
800-285-5525; $27.95 a year). Ask about corporate rates, package offers, 
weekend, weekday or seasonal specials. (Business-oriented hotels in the 
Financial District are especially likely to have attractive weekend discounts. 
And the Kimpton chain is offering "Winterfest" rates from November to March or 
April, depending on the property, with discounts of $30-$81 off "rack" rates.) 
</P>
<P>
 Travelers should remember that hotels typically offer weekend discounts and 
other special rates only "subject to availability" -- thus, the best prices are 
unavailable on nights of highest demand -- and that rates are in near-constant 
fluctuation. All the numbers in this survey have been checked and 
double-checked, but some may already have become outdated. 
</P>
<P>
 Travelers should always confirm rates themselves before making a reservation. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the hotels below offer complimentary continental breakfast, which can 
vary from a Styrofoam cup of coffee and stale roll to stylish china and fresh 
bakery creations with fruit. Unless noted otherwise, all rooms have private 
toilets. In dense, damp and windy San Francisco, swimming pools are a rarity; 
don't expect one unless it's specifically mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
 Two more monetary notes: San Francisco's room tax of 12% is not included in 
any of the numbers quoted here. And if you drive in the city, you will face 
daily parking charges of roughly $12-$24 (the more expensive the hotel's room 
rates, the more it's likely to charge you for parking). Many hotels drop the 
parking charges as part of their package offers.

 Now that I no longer live in Northern California, I seem to be sending an 
inordinate number of friends off to San Francisco for a few days. I enjoy 
pulling out a map of the city and marking it up with all my old haunts -- 
coffeehouses, bookstores, eccentric shops, flea markets, farmers markets, 
picnic spots, long walks. Then comes the pleasurable business of deciding where 
to send them to eat. I can easily get carried away. If they've got three 
nights, I've got 10 restaurants. (Well, it is hard to get into some of them on 
short notice.) I do, however, custom-tailor the list to budget, personality and 
circumstance. And this fall, due to a rash of recent restaurant openings, I've 
added a few new names. 
</P>
<P>
 Still at the head of the class is Chez Panisse -- upstairs or down. (If you 
don't reserve well ahead for Jean-Pierre Moulles extraordinary cooking in the 
more formal downstairs restaurant, you will definitely be eating in the 
upstairs cafe.) But not everybody is ambitious enough to make the trek across 
the bay to Berkeley, even though by L.A. standards this commute is a piece of 
cake. 
</P>
<P>
 When I mull over the restaurants in San Francisco I love, though, it turns out 
most of them are French. French restaurants have been a presence since the 
city's early years. These days, it's not the formal French cooking of Masa's or 
Fleur de Lys that intrigues me, but the earthier bistros and cafes. The fact 
that I don't have a single Italian restaurant on my list says a great deal 
about the difference between San Francisco and Los Angeles. (If I weren't 
restricting this list to San Francisco, Oliveto in Oakland, where former Chez 
Panisse chef Paul Bertolli is now cooking Tuscan country fare, would be 
enthusiastically included.) Or maybe it's that in Los Angeles I miss a certain 
kind of sensual French cooking. And when I do make a brief foray back to San 
Francisco, these are a few of the places I look forward to visiting. 
</P>
<P>
 * Zuni Cafe. After Chez Panisse, I think first of 15-year-old Zuni Cafe on 
Market Street. Everyone I've ever sent to this eccentric, beloved place has 
fallen in love with Zuni's mix of old and new San Francisco (society meets 
artsy South-of-Market) and earthy French-Mediterranean cooking. The kitchen is 
ruled by Judy Rodgers, whose fate was decided when she spent a year as a high 
school exchange student living with the family of the late three-star chef Jean 
Troisgros in Burgundy.  
</P>
<P>
 Here, there is a required menu: First, a glass of Veuve Clicquot brut and an 
iced platter of raw shellfish from the little stand perched on the sidewalk 
outside, just like in Paris. Oysters, clams and periwinkles are served with 
crusty sourdough loaves from Acme (the Bay Area equivalent of La Brea Bakery). 
Then you have to have the house-cured anchovies with slivers of celery and 
Parmesan, a comforting bowl of porridge-like polenta with a dollop of 
mascarpone , feathery light ricotta and spinach gnocchi, perhaps some kind of 
fish braised in the wood-burning brick oven. But always, always the 
crisp-skinned roast chicken for two with a Tuscan bread salad doused with 
Champagne vinaigrette. Travelers take note: Zuni is open virtually all day -- 
even for lunch on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 * Restaurant LuLu and LuLu Bis. Restaurant LuLu, in the burgeoning 
South-of-Market area not far from the new Yerba Buena Gardens Center for the 
Arts, has been a runaway hit since the day it opened nearly two years ago. 
Inspired by Zuni, LuLu is a much bigger place, one notch down in price, with a 
wood-burning pizza oven and wood-fired rotisserie as focal points. Chef/owner 
Reed Hearon, who worked with Mark Miller at the Coyote Cafe in Santa Fe, turns 
out rustic family-style dishes from the French and Italian Riviera. 
</P>
<P>
 I've had some very appealing dishes here, mostly first courses like the plump, 
juicy iron skillet-roasted mussels, fried artichokes with Parmesan, wood 
oven-roasted Portobello mushroom with fresh corn-studded polenta. Zero in on 
the grilled spot prawns with romesco sauce too. Side dishes such as olive oil 
mashed potatoes and Romano beans with lemon and olive oil are good, but I 
haven't been all that impressed with the main courses. The very rotisserie 
items that look so enticing -- the squab wrapped in pancetta and served with 
brilliant green fava beans and crinkly morel mushrooms, the rosemary chicken or 
the pork loin with fennel, garlic and olive oil -- just don't have that much 
flavor. For dessert, there's sometimes a refreshing trompe l'oeil wedge of 
melon ice. 
</P>
<P>
 LuLu is actually two restaurants (three, if you count the adjoining cafe where 
you can get breakfast, take-out items, antipasti and a quick dinner). Next door 
is the much smaller LuLu Bis, where Hearon offers a three- or four-course prix 
fixe meal with several choices at $21 or $27. You eat family style at long 
communal tables, much the way you did at San Francisco's traditional Basque 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fringale. Slang for "the urge to eat," Fringale (pronounced frin-GAL) is a 
highly appropriate name for this companionable South-of-Market bistro. It is a 
tiny slip of a place, always crowded, very French, with a terrific 
price-quality ratio and utterly delicious French bistro food. It is also 
tremendously popular, so it's difficult to get a table on short notice. (You 
can, however, eat at the bar.) 
</P>
<P>
 The chef is Gerald Hirigoyen from Biarritz, France; the waiters are French, a 
little brusque, but very authentic, non? The smart little wine list has some 
gems like Fonsalette, the Cotes du Rhone from Chateau Rayas. Start with a 
classic frisee salad with warm bacon dressing or the immensely satisfying 
platter of duck confit, smoked duck breast and a slab of unctuous pink foie 
gras . Next comes a heap of fragrant steamed mussels garnished with fried 
garlic and parsley, a truly wonderful confit of duck leg almost hidden beneath 
a hillock of tiny French lentils or slow-braised veal short ribs, tender and 
gelatinous, with thick strips of parsnip. I dream about Hirigoyen's marinated 
roast rack of lamb; it's that flavorful. Don't forget a side of green beans or 
comforting gratin of potatoes and cream. And for dessert: almondy ga teau 
basque and a divine cherry clafoutis . 
</P>
<P>
 * Bizou. A few doors down from Fringale is a moderately priced corner bistro 
with the affectionate word "Bizou" (little kiss), spelled out in tall 
old-fashioned French block letters. A profusion of sweet-smelling herbs and 
lavenders spill from the window boxes. Inside, the high-ceiling space has been 
painted a glorious shade of goldenrod. A small bar, a couple of old paintings, 
a vase of lilies set high on a shelf, faux bamboo chairs with irises stenciled 
onto the wooden seats complete the endearing picture of a modest bistro in some 
far-flung corner of Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 Chef/owner Loretta Keller's heartfelt cooking evokes the tastes and smells of 
Provence. 
</P>
<P>
 Her wonderful little salads and first courses interest me more than the main 
courses. I'm certainly not going to pass up the dreamy house-cured salt cod 
layered with potatoes and onions and cream or the plate of violet 
Provencal-style octopus and the pasta called orzo scented with winter savory 
for mere grilled duck breast or tuna. One night the small, appealing menu 
included warm fava bean and artichoke salad strewn with nasturtium petals and 
shaved pecorino, a velvety terrine of rabbit and duck livers and a soup of 
pureed grilled vegetables loaded with what looked like baby clams, but were 
actually . . . cockles! And I do love the beef cheek "Sainte-Menehoulde" (yes, 
indeed), marinated in red wine, braised slowly and then finished off with a 
crisp coating of mustard and bread crumbs -- perfect with a Gigondas or 
Chateauneuf-du-Pape rouge. Follow it with summer bread pudding stained blood 
red with berries -- not really French, but then Keller is refreshingly 
undogmatic. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bistro M. Ebullient entrepreneur/author/chef Michel Richard, who jets around 
the country opening offshoots of his celebrated Los Angeles restaurant Citrus, 
has moved in on San Francisco. This summer he opened his latest place, Bistro 
M, in the stylish new Hotel Milano next door to Nordstrom downtown. It's a long 
skinny space with a striking painted mural overhead running the entire length 
of the restaurant. The operative word here is bistro; don't expect a menu as 
ambitious as his L.A. restaurant Citrus. While at this point it doesn't seem 
the food will set the town on fire, Richard and chef Anthony Pels are doing 
some very nice things. I could happily lunch on the "charcuterie tower," three 
tiers of salami, ruddy prosciutto and country-style duck pate served with 
rough-textured, crusty bread. The two are to be commended for offering a real 
cheese course, your choice of four or six cheeses, including a good Roquefort 
and tete de moins , a hard cheese served in ruffled shavings. The bistro's menu 
is strong on straightforward French comfort food such as a lovely platter of 
steamed vegetables with a little crock of aioli or boudin parmentier: crumbled 
homemade blood sausage topped with buttery potato puree. At lunch, Bistro M 
offers a three-course menu for just $15 (green salad, duck confit, mirabelle 
plums with vanilla-bean ice cream, par example). Desserts from this master 
patissier are worth every calorie. 
</P>
<P>
 * Alain Rondelli. Another favorite of mine, Alain Rondelli is a savvy 
neighborhood French restaurant in the Richmond district, between Golden Gate 
Park and the Marina. Since he left Ernie's to open his own place last year, the 
Paris-born chef, who worked six years as second-in-command to Marc Meneau at 
his three-star restaurant in Burgundy, has been putting in long hours behind 
the stove at this 48-seat restaurant. I know I'll find things such as mussels 
in an orange-and-saffron-scented broth, perfect slabs of foie gras sandwiched 
between slices of tender brioche, tripe simmered all night long in red wine and 
rich, concentrated pot au feu made with lamb, instead of beef. When he first 
opened, the space was a bit stark; it's much more comfortable now. And a good 
thing, too, since Rondelli is now offering a 20-course (yes, that's 20) Menu 
Ambroisie that takes about five or six hours to eat. He prepares this 
Gargantuan meal only on Wednesdays, Thursdays or Sundays by reservation three 
weeks ahead. Initially, he would prepare it for a minimum of four; now it's 
just two. The price for this grande bouffe is $150 per person. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rubicon. When New York restaurateur Drew Nieporent of Manhattan's celebrated 
le Montrachet comes to town to open a restaurant with celebrity investors such 
as Robert de Niro, Robin Williams and Francis Ford Coppola in tow, it creates 
quite a stir. Rubicon, in fact, takes its name from director and winery owner 
Coppola's flagship Napa Valley Cabernet. The chef is Traci Des Jardins, who 
cooked at Joachim Splichal's Patina in Los Angeles and most recently at Elka in 
San Francisco. The wine director is Larry Stone from Charlie Trotter in 
Chicago, one of the top sommeliers in the country. Rubicon's two-story space in 
the heart of the financial district looks like a buttoned-down banker's 
restaurant, reminiscent of San Francisco's historic Jack's or Sam's Grill -- 
but without the patina. I'll brave the austere decor for the wines: It's 
thrilling to see so many hard-to-find wines all on one intelligently conceived 
list.  
</P>
<P>
 Des Jardins' Splichal-influenced menu -- is less adventurous. Dishes such as 
scallops with truffled mashed potatoes in a buttery, rich sauce or filet of 
beef with big slices of grilled Portobello are clearly designed with wine in 
mind. And to finish off that bottle of Pinot noir, there's a respectable cheese 
plate with warm walnut raisin bread.  
</P>
<P>
 * The Heights. Charles Solomon, who cooked at Bouley in New York, was chef at 
a wonderful little restaurant called Geordy's in an alley off Union Square. 
That closed last year; now he's back as chef/owner (with partner David Wartell) 
at a new place, The Heights, set in a romantic Moorish-inspired house in 
Presidio Heights. Its three intimate dining rooms are furnished with candlelit 
tables and comfortable chairs slipcovered in a black-and-white vegetable print. 
The waiters wear elegant waistcoats to match. This is a restaurant for 
grown-ups, quiet enough to converse over a leisurely dinner.  
</P>
<P>
 The guy can cook. One night's ameuse geule was gutsy, warm fresh sardines in 
balsamic vinegar jolted with lime and grapefruit. Then we had a belon oyster 
stew with fingerling potatoes, leeks and cream and a stunning warm lobster 
salad with bitter braised endive and a feisty horseradish cream. He served 
skate in a beautifully modulated tomato-caper sauce and superb baby lamb cooked 
three ways. Desserts are equally well crafted; he even makes his own dainty 
chocolates. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hayes Street Grill. For a quintessential San Francisco experience, I fancy 
the Hayes Street Grill at lunch when light streams in the skylights. It is a 
wonderful restaurant for pristinely fresh fish prepared with skill and respect. 
Since reinventing the San Francisco grill in 1979, along with more creative 
fare, Hayes Street has offered a selection of plain grilled fish with a choice 
of classic sauces. A recent summer lunch stands out in my mind: a marvelously 
delicate fritto misto (mixed fry) of tiny fried calamari, pale yellow wax beans 
and deep green beans and an assortment of squash accompanied by a gloriously 
garlicky aioli; Tuscan-style sand sole with lemon and rosemary, thumb-sized 
artichokes and knobbly fingerling potatoes; sweet, custardy sand dabs meuniere 
, cooked on the bone and served with a pile of brassy gold fries. And then a 
blackberry ice so intense, three baskets of berries must have gone into one 
serving.  
</P>
<P>
 * Postrio. Wolfgang Puck's sole San Francisco restaurant Postrio has been a 
hot reservation ever since it opened in 1989. When you call for a dinner 
reservation, a recorded voice advises callers that one of the "reservationists" 
will be with you shortly. Since we've got ample chance to sample Puck's cooking 
in Los Angeles, bypass all that bother and go instead to breakfast at Postrio 
-- that's a Puck meal you can't get in L.A. No reservations; just waltz right 
in and right down that grand staircase. You get the same swell service, a large 
table to spread out the juicy bits of the Chronicle and all the time in the 
world to tuck in a splendid breakfast: homemade duck sausages, heavenly 
soft-scrambled eggs loaded with lobster and mascarpone, hand-chopped corned 
beef hash topped with perfect poached eggs. . . . And this ideal restaurant 
experience sets you back just a fraction of the price of dinner. GUIDEBOOK /

TRAVEL INSIDER: A 'FIVE-STAR' RATING MAY RELY ON TWO-CENT OPINIONS; LODGING: 
SOME ORGANIZATIONS APPRAISE HOTELS IN A USEFUL WAY. OTHER 'SHORTHAND' RATINGS

 A luxurious hotel in Mazatlan , thought Barbara Meade Dedios. Great . She and 
her fiance, veteran travelers in Mexico, were planning their honeymoon in that 
area, and a travel agent with a package-tour company had found them a recently 
renovated "five-star" lodging. 
</P>
<P>
 They went. But instead of luxury, she reports, they landed in a "nightmare," 
hounded by time-share-hawkers in the lobby, denied the view room they were 
promised and confronted by a dimly lit, purple-hued bathroom with problematic 
shower drainage. The pool area was poorly maintained, Meade Dedios adds, and 
she thinks the desk staff twice tried to cheat her in cashing her travelers' 
checks. 
</P>
<P>
 Not, in short, a five-star experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Their story holds a lesson for all travelers: If you're relying on a 
star-rating or any other shorthand assessment of quality in choosing a hotel, 
remember two words: Who says? Some ratings mean nothing, and some independent 
organizations do appraise hotels in a useful way. A traveler who knows the 
difference can avoid some disappointments. 
</P>
<P>
 One widely used hotel ratings source, though it's largely invisible to 
consumers, is the Official Hotel Guide, a massive compendium found in the 
offices of travel agents. The hotel guide rates thousands of hotels worldwide 
on a 10-step scale. To profit from all that data, however, a traveler must 
realize that in the OHG's polite language, "first class" is about the middle of 
the pack, and "moderate tourist class" is the bottom of the barrel. 
</P>
<P>
 By OHG's definitions, the very best hotels are classified superior deluxe . 
Descending from there, one finds deluxe, moderate deluxe, superior first class, 
first class (dependable, comfortable places that "may be safely recommended to 
average clients not expecting deluxe facilities or special services"), 
limited-service first class, moderate first class, superior tourist class, 
tourist class, moderate tourist class ("Low-budget operations, often quite old 
and may not be well kept. Should only be used in a pinch if others are not 
available. Clients should always be cautioned what to expect.") In the San 
Francisco market, superior deluxe rooms run about $200 nightly, first class 
hotels run around $100, and moderate tourist lodgings run around $50. 
</P>
<P>
 The best-known ratings in this country are the five-star system of Mobil Trade 
Guides (which dates to 1958), and the five-diamond system of the American 
Automobile Assn. (which dates to 1977). Both systems evaluate hotels and 
restaurants, and annually update their findings in guidebooks. Both rely on 
inspectors who make unannounced visits, and neither accepts payment from hotels 
in exchange for listing. 
</P>
<P>
 A five-star Mobil rating means the establishment is "one of the best in the 
country." Four means "outstanding -- worth a special trip." Three: "Excellent." 
Two: "Very good." One: "Good -- better than average." Mobil says it gives most 
attention to facilities, furnishings and service, also weighing climate, 
historical, cultural and artistic variation as "major factors." Mobil guides 
concentrate on properties in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the AAA system, five diamonds mean "an exceptionally high degree of 
service; striking, luxurious facilities, and many extra amenities." Four stars: 
"a high level of service . . . wide variety of amenities and upscale 
facilities." Three stars: "a degree of sophistication" beyond cleanliness and 
comfort. Two stars: Clean, comfortable and safe, with "noticeable enhancements 
in decor" but aimed at the budget-oriented traveler. One star: "good but 
unpretentious accommodations," safe, clean and private, with "functional, clean 
and comfortable" rooms. AAA guidebooks cover the United States, Canada, the 
Caribbean and Mexico. (Responding to rising consumer safety concerns, AAA 
inspectors over the last two years have resolved that they won't even look at 
properties that haven't installed such safety features as dead-bolts and 
door-viewers in guest rooms.) 
</P>
<P>
 Among upscale travelers in Europe, Michelin guides are a widely venerated 
source of advice for their rigorous standards and unannounced inspections. The 
books are best known for grading restaurants, but Michelin's inspectors also 
rate hotels. The logo ratings run from a tiny building with a five-peaked roof 
(meaning "luxury in the traditional style," such as the Ritz in Paris and its 
$600-a-night rooms) to a squat building with single-peak roof ("quite 
comfortable," usually with rates of $75-$100 nightly). There are also two 
lesser rankings -- a roof over a drinking glass and fork, indicating "simple 
comfort" and an "M" in a box, indicating "modern amenities."  
</P>
<P>
 Many foreign governments themselves maintain rating systems for hotels. The 
government ratings often rely exclusively on easily quantifiable 
characteristics -- size of rooms, availability of elevators and so on -- but 
the results can be helpful. In a survey earlier this year, editors at Consumer 
Reports Travel Letter found that the following governments run ratings 
programs: Australia, Austria, Belgium, France, Greece, Indonesia, Italy, Mexico 
(which last year hired AAA to rate its top 400-500 hotels), the Netherlands, 
New Zealand, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. (For more information, 
contact the relevant government tourist office.)

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS: NEW RESORTS AT DISNEY WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Walt Disney World is putting the finishing touches on its All-Star Music 
Resort, which is scheduled to open in November alongside its All-Star Sports 
Resort which opened this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The resorts have 1,920 rooms each and are on a 246-acre site southwest of the 
Disney-MGM Studios, just outside of Orlando, Fla. Free bus transportation from 
the resorts to all themed Disney attractions is provided. 
</P>
<P>
 Lodging prices at the new resorts are the lowest of all Disney on-site 
accommodations: $69 and $79. Rates vary with the view. Rooms accommodate up to 
four people (two adults and two children, 17 years and younger), but are 
smaller than other on-site accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
 The small print may be the same at both resorts, but when it comes to decor, 
there's no mistaking one for the other. At All-Star Sports, travelers are 
lodged in the Home Run, Hoops, Center Court, Touchdown and Surf Inn hotels, eat 
at the End Zone food court and swim in a free-form pool called Surf's Up. 
Gigantic football helmets, baseball bats designed for giants and a play diagram 
big enough to sit on dot the grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 At All-Star Music, the decor centers around five themes: Broadway, Calypso, 
Jazz, Country and Rock 'n' Roll. Huge banjos, guitars, trombones and conga 
drums greet guests who stay in the Rock Inn, among others, eat at the 
Intermission food court and swim in a piano-shaped pool. For reservations, call 
(407) W-DISNEY or a travel agent. Deadline for Yosemite Lottery 
</P>
<P>
 Applications are now available for the mid-December lottery to reserve summer 
space at one of Yosemite's High Sierra camps. Applications must be turned in by 
Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 The lottery was established in 1992 to allocate the limited number of spaces 
that are available at the High Sierra camps, which are six to 10 miles apart 
and are set up in June and dismantled in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone wishing to reserve space in a tent cabin, make meal reservations or 
participate in one of several trips, including four- or six-day saddle trips or 
seven-day guided loop trips with a naturalist, must submit an application to 
the lottery. 
</P>
<P>
 Applications are available from Yosemite High Sierra Camp Reservations, 5410 
E. Home Ave., Fresno, Calif. 93727. Only one application may be submitted per 
party. Calling All Airborne Travelers 
</P>
<P>
 There's no more escaping the phone, not even 35,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to technology unveiled this month, airline passengers can not only make 
calls from their seats, they can receive them, too. 
</P>
<P>
 The service is now available on Delta Shuttle and USAir Shuttle flights 
between Boston, New York and Washington, D.C. and on United Airlines 
transcontinental flights. By month's end, it is scheduled to be offered on 400 
aircraft and by year's end, on 600, including some international carriers. 
Information: (800) AIRFONE. Festival of Arts in Hong Kong

run between Chicago and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning Oct. 30, the sleek bi-level cars will add another dimension to the 
trip, with coach, sleeping, dining (with Culinary Institute of America-trained 
chefs) and lounge cars (with floor-to-ceiling windows).

<P>
 The round-trip coach fare starts at $128 from Washington to Chicago. (Sleepers 
cost extra and range from economy to deluxe, with special bedrooms available 
for disabled travelers.) Reservations: (800) 872-7245. Pan American Highway

<P>
 A 70-year dream to join the Americas, from Alaska to Argentina, by highway, 
has hit yet another roadblock. 
</P>
<P>
 Builders have only to carve a road through an 85-mile stretch of the Darien 
Gap jungle to complete the last link of the Pan American Highway between 
Colombia and Panama. But a new environmental report released last week in 
Bogata, Colombia, says the construction will cause serious environmental 
damage, according to the Associated Press.

WEEKEND ESCAPE: EL CAPITAN STATE BEACH; THEY FINALLY DISCOVER THE JOYS OF 
SETTLING IN AT A POPULAR BEACH CAMPGROUND. NOW, IF THEY COULD JUST GET RID OF 
THEIR NEIGHBORS . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As a young married couple, our favorite way of getting away from it all was to 
backpack in the wilds: Yosemite, the Grand Tetons, Trinity Alps, Mt. Shasta. In 
our limited experience, car camping meant enduring a crowd of yahoos watching 
portable TVs and drinking beer outside Gargantuan tents at littered campsites 
with overflowing trash bins. 
</P>
<P>
 Two children later, car camping was looking better -- better than not camping 
at all, anyway. So, this summer we planned to introduce Laura, 4, and Timmy, 18 
months, to the joys of the outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 We bought a spacious four-person tent to replace the lightweight one we had 
carried on our backs, a rechargeable lantern and camp chairs. In mid-July we 
dug out a 1991 Los Angeles Times article on Southern California's best family 
campgrounds that we had set aside and began calling for reservations. And 
calling. And calling. 
</P>
<P>
 It was impossible to get a reservation for a Friday night at a beach campsite 
through the Labor Day weekend. After Labor Day? Presto! We had our pick of any 
weekend at most campgrounds on the list. 
</P>
<P>
 We chose the Friday after Labor Day at El Capitan State Beach, 20 miles 
northwest of Santa Barbara, because it seemed to offer the natural beauty of 
the beach tucked into the shadow of coastal cliffs, as well as the amenities 
families need. 
</P>
<P>
 Naively expecting a pristine, uncrowded campground, we arrived in early 
afternoon and found a line of cars waiting at the entrance gate. 
</P>
<P>
 The ranger briefed us on the camp selection procedure, which was necessary to 
avoid disputes that would surely arise if two groups of campers both claimed to 
have spotted the same site first. 
</P>
<P>
 The camp looked at least half full, and the prime cliff-top sites above the 
beach were gone. So we wound up choosing a spacious site that was one of about 
eight ringing an area the size of half a football field. A live oak tree shaded 
a flat spot that fit our tent perfectly and fir trees shielded us, more or 
less, from our neighbors. As effective as they are as a visual break, fir trees 
are lousy sound barriers. But more about that later. 
</P>
<P>
 As we set up camp, we realized the effects of overuse. We had to police the 
perimeter of the site, picking up trash and regretted not bringing a broom or a 
rake to rid the area of cigarette butts. We also noticed, for the first time, 
that the site was virtually in the shadow of U.S. 101 and the Southern Pacific 
railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, we thought, there's always the beach. And El Capitan is a lovely one: 
Only a few hundred yards from our campsite, it is a compact crescent of fine 
brown sand, with rocky tide pools to the southeastern end and an expanse of 
steep bluffs stretching to the west. Above the tide pools, on a grassy knoll, 
are a dozen picnic tables with million-dollar Pacific Ocean views. 
</P>
<P>
 The kids romped, playing in the sand, chasing waves, tossing smooth rocks into 
the surf. After a swim in the almost-tepid water and some body surfing in the 
moderate waves, we joined them in excavating a sandcastle and moat. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's that black stuff on your hands?" one of us asked 20 minutes later. 
Then we noticed the "black stuff" -- tar -- was on our legs and our arms, and 
mostly, on the bottoms of our feet. Natural oil seepage that washes in from 
offshore, the gooey stuff does not come off easily. Later that night in the 
camp shower, however, we took turns with a dish scrubber and got most of it 
off. (A quarter buys several minutes of hot water and 50 cents buys enough time 
for an adult and a squirming child both to get clean.) 
</P>
<P>
 The next day we saw a sign warning about the tar, offering suggestions for its 
removal (including using mayonnaise) and advising that the best solution was to 
avoid it in the first place. Hey, thanks a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time we left the beach, the campground was filling up and we started 
dinner. Each campsite has a fire ring, and the camp store sells firewood, but 
we used two backpacking stoves to cook a quick but tasty and filling meal. We 
had cooked a quantity of fusilli pasta before setting out from home and had 
brought along sun-dried tomatoes, pine nuts, scallions and spicy chicken 
sausage to dress it up. Home-grown sliced tomatoes and green beans, an 
inexpensive Pinot Noir and bread completed the repast. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course the children were famished and had little patience with such 
culinary indulgences. They downed fruit, yogurt, string cheese, undressed pasta 
and hot dogs while the adults' meal was cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 We cleaned up, got the kids bedded down and read outside the tent by lantern 
light. It was pleasant but not quiet: Our neighbors to the right arrived at 9 
p.m. and were struggling to raise a tent while their three children howled and 
their dog woofed. Loud rock music blared from a radio at a site occupied by 
another of our neighbors. A trio of twentysomethings behind us on a gals-only 
camping trip giggled and shrieked like banshees.  
</P>
<P>
 By 10, we had turned in. The night was cool, perfect for snuggling into 
sleeping bags, and most of the campground was quiet -- except for the good ol' 
gals behind us. Finally, after 11, a few menacing shouts in their direction 
embarrassed them into keeping their giggling down to a titter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Timmy, the family's early riser, was up at dawn, occasioning a walk to the 
beach. He chortled every time one of the large flock of brown pelicans did one 
of their characteristic slow turns before plunging straight down, neck 
outstretched, to splash into the surf. He also was captivated by almost-tame 
bunnies that were slow to hop off the hiking trail and by the line of 
surf-casters who seemed to be far better at hauling in thick strands of seaweed 
than catching anything. 
</P>
<P>
 Back at the campsite, it was time for pancakes and real filter coffee, a 
needed eye-opener after the shorter-than-ideal night before. 
</P>
<P>
 After cleaning up, we spent the rest of the morning exploring the 133-acre 
camp ground, which has a 2 1/2-mile bicycle trail that follows the coastal 
bluff to Refugio State Beach to the west. 
</P>
<P>
 With checkout time at noon, we dismantled the tent, packed the van, bought 
sandwiches and fruit at the well-stocked camp store and ate at one of those 
picnic tables above the beach, watching the pelicans glide and dive. The state 
charges $5 for day use of the beach, but the ranger at the gate waived the fee 
for us. 
</P>
<P>
 After a nap break for the kids, we started the drive home. We exited U.S. 101 
in downtown Santa Barbara and cruised the wharf area for a restaurant. The Crab 
Shack on Cabrillo Boulevard across from Stearns Wharf suggested the proper 
atmosphere for our ragtag group, and it turned out to be just right. 
</P>
<P>
 On the drive home as the kids slept, we weighed the pluses and minuses of the 
hectic two days: We had found a well-run campground in a beautiful setting -- 
but it was noisier at night than our house in Los Angeles. And though most 
families we encountered were considerate, the depredations of some -- the 
revelers, the litterers and the fire bugs who had lopped branches off the 
ancient live oaks at our camp site -- saddened us. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet we will camp again. Next time, we'll stay longer and go mid-week or on a 
weekend even more removed from the Memorial-to-Labor-Day crush. A ranger told 
us that El Capitan, which is open year-round, is at capacity on weekends into 
October, but is only one-third full during the week now. (From Memorial to 
Labor Day it is at capacity every day; nearby Refugio, with 80 campsites and a 
south-facing beach with gentle waves, is even more popular.) 
</P>
<P>
 We considered the reaction of Laura, who in one 24-hour period had scalded 
herself with hot cocoa, caught her hair in the tent zipper and was stung by a 
yellow jacket -- and still managed to bounce with enthusiasm at every turn of 
her adventure. If she could do it, so could we. Budget for Four

HIKING: MORRO BAY: THE MORRO OF THE STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Morro Rock, the much-photographed Central Coast icon, official State Landmark 
No. 801, and the "Gibraltar of the Pacific," isn't the only morro in town. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight more morros -- mini volcanic peaks -- are linked with the famed rock in 
a chain that stretches from San Luis Obispo to Morro Bay. A couple of these 
morros (all of which are taller than photogenic but relatively puny Morro Rock) 
offer great short hikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Geologists say the nine morros originated as volcanoes beneath the sea that 
covered the area a million years ago. After the sea and volcanic explosions 
subsided, erosion began dissolving the softer parts of the mountain around the 
volcanic rock and left the nine volcanic peaks standing above the surrounding 
landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the more prominent and visible morros are Islay Peak east of the San 
Luis Obispo County Airport and San Luis Mountain towering above the Madonna 
Inn. The two of most interest to hikers are Cabrillo Peak and Black Hill, both 
in Morro Bay State Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabrillo Peak, a 911-foot morro, has a terrific 360-degree view. 
</P>
<P>
 At the base of the peak are rolling grasslands with two miles of trail. Quarry 
Trail was so named for the rock quarried here and crushed for local roads. The 
Park Ridge Trail explores a group of minor peaks. Striking Park Ridge Rock is a 
state park ranger training site for cliff rescues. Live Oak Trail meanders 
among the predominant oak along the San Luis Obispo County coast. 
</P>
<P>
 The adventurous will bushwhack up trail-less Cabrillo Peak. A few faint zigzag 
paths made by use, not design, help the intrepid hiker, but it's a 
make-your-own-way kind of hike to the top. Allow yourself plenty of time to 
climb. 
</P>
<P>
 From Cabrillo Peak, the panorama includes Morro Rock to the west; the Irish 
Hills and Los Osos Valley to the south; the chain of Morros going east; the 
Santa Lucia Mountains and the southern Big Sur backcountry to the north. 
</P>
<P>
 To reach the trail head for Cabrillo Peak: From U.S. 101 in San Luis Obispo, 
take the Morro Bay/California 1 exit and travel 12 miles north to the outskirts 
of Morro Bay. Take the signed Morro Bay State Park/Montana de Oro State Park 
exit and follow South Bay Boulevard. In three-fourths of a mile the road forks; 
the right branch leads to the main part of Morro Bay State Park, but fork left 
and continue on South Bay Boulevard another half-mile to the Cabrillo Peak dirt 
parking lot on the left (east) side of the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Also consider the easy three-mile round trip hike up Black Hill, located in 
the main part of Morro Bay State Park. Black Hill, the last peak in the 
volcanic series before Morro Rock, has a trail that tours through a little of 
everything -- chaparral, eucalyptus, oaks, pine and coastal scrub. From the 
mountain's 640-foot summit, you can see Morro Bay Estuary, the sand spit and 
the hills of nearby Montana de Oro State Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Be sure to check out the morro exhibit at the excellent Morro Bay State Park 
Museum, which also boasts some terrific natural history displays and offers a 
grand view of Morro Bay. Quarry, Live Oak, Park Ridge Trails Where: Morro Bay 
State Park, Cabrillo Peak near Morro Bay. Distance: 2 to 4 miles round trip; 
900-foot elevation gain to top of Cabrillo Peak. Terrain: Volcanic "plugs," 
native grasslands, coastal scrub. Highlights: Grand Morro Bay and Los Osos 
Valley views. Degree of Difficulty: Easy hiking around peak; short, but 
strenuous off-trail climb to top of peak. Precautions: Wear long pants in 
brushy areas off-trail; watch for ticks. For More Information: Morro Bay State 
Park, Morro Bay, Calif. 93442; tel. (805) 772-2560.

 We were sitting in the Piazza Walther, eating pasta with beer. Our waiter

the town of Bolzano in the Alto Adige, Italy's northernmost province. Bolzano 
is situated at the foot of the Dolomites, the Eastern Italian Alps, which rise 
from the Venetian Plain about 100 miles north of Venice, and separate Italy 
from Austria. We were in Italy, but not the Italy of terra cotta tile roofs or 
ocher stucco walls.  
</P>
<P>
 The notion of a Mediterranean Italy is so ingrained, it was hard at first to 
grasp this place, its gloomy arched portals leading out to pale blue and yellow 
stucco walls embroidered with lacy rococo arabesques. But border cultures have 
their own seductions, and it would become apparent in no time that this blend 
of Italian and Austrian was no different, with food, language and custom all 
its own. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the mountains are a fusion of rock found nowhere else in Europe. Spectral 
battlements in the morning mist, fluted crowns reflecting pink by the late 
afternoon, they combine gray dolomitic limestone (named for its 18th-Century 
French discoverer, Deodat de Dolomieu) and dark brown volcanic rock in the 
plateaus. They tend to erase any lingering nostalgia for the Italy of the 
south. The mountains, I reminded myself, were the main reason we had come here 
to a place we had barely heard of to join 15 strangers on a weeklong hiking 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Other aspects of the trip had some importance. We were going with Butterfield 
& Robinson, the Toronto-based touring company well known to a certain brand of 
sybarites who enjoy the idea of several hours of biking or walking in between 
sustained bouts of eating and drinking. From a previous biking trip with B&R, 
to Provence, we knew they also understood how to make group travel appeal to 
group-travelphobes. There was no artificial intimacy force-fed by relentlessly 
chipper guides. We suffered through no singing of "Auld Lang Syne." Instead, 
the guides had encouraged people to get up when they pleased and go at their 
own pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranging in age from 45 to 65, we were business and professional people from 
Minnesota, Kentucky, Florida, Texas and California. We were not all made for 
each other, but we managed a shipboard camaraderie. After meeting over drinks 
on the veranda of a Bolzano hotel, we boarded a bus for the two-hour ride to 
the mountain hamlet of Corvara in Badia. Sloping down a broad, green valley 
bracketed by huge mountains, Corvara was typical of towns we would see. Each 
had a doll-sized stucco church with slender onion-domed campanile, houses of 
whitewashed stucco and unpainted wood, and window boxes full of neatly pruned 
red and pink hanging geraniums. Ski chalets and quaint woodcarvers' shops were 
everywhere -- Gepetto and Pinocchio could have stepped out of any of them. 
</P>
<P>
 We would spend two nights at a local hotel, take an exploratory day hike and 
then move on, by foot, to our next destination. The pattern would be repeated 
at each of our four hotels with one exception. We spent just one night at a 
rough hewn rifugio high in the mountains, where some of us, or at least my 
husband, could happily have spent the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Our first night in Corvara was a festive one, begun with a hearty, eclectic 
meal of South Tyrolean and North Italian cuisine -- risotto followed by pigs' 
knuckles topped off by the boiled custard and meringue desert known as floating 
island. Much beer and wine. Toward the end of the evening, Signor Costa, the 
hotel owner, and his sons regaled us with local songs -- yodeled with virtuoso 
vocal agility in Ladin, a Latin-derived Romansch language still preferred in 
much of the region to the Italian and German also spoken by most natives. Their 
accompaniment was a Spike Jones-like instrument called a violina del diavolo , 
or devil's violin; a stringed post with knots carved into gnarled faces, and an 
attached tambourine.  
</P>
<P>
 The first full-day hike turned out to be a thriller. After the threat of rain 
and fog caused our two leaders to scrap the planned itinerary, a local mountain 
guide was recruited to take us on what was supposed to be an easier route. 
Maurizio, the guide, proved to be the soul of Alpine cheer and competence, even 
if his idea of easy was open to question. 
</P>
<P>
 After a chairlift ride and a short climb through a piney thicket, we were out 
on the vast, open Pralongia plateau, surrounded in the far distance by a 
seemingly unbroken wall of chiseled gray cliffs. By mid-afternoon, the group 
was strung out in an ever-lengthening line of trekkers along a narrow path at 
the base of two craggy peaks. We made our way across the skirt with teetering, 
deliberate steps over wobbly boulders and scree, always looking over the 
immense valley miles below. Rounding the end of the massif, we descended into 
trees and meadows, then climbed again. A trickling waterfall was our staircase, 
leading up to a wide marsh and the end of the trail. Just as daylight was 
fading, we watched rain clouds gather over the ghost of a World War I barracks 
at Valparola, the scene of some of the fiercest fighting between the Italians 
and Austrians. 
</P>
<P>
 Back at our hotel, another sumptuous dinner -- quail, venison and apple crisp 
with honey ice cream -- did not allay altogether the anxiety of the day's trek. 
Our sub-group of eight had been exhilarated by the adventure. Others had been a 
little frightened. In particular, other members of the group had not enjoyed 
negotiating a hand-over-hand ascent of a waterfall, even a miniature one, in 
semi-darkness. We were about to become two groups, and while our two handlers 
weren't keen on the idea of leading a divided expedition, they rose graciously 
to the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 The two guides also made sure there was time for a little independent 
exploration of the towns where we stayed. You didn't have to go far to find a 
lot. One morning, I slipped next door to the hotel to explore a small, white 
church I had barely noticed almost hidden behind a high wall. Although I wasn't 
expecting a treasure in such a remote and unassuming place, I had learned not 
to trust the perfunctory treatment given these towns in even the best 
guidebooks. While in Bolzano, we had stumbled onto the Gothic parish church, 
and were surprised to find a wealth of late medieval and early Renaissance 
altarpieces. In addition to altarpieces, the 15th-Century church in Corvara was 
surrounded by a military cemetery with a forest of crosses formed out of 
wrought iron into twining tendrils over every grave, whose plots were 
well-tended flower beds ablaze with color.  
</P>
<P>
 The next day, an easy morning walk took us along another part of the Pralongia 
plateau, with the chalky mountains always looming on the horizon, and then down 
into a field dotted with dark log cabins. Called baitas , these cabins serve to 
provide minimal shelter, normally for ski outings, and a shamefully picturesque 
setting for a walk. We were looking for the baita with the terrace and smoking 
grill. 
</P>
<P>
 Spread out in front of the baita was an hors d'oeuvres table laden with 
regional specialties, including various cheeses and sandwiches made with speck, 
a ham similar to prosciutto, but thicker and saltier -- Austrian in name and 
flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 To balance the northern food, our aperitif was the more Italian Tirola, a 
mixture of white wine and Campari. Then we sat down at picnic tables on the 
deck for the main meal and watched as enormous vats of risotto with porcini, 
just in season, were stirred patiently, then ladled steaming, into big, white 
bowls. That tour de force was followed by barbecued chicken, sausages and ribs, 
then apple fritters fried before our eyes in another vat and chased down by 
grappa and coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 On our third day out, a three-hour morning hike led us to a high, wind-swept 
plateau that is the site of the pilgrimage shrine of Santa Croce, a simple 
16th-Century church with interior frescoes and a wall of flickering votive 
candles. At intervals along the misty forested path to the church, each of the 
14 Stations of the Cross is commemorated in a vitrine, a small case mounted on 
a stake, with a scene inside, either carved or painted in differing folk 
styles. Making their way down from the shrine were solemn processions of 
pilgrims praying aloud as they passed. Like noisy tourists barging in on a high 
Mass, we were awed and silenced. 
</P>
<P>
 Our planned route from San Cassiano to the Rifugio Fanes, at 6,798 feet the 
highest, most remote spot on our itinerary, circumnavigated the massif called 
Sasso della Croce, making use of the van to get to a chairlift, then to the 
trail. Our group of eight, fueled the night before by the local wine and an 
inspirational slide show on mountaineering, decided to tackle a more 
challenging route. The guides submitted our plan to Maurizio, who assured them 
that while strenuous, the trek was manageable. Starting early the next morning 
from the chairlift, at 6,072 feet, we ambled through farmland and cow pastures, 
lulled into a relaxed state of confidence while stopping for lunch in a rolling 
meadow dotted with purple gentian. But soon the woods gave way to a scrubby 
stretch that opened into the immense and barren Passo San Antonio above the 
tree line. Hardly visible high above was a saddle atop a loose, gravelly trail 
that clung for a very long time to the side of a precipitous drop-off, then 
accelerated its angle toward the vertical as it snaked up to the summit, at 
8,138 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of hours later, when, one by one, we had all peered over the other 
side, all the strain and struggle fell away as we took in the rocky meadows 
below punctuated by miniature turquoise lakes and ancient low stone walls 
defining the ridges, our rifugio barely in sight miles away. We made a grand 
gesture of drinking the searing cold and sweet water of a clear stream (when 
was the last time it was safe to drink from a stream in the New World?), as we 
reached the last meadow to be traversed. Marching to the deck of the rifugio as 
the sun was beginning to set, we were greeted with cheers and champagne toasts 
by the others, who had passed the binoculars to monitor our entire descent. 
</P>
<P>
 A rustic rifugio is exactly where one should stay after such a day. Its 
unpainted wood and stone structure, beds with down comforters flanking a window 
and framing a view of our trail, communal showers way down the hall, and 
boisterous dining room filled with the singing of local revelers, seemed the 
only fitting end. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the relentless thrills and strain of the previous days, the 
walk down from Fanes to the chic ski town of Cortina d'Ampezzo through the 
Parco Naturale provided the week's most docile beauty of lakes, pale ice-blue 
rivers, tranquil woods and dappled sunlight. We stayed in the quietly elegant 
Hotel de la Poste in this larger, more cosmopolitan town (pop. 8,500) in which 
it was easy to fall into the local pattern, ordering gin and tonics at sunset 
on the tiny outdoor terrace in front of the hotel, from which we watched life 
go by around the piazza . 
</P>
<P>
 The final dinner is a company ritual. Ours was a sumptuous debauchery 
consisting of a succession of dishes of escalating richness -- ravioli, 
tagliatelle, duck with chanterelles, pancetta and liver, beef and polenta and 
countless regional wines. 
</P>
<P>
 Ski pins were handed out as awards in several categories for special 
distinctions -- stupid trail decisions, for example -- and toasts offered with 
high spirits and heartfelt appreciation. The most hard-boiled member of the 
group -- a grouchy, debonair and funny former investment banker -- gave a 
touching one to the making of friends. We were only minutes away from "Auld 
Lang Syne." GUIDEBOOK / Dolomite Directions

 We drove down to San Diego the last day of September to see Seven Seas Cruise 
Line's Hanseatic, a 170-passenger luxury expedition vessel wending its way 
gradually south to Antarctica after a swift and successful transit of the 
Northwest Passage. 
</P>
<P>
 The first of a series of five Antarctic cruises begins from Buenos Aires Dec. 
18. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally built in 1991 for Seattle-based Society Expeditions as the Society 
Adventurer, the ship was never delivered to Society because of a contractual 
dispute, and languished for almost two years in a Finnish shipyard before being 
taken over by a German tour company, Hanseatic Tours. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco-based Seven Seas, which operates the very popular little Song of 
Flower, began U.S. sales and marketing for the Hanseatic earlier this year.  
</P>
<P>
 Inside, the Hanseatic is an elegant and luxurious ship, with rich wood-toned 
paneling in cabins and public rooms and spacious staterooms, all with windows 
or portholes. Each accommodation, even the least expensive, has a marble 
bathroom with tub and shower, a separate sitting area with chaise or sofa, TV 
set with VCR, mini-refrigerator stocked with nonalcoholic beverages, and 
generous closet and drawer space. All 90 staterooms measure 236 square feet; 
four two-room suites measure 475. 
</P>
<P>
 The lunch we had aboard, while not on the cutting edge of cuisine, was tasty 
and well prepared.  
</P>
<P>
 A trio plays for dancing in the big, handsome Explorer Lounge in the evenings, 
and a pianist plays at teatime.  
</P>
<P>
 The ship has a beauty shop, a well-equipped spa and hospital.  
</P>
<P>
 The Dec. 18 Christmas cruise from Buenos Aires spends 18 nights visiting the 
Falklands, South Georgia, South Orkneys and the Antarctic Peninsula, ending in

16 and 27 and Feb. 7, cruising the Falklands, Antarctic Peninsula and South 
Shetlands. And a 20-night sailing from Ushuaia to Cape Town, South Africa, 
leaving Feb. 18, will visit the Peninsula, South Shetland Islands, South 
Georgia and Tristan da Cunha. All are scheduled to land at Cape Horn if weather 
permits. Fares range from $6,750 to $15,995 per person, double occupancy, 
including air fare. To get a free color brochure or more information, contact a

TAKING THE KIDS: EDUCATION OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fred Brown didn't think twice about taking his 16-year-old son out of school 
for a week. Brown was going to Malaysia to a conference and the opportunity to 
introduce his son to another part of the world was too good to pass up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Travel is an education," Brown said, acknowledging that catching up afterward 
was difficult for his son. "The older the child, the harder it is. And it is 
extra work for the teachers." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown understands the difficulties spawned by children missing school for 
family trips. He is principal of Boyertown, Pa., Elementary School and 
president of the 26,000-member National Assn. of Elementary School Principals. 
</P>
<P>
 When his students take off, Brown expects an oral or written report on where 
they have been when they come back.  
</P>
<P>
 "Have the children read up on where they're going ahead of time and keep a 
journal," he said. Give the teachers plenty of notice to get their assignments 
together. And be prepared that there will be catching up to do afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the extra work, the practice of taking children out of school for 
travel seems to be growing. For one thing, parents are combining business trips 
with family time. The U.S. Travel Data Center reports that last year, 15% of 
all business trips included children -- about 42 million trips -- and estimates 
suggest that many of those were undertaken when school was in session. 
</P>
<P>
 Author Laura Sutherland, for one, will take her kindergartner and 
second-grader along next month for several weeks while she researches a book on 
Caribbean islands. "I'm going to develop a unit on the places we're going," 
said Sutherland, who lives in Santa Cruz. She will pack sufficient work so her 
older daughter won't be behind when she returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Sutherland knows firsthand the enriching and lifelong benefits travel can 
provide a child. She spent eighth grade touring Europe when her father, a 
college professor, took a sabbatical. "It was the best year," she said. "And it 
made me confident that I could handle new situations and new places." 
</P>
<P>
 Other families, particularly those with younger children, prefer to travel 
off-season when bargains are easier to find and popular locations less crowded. 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents simply can't get time off when the kids have school vacations. 
Take Jim and Carole Thorpe, who run Bishop's Lodge in Santa Fe, N.M. 
Thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter and summer breaks are their busiest seasons, 
Carol Thorpe said. 
</P>
<P>
 "So we take an extra week at spring vacation. It's the only time we can go 
away and be together as a family." She tells the teachers months ahead and is 
scrupulous about getting her two kids' assignments done while they're away. 
"But there are teachers who think the only way to learn is in the classroom," 
she said, sighing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Schools have got to be more flexible," said Carole Kennedy, principal of the 
New Haven Accelerated School in Columbia, Mo., and a board member of the 
National Assn. of Secondary School Principals. "With society changing so 
rapidly, schools have got to adjust to the needs of families." 
</P>
<P>
 Families need to take every chance they've got to teach their kids. In fact, 
U.S. Secretary of Education Richard W. Riley is calling on schools to spur 
parents' involvement. In a speech in September, he said that decades of 
research show that "greater family involvement in children's learning is a 
critical link to achieving a high-quality education." 
</P>

 Use a trip to teach math (figuring out what souvenirs cost or how to convert

 "For any child who is struggling in school or who gets very anxious about 
completing things, it would be difficult," UCLA child psychologist Jill

 Chicagoan Paula Wolff, who takes her four children out of school every winter 
for a Caribbean vacation, remembers the traumas of missed dances and evenings 
spent trying to complete assignments. Yet the trips were the only time she and 
her husband could break away from busy careers, and the family decided that the 
time together was well worth it, giving everyone a chance to connect with each 
other away from the stresses and strains of home, school and the office. But 
inevitably, as the kids got older, she added, the trips have become shorter. 
"Our teachers were not happy about it," said Wolff's 19-year-old daughter 
Clementine Whelan. "We'd be anxious about what we were missing. But there is no 
way we'd miss out on it. It's a special family event, something we look forward 
to all year."

BACKPACK & BUDGET: JUST CAN'T PART WITH RED SEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>

 The budget accommodation situation is improving at several of Israel's most 
popular tourist areas. A new youth hostel opened this summer in Jerusalem, the 
hostel near the remains of King Herod's desert fortress at Masada has been 
renovated, and by next summer the hostel facilities at the Red Sea resort of 
Eilat will have increased to accommodate more than 500 travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Jerusalem Youth Hostel is a 250-bed facility at 67 HaNeviim St., 
(telephone 011-97-22-384-555). This is about a 10-minute walk from the central 
bus station or the old city. 
</P>
<P>
 The hostel's dormitory rooms each have four to six beds and private washrooms. 
Travelers who are members of affiliated hosteling associations are charged $16 
per bed, per night. A bed in a room shared by two is $23 per night. These rates 
include breakfast, but other meals are available. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most moving sites in Israel is Masada, the mountaintop fortress 
ruins overlooking the Dead Sea, where, in AD 73, 960 Jewish men, women and 
children committed mass suicide rather than surrender to the Romans. 
</P>
<P>
 You can reach the mountaintop ruins by cable car, or by hiking in the early 
morning while it's still cool. The 140-bed Masada Youth Hostel, which is 
situated near the beginning of the trail, was upgraded last March. Now all its 
rooms have air conditioning and four to eight beds. You can contact the hostel 
at 011-972-7-957-150. 
</P>
<P>
 Eilat, Israel's southernmost city on the Red Sea, is known as a center for sun 
worshiping and water sports. It takes about 4 1/2 hours to travel to Eilat by 
bus from Jerusalem. The trip costs about $10. 
</P>
<P>
 By next July the 7-year-old Eilat Youth Hostel, which is located next to the 
Sonesta Hotel, will have a new addition, increasing its capacity to 530 beds 
from 370. Most rooms have four beds and private washrooms. Some double rooms 
are available. 
</P>
<P>
 The hostel also offers a television room, laundry and cafeteria. Breakfast is 
included in nightly rates. The hostel's number is 011-972-7-372-358. 
</P>
<P>
 To help independent travelers get to Israel's popular sites, the Israel Youth 
Hostel Assn. is offering a variety of economical "Go-on-Your-Own" packages 
combining youth hostel accommodations with public transportation, rental cars 
or small guided groups. Packages cover all areas of Israel and include tours to 
Egypt, the Sinai Desert and one-week adventure or leisure packages from Eilat, 
which can be purchased from the Jerusalem office or the travel desk at the 
Eilat hostel. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven-night version costs $290, the 14-night version is $560 (this and 
longer packages also include a pass to Nature Reserves), the 21-day version is 
$785 and a 28-day version (which has a 30-day bus pass) is $1,020. 
</P>
<P>
 Packages available from Eilat include:  
</P>
<P>
 * Seven nights at the Eilat Youth hostel, with breakfast and dinner, a Jeep 
safari into the Eilat Mountains and a Red Sea Cruise (with swimming and 
snorkeling) for $260. You can begin any day. 
</P>
<P>
 * A seven-night Sinai Desert trip combining two nights at the Eilat Youth 
Hostel and five nights camping for $450. Participants hike while their luggage 
is carried by camel. Visits to Bedouin villages, a hike up Mt. Sinai and an 
excursion to the monastery of St. Catherine are scheduled. There is an 
additional $20 border tax charge. This weekly package starts on Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices quoted are valid between March, 1995, and February, 1996. Most packages 
are also available earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information on these and other programs contact the Israel Youth 
Hostels Assn. at 3 Dorot Rishonim St., P.O.B. 1075, Jerusalem 91009.

COSTLY CRUISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I enjoy the travel articles by Shawn Hubler, especially her "All Aboard!" 
(Sept. 18), but I sometimes wonder if Ms. Hubler knows how the other half 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 A family of four that can afford $7,200 for a Caribbean cruise, even if it is 
all inclusive, is hardly the norm in this area. In some families, $7,200 is the 
entire annual income. In these times of companies downsizing, mass layoffs and 
very few comparable jobs to replace those lost, $7,200 cruises are about as 
attainable for many people as a trip to the moon.

BIKING IN MOAB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In September, we visited Moab, Utah, the mountain biker's mecca ("The Capital 
of Rock and Roll," April 24).It was fabulous, with one exception. It seems the 
bikers are so excited by the expansive areas of beauty, that they forget to 
honor the land they're visiting by staying on marked trails. Despite its rugged 
and powerful topography, this living crust is very sensitive and a tire or 
footprint may take a hundred years to repair. Arches National Park has already 
suffered significantly because it has been unprotected for years. Hopefully 
this won't happen to Canyonlands National Park if we all remember to stay on 
the marked trails.

MORE LUGGAGE LAMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to "Luggage Lament," Louise Hauter's letter to the editor (Sept. 
26): I would much prefer to check everything -- but with luggage being lost and 
pilfered, it won't happen. I can handle the wait at baggage claim, though 
sometimes it seems forever.The business traveler can't or won't. No easy 
answer.

 I've never had a fish fall on my head, but my luggage was placed in the 
lavatory for take-off and landing on an Air France flight to Paris. My bulkhead 
seat had no overhead compartment and there was no seat in front of me, under 
which to stow it, thus the potty treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 The carry-on fiasco is not tolerated on Lufthansa. There, carry-on luggage is 
inspected three times -- at the check-in counter, in the waiting area, and 
during boarding. Their rules of one bag per person and no garment bags, 
oversized-items or polo mallets (I've been hit by one -- thanks, TWA), etc., 
are strictly enforced.

HOLLYWOOD COMES OF AGE: AN ALL-STAR STUDIO IS BORN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Joel Kotkin, Joel Kotkin, a contributing editor to Opinion, is a senior 
fellow at the Center for the New West and international fellow at Pepperdine 
University School of Business. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeffrey Katzenberg, Steven Spielberg and David Geffen, in announcing their 
dream on Wednesday to build a full-service studio from the ground up, have 
returned entrepreneurial man agement to big-time entertainment. Significantly, 
they mortgaged their venture with their reputations and artistic skills. In so 
doing, the former Disney studio head, film director and the record industry 
mogul and movie producer together reasserted the primacy of knowledge, 
managerial guile and creativity over the power of institutional money and 
corporate bulk. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the trio's studio proposal reflects a broader trend not only 
in Hollywood but also in other fast-paced, talent-based industries such as 
biomedical devices and software. Even as new combinations are formed, and 
sometimes evolve into large companies, a greater proportion of employment has 
moved to small, even micro businesses. They are the chief providers of services 
necessary for today's successful enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 In computers, for example, it was only a decade ago when IBM and a handful of 
other big companies dominated the market. Today, a broad array of companies, 
large and small, are more adept in product development and marketing than the 
old, vertically integrated Big Blue could ever hope to be. In contrast to IBM, 
the new, fast-growing computer firms heavily rely on networks of subcontractors 
and a relatively small, cohesive management team to stay ahead in the rapidly 
changing marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally dominated by a large number of smaller, highly entrepreneurial 
units, the film industry by the 1930s had become highly concentrated in a 
handful of big studios. Films were shot at studio locations with actors on 
long-term contract, then cut and edited by permanent post-production staffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, however, this "factory" model of production has been supplanted by 
a more crafts-oriented, collaborative structure dominated by dense networks of 
smaller, highly specialized firms. In 1960, just 28% of U.S. films were 
produced by independent-production companies. By 1991, almost two-thirds were 
independently produced. In many ways, the Katzenberg-Spielberg-Geffen studio is 
the culmination of this trend. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, the structure of the entertainment industry has become more 
entrepreneurial. For example, in the last 16 years, the number of 
entertainment-related companies in Southern California has more than tripled; 
nearly 95,000 of the industry's total employment are free-lance workers, and 
firms employing fewer than 10 individuals increasingly are the rule. Indeed, 
only 19 entertainment-related companies in all California employ as many as 
1,000 people, and they are chiefly the remnants of the older studios and larger 
production companies. The smaller entities that have taken center stage offer a 
wide gamut of products and services, from manufacturing lights to creating 
software for digital images, from animation to clothes designing, from set 
construction to payroll systems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hollywood is not the big studios. It's a collection of . . . independent 
producers who come together and actually make the film, project by project," 
says Michael Storper, a UCLA economist and expert on the industry's structure. 
"Very little filming is actually done by the big studios themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 This means that the large studios, for the foreseeable future, will play the 
essential role of anchors for the smaller producers and for the region's 
entertainment industry. They will provide financing, advertising and 
distribution for the network of small and mid-sized independents. Only powerful 
players like Katzenberg, Spielberg and Geffen could ever dream of challenging 
the hegemony of the majors in these absolutely critical functions. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California's stake in the continual and healthy development of this 
highly entrepreneurial Hollywood is enormous. Since World War II, the 
entertainment complex has grown into perhaps the single most critical industry 
in the region, an outcome made all the more significant by the headlong retreat 
of aerospace. Los Angeles County is home to 92% of the people directly or 
indirectly employed in the state's entertainment industry, which grew at a 10% 
to 12% clip from 1991-93. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the most recent estimates, the entertainment industry -- movies, 
television, video and commercial production -- contributes upward of $15 
billion to the region and employs, directly or indirectly, more than 300,000 
people in Southern California and accounts for about 7% of all non-governmental 
jobs in Los Angeles County. Equally important, the film industry is a primary 
source of high-paying jobs, with wages more than 40% above the statewide 
average and among the highest in the country. For example, this fall, starting 
pay for new animators at some studios exceeded that for newly hired 
business-school graduates at local companies. 
</P>
<P>
 In part, the entertainment business is thriving because the region is an ideal 
-- indeed, perhaps the only logical -- spawning ground for such ventures as 
that proposed by Katzenberg, Spielberg and Geffen. Even in this era of the 
much- hyped "virtual company," the importance of proximity, personal 
relationships and access to special skills in crafts-based industries such as 
entertainment remain critical to success. 
</P>
<P>
 These factors help explain why even as other industries have fled Southern 
California and as other states have tried to woo film and TV production away 
from the region, the industry's concentration here has remained -- even grown. 
Currently, about one of every two strictly film-related jobs in the country is 
in Southern California. That's more than four times the number of nearest-rival 
New York, 20 times that of Florida. Almost 90% of the members of the Screen 
Writers Guild live in Southern California. More than two-thirds of all dramatic 
series, situation comedies and feature films are produced here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people in the film business are organized on specific projects -- with a 
lot who free-lance -- and you can't do that in Orlando or Chicago," says 
Jonathan Katz, co-founder of two Hollywood firms, prop-maker Cinnabar and 
Berman-Katz, a specialty-marketing company. "We start a film on Friday and have 
a team on Monday. You have to have the resources available." 
</P>
<P>
 Accordingly, management challenges differ markedly from those usually 
discussed at business seminars. For starters, few managers seek to vertically 
integrate various elements into one consistent operation that can be repeated 
with little deviation. Instead, the basic challenge lies in harmonizing a 
highly temporary alliance of creative entities and individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor reinforcing the multiplication of smaller entities is the 
growing importance of ancillary entertainment products. Many craft-based 
companies in Hollywood have diversified beyond movies and television, reaping 
profits from commercials, the development of theme parks, music, multimedia and 
even the designing of entertainment-oriented shopping malls. The studio 
proposed by Katzenberg, Spielberg and Geffen would have this multifaceted focus 
from its beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 In launching their new studio, Katzenberg, Spielberg and Geffen may prove 
particularly well-suited to exploit the new realities emerging in the 
entertainment marketplace. By finding a more effective way of linking the 
creative and crafts professionals to financial, distribution and managerial 
muscle, they could launch a entertainment revolution important not only for 
Hollywood but for an economic audience around the world.

AFTER THE JUBILATION, ARISTIDE FACES HARD JOB OF GOVERNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Amy Wilentz, Amy Wilentz is the author of The Rainy Season: Haiti Since 
Duvalier (Simon & Schuster). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So long awaited, President Jean-Bertrand Aristide has returned to Haiti. The 
mood on the ground in Port-au-Prince is celebratory -- and apprehensive. The 
first question was: Will he even make it from the plane to the palace. One 
should never underestimate the capacity of Haiti's tiny but well-armed right 
wing for mayhem. 
</P>
<P>
 They have grenades: Do they have launchers? 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of practical question will be the sort of problem Aristide will face 
in almost every aspect of the one short year remaining in his term, while he 
attempts to govern a country as unaccustomed to governance as it is accustomed 
to oppression. 
</P>
<P>
 It was, for example, heartening to see U.S. troops clearing Lt. Gen. Raoul 
Cedras' people out of the various Haitian universities. All too often, as one 
regime follows another to power in Haiti, the employees of the past regime 
refuse to be dislodged -- a government paycheck in Haiti is a very big deal. In 
the past, this has led to violence in the ministries, as one group of agency 
people jostles the other. There are actually fistfights in the corridors over 
who gets what desk. 
</P>
<P>
 The ministries have been evacuated. Fine. But who, exactly, is Aristide going 
to fill them with? At the top of each, surely, will be a figure respectable 
enough to please Washington, but also of unassailable integrity. There are 
about six such people in Haiti -- and not all of them are palatable to the 
Haitian people. If, for example, Haitian technocrat Leslie Delatour, who was 
finance minister under one of the corrupt interim governments between 
Jean-Claude (Baby Doc) Duvalier and Aristide, regains his job -- as Washington 
would like -- there may be protest in the streets. That is, if the U.S. 
occupation permits demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Other similar "reconciliatory" appointments and gestures to the coup against 
Aristide will likely be greeted with palpable disgust by a people sickened by 
concessions to this class. But clearly, such concessions must be made if Haiti 
is to avoid a replay of the coup d'etat.  
</P>
<P>
 Aristide has little to build on by way of institutions. Haitian government has 
traditionally shown little interest in public service, and government has 
always stolen more than it has spent. The Public Works Department has 
occasionally picked up garbage -- if any of its few trucks are working and if 
someone happens to be around and in the mood to take one out. Otherwise, 
garbage is piled high around the city and then sometimes burned. The streets -- 
even main thoroughfares and boulevards and the national highway -- are in 
terrible disrepair. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no organized health care in Haiti, though there is, of course, a 
Health Ministry. There is one doctor for every 2,500 people outside the 
capital. Clinics are poorly stocked, poorly administered and run by either 
religious groups with scant resources or by a corrupt private sector, sometimes 
assisted by U.S. aid. The State University Hospital is a hideous joke -- in 
some wards, patients lie two to a bed. The bedclothes are bloodstained. 
Patients sometimes lie on the floor. Nurses evince an utter unconcern. Doctors 
show up to pick up their paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
 Haiti's greatest resource lies in its talented, creative, hard-working people. 
Health care will have to be a top priority. Already, Aristide is planning to 
work with doctors from the Haitian "diaspora" to ameliorate the situation. 
There are hundreds of these who might be attracted on a part-time basis. 
</P>
<P>
 The same goes for education. Again, no structures. Again, the intervention of 
religious groups and corrupt free-lancers. Again, the possibility that exiled 
Haitians will return to work for the future of their country. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere in Haiti is the lack of democratic institutions more obvious, or more 
important, than in the judicial system. In Port-au-Prince, there are perhaps 
four lawyers who are not corrupt -- au maximum! -- as Haitians like to say. 
Yet, the amnesty voted by the Haitian Parliament to resolve the crisis calls 
for fair and impartial trials of those who committed crimes during the past 
three years, as well as under other regimes. Perhaps, who knows, there may be 
some who would like to bring criminal charges against functionaries from 
Aristide's first seven months in office. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide, who is contemplating a Salvadoran-style Truth Commission to consider 
such cases, will also have to restock the judiciary with able, intelligent 
judges. Maybe he will select some under the age of 80 (all Haitian judges seem 
senile) -- and maybe he'll put an end to the odd, 18th-Century pillbox-style 
hats that make Haitian judges seem such figures of fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally important is reforming the provincial judiciary. Too often in the 
Haitian countryside the judge is in the pocket of local landholders. A peasant 
speaking Creole is unlikely to seek redress from a rich man's wrongs if he has 
to travel for a day to get to court, and knows he will be spoken to sharply in 
a French he can't understand, and sent home no better off and out of pocket the 
transportation. The rural judicial system must be decentralized and control of 
it placed more squarely with the communities it serves. 
</P>
<P>
 If Haitians continue to feel that they cannot seek institutional justice, then 
it is more than likely that the cycles of violence and retribution that have 
been so destructive will continue. Only when a Haitian can point to a criminal 
case and say, "That is decided once and for all," will Haiti move forward. 
</P>
<P>
 All this is just a part of what the Aristide Administration must set in motion 
during what little time it will have in power. Cooperation from the 
international community -- not just money, but also staff and advisers -- will 
be crucial to this process and important, too, in counterbalancing the untoward 
amount of influence the United States is likely to wield. 
</P>
<P>
 The next six months will be a severe test for Aristide. He needs to modulate 
with great sensitivity between his role as the people's prophet and harbinger 
of democracy and the less dramatic job of transition. Reconciliation must be a 
part of this difficult work. He needs to look to responsible and respected 
members of the economic elite -- there are a couple -- for advice and 
participation. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, the elite, too, must work for reconciliation. By now, they 
must have realized that brutal military dictatorships are no longer good for 
business. For a year, they're stuck with Aristide. He's not going to bite them 
-- or necklace them. He probably won't even get around to taxing them, as they 
so richly deserve to be taxed. It's time for everyone in Haiti to sit down 
calmly at the same table and see what can be achieved.

THE ANGRY MAJORITY; THE PUBLIC IS FED UP WITH WASHINGTON. BUT WILL THEIR 
DISCONTENT PUSH THEM TO DESTROY THE ESTABLISHMENT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Kevin Phillips, Kevin Phillips is the editor and publisher of American 
Political Report. His newest book is Arrogant Capital: Washington, Wall Street 
and the Frustration of American Politics (Little Brown).

<TEXT>
<P>
 Forget gridlock. The United States may be facing the greatest crisis of public 
confidence in its political parties and government since the 1890s -- or even 
the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
 And, ironically, radicalism may be more powerful in the suburbs than in the 
slums. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue is not whether Americans are angry with the federal government and 
Washington. Every survey says they are. The critical question is whether 
citizens are sullen in the sense of being disenchanted and giving up, or angry 
and almost pre-revolutionary, like the Massachusetts farmers, blacksmiths and 
tavern keepers who gathered at Lexington and Concord 219 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Some leaders in both parties hope voters will turn their attention overseas -- 
toward the troops in Haiti and the missiles targeted on Saddam Hussein in Iraq. 
But that's implausible, because foreign diversions -- with fiercely gesturing 
Presidents and aircraft carriers on the evening news -- are growing too 
familiar. It is far more likely that the two years leading up to the 1996 
presidential election could be remembered as the time when the public's 
dissatisfaction with Washington reached critical mass. 
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe it should be "radical" mass. In one recent survey, 61% of Americans 
said it's not enough to change the faces in Washington; we have to change the 
system. A majority now wants a third political party, and more than half say it 
might be better to have an independent as President rather than a Democrat or 
Republican. Four-to-one national majorities even want voters to make laws 
themselves -- through national referendums -- rather than leave matters to 
Congress and the President. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent emphasis on the same party controlling Congress and the presidency -- 
the capital Establishment's now-faltering thesis of gridlock -- is, at best, a 
half-truth from the same politicians and interest groups who are now, finally 
and belatedly, beginning to understand that the problem runs far deeper. What 
we are looking at is a three-pronged, three-decade failure of government, 
politics and leadership coming to a boil. 
</P>
<P>
 The failed or fumbled presidencies since the 1960s are the first part of the 
equation -- a depressing roster of assassinations, riots, soaring deficits, 
rising crime, failed wars, indicted and impeached officeholders, collapsing 
national trust in major institutions and scandals from Watergate and 
Iran-Contra to Whitewater. Rightly or wrongly, Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. 
Kennedy were the last Presidents to maintain real national esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 Those two served at the high-water mark of postwar U.S. power -- when the 
dollar was king of the global currency markets, not their periodic target, and 
when pipe-fitters in Parma, Ohio, made more than bank and factory managers in 
London and Frankfurt. This points to the second component of the threefold 
failure: Americans no longer believe in their leadership or in its bipartisan 
insistence on achieving an important recovery of the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters have become convinced in the last four to six years that the American 
dream is fading: blue-coller sons will no longer follow their fathers to 
well-paid factory jobs; giant corporations are sending jobs to Mexico and 
Thailand and pink slips and apologies to 55-year-old suburbanite managers who 
will never hold another job with a middle-class paycheck. Six or seven 
Presidents and a dozen Congresses in a row have offered hollow explanations and 
hollower economic promises. None have reversed the fear of the future that 
gnaws at American households. 
</P>
<P>
 And third, why should citizens trust Washington, from which three decades of 
lies and self-interested deceptions on all these issues have poured? This 
year's Gallup polls reveal only 19% of Americans trust Washington always or 
most of the time. Another poll reported, two to one, that the public believes 
Washington is controlled by special interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington is the principal interest-group bazaar of the Western World. The 
bigger it gets, the more bogged down it gets. By one count, greater Washington 
has a staggering 91,000 people engaged in lobbying or associated with lobbying 
activities. The number of lawyers admitted to the District of Columbia bar has 
soared from about 1,000 in 1950 to more than 60,000 today. The number of 
foreign interests represented in Washington has jumped from 400 in the late 
'70s to about 1,500 today. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet private-sector influence peddlers are only part of the capital's 
do-it-yourself paralysis kit. At least as much of the government's constipation 
comes from the city's massively inflated political and policy-making payrolls 
-- the 20,000 people on staff in Congress (up from 1,500 in the 1930s, and six 
times the size of the staff of any other legislative body in the world); the 
employees of a thousand think tanks, foundations, coalitions and centers, and 
about 15,000 journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington has become Watering Hole No. 1 for the political, policy-making and 
journalistic classes -- where these elites make two or three times the salaries 
they could make in Springfield, Ill. or Spokane, Wash. In fact, of America's 20 
counties with the highest per capita incomes in 1990, seven were in 
metropolitan Washington. It is not just an inbred enclave -- it's a rich, 
self-satisfied one. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1800 to 1932, Washington was a small or mid-sized city, small enough to 
be a parade ground for whatever political realignment rode in from the 
hinterlands. No more. That easygoing, transient Washington has been replaced by 
a Permanent Washington -- a fortress that turns aside waves of public opinion 
like a breakwater turns back the sea. Don't tell us, official Washington smirks 
at the electorate, we'll tell you. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1968, Richard M. Nixon began an era of GOP control of the White House that 
prevailed for 20 of the next 24 years -- but he couldn't beat the capital 
Establishment. Ultimately, he broke the law trying, and got impeached. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-four years later, Democrat Bill Clinton campaigned against Washington 
and its lobbyists. Then, after winning, he slowly gave up. Tuesday, he told an 
audience, "I showed up in Washington to work 20 months ago, and since then I 
have been bewildered at the resistance to change." 
</P>
<P>
 "Bewildered" isn't the right word -- and some clever politicians are beginning 
to sense Washington will be the next big issue in U.S. politics. Hillary Rodham 
Clinton and senior White House aides and Cabinet members have begun meeting 
outsiders to discuss the entrenched intransigence of Washington and the 
incipient failure of the two-party system. 
</P>
<P>
 The head of the National Policy Forum, an adjunct of the Republican National 
Committee, says their 63 public meetings across the country have defined "an 
abiding desire among the people for radical change -- a bloodless revolution -- 
in the way their government operates." One prospective Republican presidential 
candidate, former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, is calling for Congress to 
spend only six months a year in Washington, and advocates a "full-scale attack 
on the culture of the company town." 
</P>
<P>
 Former Gen. Colin L. Powell is considering running for President as an 
independent, cheered by polls suggesting the public is ready for one. Ross 
Perot now says he'll start a third party if the current two parties don't pan 
out in 1995-96. And Rep. Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) could well become the first 
Speaker of the House to be defeated in his home district since right after the 
Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
 More than any other people and nation, America and its political traditions 
were shaped by anger at entrenched elites. Thomas Jefferson said, for the new 
country to stay vital, it would need a revolution of sorts every generation. He 
must be stirring in his grave to hear the trumpets of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 If Republicans and Democrats understand that gridlock is yesterday's excuse 
and they are now in a race with potential independent candidates and third 
parties to make U.S. politics and government come alive again, then the genius 
of American politics can be restored.

IN KIDNAPING ISRAELI SOLDIER, HAMAS SHOWS A NEW SOPHISTICATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Yossi Melman, Yossi Melman, an Israeli journalist, is co-author of Friends 
in Deed: Inside the USA-Israel Alliance (Hyperion). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By kidnaping an Israeli soldier, Hamas held the Israeli-Palestinian peace 
talks hostage, undermined Yasser Arafat's authority and damaged the morale and 
pride of the Israeli military. Nonetheless, the Israeli government salvaged 
some pride, at least in the eyes of Israelis, by showing its determination to 
fight terrorism, though its high-risk rescue attempt tragically failed to free 
Cpl. Nachshon Waxman. In the operation on Friday, Waxman, three Hamas captors 
and one Israeli rescuer were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamas, whose military wing took responsibility for the operation, had managed 
within days to achieve several of its long-sought goals. Although the 
Palestinian fundamentalist movement had linked Waxman's freedom to the release 
of hundreds of Palestinian guerrillas -- including their spiritual and 
religious leader, Sheik Ahmed Yassin -- the Hamas' agenda was more 
far-reaching. Aside from sabotaging the peace talks, which aimed to extend 
Palestinian self-government beyond its limited authority in Jericho and the 
Gaza Strip, Hamas has poisoned the atmosphere between Israel and the Palestine 
Liberation Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The kidnaping of Waxman overshadowed Secretary of State Warren Christopher's 
visit to the region and his mission to narrow the gap between Israel and Syria. 
No less important, the drama deepened the distrust between Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Rabin and PLO Chairman Arafat at an especially sensitive time. Both 
leaders, along with Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, were named 
recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 What enabled Hamas to succeed where it had failed time and time again? The 
answer is a combination of timing and self-improvement. The kidnaping of the 
Israeli soldier was the second blow the organization had inflicted on Israel 
within 48 hours. Last Sunday, two gunmen, also members of Hamas' military wing, 
opened fire on a crowded and narrow street in a fashionable part of Jerusalem, 
killing two and injuring 15. These two incidents showed, as Israeli military 
and intelligence officers have acknowledged, that the military wing of Hamas 
has become an impressive, sophisticated and deadly guerrilla force. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamas, which in Arabic means "fervor," was formed by Sheik Yassin in late 1987 
or early 1988, about the same time the intifada began. Its founding charter 
contends that the soil of all Palestine is a wakr (Muslim holy property) that 
belongs to Muslims forever. To Hamas, there is no place for Israel as an 
independent state of the Jewish people. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hamas message also includes Muslim unity and enmity toward the West and 
modern Western culture. The mosques, religious schools, clinics and community 
centers that Israel's military administration helped to build during its 27 
years of occupation of Gaza and the West Bank became hotbeds of religious and 
political agitation, as well as centers for the recruitment and military 
training of Hamas members. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Hamas secretly formed its military wing, known as Ez a-Din 
al-Kassam Brigades. It is named after a Syrian-Palestinian leader of the 1930s, 
whose ideology was a mixture of Muslim religiosity, Arab nationalism and the 
idea of jihad (holy war) against the British government, which ruled Palestine 
at the time, and Jewish Zionists during Israel's pre-statehood. Eventually, 
Kassam was killed in 1935, in a military clash with the British forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Mirroring their namesake, Ez a-Din al-Kassam Brigades declared jihad against 
Israel. After using knives and axes to indiscriminately kill Israeli civilians 
inside and outside the occupied territories, Hamas guerrillas embarked on a new 
campaign in December, 1992. Israeli soldiers, secret agents and Jewish settlers 
became the preferred targets. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Waxman, nine Israeli soldiers were kidnaped and murdered. Two of 
Israel's General Security Services agents were slain by their Palestinian 
informers. In these operations, members of the Hamas military wing disguised 
themselves as Israelis, occasionally even pretending to be Orthodox Jews, and 
used stolen cars with Israeli license plates to lure their intended victims, 
some of whom were hitchhiking. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Israeli intelligence has occasionally succeeded in planting informers, 
exposing its secret cells, arresting its members and killing some of its 
commanders in armed clashes, Hamas has become far more difficult to control. 
"The Ez a-Din al-Kassam Brigades," admits a senior Israeli intelligence 
operative, "maintain a highly secretive structure which is difficult to 
penetrate. They minimize contacts between the various units and use special 
couriers with coded messages for communication, which is hard to intercept. 
Their cadre is very disciplined and committed to their cause. They are ready to 
die for it." 
</P>
<P>
 It is estimated that the brigades have no more than a dozen active members. 
But the hard-core enjoys strong support from a large segment of the population, 
especially in Gaza. The Hamas also has offices in Jordan, Syria, Sudan, Lebanon 
and Iran, which has become a major source of financial support. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli intelligence believes that Dr. Mussa Abu Marzuk, who studied 
engineering in the United States and now shuttles between Syria and Jordan, is 
the political leader of Hamas. To a certain extent, his authority also covers 
the activities of Hamas' military wing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hamas' improved military capability was clearly evident in how it handled 
the Waxman kidnaping. The corporal was abducted in the heart of Israel. His 
abductors managed to smuggle him to the Jerusalem area and place him in a 
shelter apparently prepared in advance. From there, they succeeded in smuggling 
the videos showing the captive soldier to Gaza in an attempt to mislead 
Israel's security forces. 
</P>
<P>
 The tragic ending of the Waxman kidnaping may well add to the movement's 
prestige in the eyes of many Palestinians as the only force that dares to fight 
Israel and save Palestinian honor. While Arafat emerges from the crisis as a 
weak and hesitant leader, Israel holds him responsible for his lack of 
willingness to tackle Hamas terrorism, though he ordered the arrest of hundreds 
of Hamas sympathizers in Gaza in a vain attempt to find the kidnaped Israeli 
soldier. Hamas, on the other hand, portrayed Arafat as a traitor to the 
Palestinian cause, someone who has no power to stand up to Israeli pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 It is expected that Israel will soon try to take its revenge against Hamas. 
Israel will also continue its pressure on Arafat to handle extremists and 
fundamentalists among his people. Yet, most Israeli Cabinet ministers know that 
they have no other serious alternative but to continue to deal with Arafat, as 
well as to speed up talks with Jordan and Syria. "Only peace," said several 
Israeli ministers, "can uproot terrorism and Hamas violence."

AFTER A RUN OF GOOD LUCK, IT'S TIME TO DISCUSS U.S. FOREIGN POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gaddis Smith, Gaddis Smith, a diplomatic historian, is director of the Yale 
Center for International and Area Studies.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Bill Clinton has enjoyed a run of good luck in foreign policy. The 
unexpected death of Kim Il Sung helped avert, for the moment, a crisis over 
North Korea's nuclear- weapons program. Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, new resident of 
Panama, stepped down instead of taunting the United States into a bloody 
invasion of Haiti. And Saddam Hussein of Iraq made Clinton's day with 
provocative military deployment to the border of Kuwait followed by withdrawal 
in the face of the U.S. response. If you listen closely, you can hear the sound 
of hands rubbing in satisfaction in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 But each of those affairs could have unfolded far differently and may pose 
dangerous choices in the future. All leave unresolved issues that have not been 
adequately debated within the United States or internationally. 
</P>
<P>
 The easing of a confrontation with North Korea hides the lack of consensus 
among major powers on nuclear non-proliferation. The non-combat character of 
the intervention in Haiti saved Clinton from a collision with Congress over the 
perennial issue of presidential war-making power. Had he launched a hot 
invasion of Haiti without congressional approval, Clinton would have defied the 
Constitution, turned foreign policy into a bitterly partisan issue and weakened 
the nation's capacity to act responsibly in international affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Iraq's troop movements reveal the dangerous instability in the oil 
region of the Middle East and the diminished willingness of the permanent 
members of the U.N. Security Council to work together. 
</P>
<P>
 On these three issues there is no cause for rejoicing, only for short-term 
relief. More important, and more distressing, is the absence since the end of 
the Cold War of a fundamental re-examination of the goals and capacities of the 
United States against which these specific issues and others -- such as the 
continuing war in Bosnia, genocide in Rwanda, and the unratified General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -- can be judged. It is not acceptable to say 
the world has become such a confusing place that each issue can be dealt with 
only in isolation and when circumstances force a response. 
</P>
<P>
 There is always a tendency in government to be content to get through each day 
without disaster or to limit forward thinking to the date of the next election. 
This habit is ingrained, but it is still a dereliction of responsibility by 
Congress and the Administration. The convening of the new Congress in January, 
1995, would be an opportune time, long overdue, for searching hearings and 
broad public discussion. One would hope that the current abatement of a crisis 
atmosphere would still prevail -- but even if there is a new headline hot spot, 
the discussions should proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 These hearings should demand that witnesses from the Administration, the 
private sector and academia focus on conditions likely to prevail in the world 
25 years from now if different courses of action or inaction are pursued by the 
United States and other nations and institutions internationally. The hearings 
should also require that the connections among separate issues be illuminated 
-- between regional and global security; between human rights and sovereign 
rights of governments; between free trade and the maintenance of economic 
autonomy; between national interests unilaterally pursued and the future of the 
United Nations, and always between alternative visions of how the United States 
should act. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been comparable searching debates in the past -- for example, over 
resistance to German and Japanese aggression in 1939-1941, and over the 
reconstruction of Europe and the containment of the Soviet Union in the early 
years of the Cold War. Those debates forced people to look ahead and 
contemplate the consequences of action or inaction. They elevated foreign 
policy above squabbling over partisan advantage. They produced fundamental 
thinking and clarified alternatives. They educated American leaders, because 
nothing produces more learning than the necessity of explaining complex issues 
to others. 
</P>
<P>
 Skeptics will dismiss this proposal as naive and predict that such hearings, 
if held, would waste precious time, produce banal generalizations or would 
degenerate into a non-constructive struggle for domestic political advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Skeptics could also note that Clinton and his top advisers have shown no taste 
for more than the most superficial review of foreign policy and the President 
himself too often acts as if he wanted no part of foreign policy; that 
congressional leaders have been inert on the Democratic side and negative on 
the Republican; that the media devote infinitely more time to a celebrity on 
trial for murder than to all international issues combined, and that many 
Americans seem to be drifting into an implicit isolationism. 
</P>
<P>
 True. And all the more reason to demand the kind of sustained discussion on 
which to base an effective foreign policy with comprehensive goals and a 
national commitment to supply the means required to pursue them. 
</P>
<P>
 Countless individual writers and symposiums sponsored by universities and 
think tanks have addressed the nature of the post-Cold War world, but the 
efforts have been disconnected from the real world of governing -- of 
committing lives and treasure, of setting priorities, of educating legislators 
and the public. 
</P>
<P>
 There is, of course, no guarantee that a broad national debate will lead to a 
coherent understanding of the issues before the country. But the absence of 
debate will guarantee incoherence, the continuation of stumbling improvisation 
both by the Administration and Congress, media infatuation with trivia and 
public responses to events shaped more by images of the moment than an 
understanding of how a changing world affects the national and human interest.

LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW; DEVAL PATRICK; THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT'S LEADING 
CIVIL RIGHTS ADVOCATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GAYLE POLLARD TERRY, Gayle Pollard Terry is an editorial writer for The 
Times, based in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration is bullish on civil rights. This Justice Department 
aggressively champions voting rights in several oddly shaped congressional 
districts, which sent black members to the most integrated Congress in the 
nation's history. The U. S. Supreme Court is likely to take up challenges to 
the alleged racial gerrymandering in North Carolina, Texas, Louisiana, Florida 
and Georgia. In this battle, the President sides with minorities. Unlike his 
predecessors, Clinton wants the districts to remain intact "to ensure that the 
Constitution has meaning for minority voters." His advocacy proves that civil 
rights is a priority for this Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 In an even more formal reversal of the racial policies advocated by the Reagan 
and Bush Administrations, the Clinton Justice Department is arguing in favor of 
an appeal in a New Jersey affirmative action case supporting the right of a 
school district to retain a black teacher while firing an equally qualified 
white with identical seniority. The Bush Administration supported the white 
teacher, and won the case in the lower courts. The Clinton Justice Department 
switched sides, and will argue on behalf of the local school board, which had a 
voluntary affirmative action plan and chose to consider race when downsizing. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's tough point man on civil-rights is Deval L. Patrick, now ensconced 
in the spacious office that once belonged to J. Edgar Hoover. Racial 
discrimination is not theoretical to Patrick, 38, who grew up in a poor, black 
neighborhood on Chicago's South Side. Scholarships allowed him to prep at 
Milton Academy, and complete undergraduate and law studies at Harvard 
University. After graduation, he worked briefly in Los Angeles, while clerking 
for Judge Stephen R. Reinhardt, then for the NAACP Legal Defense and 
Educational Fund, a rite of passage for many civil-rights lawyers, before 
joining a prestigious Boston law firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick wasn't Clinton's first choice for the job of assistant attorney 
general for civil rights, which leads the federal fight against discrimination 
in housing, schools, lending, jobs and at the voting booth. That honor went to 
C. Lani Guinier, a law professor whose nomination was torpedoed by conservative 
challenges to her writings. After that political debacle and a long delay, 
Patrick got the nod for the important sub-Cabinet post, one of six Justice 
Department divisions, which employs 500 lawyers and staff, has an annual budget 
of $55 million and argues roughly 300 court cases annually. Patrick, who plans 
to use his job as a bully pulpit, lives with his wife, Diane, a labor and 
employment attorney, and their two daughters in Washington. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Question: What's at stake in the redistricting cases in Georgia, Texas, North 
Carolina and Louisiana?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: The two most important things to remember and appreciate about those 
cases are: . . . . One, the notion that these districts are bizarre shapes 
makes no sense when you take a look at congressional districts across the 
country and realize that there is no such thing as a regular or normal shape. 
The other is the misnomer that these are districts where voters are segregated 
by race, when, in fact, they are the most integrated congressional districts in 
the country and are responsible for the most integrated Congress in history. 
</P>
<P>
 What's at stake is the ability of voters in places where the politics are 
already racially polarized to be able to participate meaningfully in the 
process and elect candidates of their choice -- which is a right under the 
Voting Rights Act. If that concept is limited by a decision of the Supreme 
Court in the upcoming cases that does not take account of those real 
circumstances and those real challenges and the history of the jurisdictions 
where these districts have been used, then we will have lost a lot of ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why isn't this gerrymandering?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The way you ask the question indicates the common view gerrymandering is 
bad. Gerrymandering is traditional. Gerrymandering is done for a whole variety 
of reasons -- some of which the court has said are explicitly appropriate. 
First of all, district lines have to be drawn for congressional races. The 
Constitution and federal law requires congressional districts for congressional 
races. And, the district lines are often drawn to protect incumbents or because 
of geography, because the river goes in a certain way, or because the 
neighborhoods are different communities of interest, and a whole variety of 
factors. Race, by the way, is also a traditional consideration . . . . It has 
not always been used in ways that benefited or respected the strength of the 
minority vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why are these cases so important 30 years after the Voting Rights Act 
passed? Why is progress taking so long?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Progress is significant in many of these places. The districts themselves 
represent a kind of progress. The districts are not appropriate everywhere, and 
it's not about whether minority voters can only be adequately represented by 
minority office holders. I don't accept that, and I don't think experience 
bears that out every place. The point to remember is that these districts are 
being litigated in places where the politics is already racially polarized, and 
where, in the absence of these districts, it would be impossible for the 
minority voter to have his or her interests represented adequately in the seat 
of power. That is the kind of situation the Voting Rights Act speaks to. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Explain the Piscataway case.  
</P>
<P>
 A: It's a case where the school district had to make a judgment about whom to 
let go in a situation where declining school enrollments required that they let 
one teacher go. The first thing they did was consider seniority and they looked 
to the most junior members of the business faculty and concluded there were two 
of absolutely equal seniority, with the least seniority. They started on the 
same day. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they considered their performance for the years they had worked there, 
and they concluded that, based on their performance evaluations, they were 
absolutely equal in competence in the classroom. Then they considered their 
qualifications. They looked at the training and so forth, and they concluded 
that they were absolutely equal in terms of their basic qualifications for the 
job . . . . Then the school board decided, if you look at it from the point of 
view of two people who were totally equal, we can do one of two things: We can 
flip a coin, or we can consider, using our affirmative action plan, whether or 
how the decision will affect the diversity of the faculty. They expressed their 
interest in diversity by retaining the one minority teacher that they had ever 
had on that faculty. Fortunately, the white teacher was rehired the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The significance of the case is two-fold. First, there is nothing in any case 
that holds that what Piscataway did violated federal statutes. I take a great 
deal of pause from the notion that the previous Administration would attack the 
Piscataway School Board for something that was not, in fact, a violation of 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, this was a voluntary plan that the local school district used to 
express its own interest in what was important. To the extent that can be done 
within the law, and considering the fact that many, many private employers have 
plans as restrained as this one, it is an important case for us to adjust our 
position. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is it fair for the white teacher to lose her job? Would it be fairer to 
flip a coin?  
</P>
<P>
 A: No. First of all, I don't think this is about what you or I or someone 
outside the Piscataway School District thinks is right. It's about whether 
Piscataway is entitled, under the law, to express its interest in what is 
important . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The second thing is Piscataway was faced with a very, very difficult decision, 
a decision very unlike most decisions that employers have to make. Most of the 
time, in reality, employers are able to make distinctions between people on the 
things that matter. But yes, I think that it is appropriate for Piscataway to 
think about giving some rationale to its decision and to prefer that over a 
flip of the coin. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is affirmative action on the decline?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Affirmative action has limitations in terms of both where it can be used 
under the law and where it should be used. Affirmative action should be used in 
limited and restrained kinds of circumstances, but it still has an important 
benefit in the eyes of many employers. And that's something we ought to be able 
to support. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you mean by limited and restrained circumstances?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It's important to make the distinction between affirmative action and 
quotas . . . . A numbers game is not appropriate, and serves few legitimate 
interests . . . . Affirmative action is a more flexible, more comprehensive 
kind of inquiry that focuses first and foremost on quality, and then considers 
diversity in that context. That is not only a useful tool for employers, but a 
tool that many, many private employers all over the country are using in order 
to integrate their work forces. That's a goal we should also support. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Were Americans more optimistic about civil rights 30 years ago when we 
sang, "We Shall Overcome"? There was a feeling then that this would become one 
nation, living in harmony. Has that hope been replaced by pessimism or 
cynicism?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Not in my life or soul. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Thirty years ago, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said that he hoped his 
children would be judged by the content of their character, not the color of 
their skin. Has that day come?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We are closer today than we ever have been before, but it's clear, I think, 
to anybody who lives with their eyes open that we have a ways to go. There is 
no shame in not having reached that goal, in my view. The shame is in not 
continuing to strive for that goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: A younger generation of African Americans, those 35 and under, are more 
likely now to embrace separatism. Are you familiar with this trend?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I'm familiar with a couple of polls I've read that indicate that African 
Americans are tired of reaching out and feel less hopeful, in some groups and 
some settings, of the dream that you referred to a moment ago from Dr. King. 
There are a variety of reasons for that, that stem from frustrations that many 
of us feel about the lack of progress we've experienced in recent history, and 
the extent to which we've moved away as a nation from an appreciation of that 
link I spoke of a moment ago between civil rights and American aspirations 
overall. But I think we can try to turn that around. That's probably the most 
important legacy I can leave from my term in this job. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is the legacy of the Reagan/Bush era on civil rights?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Many protections were eroded, and worse than that, the faith in and respect 
of some of those protections were eroded. We are seeing in this country a 
breakdown of a sense of the link between the aspirations of civil rights and 
the aspirations of our highest national ideals. It's important for us to try, 
in the time we have, to restore some of that link. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Have you ever been a victim of discrimination?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Sure. I can remember times in boarding school when you couldn't go off the 
campus without the local police stopping you and asking you what you were doing 
in the neighborhood. I can remember going to the local MacDonalds and being 
threatened by a crowd and called every manner of names when I was at Harvard. I 
can remember what we used to call "drive-by insults" -- when people would 
cruise by, slow down, open the window and hurl out names that cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Even today. I wear a jacket and tie to work. If I wear a pair of jeans over 
the weekend and go into a nice store, I can pretty much be assured of being 
followed and treated suspiciously. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not a daily diet for me like it is for some young men and young women in 
different circumstances than the rarefied ones I live in . . . . We are still 
at a point in this country, not everywhere, but we are still in places in our 
national evolution where we are unable to see the person behind the skin. We 
will make progress past that. We have made progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: There's a perception that class inoculates against discrimination, that 
affluent, accomplished African-Americans don't experience discrimination.  
</P>
<P>
 A: That's wrong. There are scores of cases right here in the division to 
refute it, and I have my own experiences to refute it. In the housing context 
alone, I know many, many accomplished minority professionals who think twice 
about accepting new professional opportunities in a new place because they just 
don't want to deal with the hassle of finding some place to live. So it is 
wrong to assume that class insulates anyone from anything that is civil-rights 
related. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Has race declined in significance?  
</P>
<P>
 A: In many, many quarters it has. It would be equally wrong to suggest that we 
have made no progress from when the real Civil Rights revolution began in the 
late 1950s. We have made enormous progress. The fact that I'm sitting here is a 
kind of progress; that you're sitting here is undeniable progress. Does that 
mean that we have come as far as we need to go or as we can go? Of course not.*

CAMPUS CORRESPONDENCE; HOW RACE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN TEACHING 
AFRICAN-AMERICAN STUDIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE D. HARRIS, Leslie D. Harris is a junior majoring in journalism at 
Howard University. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The protest of African-American students at California State University, 
Northridge, over the hiring of a white instructor -- the only one -- in the 
school's Pan-African Studies department is yet another example of how issues 
can be reduced to race. In this case, though, the racial lines being drawn are 
particularly instructive. 
</P>
<P>
 Katherine Komis is probably qualified for the job of teaching introductory 
English. After all, she was not hired to teach African history. Still, I doubt 
she will be as effective as an African-American teacher would be teaching 
English in the department. 
</P>
<P>
 As scholar Sabrina Hope King once put it: " . . . teaching African-American 
students successfully requires more than merely mastering subject matter; it 
also consists of engaging students in reflections about the status quo, which 
in this country has often served to oppress African-American people." 
</P>
<P>
 Accordingly, black instructors in African studies can establish a special 
rapport with their black students simply because teacher and pupil, both being 
black, share certain experiences. And those common experiences partly shape 
their approaches to teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, some would turn this argument around, saying that only whites should 
teach English or British literature. But that would miss the point. 
</P>
<P>
 Whites have not been grossly misinformed about themselves. Their experiences 
have been favorably represented in history books. They have not been flagrantly 
stereotyped by the media. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not true for African-Americans. For too long, we have been made to 
feel that our history is unimportant. Most of what we know about ourselves and 
our contributions to the world is misleading, if not downright false. 
</P>
<P>
 We are living in a time when racism, and the stereotypes it fosters and 
reinforces, are more subtle and dangerous than ever before. So it is 
understandable why black students, ever conscious of racial discrimination and 
their negative media images, would have difficulty accepting a white professor 
in a Pan-African Studies department. 
</P>
<P>
 In the December issue of the Chronicle of Higher Education, black students at 
Iowa State University accused Christie Farnham Pope, a white professor teaching 
black history, of dismissing Afrocentric views without discussion. Similar 
controversies have occurred at Weber and Portland state universities. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, not all white teachers are biased, but, I know from my experience 
in a predominantly white school system that I was done a great injustice. 
</P>
<P>
 When I was in high school in Marietta, Ga., I always sensed a distance between 
me and my white teachers. I had to work extra hard to prove myself to them and 
to my white classmates. I was rarely given personal encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of this, I chose to attend Howard University, a black college. I 
correctly assumed that its professors would be more interested in my progress. 
Indeed, many go out of their way to prepare me and other black students for 
careers. And I have been blessed with black teachers of black studies who are 
free from ingrained biases and stereotypes. As a result, I have not been 
misinformed about my history. 
</P>
<P>
 A professor's ability to effectively teach African studies involves more than 
mastering the material, as important as that is. It is also aided by having a 
special relationship to the subject matter. That is, having lived a part of it. 
</P>
<P>
 It takes more than qualifications to teach in a Pan-African Studies 
department. It takes a special gift that not everyone possesses.*

MARK FUHRMAN

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re O.J. Simpson case: My sister was murdered last year. Her case, in the midst 
of so many other unresolved homicides in Los Angeles, was shuffled between 
various detectives with limited time and experience to offer.It wasn't until my 
sister's case was given to Detective Mark Fuhrman that I saw any real progress 
or interest taken. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only did he express sincere empathy toward me and my family over the loss, 
but he's put forth the groundwork and effort needed to conduct a more solid 
investigation. My calls never go unreturned and as a Latin American who is 
sensitive to prejudice, I never once detected that Fuhrman manifested an 
offensive attitude or comments. 
</P>
<P>
 I wonder how many citizens actually understand the mental pressures of working 
in crime-infested areas and the tragedies witnessed. I can only imagine that 
the ability to maintain a balanced vision would be continually challenging.

L.A. SUBWAY CONSTRUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "MTA Chief Ousts Head of Subway Construction," Oct. 12: 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin White's decision to confront directly the key issues underlying many 
of the problems plaguing the Metro Rail construction program -- namely, 
management and accountability -- is to be commended. A change of leadership and 
restructuring of the entire project team are probably the only course that will 
restore public confidence that this critical project will be completed on time, 
at reasonable cost and with complete safety for the public. 
</P>
<P>
 There is nothing more important to Southern California than an efficient 
regional transportation system. Unfortunately it appears that politics has 
skewed our perspective on the original Metro Rail vision. It's time to allow 
White to exercise the skills and expertise for which he was hired -- unfettered 
by well-meaning second-guessers, or those pursuing a personal agenda. Maybe 
then we can win back the federal financing without which this project will be 
impossible, and restore the luster to what should be a shining symbol of 
progress in our city. 
</P>
<P>
 FELICIA BRAGG 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 * The action of the Federal Transit Administration to suspend federal funding 
for the Metro Rail program, while serious, should be viewed in the proper 
perspective (Oct. 6). First, it is important to recognize what the FTA action 
is not. It is not in any way a repudiation of the Los Angeles subway project. 
The relationship between the MTA and FTA is not adversarial -- it is a 
partnership. FTA Administrator Gordon Linton took great care in his press 
conference to emphasize the agency's continued support for the Metro Rail 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 Linton also stressed that he expects that this will not be a protracted 
situation. Indeed, the two primary requirements set down by Linton -- cessation 
of tunneling on the Hollywood line until a full analysis and detailed plans for 
safe construction procedures are in place, and a revised management plan for 
Red Line construction -- are actions that the MTA was already pursuing.  
</P>
<P>
 As the senior California member on the House Appropriations Committee, I have 
a responsibility to make the case to my colleagues that the Red Line is a 
project worthy of federal investment. More importantly, I have an overriding 
duty to my constituents and all Los Angelenos to ensure that this system is 
built safely and in a fiscally responsible manner. 
</P>
<P>
 Only by aggressively addressing the real deficiencies of the MTA organization 
and the construction practices of its contractors can we address the growing 
public perception that all is not right with this project. To the extent that 
the FTA action imbues this process with urgency, the MTA, its board, and 
supporters of the subway should view this as an opportunity to move 
expeditiously to regain the federal government's and the public's confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 REP. JULIAN C. DIXON 
</P>
<P>
 D-Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 * Honors to The Times for your expose of the subway tunnel debacle. Yes, the 
contractor should reimburse the MTA for the savings realized with the cheaper 
wood braces. And the engineers who OKd the braces should have their licenses 
suspended. 
</P>
<P>
 KENT WILLIAMS

</P>
<P>
 * Re "The Broom Must Sweep Clean," editorial, Oct. 13: The Times should take 
great satisfaction now that the broom has swept away the best construction 
manager in the nation, a man of great integrity and skill, and now you cry for 
the abolition of what you call a quasi-independent subsidiary of the MTA.  
</P>
<P>
 The Rail Construction Corp. is a committee made up of MTA board members and a 
group of volunteer business people with a wealth of experience that have 
recommended sound business practices for the actions taken by the MTA. All 
decisions were made at the MTA board. The staff are all MTA employees reporting 
directly to Franklin E. White, as did Ed McSpedon. 
</P>
<P>
 This is structured as a very convenient scapegoat since McSpedon was never 
given the personnel required by the federal government for the management of 
this project, or for management control over great areas of his responsibility, 
even though the RCC board has been requesting these management changes for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 If Hollywood and this city want a world-class transportation system that will 
bring people to share its glory, then they are going to have to suffer a little 
inconvenience. The Times has elected to ignore all the awards and positive 
investigative reports that would let the public know what McSpedon and a 
dedicated staff have accomplished for this city and has chosen to focus on only 
the problem areas that are part of every major public works project. 
</P>
<P>
 If just one voice, with a vision, would tell the public what a great system is 
being built in this city, then there is the possibility of saving this program. 
I am grateful that as a private citizen I can speak out without any fear of 
what a newspaper can do to me. 
</P>
<P>
 I told the staff that there is light at the end of the tunnel; you just can't 
see it because the tunnel is out of alignment.

PESTICIDE WAR CEASE-FIRE; EPA AGREEMENT COULD OPEN DOOR TO KEY LEGISLATIVE 
REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Congress passed it 36 years ago, the Delaney clause of the Food, Drug and 
Cosmetic Act seemed a good way to protect foods from carcinogens. It imposed a 
very strict standard, prohibiting in processed foods even the smallest trace of 
any pesticide believed to cause cancer, no matter how tiny the risk. 
</P>
<P>
 But today the law is outdated. It fails to address possible nerve damage and 
reproductive disorders caused by pesticides, imposes an impossibly strict 
standard on carcinogens and does not affect fresh foods. And it applies 
differently when it comes to food additives and colorings. Clearly the federal 
patchwork of food safety laws needs a thorough updating and overhaul. However, 
bills to do that have been frozen in Congress because it has been impossible 
for environmental groups to compromise with the agricultural and chemical 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
 We now have reason to unclog the logjam. Last Wednesday the Environmental 
Protection Agency reached agreement with the Natural Resources Defense Council 
and unions representing farm workers to enforce a strict interpretation of 
Delaney, using zero risk rather an "negligible" risk. That could affect up to 
85 pesticides, probably banning 36 chemicals within two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement allows for the orderly phasing out of the most toxic pesticides, 
and further testing of others. No massive disruption of farming or food 
supplies is expected. 
</P>
<P>
 This offers a valuable pause in the pesticide wars. Rep. Henry A. Waxman 
(D-Los Angeles) has proposed eliminating the Delaney clause in exchange for a 
single health standard for pesticides, food additives and colorings. A 
competing industry bill would also terminate Delaney but would balance the 
health risks of pesticides against their economic benefits in crop yields. 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, all sides agree that last week's EPA action may finally 
precipitate action in Congress. We are not now taking sides on the question. 
But when the new Congress convenes in January, it should resolve this overdue 
issue, using the latest medical, scientific and economic data.

CALIFORNIANS IN CONGRESS SHOW THEY CAN PLY THE SAME COURSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 J obs is the four-letter word finally bringing together the traditionally 
fractious California delegation in Congress. A sagging state economy and 
stubbornly high unemployment are prodding the politically polarized members to 
work together more. 
</P>
<P>
 California long held the unenviable reputation for having one of the least 
effective delegations on Capitol Hill. That improved during the 103rd Congress. 
The improvement is worth noting. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's most populous state deserves more than it's getting from 
Washington. The California congressional delegation is the largest on Capitol 
Hill. The two senators, Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, both Democrats, and 
52 members of the House represent more than 10% of the Congress, and enough 
votes to make or break a bill on a close call. That muscle must be exercised 
more because of a pervasive ABC -- Anywhere but California -- mentality in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 But the California clout is rarely flexed because the delegation's Republicans 
and Democrats represent what are in essence three distinct regions -- North, 
South and Central California -- as well as a coastal/inland split. They find 
little they can agree on. Such gaping geographical, and philosophical, 
differences are hard to put aside. However, many members of the delegation 
discovered that they could find common ground when California's economic 
interests were at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 The delegation's disunity cost California such job-generating federal projects 
as the National Earthquake Center, which went, incredibly, to Buffalo, N.Y.; 
and the $11-billion superconducting super collider, which went to Dallas. 
Although funding was eventually terminated for that project, it remains a prime 
example of how the Texas delegation traditionally works in concert to bring 
home the bacon.  
</P>
<P>
 The California delegation got a boost with the creation of the nonpartisan 
California Institute for Federal Policy Research, a Washington-based think tank 
that monitors issues of interest to California, and encourages bipartisan 
cooperation. The delegation, led by the deans, Reps. Don Edwards (D-San Jose) 
and Carlos Moorhead (R-Glendale), finally met as a bipartisan group in 
Washington in February, 1993 when Gov. Wilson came to the nation's capital. 
Clearly, the mood was changing. 
</P>
<P>
 Putting California first finally became an urgent priority for the entire 
delegation after the Northridge earthquake last Jan. 17. In what is easily the 
best example of bipartisan unity and teamwork, the California congressional 
delegation worked to get Congress to approve an $8.6-billion supplemental 
appropriations bill to provide desperately needed earthquake assistance.  
</P>
<P>
 The 54 votes provided by the California delegation wasn't the only advantage 
the state had in Washington during the quake crisis. The congressional 
delegation also boasted some of the most powerful and influential members of 
Congress. Californians are chairs or ranking minority members of nearly 30 key 
committees and subcommittees. Julian Dixon (D-L.A.), a chairman of the powerful 
Appropriations Committee, delivered. So did Jerry Lewis, of Redlands, the 
ranking Republican on the House Appropriations subcommittee that allocates 
funds to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the key source of federal 
help in the immediate aftermath of any national disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 The bipartisan teamwork on earthquake relief also included plenty of 
cooperation among the members of Congress whose districts were hardest hit by 
the temblor. Veterans Anthony C. Beilenson, (D-Woodland Hills), a senior member 
of the House rules committee; Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), one of the 
best strategists in Washington; Henry A. Waxman (D-L.A.), a powerful 
subcommittee chair, and freshmen Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) and Howard P. 
(Buck) McKeon (R-Santa Clarita) put aside philosophical differences to help 
their constituents who suffered from an earthquake that respected no political 
boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 A majority of Democrats and Republicans in the House even found some common 
ground on immigration, the most controversial issue in the state. A majority of 
the delegation supported a bill to reimburse California and other states for 
the cost of incarcerating illegal immigrants convicted of felonies. California 
received $33.4 million, a down payment on the federal obligation to states 
impacted by high rates of illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Helping to mitigate the effects of defense-industry downsizing was another 
issue on which Democrats and Republicans could agree. Two freshmen, Reps. Steve 
Horn (R-Long Beach) and Jane Harman (D-Rolling Hills) teamed up to save the 
C-17, a huge cargo plane used to transport troops and tanks. During their 
successful effort, they managed to get conservative Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden 
Grove) and liberal Maxine Waters (D-L.A.) on the same side of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 When the 104th Congress comes to Washington in January, the California 
delegation may have a friend in the White House in Leon Panetta, President 
Clinton's chief of staff, who once represented Monterey County. Panetta can't 
bend over backward to help his home state, but he does provide priceless access 
to the White House. Access alone, however, won't mean much unless all 
Californians in Congress work together more consistently.

GANG RUNS INTO TOUGH FOE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A court injunction against violent gang members in a crime-saturated Norwalk 
neighborhood seems to be getting favorable results without running roughshod 
over constitutional guarantees. For now that means residents -- who as recently 
as two months ago were terrorized by assaults, armed robberies and even 
firebombings -- can walk down the street in peace. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Los Angeles County district attorney's office, the Norwalk 
sheriff's office used to receive as many as 15 calls a day from the 20-block 
area around Orange Street. Since the injunction was issued in August, 
authorities have logged about eight complaints a week there. None have been 
gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials attribute the success to the court action, which targets 22 members 
of a local street gang with 19 restrictions -- among them curfews and 
prohibitions against carrying potential weapons such as baseball bats and 
crowbars. Violations bring swift justice including up to six months in jail and 
$1,000 fines. 
</P>
<P>
 Those kind of results may prompt some gang-weary local officials to try to 
slap an injunction on every suspected gang member they can find. But they 
should think carefully before rushing off to court in search of a cure-all. 
</P>
<P>
 Anything that restricts freedom of movement and association has the potential 
to be abused. That's why we believe such bans should be very limited in their 
scope. That means keeping the focus on small geographical areas, and targeting 
small groups of troublemakers or repeat offenders already well known to police 
and community residents.

 I would like to respond to Amy Wu's Campus Correspondence, "Is Youthful 
Idealism Dead in the '90s?" (Opinion, Oct. 2). She seems to have given up on 
herself and her peers to make positive change in this country. I disagree with 
her ideas that our generation is out for money and that we have no desire to 
make positive change. I am a 23-year-old who is taking part in President 
Clinton's AmeriCorps year of service, in a branch called VISTA (Volunteers in 
Service to America). This program would be beneficial to Wu and her peers who 
have a negative attitude because they would see the truth that there are many 
of us out there, from this generation, working to make positive change in 
communities throughout this country. 
</P>
<P>
 These programs have a contagious, positive, cyclical effect on the community. 
Participants inspire each other to dedicate their lives to community service. 
It is these participants who give faith back to the community, that someone 
cares about their welfare. It is this community that decides that positive 
change can and will occur with hard work. And it is this positive change, 
achieved, that leads to a brighter future for all of us. 
</P>
<P>
 Wu and her fellow students are at a time in their lives -- college -- where 
they should be dreaming of what could be, not dwelling on a future of misguided 
intentions. This freedom to dream should be enough to inspire them to dedicate 
themselves to at least one year of service, if not the rest of their lives. 
This generation is out there, waiting for their support with open arms.

PERSPECTIVE ON AMERICA'S IMAGE; SSSSSH! THE WORLD IS LISTENING; OUR PUBLIC 
WRANGLING ABOUT LOUSY GOVERNMENT AND LAME POLICIES IS FREE SPEECH WITH A HEAVY 
COST IN HOW OTHERS SIZE US UP.

 Some years ago, a media survey asked Israelis how they interpreted the sexy, 
lavish soap opera, "Dallas." Their responses varied most significantly 
according to where they were from and how long they had been in Israel. Recent 
immigrants from outside Western Europe believed that the show described the 
life of ordinary Americans. Only those who had lived in Israel for some time or 
who had immigrated from the West recognized that the constant violence and 
infidelities might be something other than a documentary, perhaps romantic 
fiction or even metaphor. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past two years, American politics have been "Dallased" for the rest 
of the world. Foreigners are taking what they see and hear literally. When 
Americans say their government is hopelessly gridlocked and run by moral 
pygmies and idiots, foreigners believe us. We should know. Shouldn't we? 
</P>
<P>
 Americans know better, but for a number of reasons choose to conduct their 
public debate in apocalyptic and increasingly nasty terms. The result misleads 
our enemies, and that is dangerous. Such a government, they conclude, couldn't 
possibly act forcefully in Haiti (or Kuwait, or North Korea). They are wrong. 
But they are tempted. 
</P>
<P>
 Most dangerous of all, Americans may have begun to misunderstand their own 
political rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
 Three reasons peculiar to the nature of democracy in America explain why 
foreigners have so much difficulty understanding our public debate: the aquifer 
problem, the immanent history problem and the policy laboratory problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreigners aren't used to hearing every problem presented in its most 
threatening form. Example: American environmentalists, knowing how hard it is 
to win remedial action through many layers of government, are tempted to 
present the least evidence of pollution in a few lakes in a handful of northern 
states as well-advanced, terminal and irreversible contamination of the 
aquifers of the entire North American continent, with spillover into the polar 
icecap and grave implications for global warming. Their opponents show no more 
restraint. They answer: There is not a trace of evidence that pollution has 
occurred, and if it had, it would not be dangerous and could best be handled by 
private enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans speak as if they believe that history occurs to act out their 
personal principles. Any deviations must be the work of traitors, or those 
familiar pygmies and idiots. Judging from their public speech, Americans make 
no allowance for the tyranny of circumstances, for the legitimate and 
conflicting needs and desires of others, or for accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans of all political views also argue about the most enduring and 
upsetting human problems as if they were white-coated technicians cooking up 
tasty little pellets -- incentives or penalties -- for a menagerie of 
laboratory rats. This is, after all, the country that invented the term public 
administration, as if good management by "policy wonks" could be substituted 
for politics, with its clashing ambitions and ideals, its sinfulness, loss and 
occasional wisdom. 
</P>
<P>
 Freed from the discipline of the Cold War, Americans have begun to conduct 
their domestic political debate as if no one else were listening. During the 
past year, the Republican Party brought Congress to a halt and staked its 
mid-term election hopes on a policy of calculated obstructionism. "Wear the 
(obstructionist) label as a badge of honor," one conservative spinmaster 
advised. During the same period, Democratic candidates have done all they can 
to distance themselves from their activist President. Candidates from both 
parties routinely run against Washington, as if it were not part of the country 
and themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreigners can be forgiven if they take it all literally: the exaggerations, 
the accusations of betrayal and criminality, the charges of stupidity and 
corruption. Given the current level of what passes for debate, it's small 
wonder that they see domestic weakness and irresolution instead of the clumsy 
working of the separation of powers in a huge country without strong political 
parties. If the United States were the country described in its own public 
debate, we would not be assisting Haiti, defending Kuwait, winning a nuclear 
stand-down in Korea and brokering peace in the Middle East.  
</P>
<P>
 Foreign governments usually base their actions on their assessment of costs 
and benefits. It would be tragic if by losing ourselves in our vehemence and 
folly at home, Americans encouraged aggressors and dictators to believe they 
can flout international law and ignore American power.

SUPERSTORES, NARROWED CHOICES; BOOKS: HIGH-VOLUME OUTLETS ARE CRUSHING THE 
TRADITIONAL BOOKSELLERS WHO OFFERED US NEW IDEAS AND IDIOMS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On a quiet evening in Westwood Village, four customers are gathered around the 
checkout in Waldenbooks, but they are not buying books. They are watching a 
video of Mel Brooks' "The Producers." This isn't going to do anything for the 
store's sales figures or its bookish reputation, but it hardly matters, because 
the branch reportedly will be gone in a few months. 
</P>
<P>
 If that happens, it will be Westwood's second bookstore death this year. 
Butler & Gabriel, which specialized in fiction, closed in August after losing a 
discounting war with UCLA's campus store. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, these two dealerships are just the latest in a chain of closures in 
Westwood that includes Hunter's, Campbell's and Westwood Books, all victims in 
a literary oasis that is slowly becoming a desert. 
</P>
<P>
 Westwood is not alone. Hunter's in Pasadena has closed, and the Old Pasadena 
Bookstore, and Eric Chaim Klein in Santa Monica, and Book of Wonders in Beverly 
Hills, and Blue Moon near the Beverly Center, and Jack Roth on West Olympic 
Boulevard, and Book Castle in Burbank, and Chatterton's in Los Feliz and Fowler 
Brothers on West 7th Street. Other stores said to be in trouble include Big & 
Tall, the literary coffee shop on Beverly Boulevard now closed for remodeling. 
</P>
<P>
 The appearance that bookshops are failing is contradicted, however, by a study 
published last month by Dun & Bradstreet and G.A. Wright, a retail consultant 
based in Denver, which suggests that bookstores are thriving, increasing their 
sales and taking on staff. It also finds that bookstores have one of the lowest 
closure rates of any retailer. Independent research by the American Booksellers 
Assn. confirms this view. 
</P>
<P>
 The study does not allow for local anomalies such as Southern California's 
recession, but even here, the data doesn't suggest that bookstores are at risk. 
The two losses in Westwood, for example, will be more than replaced by the 
arrival of Borders, a subsidiary of K-Mart that has taken over a derelict mall 
south of Wilshire Boulevard, and by Barnes & Noble, which is opening a huge 
outlet at the intersection of Westwood and Santa Monica Boulevards. The focus 
of bookselling may move half a mile from the sleepy environs of UCLA, but the 
result will be a statistical gain. 
</P>
<P>
 The discrepancy between the results of the survey and what booksellers report 
is important because it marks a difference of perception. While the industry as 
a whole welcomes change and replacement as a sign of health, individual 
booksellers feel beaten down by changes being forced upon them. Small 
generalists cannot compete with giant infiltrators that mainline on the 
bestsellers list, buy in volume and discount on price. In order to survive, the 
independents are being forced to become niche marketers. 
</P>
<P>
 This development has a special poignancy. The small generalist bookstore is a 
symbol of our open society. It represents independence and self-reliance. It is 
sustained by a liberal consensus that sees a moral value, and not just a 
utilitarian value, in the diversity of information and ideas. When it collapses 
or gets transformed by commercial pressure into a specialist store, it reminds 
us of the fragility of that consensus and the endangering of choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Chain bookstores endanger choice as an operational necessity. Group purchasing 
prevents them from selecting stock with the same sensitivity as local stores 
that buy on their own. Profit maximization prevents them from supporting books 
or areas of interest that may not sell well but expose readers to new ideas. 
Corporatism prevents them from expressing any kind of passion (whose passion 
would a Barnes & Noble store manager represent?) or taking risks or engaging 
with their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Superstores may be better equipped to offer dynamic service and be more 
sensitive to market trends but their methods are inappropriate to the values 
that book retailing stands for. The effect of superstores on clothes-buying, 
for example, is that options become categorized and everything we wear becomes 
more or less an example of a uniform. The effect on books is likely to be the 
same. This is disturbing if what we read gives rise to what we think. 
</P>
<P>
 The effect of this is to alter the symbolic function of the bookstore. Today 
when we think of bookselling, we think not of informed browsers and 
intellectual curiosity but of Muzak and malls and the culture of calculation. 
The bookstore no longer stands for any kind of cultural mission but for the 
primacy of business. Its well-stocked shelves no longer invite but induce. The 
aim is to sell, not to challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 The new bookstore also teaches us that our purchasing decisions are merely the 
expression of probability and public trends. It isn't just that the extent of 
our reading -- the scope of our thoughts -- is predetermined by marketing 
directors a thousand miles away; it's that when we enter the bookstore we give 
up our claim to individuality, and that we find this acceptable -- or don't 
even notice. The promise of the bookstore used to be that it led us to books 
that elevated us; in a mass market, its underlying effect is to diminish us.

AT THE CORE OF THE MTA PROBLEM: A SPRAWLING, IN-FIGHTING BUREAUCRACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Morris Newman and Jay Stark, Morris Newman, an architecture and urban

Report. Jay Stark, an urban planner, is editor of Metro Investment Report and 
The Planning Report.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The freezing of $1.6 billion in federal rail money because of faulty Red Line 
construction is terribly humiliating for the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority. It is also a caning administered to Southern California and its 
officials, most notably Mayor Richard Riordan, who should now realize that they 
can no longer ignore the enormous organizational problems that have made the 
MTA the least credible public agency in the region. What had been the prize of 
Los Angeles -- the nation's largest public-works project -- has turned into a 
public embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
 While Franklin E. White, the MTA chief executive, rightly fired Edward 
McSpedon, head of the Rail Construction Corporation, the quasi-independent unit 
in charge of Metro Rail construction, neither the public nor the federal 
government should be satisfied with scapegoating. The latest series of 
construction defects are not isolated glitches, as White has suggested. When 
parts of Hollywood Boulevard began to sink -- as a result of using plywood and 
plaster instead of steel and high-strength concrete in the subway construction 
-- it seemed a perfect metaphor for the collapse of the MTA bureaucracy itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The obvious question is how could this mammoth public agency, with an annual 
budget of $3 billion and a staff of nearly 10,000 people, show such apparent 
negligence on its most crucial project -- even after it was stung by previous 
press revelations of poor construction in its underground tunnels? 
</P>
<P>
 In the midst of all the finger-pointing and recrimination, the true villain is 
the bureaucratic structure of the MTA itself. The agency is simply too large, 
too Balkanized and its parts too isolated to yield good results. Even before 
the first public-relations disaster spawned by press reports, in December, 
1993, of defective tunnel work, many MTA observers worried that the agency's 
Byzantine internal politics would be its downfall. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency is still reconciling the marriage of its two former constituents -- 
the rail-oriented Los Angeles County Transportation Commission and the business 
oriented Southern California Rapid Transit District. The new structure, with 
its politicized, tit-for-tat division of responsibilities among former managers 
of the rival agencies, has hurt morale and weakened a sense of purpose among 
staff. It has also fostered open power struggles within the agency, which 
resulted in a six-month delay on White's proposal to dissolve the 
quasi-independent RCC in favor of a construction committee directly accountable 
to top management. 
</P>
<P>
 To understand the MTA's organizational problems, it is instructive to examine 
the long chain of command from the agency's top management on down to the 
workers in the tunnel. At the top are White and the MTA board, who make broad 
decisions on policy, projects and goals. Next is the MTA staff. Then the RCC, 
which is a kind of "general contractor" hiring other contractors and enforcing 
cost controls and deadlines. To do the RCC's work, a team of outside 
contractors act as engineers and general-construction managers for the job. 
They, in turn, hire subcontractors, such as Shea-Kiewit-Kenny, the tunnel 
excavators now facing most of the blame for substandard work. 
</P>
<P>
 Accountability and quality control have clearly failed under this 
loose-limbed, far-flung structure. The situation recalls a story in the Talmud: 
A man was so rich and had so many ranks of servants that he was kidnaped and 
held for ransom by his own employees -- because they had never seen him and 
didn't know who he was. 
</P>
<P>
 The most important new player in MTA politics is Jerry B. Baxter, a 34-year 
Caltrans veteran, who will likely take responsibility for the reorganization of 
the MTA's construction company. The latest in a long line of MTA saviors, 
Baxter will seek to build accountability into the construction program, to ween 
the agency away from outside contractors and create a direct line of command to 
the MTA director and board. 
</P>
<P>
 Restoring credibility to the MTA cannot take place behind closed doors, 
however. Baxter should not be encouraged to become yet another 
behind-the-scenes player. Instead, he must present his reorganization plan to 
the public, the federal government and the MTA board in a timely and open 
manner. His experience in managing thousands of employees on vast 
freeway-construction jobs augurs well for his potential to bring oversight 
management and quality control back within the MTA -- rather than delegating 
those responsibilities to its contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it may seem odd to argue for strengthening White's hand at a time 
when his credibility is at a low ebb, the the director should have more control 
over construction. In addition, bureaucratic layers should be eliminated and 
the chain of command shrunk. A good start would be the elimination of the RCC, 
as White has recommended. 
</P>
<P>
 Another idea would be to limit the role of the outside contractor to 
construction -- not engineering or day-to-day inspection. Caltrans, the state's 
highway-building agency, also uses outside contractors, but engineers its own 
projects and oversees construction quality directly through its own staff, who 
stand side-by-side with construction workers in the field. Although Caltrans 
does not perform the job of a contractor, such as supervising workmen or 
scheduling constructions, it does take responsibility for correct construction 
"specs" and cost containment. This does not guarantee a goof-free outcome, but 
it would make 1.5 miles of shoddy work -- the size of the latest MTA black eye 
-- much harder to hide. In other words, it's time to deflate the mystique of 
the outside "expert," and rely on in-house experts who are answerable to nobody 
but the public. 
</P>
<P>
 An important player in MTA politics who has remained silent on the 
mismanagement of construction activity is Riordan. As an MTA board member who 
controls four votes, the champion of business-style management has the chance 
-- and the clout -- to show some leadership in restoring federal funding for 
Metro Rail. 
</P>
<P>
 It's unfortunate that it takes a $1.6-billion embarrassment for the MTA and 
its elected officials on the board to demand accountability for construction 
and oversight management of the Metro Rail. Restoring public confidence and 
federal funding should be the agency's top priority. Otherwise, MTA officials 
could find themselves playing cameo roles in a Christopher commission-style 
inquiry, and end up burying their super agency along with their subways 
tunnels.

FOOD FROM THE 'HOOD STARTS FRESH AFTER THEFT; CRENSHAW HIGH STUDENTS LOST THEIR 
COMPUTERS BUT COME OUT AHEAD WITH $13,000 IN DONATIONS 
</P>

 Crenshaw High School students once again are savoring the success of their 
Food From the 'Hood salad dressing business after thieves gave them their first 
sour taste of reality two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 About $8,000 worth of computer equipment, most of it donated, was stolen Oct. 
5 from the company office on campus. But with the help of political and 
corporate allies, the students were back to business last week.  
</P>
<P>
 The students and their business consultant quickly put out the word that they 
had been hit, and in less than 48 hours donations not only paid for the damage 
but put them over the top with a total of $13,000. 
</P>
<P>
 They also got a sleek new Food From the 'Hood van, a donation they had been 
anticipating but whose timing gave them a boost. 
</P>
<P>
 "It turned out pretty good," said biology teacher Tammy Bird, who conceived 
Food From the 'Hood last year and works closely with students. "Actually, we 
came out on top overall." 
</P>
<P>
 The fledgling company, which has been expanding rapidly and now distributes 
its product nationwide, lost nearly all of its communications equipment in the 
theft: two hard drives, two keyboards, a printer, monitor, fax machine, 
camcorder and computer mouses. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came in the next morning, I knew something was wrong because I didn't 
see the computers from across the room," said senior Ben Osborne. "I thought, 
'Uh-oh, something's not right here.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Jaynell Grayson just couldn't believe her eyes. "I thought (business 
consultant) Melinda McMullen had taken the computers out for some reason," she 
said. "Then I saw the glass broken and it was, like, I was in shock." 
</P>
<P>
 McMullen said that after advising local news media of the theft, she got an 
immediate response from 8th District Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who called 
to say he would do "everything within his power" to replace the lost items. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days after the break-in, Ridley-Thomas presented the student owners of the 
salad dressing business with an $8,000 check from the ticket broker company 
TicketMaster, whose officials also were on hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took one phone call," said Ridley-Thomas, who has supported the Crenshaw 
student project from its inception with funds and service donations. "They 
(TicketMaster) had heard of the incident and recognized the importance of 
helping these young entrepreneurs. Food From the 'Hood is an exemplary program. 
Even though they experienced losses, good can triumph." 
</P>
<P>
 The check was just the start. One individual who heard about the theft brought 
in a new fax machine to the office; another called from Long Beach to say that 
another fax machine was waiting to be picked up by students, with his 
compliments, at a local Staples office supply store.  
</P>
<P>
 The icing on the cake came from Nissan. At its annual employees' luncheon in 
Carson last week, officials presented Food From the 'Hood owners with another 
unexpected check, this time for $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The money was in addition to Nissan's gift of a Quest minivan custom-painted 
with the colorful "Food From the 'Hood" logo on its sides, something that had 
already been in the works. The van the group had been using to transport its 
product to farmers markets and local stores was on loan from RLA and due back 
in December.  
</P>
<P>
 "This group just embodies everything we want to support -- entrepreneurship, 
self-development," said Nissan spokesman Don Spetner. "It's a great 
organization. They deserved it." 
</P>
<P>
 McMullen, shouting over the sound of drilling as school district workers 
installed an alarm system last week, said she and the students have been 
working nonstop to reload data lost in the theft -- which was everything. 
Students have been helping McMullen go through shipping receipts and financial 
records to input information into the new and upgraded computers, which they 
lost no time in buying. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't re-create everything, but we're trying," she said. "We're getting 
there."

CENTER COUNSELS KOREANS ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE; FAMILIES: ALMOST 70% OF 
FACILITY'S SESSIONS DEAL WITH ISSUES SUCH AS SPOUSAL ABUSE. CULTURAL NORMS THAT 
DICTATE SEXUAL INEQUALITY CREATE BARRIERS TO CHANGE.

 In a tiny, sunlit office at the Korean American Family Service Center in 
mid-Wilshire, a young man sat with his head slightly bowed and his dark eyes 
slightly lowered behind glasses. As he faced Hae Soon Lee, a female domestic 
violence counselor, he spoke softly in Korean, a trace of embarrassment and 
shame lingering in his voice as he talked about turning violent toward his 
girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 "She came here when she was much younger than me, so she is much more 
Americanized than I am," said the 26-year-old Korean immigrant, who has been 
receiving counseling at the center for almost six months since being convicted 
of misdemeanor battery. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were planning to get married, and I was taught that the man is supposed to 
plan everything," he continued. "But I had to discuss plans and finances with 
her, and that was difficult for me. It created tension and stress." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, who has been counseling partners in abusive relationships at the center 
for four years, added her own commentary as she interpreted her court-referred 
client's confessions. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Korean culture, women are supposed to be very submissive, and he expected 
his girlfriend to be this way," she said. "The bottom line is power and 
control, and one way in which he could control her was physical violence. But 
she is never going to be submissive, and he has to accept this." 
</P>
<P>
 For 11 years, the Korean American Family Service Center has offered family 
counseling to the Los Angeles Korean community. Almost 70% of the center's 
workload is related to domestic violence; the remainder covers many areas, 
including child abuse prevention and information, marriage and divorce 
counseling, and occasional classes in English, family law and parenting. It is 
the only agency offering domestic violence counseling to the Korean community, 
and one of the toughest challenges faced by its staff of seven Korean-speaking 
counselors is trying to reverse centuries-old cultural norms that emphasize 
sexual inequality -- and sometimes set the stage for violence at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Hyeseop Shin, who recently joined the center as executive director, said that 
about half of all domestic violence cases within the local Asian American 
community occur in Korean American households, although there are many other 
patriarchal Asian cultures in which women are expected to be submissive. 
</P>
<P>
 The primary reason for this, she said, is that the Korean community in Los 
Angeles is still relatively new, and most families in which wives suffer from 
domestic violence are first-generation immigrants who have not yet accustomed 
themselves to the fact that in the United States spousal abuse is a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many Chinese and Japanese people here are not immigrants, but second- or 
third-generation," Shin said. "However, a lot of Koreans still suffer from a 
lack of acculturation. Many Korean men do not know wife-beating is illegal 
here. So they think they can do anything they want with their wives." 
</P>
<P>
 Although all women and couples are accepted, most of the center's clients come 
from court referrals, Shin said. The couples are separated at first, with 
abusive husbands attending group therapy and abused wives receiving one-on-one 
counseling.  
</P>
<P>
 The men are taught how to control their anger and learn how to treat their 
wives with more respect, whereas women are given emotional support and informed 
of the choices available to them if counseling does not solve their problems, 
including restraining orders, shelters and divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 Shin said Korean women, especially those who are attached to old ways, often 
present a challenge to the counselors.  
</P>
<P>
 "We had an older couple come in who had been married for more than 20 years," 
she said. "This woman had been getting beaten for 20 years, and all this time 
she hadn't said anything because she thought it was part of normal marital 
interaction." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple is undergoing counseling, Shin said.  
</P>
<P>
 In much of Asian culture, divorce is looked upon as morally incorrect, and 
because many Korean immigrant women are financially dependent on their 
husbands, abused wives are often especially reluctant to leave their marriages. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the criticisms our agency faces from the Korean community is that we 
sometimes encourage divorce," Shin said. "It's something that conservative, 
patriarchal men say without knowing what these women have been through." 
</P>
<P>
 Shin is working on a plan to set up economic development and job training 
classes for women at the center so that battered wives will be better prepared 
financially to leave an abusive marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Once couples have completed their counseling, most do not come back a second 
time, Shin said. The shame of having lost face by being arrested in front of 
family or neighbors, along with the threat of getting caught again, combine to 
deter Korean men -- who generally wish to be law-abiding, she said -- from 
further aggression against their partners.  
</P>
<P>
 Or so she hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way of knowing whether the reason they don't come back is because 
they don't beat their wives anymore, or whether it's because they control their 
wives so well now they make sure they don't tell anybody," Shin said pensively. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to believe that it's because we're successful." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Hae Soon Lee's little office, the young man with the bowed head looked 
up slightly to face his counselor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm learning to compromise with my girlfriend," he told her. "So I can accept 
her as she is."

MOVIES; BETWEEN SWEET AND DEADLY; JOHN CUSACK'S MADE AN ACTING CAREER MOVING 
FROM GOOD GUYS TO RATS, MOVIES TO THEATER, COMEDY TO NOIR . IT MAKES HIM HARD 
TO PEG -- AND DON'T ASK HIM TO HELP YOU FIGURE IT OUT. 
</P>

<P>
 An acquaintance of John Cusack's from the Chicago theater scene, praising the 
28-year-old actor as "a very centered art ist" and "an extraordinarily talented 
young man," adds a caveat.  
</P>
<P>
 "Johnny," says the acquaintance, likes to mix it up a bit, and predicts Cusack 
will arrive for this interview "just slightly inappropriately dressed, just 
slightly unshaven. There's always that element of the pose. He's a really 
strong character, and the character he plays is Johnny Cusack." 
</P>
<P>
 No surprise, then, when Cusack ambles into his publicist's office in Westwood 
sporting museum-quality grunge wear and perhaps two days' stubble on his pale, 
expressive face. Unlike most movie actors, he's bigger than he appears on 
screen -- about 6-foot-2 -- and he moves with the rangy self-assurance of a 
basketball forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet no matter how amiable and fast-talking Cusack becomes once he is seated 
behind a table at a corner espresso bar, he remains ineluctably watchful. When 
asked, after a lengthy and informed disquisition about the film business, 
whether he is comfortable with his stature within it, he turns suddenly 
disingenuous. "I don't know what it is," he insists. When the question is put 
to him again, he just as suddenly answers with disarming candor. Score one for 
Johnny Cusack. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll bring a commitment to something that'll be designed to push a button in 
you," says Cameron Crowe, who directed Cusack in 1989's "Say Anything . . . . " 
"He'll be checking you out. He'll want to know about your commitment." 
</P>
<P>
 It's the same unsettling ambivalence -- the nice guy with the sharpened edge 
-- that Cusack has honed to great effect on screen: as the small-time con 
squeezed by a manipulative girlfriend and his mother in "The Grifters" (1990); 
as the nakedly ambitious junior politician betraying his best friend in "True 
Colors" (1991); as the indomitable kick-boxer who defrosts the class 
valedictorian in "Say Anything . . . , " and as the skirt-chasing collegiate 
dignified by love in Rob Reiner's "The Sure Thing," the 1985 movie that lifted 
Cusack, then only 17 and a student at Evanston Township High School outside 
Chicago, into the serious-actor leagues after appearing in the likes of 
"Sixteen Candles" and "Class." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The ease with which Cusack moves from light to dark, often in a single role, 
has endeared him to critics -- Roger Ebert anointed him "one of the best actors 
of his generation" -- and to thinking-man's directors like Crowe, Stephen 
Frears ("The Grifters"), John Sayles (1988's "Eight Men Out") and Woody Allen, 
who cast the dumbfounded Cu sack in a small but pivotal part in 1992's "Shadows 
and Fog." 
</P>
<P>
 "Some actors have a particular personality the audience likes," says Allen's 
casting director, Juliette Taylor. "John rides a certain line. People love to 
watch him -- he's cute and sweet -- but he can play dangerous. His persona 
isn't so identifiable that he's pegged with a certain personality. He has a big 
range." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, after last year's diffidently received "Money for Nothing," Cusack is 
back with two highly anticipated comedies: "The Road to Wellville," Alan 
Parker's adaptation of the T. Coraghessan Boyle novel, in which Cusack plays an 
embattled would-be corn-flake magnate, and the lead in Allen's "Bullets Over 
Broadway," which opens Friday, as a pompously idealistic playwright beset by 
gangsters, armchair socialists and an uninvited collaborator. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's my kind of actor," says the newly press-friendly Allen, who was 
impressed enough after "taking a chance" with Cusack on "Shadows and Fog" to 
cast him in the far more demanding "Bullets Over Broadway." Cusack, says the 
director, "is an attractive young man and athletic, so he's got good physical 
presence. But he's intelligent, and he projects that intelligence on screen. 
More important than anything, when he does a character he sounds like a real 
human being, not an actor doing lines." 
</P>
<P>
 Cusack pointedly approached both Allen projects with a workmanlike attitude. 
"I'm pretty pragmatic about how you need to work, and you can't really work 
with someone if you put them on a pedestal. I had to tell myself: There's 
obviously a reason I'm working for the guy. You can't think, either I'm worthy 
or I'm not. You just gotta go do it. Otherwise you start editing your 
instincts. So I saved that for before and after -- I was all freaked out." 
</P>
<P>
 Given Allen's minimalist directing style and willingness to let actors 
improvise, Cusack says, "You have this great, strange combination: the best 
script you've ever worked on, and a guy allowing you to do whatever you want. 
For a while, you don't take him at his word, and then you go, 'The guy said do 
what you want. I better start improvising a little bit.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Allen, clearly, was pleased. "If I'm having problems with a scene, he can use 
his ingenuity to correct it. I trust his improvisational ability. He stays with 
the character. It's never an artificial stretch or anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Famous for turning down putatively attractive roles -- he spurned offers to 
appear in "Indecent Proposal," "White Men Can't Jump" and "Sleeping With the 
Enemy" -- Cusack began guarding his resume after narrowly escaping being 
typecast as a genial teen. "I knew I wouldn't have longevity if I didn't make 
smart choices," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after Cusack portrayed White Sox third baseman Buck Weaver in "Eight Men 
Out" with the unimpeachably classy Sayles, Crowe had to fly to Chicago to 
convince the skeptical actor that "Say Anything . . . , " now regarded as one 
of his best performances, "wouldn't be a zany high school movie. When I hooked 
up with him, he didn't want to be the guy who carried the weight of charm on 
his back anymore," Crowe says. 
</P>
<P>
 Having proved his mettle with demanding dramatic material like "The Grifters," 
Cusack is edging back toward comedies. "I'm ready to be funny again," Crowe 
says Cusack told him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to do comedies because you're much lighter of spirit," Cusack says. 
"You spend all your days sort of having a nice distance on yourself and the 
human process. When I was doing 'The Grifters,' Anjelica (Huston) and I used to 
come off the set and have a tequila and go ' whoooo! ' because we spent all day 
being really nasty. We really freaked each other out." 
</P>
<P>
 A hit comedy could also provide Cusack, now closing in on his 30s, with the 
opportunity to establish himself as a leading man who can open a mainstream 
film. As for now, he admits, "There is a group of projects that I'm excluded 
from based on box-office viability.  
</P>
<P>
 "There was talk of my doing a movie with a big director. He really wanted me 
to do it and I would love to work with him. But I can understand pragmatically 
why a producer, who is putting up $40 million for a very serious film, says, 
'We gotta get somebody like Tom Hanks, Bruce Willis or Tom Cruise that can 
guarantee us some money on our investments.' (But) I'm doing some movies now 
that might be able to cross over, that are smart but also subversive and, 
maybe, commercial." 
</P>
<P>
 In July, Cusack signed on to co-star with Al Pacino in "City Hall," a thriller 
now in rehearsal in New York, and he will executive produce and star in "Grosse 
Point Blank," a dark comedy he co-wrote about a hit man attending his high 
school reunion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do think in the last couple of years he's changed into wanting to have the 
Tom Hanks mantle," says Crowe. "I don't think in a million years he'd want to 
be Tom Cruise. But Tom Hanks is pretty appealing to him." 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth of five siblings (older sister Joan was nominated for a best 
supporting actress Oscar for 1988's "Working Girl"), raised by an Emmy-winning 
documentary-filmmaker father, Richard, and educator mother, Nancy, Cusack was a 
reluctant student -- "every day I wasn't in high school was a day above water 
for me."  
</P>
<P>
 At age 9, he was performing with his brothers and sisters at Evanston's Piven 
Theatre Workshop, run by family friends Joyce and Byrne Piven. (Their son, 
actor Jeremy Piven, remains one of Cusack's close friends and appeared with him 
in "Say Anything . . . " and "The Grifters.") Along with his parents' 
left-leaning politics, Cusack would be profoundly influenced by the Pivens' 
teachings. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's so great about them is that, at a very early age, they teach you to 
guard your instincts," he says. "Like, what makes you your most interesting and 
successful, not only as an actor but as a person. It's your opinion, how you 
see the world. There's a great validation of each individual, that they should 
guard and harness and protect their instincts. Because that's all you've got, 
really." 
</P>
<P>
 Itching to get into movies, and noting that several were set to film in 
Chicago, Cusack corralled an audition and, at 16, was cast opposite Rob Lowe in 
"Class." Within three years he had appeared in eight films, although pearls 
such as Reiner's "The Sure Thing" were outnumbered by swinish teen drivel such 
as "One Crazy Summer." As his film career took off, Cusack maintained his 
Chicago roots, founding the New Criminals theater group, where he produced and 
directed raucous commedia dell'arte performances that included an 
interpretation of Hunter S. Thompson's "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd always wanted to get the Fishbone crowd into the theater," Cusack says. 
"And we did. We got a much younger demographic, the people who went to the 
clubs and bars." For one production, he handed out chainsaws to the cast as 
opening-night gifts; one actor used his to literally cut his way onstage. 
Cusack approved. "When it comes to theater, I'm an adrenaline junkie. I want an 
event that challenges my imagination and makes my heart race." 
</P>
<P>
 Cusack got both when he journeyed to Thompson's lair outside Aspen, Colo., to 
woo the fabled gonzo journalist into allowing the production of "Fear and 
Loathing." 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'Come on out -- we'll talk about the script if you have money. But 
on the weekend there will be games.' " Ten minutes into the visit, Thompson had 
Cusack and fellow New Criminals "chipping golf balls off his front porch and 
blowing them apart with shotguns with whiskey in our heads." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, at the Woody Creek tavern, a "big burly guy" impolitely asked Cusack 
what he was doing there. "And I said, 'What the (expletive) are you doing 
here?' I didn't quite know what was going on, but Hunter goes, 'You passed the 
test!' Which was lucky, because otherwise I might have gotten stomped." 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, Cusack has shifted his home base to Los Angeles, even though, 
he confesses, he still can't find his way around town. He's given up his 
Chicago digs and lives in a beachfront house in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a lot of friendships here," he says, "and a lot of my friends in 
Chicago theater want to come here. I would encourage them, too, because there 
are so many people getting well-paid who are sort of mediocre. Two or three 
moves through the hoop and they're getting millions." 
</P>
<P>
 Having noted that studios "aren't interested in making anything, for the most 
part, with ideas or substance," the star of "Hot Pursuit" wants to develop his 
own films. "It's sort of a selfish instinct -- I'm just trying to make stuff 
that I would be excited to work in. The worst thing is to wait around and be at 
the whim of directors and producers who want you to do their things, who might 
not have anything to say about your character but, since they're in a position 
of power, you've gotta work with them for six months. Why not just do it 
yourself?" 
</P>
<P>
 Along with "Grosse Point Blank," Cusack is developing a movie about the NFL 
for former Warner Bros. chief John Calley, now head of United Artists.  
</P>
<P>
 "I want to get into football's sort of punishment-ritual bone-crunching," 
Cusack says, his voice rising. "It's connected, I think, to the whole manifest 
destiny, the giving up of self for the good of the team, the preparing people 
for a bureaucratic company life. Somehow, it's a great tie-in to the American 
dream." 
</P>
<P>
 And so Cusack, himself a pretty good tie-in to the American dream, soldiers on 
-- even if, as one of his hometown associates points out, "There will never be 
anything that changes the fact that he is a white boy from a privileged suburb 
of Chicago, and he wants desperately not to be that." Still, with minimal 
compromises, he's nabbed a house on the beach, nuzzled Annette Bening 
on-screen, chucked a football between takes with Woody Allen, and begun to 
transform his table-pounding philosophies into movie scripts while maintaining 
the wardrobe and shaving schedule of a bass player. 
</P>
<P>
 "An actor," Cusack declares, "should be a punk in the best way. It should be a 
full-on expression of self, y'know? Only without the broken bottles."

ART; SLICK ART IS HIS BUSINESS; IN 1987, BRITON RICHARD WILSON FILLED A GALLERY 
WITH OIL, CREATING AN OPTICAL ILLUSION SO DISORIENTING -- AND POPULAR -- THAT 
HE DID IT AGAIN, AND AGAIN. 
</P>

 'Say you're sitting in a train at a platform that's due to pull out, the train 
next to you moves, and you think you're moving," says British artist Richard 
Wilson, the subject of an exhibition opening today at the Museum of 
Contemporary Art in conjunction with the UK/LA Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 "Suddenly you see the platform and realize you haven't moved. At that moment 
you've experienced a fault in the body mechanism between eye and brain, and 
you've been fooled. That's the experience you have in the oil room." 
</P>
<P>
 For those not plugged into the international avant-garde grapevine, "the oil 
room" is an installation Wilson first completed at Matt's Gallery in London in 
1987. The piece, actually titled "20:50," is on view at MOCA through Jan. 8; it 
has been re-created four times at locations around the globe and never fails to 
cause a ruckus. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how it works: Imagine a walled ramp extending into a room. The 
enclosing walls of the ramp are about shoulder height, and beyond the walls is 
a room completely filled with black oil -- about 700 gallons -- that creates an 
unbroken reflective surface. You, the viewer, are up to your neck in oil, but 
because of the reflection that surrounds you, you can't quite figure out where 
you are. The piece is so intensely disorienting that people often flail about 
and wind up smudging themselves with oil in an effort to get their bearings. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my most popular piece, probably because it's the most psychological 
-- in fact, there will be two on the planet when this one is completed," the 
40-year-old artist explains during an early morning meeting in a cafe in 
downtown L.A. (The other oil room is on view in London in the collection of 
advertising magnate Charles Saatchi). 
</P>
<P>
 "When you enter the room you don't see the work, because there's nothing to 
see -- you're simply looking at a room, or so you think. In fact, you're seeing 
a reflection, but it's not the kind of reflection we're used to seeing in 
mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
 "As you move into the room, the ramp rises and narrows in order to create the 
feeling of running out of space," he continues. "The ramp is all you have to 
keep from mentally falling into the reflection, and you reach a point where 
it's like Alice through the looking glass and you flop into another world. The 
slight raising of the ramp intensifies the feeling of disorientation because 
normally when you wade out into a liquid -- say, at the beach -- you go down 
and out into that expanse. This operates in reverse, and though you're aware 
something unusual is happening, your faculties aren't acute enough to know the 
floor sloped up. People sometimes suffer extreme vertigo in the piece." 
</P>
<P>
 Hearing about the oil room, one gets the impression that it's not unlike a 
spooky carnival attraction. Wilson, however, intends that his art do more than 
toy with people's equilibrium. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are two kinds of work: There's slap-shot work where you walk in and 
say, 'Wow!' You get one view of the thing and it's an incredible experience. 
Then there's work that unfolds slowly and experiencing it is a process of 
layers peeling back. I want both to happen in my work," he explains. 
</P>
<P>
 There are, indeed, subtle resonances to Wilson's work, but it's nonetheless 
firmly grounded in a Wow! school of art more identified with America than 
England. 
</P>
<P>
 British artist David Mach, Wilson's contemporary and friend, also makes 
insanely grandiose work that defies belief (say, a life-size artificial 
elephant hoisting a refrigerator with his trunk), but mostly Wilson's work is 
in a tradition of mind-boggling American Conceptual sculpture that stretches 
from Gordon Matta-Clark, Walter De Maria and James Turrell in the 1970s to 
current work by Chris Burden and Nancy Rubins. All of these artists deal in one 
way or another with issues of scale, perceptual phenomena and the sublime. 
However, unlike an artist like Turrell who creates sculpture out of light that 
has a palpable metaphysical presence, Wilson intends that his art remain firmly 
tethered to the real world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Metaphysics? Religion? Never touch the stuff," he says with a laugh. "I like 
the physicality of the work I make and don't see myself as a Conceptual artist, 
because the pieces I make are so incredibly physical. However, I suppose they 
are Conceptual in that they disappear and, like most Conceptual art, must rely 
on the written word for any kind of longer life." 
</P>
<P>
 An intense man who is cordial yet private in a way that is distinctly British, 
Wilson is amazingly animated considering that he's being interviewed at 7:30 in 
the morning after having just gotten off a plane from London. He lives there 
with his wife, Sylvia Ziranek, who is a performance artist, and their two 
children (Wilson's youngest child, a daughter, was born just five weeks ago). 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lived in the same place for 19 years in a building that's a bit like a 
lighthouse," he says, poking at a plate of eggs. "It was a condemned squat so I 
was able to buy it very cheaply, then I gutted it and rebuilt it. It's about 
two minutes from the Thames, where I have a big old wreck of a boat." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson was born in London in 1953, the second of five children. He recalls 
that "an interest in art was always encouraged." 
</P>
<P>
 "My father taught art and made art himself -- he made three-dimensional 
studies of the sea that combined sea patterns with a mathematical equation 
called Root Three he became interested in during World War II when he worked as 
a radar fixer. I suppose you could call what he does Conceptual art but for the 
fact that his pieces are traditional -- they're made of wood and paint. My 
father's father was a painter, and his father's family were tinkers who 
traveled the countryside making pots and pans. On my mother's side, I'm related 
to builders and watchmakers, so the family has a long history of skill in the 
fingertips. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a creative kid and was always having fads where I'd decide to do 
something, do it for a day, then get bored. I considered graphic design but 
found it too flat -- I wasn't using my hands enough. When I tried sculpture I 
immediately knew it was the perfect medium for me, and by the time I was 
getting out of my teens I was committed to a career in art." 
</P>
<P>
 A fter graduating from high school in 1970, Wilson attended the London College 
of Printmaking in 1970-71, then transferred to Hornsey College of Art, where he 
was to spend three years. He earned his master's degree in 1976 at Reading 
University, where he now teaches in the art department one day a week. "I don't 
know what I teach, but I certainly have good conversations -- I find it very 
stimulating," he says with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started out making fairly traditional sculptural objects and quickly 
noticed they worked best in certain spaces," Wilson says in explaining the 
evolution of his work. "I began building floors for pieces of work, and slowly 
the objects disappeared and the floors and walls became the central components 
of the work. Basically I was putting architecture in architecture, and I 
realized I needed to develop that idea as fully as I could. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the course of this evolution I was getting snippets of certain artists 
-- there was an interesting artist in New York in the mid-1970s named Billy 
Apple, for instance, who'd do things like wash a part of the gallery floor then 
exhibit the dirty rag he'd used. I saw Walter De Maria's 'Broken Kilometer' and 
heard about Gordon Matta-Clark. At that point, people were just starting to 
realize he was an important artist and he wasn't well-documented yet, so I was 
only able to collect bits of information about him. (Matta-Clark, who died of 
cancer in 1978, made sculpture out of abandoned or condemned buildings -- he 
would slice them in half, for example, or gouge chunks out of the roof.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I made my first installation in 1980, but prior to that I made impermanent 
pieces that had a quality of event -- I did a lot of explosion pieces, and I 
did Formalist things like make a perfectly finished plank, then snap it in 
half. I don't consciously design impermanence into the work, but it seems to be 
an unavoidable fact of life now. A milk bottle can become a Molotov cocktail in 
the wink of an eye, and everything we touch is constantly being adapted. 
</P>
<P>
 'My work is essentially about adapting architecture -- I object to the idea 
that buildings are these gods we're forbidden to act upon," says Wilson, who 
has had opportunities to collaborate with architects but turned them down. 
</P>
<P>
 "Architects, like artists, are very conditioned by what they're allowed to do, 
and we're ending up in a world that's completely enveloped in cotton wool," he 
says. "Why can't we adapt and change buildings? My interventions are quite 
sensitive to whatever interior situation I go into, and it's often the case 
that I enlist parts of the building to function as the fabric of the work. 
</P>
<P>
 "For instance, I did a piece in 1989 called 'She Came in Through the Bathroom 
Window,' where I cut a 26-by-7-foot window from the gallery and simply brought 
it into the room. I'm interested in the idea of taking information that's 
always at the periphery of our vision in a gallery -- say, the radiator -- and 
making it the center of attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's work of the early '80s was well-received in England. However, it 
wasn't until 1985 when writer Michael Newman wrote an article for Artforum 
about a work titled "Sheer Fluke" that Wilson began to receive wider 
recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1986 he was able to support himself with his work, and during the past 
eight years he has twice been nominated for England's prestigious Turner Prize. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been well-looked after by the British Council," he says. "I tend to be 
the other act -- I'm sort of the token wild, wacky artist, which is fine." 
</P>
<P>
 In light of the fact that Wilson's work has been critically acclaimed in 
Europe for nearly a decade, it is surprising to hear him say that the reason 
he's never shown in the United States before is because he's never been asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "The invitation from MOCA was the first U.S. offer I've received, although 
there's been a lot of interest," he says. "What's that guy's name in New York? 
(Art dealer Larry) Gagosian? His people have been writing, but I'm not sure I'm 
what they're looking for. Galleries need to make money now because we're in a 
recession, and I'm a risk in that respect, although I do guarantee audiences 
and I do sell work." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the MOCA show marks Wilson's U.S. debut as an artist, he has worked 
here before with Bow Gamelan, an improvisational trio he formed in 1983 with 
performance artist Anne Bean and percussionist Paul Burwell. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're like a road accident or a building site -- we're not entertainment but 
what we do draws a big crowd," he says. "We're interested in getting back to 
first principles of sound-making and we don't do songs -- we just hit it hard 
and keep going until everything breaks down. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Stomp" works with similar ideas in that they make music using everyday 
objects," he says, referring to the British percussion act, "but whereas they 
use things from around the house, we go to scrap yards -- we've used everything 
from big grain silos to enormous car axles. The lovely thing about inventing 
instruments is that no one can tell you how to play them, because they have no 
history." 
</P>
<P>
 Showing alongside "20:50" will be "Deep End," a new work conceived 
specifically for MOCA that Wilson describes as "a big risk, because I've built 
the thing over the fax machine with (MOCA installation designer) John Bowsher 
and (MOCA curator) Paul Schimmel. The central component of the piece is an 
upside-down pool, and I haven't even seen the pool they got yet -- I have 
visions of the scene in 'Spinal Tap' where they wind up with a 17-inch replica 
of Stonehenge for a stage set," he says with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 "I work in spaces intuitively, as opposed to mathematically, and can't really 
predict what's going to happen when I begin a piece. One doesn't have a clear 
idea of a piece then go make it -- it's more a case of feeling one's way 
through it. The museum told me they wanted an old work and a new work and that 
they wanted the oil, so I had to come up with a piece that deals with the same 
things without copying it. Illusion versus reality, a sense of vastness, the 
feeling of a moving out into an unstable space -- these are the things I was 
thinking about. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I flew into L.A. last year, I was knocked out by all the swimming pools 
I saw out the plane window and was struck by how sculptural they were in terms 
of shape," he continues in explaining the genesis of "Deep End." 
</P>
<P>
 "My work is generated to a large degree by the space where it will exist, but 
I also feed off the location, and for me L.A. has a sense of artificiality. 
Then there's this great hole in the ground which is MOCA -- it's as if 
someone's dug it out and put in an interior. So I started thinking about 
swimming pools and pool shells and a shell within another shell -- hopefully it 
will all add up to something. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, the oil is much less of a risk because this is the fifth time I've 
done it and at this point I feel I know it. However, there are dramatic 
differences in it every time I do it, and technically it's always a major job 
putting it in. The first oil room cost just over 1,000 (about $1,600 in today's 
dollars) to build, but when Saatchi installed his in 1990 it cost more than 
30,000 (about $48,000 today). He wanted it for a six-month run, but it's been 
there for 3 1/2 years -- he loves it. It had an expensive oil change last year, 
but basically it's self-cleaning -- if anything falls in, it's just pulled in. 
I get the oil from local refineries and use sump oil (used oil) because it's 
blacker and creates a more reflective surface than new oil would. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realize I'm in danger of becoming 'the guy who does the oil room' but I 
can't stop doing the piece, because I don't own it," says Wilson, who is also 
completing a permanent commission that opens in November in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an interesting situation -- Saatchi's permission is required to do the 
piece, and if he gives it then I must install it. He's never agreed to do it 
against my wishes, which is very kind of him, but he's always terribly happy if 
it's done. Prince Charles will be standing in it Nov. 2," Wilson adds, clearly 
amused at the idea, "because MOCA has been selected to be the site of the 
formal opening of the UK/LA Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone always wants to know how far down the oil goes," he says in parting, 
"and I always tell them it's as deep as you want it to be."

FILM COMMENT; PULP FRICTION; DIRECTOR QUENTIN TARANTINO'S MOVIES ARE BEST KNOW 
FOR THEIR WIT AND MAYHEM, BUT WHAT YOU DON'T HEAR ABOUT IS THEIR ORIGINAL TAKE 
ON RACE.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The recent opening of writer-director Quentin Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction" is a 
high point in a low age. Already slobbered over at Cannes and genuflected 
before by the New York press, it is, perhaps more than anything else, a 
continuation of Tarantino themes thus far missed and another startling 
aesthetic victory for a small, undeclared American film movement. 
</P>
<P>
 By looking full face into the ethnic quirks and racial complexities of our 
identity, "Pulp Fiction" addresses issues most effectively pushed into the 
ambiguity, humor and tragedy of art by such different works as "City of Hope," 
"Mississippi Masala," "One False Move," "Driving Miss Daisy" and "Six Degrees 
of Separation." In that respect, no matter his present focus on the underworld 
milieu, Tarantino is bringing a large and subtle talent to subjects that have 
eluded even the most consistently celebrated and publicized American directors 
of the last few decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarantino is deeply intrigued by the artistic challenges of the many 
miscegenations that shape the goulash of American culture and by how powerfully 
the influence of the Negro helps define even those whites who freely assert 
their racism. "Pulp Fiction" presents his most recent variations on Carl Jung's 
observation that white Americans walked, talked and laughed like Negroes and 
that the two figures appearing most often in their dreams were those of the 
black and the red American. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawing deftly imposing performances from an ensemble featuring John Travolta, 
Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman and Bruce Willis, Tarantino brilliantly twists 
his Jungian themes through the vehicles of cliched crime novel plots until they 
achieve revelations sometimes so stinging that new life is shocked onto the 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
 The human nuances and surprises in the writing provide fresh alterations of 
meaning as they render a grittier and ever experience in American film. Those 
more relaxed integration than we almost alterations reach far beyond the 
customary racial cliches that thud upon us frame by frame and the hostile or 
maudlin soapbox oratory that washed all possible eloquence out of dialogue. The 
viewing experience is familiar and foreign: We feel we've seen it and not seen 
it before. 
</P>
<P>
 The virtuosity of "Pulp Fiction" is the culmination of the self-taught 
31-year-old Tarantino's only previous works, "True Romance" and "Reservoir 
Dogs." In those first Tarantino screenplays, black people exist the way they do 
in the films of Martin Scorsese. They are at the edge of things, briefly 
stepping into view, sometimes important but most often all-purpose inspiration 
for obsessive racist comments. 
</P>
<P>
 Directed quite effectively by Tony Scott in the swiftly cut style, color and 
lighting of television commercials, "True Romance" clocks the adventures of 
Clarence and Alabama, a rock 'n' roll outlaw couple played with superior 
perception by Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette. It is at once an 
ingenious variation on "Hamlet" and a chase film that reaches for the energy of 
anarchic destruction that defined one aspect of American films between the 
chaos of Mack Sennett and the patriotic slaughter of World War II Hollywood. 
That bloody disorder within the dramatic American tale was stretched out even 
further with "Bonnie and Clyde," "The Wild Bunch," "The Godfather" and "The 
Godfather, Part II" and "Taxi Driver." 
</P>
<P>
 "True Romance" is informed by all of that but goes its own way. The 
twice-quoted "something is rotten in Denmark" means the dope world of casual 
sadism and murder. We see how the mistaken grabbing of a suitcase of drugs sets 
in motion a negative democracy of white trash, black street criminals, Italian 
gangsters, aspirant actors, potheads, Jewish film producers and law 
enforcement. That social sweep might have been introduced in the drug-dealing 
montage of stills "Superfly" used, but it has never reached the condition of 
art this film has. 
</P>
<P>
 One essential reason Tarantino succeeds where others bite the dust of 
exploitation is that he truly understands his crime world within the larger 
context of culture. Besides cocaine, there are also the deadening mass opiates 
of rock 'n' roll, junk food, the cartoonish gore of martial-arts movies and a 
set of comic-book conceptions of romance, valor and steadfastness that inspires 
the violence of Clarence and Alabama, who are either trying for nobility or 
loyally responding to danger with hysterical, self-defensive rage. 
</P>
<P>
 In Detroit, Clarence spends one night with the novice prostitute Alabama and 
marries her the next day. The film's central icon is Elvis Presley, the white 
man who most successfully and joyously "went native" by bringing black pop 
rhythms into adolescent mass America. Presley is Clarence's spiritual father. 
The ghost of the King appears and orders Clarence to avenge his new bride's 
honor by killing Drexl, her murdering white pimp. A venomous minstrel, Drexl 
thinks he is black, sort of a Motor City Mr. Kurtz, a modern version of "going 
native" the worst way. 
</P>
<P>
 In his dreadlocks, with his gold teeth, his scarred face, his strained, 
contemptuous black speech rhythms and falsetto punctuations, Gary Oldman's 
Drexl is much more frightening than his Dracula and inhabits an integrated 
world of criminality we won't enter again until "Pulp Fiction." At their 
showdown, Clarence tells Drexl before he kills him that his black street 
mannerisms aren't frightening, because they don't include anything that he 
hasn't already seen in "The Mack," a blaxploitation film with Max Julian and 
Richard Pryor. 
</P>
<P>
 When told by Clarence of his deed, Alabama weeps with pulp emotion because she 
considers the murder "so romantic." This Shakespearean idea that all the 
world's a stage is perhaps Tarantino's favorite theme. His people are executing 
roles drawn from mass media or personal contact, most of them miscegenations of 
style. 
</P>
<P>
 This theme is extended when a Sicilian American Mafia don uses torture in an 
attempt to find out where the newlyweds have run with the dope Clarence 
unintentionally took from Drexl's, thinking the suitcase contained Alabama's 
clothes. Christopher Walken is the don and Dennis Hopper is Clarence's father, 
a retired cop. The don explains that lies won't work, because Sicilians are 
"great liars -- the best" and that they can read untrue faces better than 
anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopper is then given lines that turn things around through one of the most 
startling monologues in cinematic history. It is perhaps his finest moment in 
film. Knowing that he can't withstand the torture, his character decides to 
make the don angry enough to kill him. He attempts this through the shrewd use 
of racial invective, informing the don that "Sicilians were spawned by 
niggers." The supposedly startled don smugly demurs. 
</P>
<P>
 The father, a former alcoholic and security guard who spends time reading 
history, then speaks of the Moorish invasion and the sexual pillaging of 
Sicily, which is why Sicilians don't have blond hair and blue eyes like 
Northern "wops." He asserts that the dark-haired and dark-eyed don's 
grandmother many generations back had "a half-nigger kid." In short, Sicilians 
are "part eggplant." 
</P>
<P>
 The upshot is that in America, where neither national nor world history are 
well known, Sicilians who embrace racism are also acting; they are "passing" 
for white. The don shoots him through the head. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarence and Alabama flee to Los Angeles in his purple Cadillac, where he 
arranges to sell the suitcase of cocaine. The remainder of the film pivots back 
and forth between scenes of either sadistic or chaotic violence and a telling 
sendup of self-absorbed Hollywood decadence, from the filthy homes of aspiring 
actors to the cellular phones and sports cars of drug-dealing producers. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost everyone is doing some sort of an impersonation or seeking public 
recognition, even the cops, who demand credit for "the collar," the drug bust 
that will give them their media moment. When Bronson Pinchot's actor character 
is caught with some of the coke and made to wear a wire by the police, he says 
to himself as he prepares to betray his boss, "Elliott, your motivation is to 
not go to jail." It is as hilarious as it is harrowing. 
</P>
<P>
 'Reservoir Dogs" put Taranti no behind the camera, where he again showed off 
his gift for writing the sustained monologue and simultaneously revealed his 
unique command of narrative time. Tarantino uses a collage of recollected 
events and establishing flashbacks to move free of linear storytelling as we 
see a Los Angeles jewelry heist foiled by an undercover cop. Like the Scorsese 
characters of "Mean Streets" and "GoodFellas," Tarantino's thugs talk about 
black people as repulsive inferiors, but they also accuse each other of 
verbally imitating their talk and express sexual attraction to Pam Grier types 
in the middle of a riotous discussion of domestic differences between white and 
black women. 
</P>
<P>
 The racial complexity is furthered by the fact that the undercover cop's 
instructor is black and teaches him how to "pass" for the kind of white 
criminal necessary to fool the robbers. To give his character authenticity, the 
undercover cop even tells a story that the black mentor scripted and rehearsed 
with him. The audience of racist crooks swallows it whole. 
</P>
<P>
 This is another variation on the tradition of Negro composers and arrangers 
successfully writing for white bands that performed almost exclusively for 
white audiences. (This was also reflected in black choreographer Lester 
Johnson's tutoring of Travolta for "Saturday Night Fever," where his character 
danced in essentially an all-white world, making Travolta into the disco Fred 
Astaire.) Such events raise the question of what we mean by "white" if, as in 
America, it's long gone from any kind of European "purity." Though one instance 
of torture in "Reservoir Dogs" goes too far for this writer's taste, the 
control of form, the ethnic complexity and the understanding of criminal 
psychology are outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 The evolution from "True Romance" and "Reservoir Dogs" to "Pulp Fiction" is 
expressive of a nearly astonishing talent. Tarantino's dark world of 
overlapping stories is itself an emblematic development of the filmmaker's 
sense of intricate racial counterpoint. Regardless of our color, the coarse and 
overstated pulp vision is what anchors so many of us and, ultimately, allows 
common frames of reference. Our opinionated conversations are full of 
commitment to the failures of feeling that shape the sentimentality and false 
moxie of popular culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarantino knows that while those elements are either comical or obnoxiously 
pretentious in the straight world, they become sinister in a criminal context. 
He supplies us with a key to how evil works in our time of arrested moral 
comprehension. Every wrong is justified with an offhanded, narcissistic 
cynicism, a reflection of the flippant anarchy that gives counterfeit vitality 
to the mass-market rebellion of our rock and rap world. Even so, the 
unpredictable nature of chance and of human personality periodically arrives to 
produce a dissonant, gallows wit. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the central characters in "Pulp Fiction" course through a thickening 
smog of amorality. Their Los Angeles stories lead one into the other, usually 
focusing on couples -- boy and girl robbers asserting their love through petty 
heists; a pair of seasoned hit men "getting into character" before performing 
the blood sport of their brutal work; the trusted thug given the job of 
entertaining Mr. Big's hot wife; a fighter who agrees to throw a bout but 
double-crosses the crime boss central to all of the stories, then the fighter 
and the outraged boss murderously battling their way into a store where they 
become sudden captives of two redneck sadists and are gleefully taken beneath 
their own underworld into a homemade hell. As prisoners, these two men discover 
that, for all their knowledge of hard knocks, murder and corruption, there are 
arenas of evil where they are equal in virginity to the world's biggest 
squares. 
</P>
<P>
 So realities tumble one into the other -- race into race, class into class -- 
and make us realize, once more, how little separates us in our urban Wild West 
of contraband, drugs, bribery and professional destruction. In this cosmos of 
unforced integration, there is a fundamental, hard-bitten morality: The sole 
taboos are those of the callous, unintentional and indifferent crimes committed 
against the guilty as well as the innocent. Redemption is possible only through 
the rigors and dangers of compassion, the essence of a loyalty that reaches 
down as well as up, to those who don't understand and to those who do. We also 
realize that capturing the actual wackiness of American life frees our most 
insightful artists from the contrivances of surrealism. 
</P>
<P>
 Black and white form the central motif. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson, 
wearing black ties, black suits and white shirts -- like the robbers in 
"Reservoir Dogs" -- are the killers working for black Ving Rhames, the 
millionaire criminal whose white wife, Uma Thurman, wears her hair black and 
has matching nails. As Bruce Willis flees the boxing arena in a cab, the 
Technicolor interior is backdropped by black-and-white street scenes. The 
rednecks take their prisoners into a basement of silver chains and black 
leather. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarantino himself plays a middle-class friend of Jackson's whose home he and 
Travolta come to when they have the fierce problem of cleaning up and getting 
rid of a black corpse after a messy, accidental killing in their car. Tarantino 
wants them to do it fast and be gone before his black wife returns home from 
work. Harvey Keitel, a Jewish fixer in black evening clothes and white shirt, 
speeds to their aid. The Joycean sense of "here comes everybody" is basic. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes the film such an accomplishment is the clarity of the characters. 
None of them, even the cameos, are cartoons. They all have specific visions of 
the world and most love to talk. Tarantino is one of those bent on bringing 
back to American film the combination of strong dialogue and open physical 
dimension that gave Hollywood its greatest moments, those points at which the 
verbal essence and the stagecraft of spoken theater were extended by the 
camera's freedom and range of scale.  
</P>
<P>
 Tarantino's words push the drama and the comedy, reveal the characters and 
give the violence a power it never has in the periodic disruptions of formula 
action films, where spectacle gore replaces the dramatic intensification of 
feeling and adolescent smirks pose as anti- Establishment irony. Even when 
Tarantino's people are posturing, they say things that unveil their 
psychological roots. A real-sounding but expansively rewritten biblical 
quotation, for instance, prepares the way for a murderer's unexpected spiritual 
revelation. 
</P>
<P>
 Possibly an ensemble masterpiece, the film contains the finest performances 
we've yet seen from Jackson and Travolta. Each of them brings nuances of 
remarkable subtlety and rhythm to speech, gesture and facial expressions, 
forming superb contrasts of sensibility that collaborate for murder, detail a 
friendship and range into areas as widely removed as theological disputes and 
discussions of international hamburger quality.  
</P>
<P>
 Thurman gives a prickly magnetism to her spiritually mildewed sex kitten, a 
coke-snorting, failed television star who is bored and taken by the upper-class 
privilege resulting from her marriage to a widely feared and wealthy criminal. 
During her evening out with Travolta, Tarantino sends up both Planet Hollywood 
and our self-congratulatory faux nostalgia for pop trash. At Jack Rabbit 
Slim's, the pop museum and restaurant, black and white slides up again -- the 
vanilla milkshakes are called "Martin and Lewis," the chocolate, "Amos and 
Andy." Later, the pampered gun moll's mistaking one kind of dope for another 
allows Tarantino to do a stunning reversal of the stake in the heart of the 
vampire -- this time to save a life. 
</P>
<P>
 The lumbering crime boss whose girth and heavy voice are metaphoric of his 
power is done to a sullen fare-thee-well by Rhames (his character's name, 
Marsellus, obviously connects him to the Roman references made in "Godfather 
II" and to the Greco-Roman appropriations of American slavery, when such names 
were given to chattel). Effortlessly brilliant, Christopher Walken has a 
hilarious monologue about patriotism, family heirlooms and the honoring of 
friendship that sparks a moral decision in Bruce Willis' fighter. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarantino then bends a cliche by making the dialogue's early homoerotic 
references to one character literal. The avuncular corruption of Harvey 
Keitel's Winston Wolf is another in what is an almost endless line of high 
points in varied styles of contemporary film acting, which includes the work of 
Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette and Maria de Medeiros. 
</P>
<P>
 One cannot be too impressed by what Quentin Tarantino has just accomplished in 
this time of shrill emptiness and our submission to what has become the 
sanctimonious profession of ethnic alienation. As they say in the South, 
Tarantino seems to have been "born knowing." His "Pulp Fiction" brings a 
detailed, visceral craft to our culture and makes it clear that he means to 
join those in our most invincible pantheon. 
</P>
<P>
 Even at this point of development we can see what he wants -- the epic sense 
of racial conflict and synthesis John Ford brought to his best Westerns, the 
"His Girl Friday" snap of Howard Hawks, the inventive social satire of Preston 
Sturges and the deglamorizing grunge of Scorsese's finest criminal portraits.  
</P>
<P>
 But, finally, the lyrical cynicism and wit of "Pulp Fiction" recall the moral 
dilemmas of Orson Welles and Billy Wilder. The work of both identified the 
American tension created by what always opposes the high democratic vitality of 
empathetic individualism. Our perpetual nemesis is the protean and sentimental 
mob instructed by the worst of our commercial culture, our greed, our 
cannibalizing of lacquered celebrity and our narcissistic varieties of 
xenophobia.

MTA WEIGHS ELIMINATION OF BUS ROUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Transportation officials are monitoring a bus route that runs from East Long 
Beach to Downtown Los Angeles to determine whether the route should be 
eliminated because of declining ridership. 
</P>
<P>
 Service on Line 457 was recently cut from 10 to six trips a day because the 
number of passengers on the route has fallen from 400 a day in 1990, when the 
Blue Line began service, to below 100.The route runs along the Long Beach 
Freeway. The fare is $3.35 one way. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been actually trying to cancel this line for a number of years because 
of the Blue Line," said Jon Hillmer, manager of operations for the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority. He added that Line 457 costs the MTA more money to 
operate than any other route because so few passengers patronize it. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials had proposed eliminating the route and two other express routes 
into Los Angeles from San Pedro and the South Bay, but instead decided to 
reduce the number of daily trips and monitor how many people ride the buses 
until the end of the year.

POP MUSIC; ROCK IN A HARD PLACE; AN OASIS OF CREATIVITY HAS BLOOMED IN THE

 Out past the diner with the life-size dinosaurs in the parking lot and the 
high-tech windmills that dot the hills like oversized wildflowers, Kyuss has 
found a rock 'n' roll oasis in the California desert. 
</P>
<P>
 The beautifully bleak expanses of the Coachella Valley might seem an unlikely 
home for cranked-up guitars and thundering drums. But members of the hard-rock 
quartet see something in the landscape that they couldn't find in the music 
industry hub of Los Angeles -- inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 "The desert is the key ingredient in our sound," says singer John Garcia, 23. 
"We're always trying to work the desert vibe into our music. Whatever power and 
integrity our sound has comes from living around here." 
</P>
<P>
 The members of Kyuss -- the group takes its name from the game Dungeons & 
Dragons -- are lazing about a genuine oasis, complete with a spring that 
nurtures a stand of palm trees and a lush tangle of vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
 The band recently completed a European tour and is getting ready to hit the 
road for three months across the United States opening for Dinosaur Jr. There 
are plenty of last-minute details to worry about, but right now, the band 
members are content to spend a few hours soaking up some more of that desert 
vibe. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't find medicine better than this," bassist Scott Reeder, 28, says 
with a shrug. 
</P>
<P>
 Musical hot spots come and go, from Seattle to Chicago's "Guyville," but the 
desert doesn't budge. At the outskirts of towns such as Palm Desert, up in the 
high desert of the Wonder Valley or out in Arizona's Sonora Desert, bands can 
work free of most urban distractions and enjoy life in the slow lane. 
</P>
<P>
 The sun, wind and wide open spaces of the Southwestern deserts don't create a 
single, identifiable sound -- the whomping metal of Kyuss wouldn't be easily 
confused with the loopy meditations of Tempe, Ariz., group the Meat Puppets or 
the shambling, countryfied rock of Tucson's Giant Sand. 
</P>
<P>
 But the harsh beauty of the desert does seem to pull uniquely powerful music 
from the players who call it home. 
</P>
<P>
 "The desert can be the biggest, coolest club you could imagine," says the 
compact, athletically built Garcia, who fronts Kyuss onstage like a man 
possessed but in conversation is serene and soft-spoken. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't have many real clubs to play in around here, so we'd take a 
generator, a light, a keg and a bunch of kids out in the middle of nowhere and 
throw our own party," he says. "We're only two hours away from Los Angeles, but 
considering how different things are out here, we may as well be on Mars. The 
thing is, we're a very satisfied bunch of Martians." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As Highway 62 slides eastward between the Twentynine Palms Marine Corps Base 
and Joshua Tree National Monument, the world gets awfully quiet. That makes 
Dick Dale a very happy desert resident. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's perfect peacefulness here," says the veteran guitarist. "You can 
close your eyes and just listen to your ears ring. . . . You don't want to turn 
on a radio, because you feel like you'd dirty the air. You don't even want to 
speak. It's that powerful." 
</P>
<P>
 For most of his career, Dale has been known as the King of the Surf Guitar, 
and he and his group the Del-Tones had hits with such genre-defining tunes as 
"Let's Go Trippin' " and "Miserlou." 
</P>
<P>
 Six years ago, disgusted by the polluted waters surrounding their Newport 
Beach mansion, Dale and his wife, Jill, set out for the desert and built a 
house for themselves. The man who once spent half of every day in the surf now 
hauls his own water to his home and frets over faucets left running too long. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been able to experience the spirituality of the ocean all my life, but I 
feel that's been destroyed," says Dale, whose 2 1/2-year-old son Jimmy rounds 
out the household. "Now I've got the spirituality of the high desert, and I 
don't think I could get any higher." 
</P>
<P>
 Dale, 57, says the desert has added a new ferocity to his music, but he didn't 
take to his stark surroundings all that quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first came to the desert, I said, 'Who the hell would want to live 
here? You'd have to be out of your gourd.' But property was cheap, so we bought 
land and built the house. We were coming out once or twice a week, and then we 
started asking, 'Why are we bothering to drive back to the beach?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The desert has given Dale peace of mind, but it's also refired his desire to 
make powerful, primal rock 'n' roll. He says he's given up his "Surf King" 
crown and has no second thoughts about his move inland. 
</P>
<P>
 "For $3 million and perfect surf, you couldn't get me out of this place. I 
don't need to be in the world of riches anymore. Diamonds and Rolexes and all 
that crap are gone. I have a Rolls-Royce that's got four flats and a rat living 
in the trunk. The rat's happy, and so am I." 
</P>
<P>
 There's no rat in Curt Kirk wood's trunk, but he does have a desert tortoise 
hibernating in his closet. The Meat Puppets' guitarist and singer has been 
creating oddly soothing mixes of punk, country, pop and rock music for nearly 
15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Having grown up in Phoenix and now living in nearby Tempe, Kirkwood couldn't 
help but be influenced by the desert around him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we try to consciously write music for the desert," he explains. 
"But the band appreciates our natural surroundings, and through our music we 
enjoy satisfying that primal need to be outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we're really playing well together, the music rings out with some of 
that sunny, windy, desert feeling, and we all understand that particular vibe 
without having to talk much about it. Living here, the desert creeps into 
everything you do." 
</P>
<P>
 Kirkwood, 35, says that the desert's influence shows up strongly on such songs 
as "Station," "Shine" and "Severed Goddess Hand," from the band's latest album, 
"Too High to Die," a hit in college-alternative radio circles. 
</P>
<P>
 He also credits the desert with bringing him, his bassist brother Cris and 
drummer Derrick Bostrom together as a band in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as we got cars, we started driving to the edge of town to hang out, 
because there was never much of a club scene to get involved with," he recalls. 
"We were on the fringe of the Phoenix desert stoner scene. It seemed really 
natural for a band to come out of our desert peer group, but when it came time 
to make music, only myself, Cris and Derrick were into showing up to play on a 
consistent basis." 
</P>
<P>
 As the band progressed, the members greatly appreciated the comfort and 
solitude that the desert offered. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the reasons we liked going there so much was that none of us were very 
good in social situations," Curt Kirkwood says. "We loved the desert because it 
was real pretty and we didn't have to deal with other people." 
</P>
<P>
 Down in Tucson, Howe Gelb, the lanky, laid-back singer-guitarist who fronts 
the band Giant Sand, is beginning to admit to himself that the desert may have 
more influence on his music than he previously believed. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the last umpteen years I've been saying that there's no connection at all 
-- that Thelonious Monk would have made the same music if he lived out here. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm starting to change my mind. The desert doesn't give you a specific 
sound, but it definitely gives you an overview. Maybe a band like mine just 
wouldn't grow anywhere but the desert." 
</P>
<P>
 Gelb is especially pleased by the incidentals of the desert lifestyle. "Rent 
is cheap, the pot is practically free, and no one cares if you can really sing 
or not," he notes with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 He has no qualms about musicians' tapping the desert as an influence, but he 
says the connection should not be flaunted. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people that call themselves desert bands and actually sing about the 
desert come off as kind of laughable and obnoxiously naive," says Gelb, whose 
latest Giant Sand album, "Glum," was released at the end of August. "We don't 
need more people stating the obvious." 
</P>
<P>
 Giant Sand's previous album, "Purge and Slouch," was recorded in an old house 
outside Tucson, with Gelb contributing most of his guitar parts and vocals 
while slumped on a living room couch. 
</P>
<P>
 Gelb has also lived and worked in the Mojave Desert, at an isolated ranch 
called Rim Rock. He says that both experiences beat working in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very few musicians stop to think how L.A. might work against them," he says. 
"Every day I drove out to this house in the desert to record, and no matter how 
hot it was, I'd be thinking that this was another day I didn't have to deal 
with the traffic on Venice Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have to deal with all that extra grief out here. If you're caught 
up in dealing with everything from parking tickets to riots, you're going to 
make music that reflects that, and great music can come from that. But in this 
setting it's easier to clear your head out. Once you experience the solitude of 
the desert, it becomes necessary." 
</P>
<P>
 Kyuss -- whose members grew up in the small communities around Palm Springs -- 
came together in the late '80s, when Garcia and guitarist Josh Homme made a 
tape to sell in local record stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Catherine Enny, the manager of the studio where they recorded, thought so much 
of the band's large, loud sound that she began booking shows for Kyuss, often 
sending them 100 miles west to gigs in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 While the group made a powerful impression in some of Hollywood's big rooms, 
the band's favorite venue remained the wide open spaces of the desert. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't get that sound anywhere else," bassist Reeder says. "But it's the 
standard we shoot for." 
</P>
<P>
 He helped throw the first generator parties with his previous band, Across the 
River, and is happy to continue the tradition with Kyuss.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty nice to be playing as loud as you can and look up and see a full 
moon," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The band had made the trip to Los Angeles only a few times when it was spotted 
and snapped up by Chameleon Records, which put out "Blues for the Red Sun" in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The album was produced by Masters of Reality guitarist Chris Goss, who had 
become a close friend of the band's after attending a few of its generator 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Kyuss' future looked uncertain when Chameleon folded last November. But 
Elektra Records, the label's distributor, elected to pick up the band's 
contract and released the album "Sky Valley" in June. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have said it's amazing we survived," Reeder says, "but it's no big 
deal. We just kept playing. That's the easiest thing in the world for us to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Garcia: "That's the way things go out here. It's laid-back. We're in no 
hurry to do anything. We want it all done right." 
</P>
<P>
 Doing it right has occasionally meant saying no. When MTV wanted the band to 
bring a film crew to one of the generator parties, Kyuss politely demurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought that was the coolest thing," says Goss, 37. "There's a commitment 
to being genuine that I love about Kyuss. Those parties are something that the 
local kids really enjoy. Why make it flavor of the week?" 
</P>
<P>
 Goss had such a good time visiting and working with Kyuss on its home turf 
that a year ago he moved from Hollywood and bought a home and space for a 
studio in Palm Desert. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been sheer pleasure," he says. "If you can take the heat, the desert's 
great. I used to have the philosophy when I was making rock 'n' roll in L.A. 
that the music had to be louder than the noise all around me, and I thought 
that the competition made the music stronger. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that way anymore. Wherever your soul is comfortable, that's 
where you should make music. I'm comfortable in the desert. I hit those 
windmills and I'm free."

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: HUNTINGTON PARK; 200,000 GET A TASTE OF MEXICO AT 
FAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIMON ROMERO

<TEXT>
<P>
 The mariachis trumpeted, the tacos were devoured and the dances were raucous 
as more than 200,000 people jammed Pacific Boulevard last weekend for the 
annual three-day "Sabor a Mexico" street fair. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual cultural celebration and salute to the patria , or homeland, 
included everything from the sale of red, white and green Mexican flags to 
frenetic quebradita dance contests. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so much fun up there on the stage," said 9-year-old Bobby Martinez of 
El Monte, who came with his family to dance and eat in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 And attractions such as Andean flute musicians and open-air sales of 
Salvadoran pupusas , akin to a meat turnover, affirmed the multicultural makeup 
of Los Angeles' Latino population. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't matter to me that this is a Mexican celebration, " said Antonio 
Sanchez, who came to Huntington Park five years ago from his native Guatemala. 
"It's a nice excuse to walk around outside and watch people have a good time." 
</P>
<P>
 The fair also recognized the city's Latino population. About 95% of Huntington 
Park's 56,000 residents are Latino, with 40,000 of Mexican origin, according to 
1990 U.S. census data. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really amazing to see so many people speaking Spanish gathered in one 
place," said Estella Holguin, who handles promotions for Radio Alegria, AM 930, 
a local radio station and one of the fair's promoters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really demonstrates the strong sense of community in this part of Los 
Angeles; the Southeast is one of our most important markets," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Dante D'Eramo, who helped organize the fair for the Chamber of Commerce, 
the day was a success. 
</P>
<P>
 "After all the bad press the city received (about disturbances) during the 
World Cup celebrations, it feels great to see us pull off something really 
positive. There were no incidents of violence during the fair and lots of 
families were strolling along the boulevard just having a good time." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps no one was more in awe than 12-year-old Elizabeth Sandoval of Los 
Angeles, who said in Spanish: "I've only been to Mexico once and that was when 
I was little. Maybe I'll go again someday, but for now this will do." SIMON

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: HUNTINGTON PARK; LATINO HEALTH CENTER COULD FACE 
CLOSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIMON ROMERO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Health educator Maria Vargas, who pounds the pavement every day to fight 
illnesses from tuberculosis to lung cancer to AIDS, is battling to keep her 
health center open. 
</P>
<P>
 The center's home in a former Hindu temple at 2502 Clarendon Ave. is for sale. 
Unless she can find a new home to plug in a phone line and distribute 
preventive care pamphlets, the Mexican American Health and Educational Services 
Center could close at the end of this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're out of money and we really need this space in order to keep on 
providing the community with ways to prevent communicable diseases," said 
Vargas, who contributes part of her salary as an outreach health educator for 
the American Diabetes Assn. and American Lung Assn. to the center. Run with the 
help of 25 volunteers, the center depends on private donations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without ways to approach the Latino community at their level, the chances are 
that more people will get sick and won't know why or how they can get better," 
said Vargas, who has held a variety of jobs as a health educator in Los Angeles 
County in the past 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Since she founded the center in 1991, Vargas, 43, says she has promoted 
healthier lifestyles to thousands of Latinos while raising awareness about 
health problems such as diabetes, tuberculosis and AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas tries to reach out to Latinos who mistrust the medical establishment 
and turn instead to folk healers for cures.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of distrust among some, especially older people, in dealing 
with modern medicine. A lot of people will still just go to a curandero to look 
for a cure," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent prenatal information session at the center, Vargas said she was 
amazed that many women did not know about the dangers posed by secondhand smoke 
and proper eating habits during pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas takes her message about preventive care, along with plenty of pamphlets 
in Spanish and English, to churches, schools and clinics in Huntington Park and 
surrounding communities. At these outreach sessions, she refers those in need 
of medical care to local clinics and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the sale of the building is completed, the center has been allowed to 
stay and pay $500 per month in rent. Most of that money, Vargas said, comes out 
of her own pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we need to operate is about $1,500 per month," said Vargas. 
</P>
<P>
 But even that amount is difficult to come by. In the center's first year, the 
owners charged no rent in exchange for needed repairs to the building's 
interior. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas and a corps of local volunteers from 8 to 80 painted walls, scrubbed 
floors and cleaned up the front porch, a hangout for prostitutes and 
drug-pushers. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the building is in pristine condition, its walls lined with posters 
proclaiming the dangers of secondhand smoke to young children and ways to 
prevent AIDS. Children wander in after school to take advantage of tutoring 
programs or volunteer in handing out anti-smoking literature. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really gratifying to see these kids interested in health issues when 
they're young because prevention is so important," Vargas said. "Identifying a 
health problem at an early age can prevent much larger problems later on in 
life."

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: SOUTH GATE; BACKERS OF AZALEA FESTIVAL ATTACK PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIMON ROMERO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At first glance, agenda item No. 12 looked innocuous enough. 
</P>
<P>
 To better reflect South Gate after a decade of abrupt demographic change 
during which Latinos surged to 83% of the population, city staff recommended 
that the City Council approve a carnival date change from March, when the 
annual Azalea Festival is held, to May, and hold a Cinco de Mayo Festival in 
its place. 
</P>
<P>
 "Historically, this date hasn't been a priority in this city," said Mayor 
Albert Robles at last week's meeting, referring to the celebration of the 
anniversary of May 5, 1862 -- the day when Mexican troops expelled the French 
from the city of Puebla. 
</P>
<P>
 The council was surprised, though, when the symbolic effort to replace azaleas 
with choruses of "Viva Mexico" was shouted down by charges of petty politics 
and cultural favoritism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just because there's a Mexican majority in South Gate doesn't mean we have to 
celebrate a holiday that originates all the way in Puebla," said Victorio 
Gutierrez, a South Gate High School teacher who opposed the change. "We have a 
lot of other people in this city, Salvadorans, Guatemalans and others, who 
resent being considered Mexican and having to celebrate Mexican holidays." 
</P>
<P>
 Several residents pointed out that the city already celebrates Mexican 
Independence Day, Sept. 16, with a carnival, in addition to its annual 
celebration of July 4. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the 1990 U.S. Census, the city has a total population of 86,284, 
71,740 of whom are Latinos. Mexicans are the largest group in the Latino 
community, with 56,252. The city also has 4,754 Salvadorans, 2,269 Guatemalans 
and thousands of other residents from the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, 
Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and other South American countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase in the total number of Latinos was dramatic during the 1980s, an 
84% increase in 10 years. During the same period, South Gate witnessed a 
massive exodus of Anglos, who declined by 53%. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, according to census data, Spanish is the most common language spoken in 
South Gate homes, followed by English and Tagalog. 
</P>
<P>
 A 30-year-old tradition in the city, the annual Azalea Festival honors women 
over the age of 60. The azalea is the city's official flower. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no problem celebrating Cinco de Mayo, we just want the Azalea 
Festival to remain a tradition in South Gate," said Mildred Ward, 75, this 
year's Azalea Queen. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the deluge of complaints about the carnival change, the council 
decided to postpone its vote by one month in hopes of reaching a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there's anyone in the city who wants to do away with a festival 
honoring these older women," said City Clerk Nina Banuelos. "We're probably 
just going to have to celebrate both." SIMON ROMERO

COMEDY; IT'S NOT EASY BEING GREENE; DID YOU HEAR THE ONE ABOUT THE COMIC WHOSE 
LIFE BECAME A NIGHTMARE OF GAMBLING, ALCOHOL, PANIC ATTACKS AND PRESCRIPTION 
DRUGS? SHECKY GREENE CAN TELL IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Lawrence Christon, Lawrence Christon is a Times staff writer. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Because he spent most of his professional life playing clubs, and because the 
name Shecky fits right in with all those generic Jackies and Joeys who started 
out in the Borscht Belt before they went on to careers in movies and 
television, Shecky Greene tends to get lumped in with the band of postwar 
vacation resort tummlers that history and a new generation have shunted aside. 
His Vegas association tends to date him too, now that the city is 
metamorphosing into a theme park. But to comedy aficionados, Shecky Greene is 
unquestionably one of the greats, the comedian's comedian. 
</P>
<P>
 What nearly no one knows, however, is that his chunky frame has housed a 
lifelong rage and sorrow so consuming that, emotionally speaking, he could be a 
character out of Aeschylus. Or that a six-year period beginning in the '80s saw 
not a celebrated turn into the gentle autumn of a career but a man so seized by 
terror that he would take to his bed, crying and shaking uncontrollably. 
</P>
<P>
 "You feel you're in a pit, a hellhole," he says, describing an emotional free 
fall, accelerated by prescription drugs, that began in high school and has only 
recently come to an end. "There's nowhere to go. You can't get out. You feel 
alone." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a big effort just to get him to walk," says his wife, Marie. 
"Socially, we couldn't go out. He couldn't drive. If a restaurant was too dark, 
he'd leave. If a restaurant was too light, he'd leave too. I had to warn our 
friends to expect anything. You never knew when a panic attack was going to 
hit." 
</P>
<P>
 While Greene anguished in self-imposed exile, everyone who knows him filled 
his absence with wild and crazy Shecky Greene memories -- almost as many as 
Greene has himself. There was the time, during his heavy drinking period, when 
he plowed his car into the fountain in front of Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, 
and while security guards surrounded him under towering plumes of water, he 
rolled down his window and said, "Hold the spray wax, please." 
</P>
<P>
 There was the night when Johnny Carson, in his drinking period, chased Greene 
around and out of his best friend Buddy Hackett's house during a party. Greene 
crashed through a lot of furniture, then plunged into Hackett's swimming pool 
fully clothed, whereupon he clambered out and squished his way home. The next 
day Greene, remembering nothing but feeling remorseful -- he knew from 
experience that he was a mean, obstreperous drunk -- called Hackett to 
apologize. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope you don't hate me," Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hate is an emotion," Hackett replied. "For you, I feel nothing. But you're 
off the nut. Carson was so loaded he walked into a wall and wrecked my stereo." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and associates remember Greene's days as a compulsive gambler who 
shrugged off the loss of pot loads of money. He could afford it, he reasoned. 
After all, he made more than God (he was quite specific on this: He earned more 
than $100,000 a week during the mid-'70s, while God, in Greene's estimation, 
made only $35,000). 
</P>
<P>
 Grateful audiences remember him as an all-purpose entertainer of the old 
school who told jokes and stories, sang, owned an endless fund of the kind of 
observations that made the dreariness and confusion of life not only bearable 
but funny and would do anything short of killing himself onstage for their 
delectation. Once, during a Florida gig early in his career, he did a body flip 
that landed him flush on his knee, which blew up to the size of a cantaloupe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why do you do this to yourself?" an examining physician asked him the next 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It got a laugh," Greene replied. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is a single laugh worth your knee?" the doctor asked, incredulously. Greene, 
in recounting the story now, doesn't give his response. He's had knee surgery 
and a hip replacement to relieve a career full of self-inflicted damage. 
Decades later, a decisive answer is still too close to call. 
</P>
<P>
 There are clinical words to describe what Greene has been privately suffering 
through, depression being chief among them. But there's another term that 
describes what has made a miserable condition even worse, especially because it 
was avoidable: iatrogenic addiction. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is a condition that is physician-induced," says psychiatrist Ronald 
Gershman, who has been treating Greene since November, 1989 (the comic has 
given the doctor permission to talk about his case). "The drugs Shecky was on 
are among the most addictive in medicine." 
</P>
<P>
 Gershman is, as far as Greene is concerned, a radical departure from a long 
list of attending physicians whose eccentricities and ruinous prescriptions 
could be the gleeful subjects of a Moliere farce. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, there was the Freudian disciple who told Greene to feel free to 
call him at his Viennese clinic whenever he felt an anxiety attack coming on. 
Greene did and made his way through the labyrinth of international dialing 
signals and a phalanx of uncooperative medical assistants only to hear the 
doctor call him a string of obscenities and yell, "You crazy s.o.b. Don't call 
me anymore!" 
</P>
<P>
 There was the psychiatrist who never suspected the anvil of dread that hung in 
Greene's viscera, taking pleasure in the emotional camouflage of Greene's 
patter and shtick. When Greene asked him why he didn't help his sleeplessness, 
the doctor said, "But I thought this was your real personality." 
</P>
<P>
 As Greene regales his visitor with stories like these, one is reminded of the 
notion that the comedian is a person who sees things funny. But that of course 
doesn't mean things happen funny. Especially in Greene's case. Through the 
years he had been diagnosed a manic-depressive, a condition often 
pharmaceutically treated by Valium, Xanax and Ativan -- drugs that fall into 
the category of benzodiazepines. 
</P>
<P>
 The symptoms of benzodiazepine withdrawal include, Gershman says, "pains, 
burning sensations, teeth grinding, emotional outbursts, the feeling that the 
earth is spongy under your feet, a perpetual kind of mild terror and a mantra 
about wanting to die. These drugs can render you incapable of functioning. One 
of my patients who was on Ativan wrapped Scotch tape around her head because 
she felt that pieces of it were falling off. One patient saw her arms fall off. 
It's hard to get the word out on these drugs because of the drug companies." 
</P>
<P>
 That this kind of addiction has been hard to diagnose until recently doesn't 
seem to offer Greene much of a vindicating solace. At 68, he still has a 
powerful-looking body -- a low center of gravity lends his thick torso the 
obduracy of a hydrant. The sheer forcefulness of his personality, even in 
casual conversation, is indicative of a lifelong capacity to dominate large 
roomfuls of people. 
</P>
<P>
 His voice is strong, peremptory. He has a born comedian's restlessness of mind 
and is full of jokes, asides and uncannily dead-on dialects. But there are 
small stillnesses where his lips are pursed and his mind is off elsewhere. Then 
his face looks shadowed with a lot of bad memory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up in the North Side of Chicago," he said recently in his Hancock Park 
home. "I was a real good athlete, which disguised the depression I began 
feeling as a kid. I loved sports. I wanted to be a phys ed teacher. But at the 
same time I was never happy. I felt like I never knew where I was going. I 
thought because there was mental illness in my mother's family, and that my 
father's mother had a nervous breakdown, that it might affect me. But there 
were no pills in those days. You didn't talk about these things. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why I went into comedy I'll never know. My father was a shoe salesman whose 
real vocation was the horses. I had two older brothers. One sold restaurant 
supplies, the other had a tile store. I could sing pretty well, and I liked to 
tell dialect jokes. I even took drama class, but I never had aspirations to 
that. I never wanted show business. I guess what I wanted was approval." 
</P>
<P>
 Greene, whose pre-show-biz name is Fred Sheldon Greenfield, served aboard an 
aircraft carrier during World War II. After his tour ended, he took one stab at 
seeing a doctor. "He said, 'Don't go to school. Don't get married. You need 
help.' But I never followed through." 
</P>
<P>
 Greene went to a junior college for a while, but comedy was such a natural 
outlet that he joined some friends to play resort revues at Peewaukee Lake, 
Wis. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the sources he drew on then were Danny Thomas, Lou Holtz, the Three 
Stooges and Harry Ritz of the Ritz Brothers. He had already broadened his 
knowledge of dialects as a kid listening to the radio with his brothers while 
his mother worked late nights; they picked up signals from Uncle Ezra and the 
Barn Dance, and Lulabelle and Skyland Scottie. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, he floundered early on in search of his own style. He worked 
with partners at first, Sammy Shore, then Joe Sterling, then Jean Karen, and 
for several years chased a desultory career through New York, Chicago and East 
and West Dubuque. He decided to strike out on his own and went down to New 
Orleans. The Big Easy loosened him up; he found his timing and sharpened the 
angles of his variety act at a joint called the Preview Lounge, where Al Hirt 
worked as his orchestra leader. 
</P>
<P>
 By this time Greene had taken it on himself to support his entire family; he 
went through considerable panic when the Lounge burned down, but Martha Raye 
called on him to join her, and he began his move west. 
</P>
<P>
 He went to Reno in the early '50s to play the Golden Hotel. "I was working for 
the boys out of Chicago without realizing it," he says, which may be yet 
another explanation why, for all his affability, he's a guarded figure: too 
much garrulousness around or about the euphemistically termed "boys" is not 
generally conducive to good health. They looked out for him. This was around 
the time Reno and especially Las Vegas were beginning to build up. Greene 
proved such a sure audience draw that he landed an unheard of three-year 
contract at $1,250 a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon he was playing the Last Frontier in Las Vegas. He married, unwisely ("I 
didn't know her second name then, and still don't"), and the ghastly split 
between soaring success and private misery became more abysmal than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to quit show business. I wanted to leave the girl. I started to 
drink and gamble, which I'd never done before," he says. "It was unbelievable. 
They held me over for 18 weeks, the first time ever in the history of Vegas. 
But it didn't mean (expletive) to me." 
</P>
<P>
 He signed with NBC in 1953 and began to divide his time between Hollywood and 
Las Vegas, where he would return to play the New Frontier (Elvis Presley was 
his opening act) and the Riviera. The name Shecky Greene became as solid as the 
mint. 
</P>
<P>
 "I moved into the Riviera lounge and never felt so free and uninhibited in my 
life," Greene says. "At the same time I was mean, belligerent, angry. There was 
this writer from Esquire magazine who came out to do a story on me. 'I've never 
fallen for an entertainer before,' he said. 'This is going to be the best story 
I've ever done.' Then he saw me drunk. He called up the next day and said, 
'I've torn up the article. I can't let people know the truth about you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The pattern kept up for 20 years. More money, more fame, more misery -- and a 
second bad marriage. ("She was a little Hawaiian revue act. It was a complex 
situation -- but a disaster.") Even the jokes about Greene's drinking were 
growing commonplace. "There goes Shecky's burglar alarm," his neighbors would 
say. "He must be just getting home." 
</P>
<P>
 Inevitably, he began to break down. He lost his voice, and doctors removed his 
parathyroids in error. In 1976, he was diagnosed with sarcoma of the ribs, and 
three were removed ("I thought they were making the Andrew Sisters out of me"). 
He had recently stopped drinking and started on prescription drugs, Nardil at 
first, then Xanax. 
</P>
<P>
 Divorced once again, he called up an old friend of 30 years, Marie Musso, a 
tall, elegantly attractive woman who had been drawn to Greene years back but 
frightened and repelled by his drinking. "I said, 'I really need you, Marie,' " 
Greene recalls. "He was searching for me," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 They were married in 1985, by which time Greene's panic attacks were literally 
paralyzing him. Several times he thought he was having a heart seizure. In the 
meantime, his Xanax dosages were increased. By 1987, "he was not working," 
Marie Greene says. "We moved to Brentwood. He took to his bed, where he'd cry 
and shake. To get him to walk at all was a big effort. We went through six or 
seven therapists. There were times when I wanted to kill him. But mental 
illness is hard to detect. It's not like a broken leg. But we never lost our 
sense of humor. As a wife going through all this, I said, 'I'm not going to 
give up.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Then they heard of Gershman, a pioneer in drug rehabilitation therapy who had 
opened a methadone clinic in Watts in 1977 and was director of alcohol and 
substance abuse at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center from 1984 through 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Gershman, a youthful-looking 46 and dressed in jeans and casual shirt, 
carefully placed Greene's case history folder on the living room coffee table 
in his Brentwood home. He spoke from memory, occasionally running his fingers 
along the edge of the folder, talking first about Greene's treatment and 
psychological background and then about how the entertainment profession makes 
vulnerable people even more so. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shecky came to me in October of 1989 and I admitted him to the clinic in 
November," Gershman said. "His chief complaint was Xanax dependence. He was 
severely depressed. He had panic disorder, depressive disorder and agoraphobia. 
He was completely dysfunctional. He'd been through a whole lot of medications. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that they don't work, but you can't just throw pills at people. 
Depressions happen. Regardless of what underlies them, there's always 
treatment. But medication doesn't say anything about who you are or why you're 
depressed. It's just something that deals with brain chemistry, a tool to help 
you get off the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shecky was typical of the actor-entertainer who grows up in a family where he 
had a distant, cruel father and a manipulative mother. His sense has been to 
take care of the world to gain its love. He's been brilliantly successful, but 
he never gets what he wants: his mother to say, 'You're a good boy, Shecky.' 
Even as his life grew more and more out of control, he took care of his mother, 
father and brothers. When the appreciation didn't come, it only made him work 
harder and feel more enraged. He looked for acceptance in applause." 
</P>
<P>
 Gershman has worked with entertainers for a good portion of his career and 
recognizes in the industry itself and in the people attracted to it a 
continuous potential for individual disaster: 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had Academy Award-winning actors sit in front of me terrified that 
they'd never work again. A lot of them go into show business for approval; if 
the whole world doesn't love them, they feel like failures. When you become 
famous and wealthy, you have this complex network to deal with -- managers, 
agents, studio executives. Most actors don't have the tools to manage anything 
so complex. They don't have particularly good skills for conducting normal 
lives. Much of the time, they feel theirs out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 "Freedom is when one's existence isn't dependent on other people's opinions. 
If you have to filter your identity through an image, you're leaving a large 
part of yourself in the dark," he said, jerking his head in the direction of 
the O. J. Simpson mansion, only a few blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
 Gershman treated Greene initially by prescribing Klonipin ("a slow-acting 
benzo that doesn't create a high") in gradually reduced doses; he then put 
Greene on Zoloft. He also began what he calls "the therapeutic alliance," which 
at first consisted of having Greene make golf his first priority -- at least 
over working. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think psychiatry got lost when it tried to fit patients into a theoretical 
framework," Gershman said. "I don't believe in creating a mystique, in 
infantilizing the patient by hiding your technique. The therapeutic alliance 
takes a lot of time and consists of listening and being credible. If you tell 
them what you're doing, they get better faster." 
</P>
<P>
 Greene has recently, and cautiously, begun a return to performing after 6 1/2 
years. Starting slowly, he's played Kutcher's in the Catskills, the Desert Inn 
in Las Vegas, Atlantic City and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found out if you can be honest with an audience, they'll accept anything," 
he says. "So many people are touched by these situations, or else they 
understand that emotional illness is as serious as cancer or alcoholism. It 
can't be hidden. It has to be treated." On Monday, he'll play himself on TV's 
"Northern Exposure," and on Nov. 11 and 12 he plays live at the Wilshire Ebell 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Gershman has great affection for Greene, and some concern as well: "Shecky's 
one of the most just, kind and compassionate people I've ever met. I think his 
comedy genius is based on being sort of the common man. People understand he's 
struggling to survive, like everyone else. Audiences trust him to tell them the 
truth; he can take them anywhere. Now he's going back into the lion's den. Will 
the same old forces push the same old buttons?" 
</P>
<P>
 No one can tell, including Greene himself, whether his return and its churning 
up of deep currents will set an old self-destructive cycle back in motion 
again. But odds are that the moment he takes the stage he'll be met by a wave 
of residual gratitude and warmth for an entertainer who's given a lot of 
pleasure for a lot of years.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: SOUTH-CENTRAL; CENTER NAMED FOR SLAIN MINISTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ENRIQUE LAVIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Her name signified love and giving to the communities she served. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a community center has been named in memory of the Rev. Blanche Thomas, an 
81-year-old minister who was found slain in her South La Brea Avenue home in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3R Outreach, a 4-year-old nonprofit organization based in South-Central, 
last week dubbed the newest addition to its programs for the homeless after 
Thomas, who had worked closely with the 3R program. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blanche Thomas Christian Center, located in a former auto body shop garage 
at 8854 S. Central Ave., is expected to open Monday. It will serve principally 
as a vocational training center and place of worship for the homeless aided by 
3R (Reclaim, Recover, Restore). They will receive computer training and other 
instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Through her small South-Central parish, Mt. Zion Churches United, Thomas 
worked to comfort the elderly, to ease the plight of the homeless and to stop 
substance abuse. Thomas is remembered for distributing donated food to the 
needy and raising funds for blankets to give to homeless people in the streets, 
family members said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas was found dead of asphyxiation in her apartment on July 25. She had 
been bound, gagged and sexually assaulted. Shortly after Thomas' death, a 
$50,000 reward was put up by Los Angeles City Councilman Nate Holden's office 
and television evangelist Gene Scott for information leading to an arrest and 
conviction. Police said last week they have good leads and expect to make an 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3R's Blanche Thomas Christian Center is intended to carry on Thomas' 
legacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Through a tie with Orange County's Pacific Christian College's 18-month Excel 
Degree Completion Program, the center will offer college-accredited classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Space for the center was donated by one of the relatives of the Rev. Sonja 
Williams, who serves as co-pastor of Mt. Zion with her husband, the Rev. Calvin 
Williams. Sonja Williams is Thomas' niece. 
</P>
<P>
 The center has been given three computers by Chem Search, an El Segundo 
company, each with the latest word processing and accounting software. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to be like other training centers that offer computer 
training with outdated software," said Sonja Williams, stacking books and 
packages of WordPerfect 6.0, Microsoft Word 6.0 and other software on her desk. 
</P>
<P>
 The new facility will be a boost for 3R, which the Williamses operate from an 
office at an apartment complex near the center where they house 22 homeless men 
and women. These 22 people receive counseling and job training there. 
</P>
<P>
 The use of the apartment complex was provided by owner Sterling Williams (no 
relation to the Williamses). The man was so impressed by Sonja Williams' work 
with his wayward son Rodney, whom she found roaming the streets, that he gave 
3R a break on the rent so that the organization could expand its operation. 3R 
has a five-year lease with an option to buy. The Williamses pay $3,000 a month 
for the entire complex. 
</P>
<P>
 The Williamses have struggled through the years to keep their program 
together. Two months ago, the couple left their house of two years and moved 
into the apartment complex because of economic difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire 3R operation is running on an annual budget of about $100,000. Most 
of Calvin Williams' income from his job managing a Department of Water and 
Power yard in Venice goes to 3R, while Sonja volunteers full time for the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we're not doing too bad," Sonja Williams said as she opened a 
refrigerator door to reveal an abundance of frozen meats and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part 3R serves homeless people who have dropped in and out of 
alcohol and drug rehabilitation groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got here in May I was in the (Alcoholics Anonymous/Narcotics 
Anonymous) 12-step program. It wasn't working for me," said Valerie Howard, 26, 
sitting on her couch in the two-bedroom apartment where she's lived for the 
past five months. 
</P>
<P>
 Living in an environment that looks like a home has helped Howard put her life 
back together, she said. She now works as a beautician at two beauty shops, one 
in Inglewood and the other in South Central.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: WATTS; FOR THEATER GROUP, THE PLAY'S THE THING 
</P>

<P>
 There's a tragedy brewing in Watts. 
</P>
<P>
 A Greek tragedy brought on by a theater company that plans to stay for a 
while. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica-based Cornerstone Theater Company is into its fourth week of a 
15-month residency in which five plays or musicals will be created. The first 
play, "The Love of a Nightingale," is an adaptation of a Greek myth laced with 
betrayal and magic, and violence that results from silence. 
</P>
<P>
 Making her directorial debut with Cornerstone, Ashby Semple said she chose 
British author Timberlake Wertenbaker's short play because the topic is 
relevant to the community. The heroine is violently silenced and "it seemed 
resonant that this community's voice is underrepresented," said Semple, who has 
been with Cornerstone for six years as an actress. 
</P>
<P>
 But audiences don't have to come for the sociological meaning of the play, 
Semple said. "Let them come and see a funky evening of theater." 
</P>
<P>
 The play runs Oct. 28 through Nov. 6 at the Watts Towers Arts Center, which 
will seat an audience of 60 to 66 people. In conjunction with "The Love of a 
Nightingale," Semple is directing a 10-minute play with a cast of children 
about the life of Watts Towers creator Simon Rodia, called "Breaking Plates." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of Cornerstone's aim is to establish a theater company in Watts. Cast 
members in Semple's plays, as well as future productions, are mostly local 
residents.  
</P>
<P>
 Since 1986, Cornerstone has created 18 community productions in 11 states. The 
Watts residency is the company's longest to date. The company is funded by 
local and national grants that total $650,000.  
</P>
<P>
 Cornerstone's second play, "Los Faustinos," which will run from Dec. 2-18, 
will involve a cast of 35 actors, said Stephen Gutwillig, managing director of 
Cornerstone. 
</P>
<P>
 Since spring, a community advisory committee has been brainstorming ways to 
help Cornerstone establish a continuing community-based theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, this will mean the revival of theater in the community," said Mark 
Greenfield, director of the Watts Towers Art Center and a member of the 
advisory committee. "For the last 15 to 20 years there hasn't been much theater 
happening (here)." 
</P>
<P>
 Marceneus Earl, 24, grew up in Watts and will play the bad guy in "The Love of 
a Nightingale." 
</P>
<P>
 "With Cornerstone coming into the community," he said, "we have a chance to 
get young people into the production of a play, rather than into the normal 
everyday thing, which is nothing."

MOVIES; WITH A HOOP AND A PRAYER; A PRO BASKETBALL CAREER IS THE DREAM OF TWO 
CHICAGO STUDENTS, AND THEIR DAY-TO-DAY STORY IS DRAMATIZED IN THE DOCUMENTARY 
'HOOP DREAMS.' BUT THERE'S MORE TO IT THAN THAT, SPORTS FANS.

<P>
 The production notes given out to the media about the film "Hoop Dreams" -- 
the story of two underprivileged African American high school kids questing for 
the elusive ideal of a pro basketball career -- begin with an admonition to 
journalists not to blow the twists and turns of the narrative for potential 
viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The filmmakers and distributor would like to ask you to use discretion when 
discussing the plot of the film," the press kit gingerly requests. "We believe 
that each audience member will find the story of Arthur Agee and William Gates 
more compelling if they approach the film without knowing the outcome of 
particular games or details of how their lives play out in the film." 
</P>
<P>
 But director Steve James, in an interview, can't resist pretending to let the 
cat out of the bag: "Arthur's actually a woman," he quips, mindful of the last 
time an art-film distributor made such an insistent caveat. 
</P>
<P>
 No, "The Crying Game" this isn't, although there are game scenes that end with 
weeping. In fact, there are no terribly startling surprises about the picture's 
two adolescent leads under wraps. And the plot twists of "Hoop Dreams" -- which 
is a (gulp) documentary, one that lasts nearly (double-gulp) three hours -- are 
only the small ones that real life metes out: a crushing disappointment here, a 
stirring underdog triumph there, ironic reversals of fortune everywhere, on- 
and off-court upsets and, inevitably, anticlimaxes to spare. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet a narrative film it assuredly is, with plenty of suspense in just how well 
the two kids will fare, in ball and in life, during and beyond the 4 1/2-year 
period James and his partners filmed these two kids and their families, 
coaches, scouts, et al. And this strong sense of storytelling -- strong enough 
that fictional remake rights to the picture have already been sold -- is a key 
reason "Hoop Dreams" is being touted as the latest great hope of mainstream 
documentarians, who have their own dreams of escaping ghettoization. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Picked up by Fine Line for distribution after winning the Audience Award at 
this year's Sundance Film Festival, "Hoop Dreams" opened in New York last week, 
begins its Los Angeles run on Friday, makes a pass across to 20 other top 
markets the following week and a presumed full-court press before the end of 
the year if early box office dictates the hundreds of screens hoped for. 
</P>
<P>
 Not since "Roger & Me" . . . etc. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this sort of wide-release talk too heady when not just the dreaded D-word 
but the dreaded three -word is also at play? Perhaps. No one knows better than 
the three filmmakers -- all major basketball fans themselves -- that there may 
be a limited amount of overlap between sports buffs and art-house denizens, the 
two most obvious audiences for "Hoop Dreams." 
</P>
<P>
 But in Park City, Utah, interested distributors saw the intriguing sight of 
avowedly sports-phobic cine astes who would much sooner watch the IRA than the 
NBA gradually losing their reluctance, becoming involved and loudly cheering 
during the game scenes by about the halfway point. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prior to Sundance, we couldn't get anybody to look at it," James says of his 
2-hour, 49-minute film. "There were a lot of people who passed just because it 
came in the door on two cassettes. It's a terrible thing when it comes in on 
two cassettes." 
</P>
<P>
 But in Park City, where "Dreams" emerged as the buzz film of the industry's 
favorite festival, the buyers started lining up, and, James gloats, "I'd like 
to believe a lot of the people who'd passed before without even watching it 
were kicking themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Fine Line President Ira Deutchman was impressed at the festival that "above 
and beyond its important message, it's a movie that thrills audiences, who we 
saw cheering and responding very much the way they would to a fiction film" -- 
no small factor to a commercially motivated company that had never even picked 
up a documentary for distribution before. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately the filmmakers opted to go with Fine Line in part because the 
imprint's parent company, New Line, is now owned by Turner Entertainment, which 
can handily cross-promote the picture during National Basketball Assn. 
broadcasts on the TNT network. Not that they're too eager for the planned 
sports tie-ins to get "Hoop Dreams" tagged as a sports movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously basketball is the driving force and surrounding scope of the film, 
the prism through which you look at it," says Peter Gilbert, the 
cinematographer and co-producer. "But it's a film really about families 
struggling to try to better themselves and to get ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 Hyperbolic or no, Fine Line's president says he actually thinks of the epic 
documentary "in some ways as the 'Schindler's List' of this year." 
</P>
<P>
 "It addresses one of the most important topics from a social point of view we 
can talk about in this country right now," Deutchman says, "approaching what 
could be a depressing subject -- the plight of people who live in the inner 
city -- in an uplifting manner." 
</P>
<P>
 It is to the filmmakers' credit that a lot of the uplift is very much 
subjective. Some viewers will undoubtedly appreciate the picture as inherently 
indicting the ethics of American athleticism and its exploiting of youngsters 
whose odds of realizing their pro dreams are on par with a lottery jackpot. 
Others will see it as more of a mash note to a system that helps keep some 
lifeline of hope alive in the 'hood. 
</P>
<P>
 Either way it's an ode to survival. And though the film obviously has a 
male-centric scent about it -- with its supporting cast of mercenary coaches 
and deadbeat dads and disappointed older brothers -- there is a strong sense of 
woman-as-rock as well in the movie's urban maelstrom. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about their favorite scenes from 4 1/2 years of shooting, the filmmakers 
tend to come back to the sequences involving Sheila Agee, Arthur's enduring 
mother, who is laid off, sees her husband leave her and watches the family's 
power and phones turned off during the course of the film. 
</P>
<P>
 Says director James: "The scene I always think of is Sheila in the kitchen, 
making Arthur's birthday cake, and she says -- with total sincerity, with no 
trace of bitterness or irony -- 'He made it to 18, and that's great. That's 
something.' To be 18, that's good , and she is elated at that. That moment just 
devastates me every time I see it." 
</P>
<P>
 Cinematographer Gilbert: "One of the moments for me is again Sheila, who 
clearly is one of the stars of the film, after a key game when she's overjoyed 
with Arthur's success. She says, 'You always try to raise your kids to grow up 
and believe that they can do anything and that they can be anything. But you're 
always at some level sort of lying on the inside a little bit.' " 
</P>
<P>
 And executive producer Gordon Quinn: "There are things that Sheila says in the 
film that you think, 'There are people in Hollywood who get a lot of money to 
write lines like that.' " 
</P>
<P>
 A sk the trio if they've ever seen Albert Brooks' 1979 comedy "Real Life," 
which satirizes the intrusion of documentary filmmakers into their subjects' 
lives, and they all laugh in acknowledgment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ah, yes, the helmet-cam," Gilbert says with a chuckle. "My favorite part of 
that film is when (Brooks) is in the car with the wife because they have to be 
alone. She's spilling her guts about her divorce, and suddenly the camera rises 
up from the back seat." 
</P>
<P>
 There were no hidden cameras on this shoot. But, says Quinn, "we all come out 
of that tradition" -- that tradition being the privacy-invasive, 
capture-the-small-moments cine ma ve rite documentary style largely instigated 
by "An American Family," the 1973 PBS series that Brooks was spoofing, the one 
in which cameras followed the middle-class Loud family through its daily 
routines. 
</P>
<P>
 The trio of James, Gilbert and Frederick Marx had originally teamed up with 
the intention of just doing a short film, using as their initial focus a 
part-time scout in Chicago who recruits junior high kids from the inner city 
for top-ranked private high schools. Their cameras were tagging along with the 
scout when the scout came across Arthur Agee, a small but incredibly wiry 
player, showing up his peers in a game on a playground court. 
</P>
<P>
 The scout took young Arthur (and by extension, the filmmakers) out of his 
neighborhood to St. Joseph's, a mostly white high school famous as the place 
where Isiah Thomas got his start. There, the crusty coach agreed that Arthur 
had promise but informed the cameras that he had another kid, William Gates, 
who could well be "the next Isiah," that they ought to check out. 
</P>
<P>
 (Officials from St. Joseph's filed suit this month against New Line, claiming 
that the film portrays the school in "a bad light" and alleging the producers 
promised the documentary would be used for nonprofit purposes.) 
</P>
<P>
 In these two freshman aspirants, the filmmakers soon enough decided they had 
the makings of a full feature and determined to patiently follow the pair 
through their entire high school careers and into college. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Gilbert, in an understatement that draws knowing laughs from his 
colleagues: "I think there was this point where our wives were thinking, 
'Another high school basketball game tonight?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The three started off the project in earnest armed only with about $2,500 in 
PBS grant money, financing most of the filming from their own pockets. It 
helped that Gilbert, who probably has the longest resume of the three 
(including shooting documentaries for Barbara Koppel and Michael Apted, plus 
rock videos and network series work), owned a lot of the equipment they were to 
use. Not until their subjects were in their junior year were the filmmakers 
really able to win more grant money and devote themselves to the project. 
</P>
<P>
 There were only about 30 days of shooting spread out over the boys' first two 
years of high school -- then about 110 filming days in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other side is not just the shooting," Gilbert points out. "We were in 
contact with them every day or two, and that's a lot of work. And we're still 
in contact with them all the time. These are people who are gonna be with us 
the rest of our lives -- it's that kind of relationship. That, in a way, was a 
very difficult thing, because a lot of times they would be going through 
problems it was very difficult for us to help with." 
</P>
<P>
 Recalls James: "The Agees didn't even have a phone for a year and a half. That 
meant dropping by." 
</P>
<P>
 "The nice thing was that we matured as filmmakers along the way, as the kids 
matured and got more articulate about how they felt about things too," Gilbert 
says. "They would question what we were doing more. It was a very courageous 
thing for them to go along with us. To have somebody film you through high 
school, it's pretty amazing. It's a rough time for most kids." 
</P>
<P>
 The final film is a warts-'n'-all portrait -- with the full consent of the two 
families involved, who did successfully request that a few private moments be 
edited out. Among the sadder and more vivid vignettes that remain is William's 
older brother talking about being a has-been in his hometown after his own 
dreams of basketball stardom fell through, or the sight of Arthur's estranged 
father (before he found religion and cleaned himself up) making a drug deal at 
the edge of a playground while his son stops and watches the transaction from 
mid-court. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of Arthur's most important interactions with his dad in the film happen 
on a basketball court," James points out. "From the opening scene with their 
playing together, full of hope about his going to St. Joe's when he's young, to 
seeing his dad buy drugs on the playground, to his 'Great Santini' scene at the 
end where he finally has that rite of passage and expresses directly to his dad 
his feelings about him when they're playing one-on-one: 'You can't con me 
anymore.' That's the film, in a sense, in those scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the way both families handled adversity continued to amaze us. It's not 
something you see in movies about that community a lot. You see the destruction 
and people losing it, but you don't see that kind of perseverance that we 
witnessed. It happens a lot, but I guess it doesn't sell tickets or something." 
</P>
<P>
 Without giving too much away, William and Arthur are both playing college ball 
right now, and one of them still has NBA dreams, but it's unlikely either one 
-- whatever his past triumphs -- will find a career in the pros. 
</P>
<P>
 So, as these kids are made to grow up too fast in an "amateur" system that's 
just as ruthless and dictated by economics as the adult version, yet perhaps 
are caused to stay in school because of their basketball prowess, are we to see 
the sports ethics glass as half-empty or half-full here? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we were committed to the film not being a polemic either way," James 
says. "When you spend 4 1/2 years with people who have the dream, I think it 
would be a disservice to not show it in its complexity and really let people 
see it for the double-edged sword that it is." 
</P>
<P>
 But, for all the film's implied cynicism, James (who played a year of college 
basketball himself at Virginia's James Madison University in 1977) clearly 
thinks the promise of pro-sports stardom for ghetto kids beats no promise at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see the trade-off and the potential for exploitation -- and having to 
grow up fast and understand it's a business -- and you don't want to see that 
happen to a kid. But when they don't feel like there's any other dream that's 
palpable and real for them, do you want to be the one to shoot that down and 
take that away from a kid like Arthur or William? 
</P>
<P>
 "In fact, kids like William and Arthur are not stupid. There's a reason why 
they chose basketball. And far before they'll ever play -- if they ever get so 
lucky as to play -- a pro game, basketball will have done a lot of good things 
for them, along with some things that are not so good. It got them to schools 
that provided a better education. It got William and his brother jobs. . . . 
The people in the media who talk about the long shot of the dream I don't think 
understand that it's about a lot more than that for these kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe then we have to take the next step and ask, 'Why is sports one of the 
few vehicles that these kids can even hope to use?' " 
</P>
<P>
 If anything, the "Dream"-makers say, the ethics of pre-pro recruiting and play 
have been policed better in recent years. And with basketball interest at an 
all-time high, the issues won't be going away. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the world's second-most-popular sport, second only to soccer, and 
rising fast," Gilbert says. He immediately corrects himself: "Well, actually 
the most popular sport in the world is not soccer, it's fishing." 
</P>
<P>
 "Which is the story of our next film, by the way," Marx adds. "It's the story 
of two young fishermen, one from Virginia . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 "It's called 'Fishing Lures,' " James says. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the name of James' and Marx's next film is "Twilight: Los Angeles 
1992" -- an adaptation of Anna Deavere Smith's one-woman show about the 
aftermath of the L.A. riots, to be co-directed as a theatrical feature by the 
pair and executive-produced by Jonathan Demme. 
</P>
<P>
 James and Marx have also been assigned by Disney Studios Chairman Joe Roth to 
put together a dramatic film about baseball legend Roberto Clemente and have 
initiated negotiations with Clemente's son for the rights to the late Latino 
hero's life story. 
</P>
<P>
 Planned as a TV movie to air in 1996, meanwhile, is a fictional "Hoop Dreams," 
which no less a basketball fan than Spike Lee is set to executive-produce (and 
hasn't ruled out directing). 
</P>
<P>
 And of the real-life dreamers? William Gates and Arthur Agee have had peers 
knocking on their doors for autographs ever since the trailer for "Hoop Dreams" 
started appearing in theaters before New Line releases such as "Above the Rim" 
and on the "House Party III" home video. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told William the other day his head's gonna be 50 feet tall in New York," 
says James, referring to plans to run the trailer four times an hour on the 
video screen in Times Square. 
</P>
<P>
 On a practical level, Marx points out, the experience of the two "stars" being 
filmed "will rebound to their benefit in the sense that, at the very least, 
it's gonna be relatively easy for recent college graduates to get their phone 
calls returned for job interviews. I mean, what could be a better resume? 
Everybody who's a potential employer not only knows the person they're getting, 
but everything they could want to know about their character and background." 
</P>
<P>
 "That could be scary, though," counters Gilbert, mentioning one embarrassing 
scene a prospective young employee might not want on his permanent record: 
"Arthur in Spanish class." 
</P>
<P>
 More laughter: Maybe they have ruined this kid's life after all. But not 
likely. And the families involved seem not to have overly minded the warts in 
mind of the larger service of a rare dream recorded. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the first screening," James recalls, "I asked William, 'Well, what did 
you think of the film?' And he said, 'I thought it was great. You captured how 
I became a great ballplayer (and then went) to just being an average 
ballplayer.' I said, 'You liked that?' And he said, 'It's what happened to me.' 
"

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: CITY TERRACE; CENTER GETS BOOST FROM AMERICORPS

<P>
 With her 3-year-old daughter at her side, Sofia Perez listened to a reading of 
"Little Red Riding Hood," keeping an eye out as other children squirmed and 
jumped up to listen closely to the tale of Red's scrape with the big bad wolf. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez, 20, who received her high school diploma in June, is one of seven 
AmeriCorps workers affiliated with President Clinton's National Service Program 
who have been helping out at the Eastside Family Literacy and Child Development 
Center at Garfield Community Adult School. 
</P>
<P>
 The workers have signed up for a year of service that will be rewarded with 
$4,725 in tuition for college or a vocational training program. 
</P>
<P>
 The workers assist staffers in the preschool, English as a second language 
classes and the reading lab at the center, which is in the school at 831 N. 
Bonnie Beach Place. The three AmeriCorps workers not on welfare are paid 
minimum wage; those with children pay $7 per week to enroll them in the center. 
</P>
<P>
 For Perez, the service has given her training in child development, which she 
wants to put into practice as a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really enjoy working with the children and also tutoring in the adult 
education (programs)." 
</P>
<P>
 Luly Perez, 22, no relation to Sofia, hopes to be accepted to the Los Angeles 
Police Department Academy after working the mandatory 1,700 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 She also received her high school diploma in June from Garfield and has a 
4-year-old son enrolled in the center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I already have my goals and everything I'm doing is around my son," Luly 
Perez said, scraping green clay off her hands in a room where 2-year-olds play. 
Besides her 40 hours a week at the center, she takes a justice studies class at 
East Los Angeles College. 
</P>
<P>
 Ana Pearson, 20, counsels teen-age parents and welfare recipients on career 
planning. Having been in their place, she says she knows how to motivate the 
students when they get down. 
</P>
<P>
 Now she wants to use the community service and tuition to become a social 
worker. She would be the first person in her family to attend college. 
</P>
<P>
 The AmeriCorps program has increased the ratio of adults to children to 1-to-5 
in the preschool, compared with the average child care center ratio of 1-to-12, 
said Maud Shearer, lead teacher at the preschool. The center could not possibly 
have hired that many adults if it had to pay prevailing wages, said Garfield 
Principal Dolores Diaz-Carrey. MARY ANNE PEREZ

 Eastside activists Tuesday criticized Power 106 Station Manager Doyle Rose 
about the station's recent "2 Fat Mexicanz" advertising campaign touting its 
morning disc jockeys. 
</P>
<P>
 They learned that the billboards, which depict brothers Eric and Nick Vidal, 
the Baka Boyz who host the four-hour morning program, will be taken down 
permanently in one week. Rose said the station received a number of complaints 
regarding some of the original billboards that showed the two sitting on 
toilets eating pizza and immediately yanked those ads. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the slogan, which was changed to say "2 Fat Proud Mexicanz," will 
continue until the campaign completes its full run next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still don't feel today, nor do the Baka Boyz, that the boards were done in 
bad taste," Rose told about two dozen members of the East/Northeast Networking 
Roundtable, who had gathered at the American Red Cross, 5051 E. 3rd St., for 
their regular meeting. "I would suggest that you listen to them. They present a 
very positive image in the community." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that any future advertising for the station will endeavor to be more 
sensitive to community concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 But the members of the Roundtable group, mostly social and health workers and 
educators who meet monthly to share information and hold educational seminars, 
were not satisfied and demanded a public apology. 
</P>
<P>
 "Keep in mind that we're going to be monitoring your station and the 
suggestions we make to you here, we hope you take them to heart," said Raul 
Estrada, director of the substance abuse treatment center at El Centro Human 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Several members decried the billboards, saying they reinforce stereotypes 
about Latinos held by the general public. More importantly, they added, Latino 
children and teen-agers need to see positive images of themselves and their 
culture rather than the depictions presented by the station. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're promoting negativity, and that I find offensive," said Sylvia 
Lopez-Olmos, a domestic violence and substance abuse counselor for El Centro 
Human Services Inc. "I was a listener every day until this ad." 
</P>
<P>
 The Roundtable joined in a letter-writing campaign started by the county Human 
Relations Commission in response to the billboards. Rose responded to the 
members' request that he meet with them and discuss their objections. MARY ANNE

COVER STORY; EXILE ON MAIN STAGE; EDUARDO MACHADO'S PLAYS HAVE EARNED HIM A 
RESPECTED PLACE IN TODAY'S MULTICULTURAL LANDSCAPE. BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT

 Give this man a Cohiba cigar. He has what you call timing. 
</P>
<P>
 Eduardo Machado began writing "Floating Islands," his story of Cuban 
emigration, 14 years ago, around the time of the Mariel boat lift. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cuba hasn't been as topical since. 
</P>
<P>
 So it's a stroke of fortuna that the island nation is back in the news now, 
right as his drama is set to open at the Mark Taper Forum. Now performed in two 
parts, "Floating Islands" bows next Sunday, directed by Oskar Eustis. The saga 
about half a century in the life of a Cuban family that ends up in Woodland 
Hills has never before been presented in its entirety. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuban-born Machado, 41, who based "Floating Islands" on his family history, 
grew up and forged his artistic identity in Los Angeles. As one of the few 
Latinos whose work is produced regularly by mainstream regional theaters, he's 
one of the rising stars of a newly diversified talent pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Machado's appeal comes from the fact that he is interested in exploring 
cultural roots, but his work is not doctrinaire. In this age of 
multiculturalism, he is one of a growing group of writers moving beyond race 
politics to emphasize craft and storytelling. 
</P>
<P>
 He certainly has fans in the right places. "Eduardo is extraordinary," says 
John Hart, veteran co-producer of "Guys and Dolls," "Tommy" and the upcoming La 
Jolla Playhouse revival of "How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying." 
"He addresses a wide range of subjects, (and the work's) always brilliantly 
character-driven." 
</P>
<P>
 Machado also gets kudos from his fellow Cubans. "Eduardo is a special artist 
whose voice as a writer has great resonance and eloquence," says actor Andy 
Garcia, who, like Machado, was born in Cuba and came to the United States as a 
child. 
</P>
<P>
 But even Machado didn't figure on "Floating Islands' " synchronicity. "It's 
interesting politically that these plays are happening now, when Cuba's back at 
such a political point in its history where everything's going to turn around 
again," Machado says. "That has influenced me in thinking of these plays as 
something that is quite alive. 
</P>
<P>
 "(They) can say something to the problem of the moment -- that (the United 
States) makes people immigrants by your policies (toward Cuba) and then you 
don't want them to come here," Machado says. "Because the United States has had 
an embargo for 35 years, the situation in Cuba is that, since they lost the 
Russian support, they are in the middle of deterioration and starvation. 
</P>
<P>
 "And at this moment," Machado continues, "the United States government, 
instead of dropping the embargo for humanitarian interests, is rejecting people 
who are risking their lives on rafts to emigrate to this country. The U.S. 
policy seems cruel." 
</P>
<P>
 "Floating Islands," however, is not explicitly about U.S. foreign policy. It 
views social turbulence through the prism of a family. "It is my personal epic, 
the struggle of my life to get these plays to work," Machado says. "But I'm 
past thinking that writing is only a personal thing. As you get older, you can 
take a step back and see it within the dimensions of the culture." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The stylishly black-clad Machado is seated on an overstuffed couch in a Taper 
office, answering questions during a rehearsal break. He is affable but 
soft-spoken, almost shy, and given to the occasional fidget. 
</P>
<P>
 Machado takes his time, weighing thoughts about his life and art carefully 
before he answers. But when he has found his response, he looks directly at 
you. Machado's dark eyes are as insistent as they are penetrating, yet not 
without a trace of little-boy-lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it's the emotional fallout of having been uprooted as a child. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Havana on the day in 1953 that Fidel Castro landed in Cuba, Machado 
grew up in a large, comfortable household filled with relatives. But shortly 
after the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion, he was shipped off to live with young 
relatives in Miami, where he got his first taste of poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 The next year, his parents moved the family to L.A. But it wasn't until 
Machado got to Van Nuys High School that he discovered true sanctuary in the 
make-believe of theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "Floating Islands" is a version of Machado's own journey. The four-play work 
-- which includes "The Modern Ladies of Guanabacoa," "In the Eye of the 
Hurricane," "Fabiola" (seen in L.A. in an earlier version in 1985) and "Broken 
Eggs" -- begins in a middle-class Cuban home in 1928. The second and third play 
are set in the pivotal years 1960 and 1961, and the fourth, in 1979 Woodland 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The story revolves around the experiences of a comfortable Cuban family, 
displaced by political upheaval, who land in a United States that regards 
Latino immigrants primarily as fodder for menial labor. The tone is often 
lightly comic, but there are also times when it hovers near the purple emotions 
of telenovela (Spanish soap opera). 
</P>
<P>
 "Floating Islands" is more than just a case of choosing the right topic at the 
right moment, though. Despite his relative youth, Machado, who has written more 
than two dozen plays and translations to date, exemplifies a breed of 
playwright on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
 Characterized by an attitude toward ethnicity that's less strident than what 
was the norm only a couple of years ago, Machado and writers like him embrace 
their heritage, but see themselves first and foremost as artists rather than 
activists. 
</P>
<P>
 Machado may be Latino, but he doesn't define himself primarily in such terms. 
"I can only really identify myself as a playwright," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the politics of Machado's plays are seldom overt, and that approach 
seems to be serving him well. "He does not adhere to any ideological line," 
Oskar Eustis says. 
</P>
<P>
 The prolific Machado has indeed made inroads. Unlike most non-Anglo writers, 
he can claim multiple productions on such mainstream stages as Long Wharf, 
Actors Theatre of Louisville, Ensemble Studio Theatre, American Place Theater, 
the Magic Theatre and the late Los Angeles Theatre Center company. 
</P>
<P>
 He's set to direct his first film from his own screenplay, "Exiles in New 
York," in 1995. The movie, which contains three separate stories all set in the 
Big Apple, will feature Whoopi Goldberg in an ensemble cast, and is to be 
produced by Hart. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet while Machado has emerged as a writer simultaneous with the vogue for 
multicultural theater, he forged his artistic identity apart from that trend 
and rejects it. "The minute you say 'we're doing Hispanic theater, we're doing 
Chicano theater' is the minute you feed stereotypes," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not doing any of that: I'm doing theater. If I was concerned with the 
struggle of people coming over the border, I'd better be over at the border 
doing something about it. I'm concerned about my art." 
</P>
<P>
 Machado definitely doesn't wear his agenda on his sleeve, as many doctrinaire 
multiculturalists do. "The problem with theater right now is that it's not 
enough about theater," he says. "It's too much about a social agenda that 
theater artists are not equipped to solve. Going on just to (fulfill) a social 
agenda is ultimately tedious." 
</P>
<P>
 Machado also rejects one of the favorite styles of multiculturalists: magical 
realism, a genre most frequently associated with the writings of Gabriel Garcia 
Marquez, which juxtaposes the everyday with the fantastic and is characterized 
by the liberal use of poetic symbolism. 
</P>
<P>
 But Machado thinks it's a style that's peculiar to its Latin culture of 
origin. "I believe magic realism in Latin America because it is an internal 
part of (people's lives)," he says. "Magic realism in the United States is 
something that people have added on for theatricality." 
</P>
<P>
 Machado offers instead a world view that is culturally specific, but much more 
catholic about notions of community identity. "He's political in the way that 
Chekhov is political, writing about real people caught up in history," Eustis 
says. "He won't let anybody off the hook and onto a soapbox." 
</P>
<P>
 The emphasis on craft is something Machado learned at the Padua Hills 
Playwrights Festival and Workshop. From 1979 to 1986, he participated in the 
annual gathering, first as an actor and later as a writer. 
</P>
<P>
 At that respected writers' enclave -- associated with such talents as Sam 
Shepard, Maria Irene Fornes, John Steppling, Jon Robin Baitz, David Henry Hwang 
and others -- Machado fell under the particular influence of Steppling, Padua 
Hills founder Murray Mednick and Fornes, who is also Cuban. 
</P>
<P>
 Steppling cast Machado in several of his plays during the early 1980s. 
"Eduardo was a wonderful actor, a singular talent," Steppling recalls. "I don't 
think he believed in his own talent as an actor as much as other people did, 
though." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Machado never found acting completely satisfying. "When I was in 
John's plays, my job was to create this other person that had little to do with 
my instincts," he says. "And because I wasn't playing Latins, I was expressing 
less and less of myself." 
</P>
<P>
 He felt a need to convey more of his personal history. "There was this world 
that I wanted to express -- being Latin and Cuban -- and there was no 
literature for me to express (it)," Machado says. "Because of that I stopped 
acting." 
</P>
<P>
 He began to write, but Machado didn't find his voice as a writer right away. 
"I was writing because John Steppling was a writer," he recalls. "Also because 
I found myself surrounded by writers: Irene, John and Murray. But I was an 
actor surrounded by writers who did not welcome me into the world of writing 
for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Steppling, who also has a family connection to Machado (Machado's ex-wife is 
the grandmother of Steppling's son), continues to criticize Machado's writing. 
"Ed's plays don't speak to me politically and emotionally," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "He writes old-fashioned plays -- in their devices, narrative structures and 
even the dialogue," Steppling continues. "I feel like I'm reading a play from 
the '40s sometimes. I suspect he knows that and it's just what he prefers. 
Politically, we probably are not terribly close." 
</P>
<P>
 Steppling is not alone in his opinions, although other colleagues -- 
particularly those in the Latino community -- were not willing to speak on the 
record about it. The most common remarks are that Machado tends to be 
aesthetically conservative, politically noncommittal and given to easy laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 Machado has taken such criticisms to heart. "It took me a long time to get 
over that, because when you admire people as writers, it's hard when they don't 
admire you," he says. "I would have loved my plays to be like John's or 
Irene's, but they weren't. It was hard to accept that I was writing a different 
kind of thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Even he knows that he was too dependent on jokes in his earlier efforts. "I 
started thinking 'laughter is great' but you have to earn it," he says. "I 
could have become (a) Neil Simon, because I know how to do that rhythm thing. 
That's a trick. It's not real." 
</P>
<P>
 Before he moved to New York 11 years ago, Machado wrote one short play that 
ultimately became part three of "Floating Islands." It was given a reading at 
the Ensemble Studio Theatre, when the New York company had a outlet here. Yet 
it wasn't until Machado moved to New York at age 29 -- primarily to take 
advantage of teaching and production opportunities -- that he began to write in 
earnest. 
</P>
<P>
 Machado, who has continued to spend a substantial amount of time in L.A., 
writes work that ranges from a satiric comedy of manners to knock-down-drag-out 
melodrama; the emotionally brutal family fight looms large. "He has a real 
sense of drama, almost bordering on the melodramatic, which is appropriate for 
the Cubano experience," says producer Hart. "He's a young Tennessee Williams." 
</P>
<P>
 Machado has been likened to Luis Bunuel and others, particularly in the way he 
skewers middle-class mores. But he also belongs in the company of contemporary 
Cuban writers such as the acclaimed C. Cabrera Infante and non-Cubans such as 
Milan Kundera, with whom Machado shares an ironic take on the sweep of history. 
</P>
<P>
 But for all of its jokes -- call it the "unbearable lightness of being Cubano" 
-- there are other even darker aspects to Machado's writing. Like the late 
Cuban novelist Reinaldo Arenas -- who was imprisoned for his homosexuality 
under Castro and left the island via the Mariel boat lift -- Machado laces his 
stories about the immigrant experience with pained eroticism. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 -- from "Fabiola" 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The four-part "Floating Islands" epic was inspired by Machado's family 
history, but that's only the starting point. "It's still based on the fact that 
my grandmother cut her hair in 1929 and she thought it was a big rebellious 
act, that my grandfather lost his bus company when Fidel nationalized . . . and 
that I lived in an extremely alcoholic family," Machado says. "But of course 
it's my re-imagination of all these things." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than documentary, Machado calls his work "truth of imagination." "The 
truth is not necessarily what actually happened," he says. "The truth is what 
these people were thinking and feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet those who would know also find veracity in "Floating Islands." "I know the 
characters: They're members of my family," says cast member Marissa Chibas, 
whose Social Democrat father, Raul, fought with Castro and whose uncle, 
Eduardo, had been considered a front-runner for the 1952 presidential elections 
until he shot himself during a 1951 radio broadcast. (Eduardo Chibas' suicide 
is talked about in "Fabiola.") 
</P>
<P>
 "The conversations are conversations I have had with my parents," says Chibas, 
who was born in New York in 1961, the year after her father left Cuba. "These 
families are greatly influenced by the politics of the time." 
</P>
<P>
 "Floating Islands" can also be taken as a case study in rendering the personal 
political. "They're essentially family plays -- incredible intricate and 
recognizable portrayals of dysfunctional people just like us -- and yet 
Eduardo's able to tell an overall story about Cuba and, by extension, about the 
Americas in the 20th Century," says director Eustis. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Times critic Frank Rich said of a 1983 production of Machado's "The 
Modern Ladies of Guanabacoa," "there's no question that he has talent" and 
compared his work to "the lighter comedies that Luis Bunuel made during his 
Mexican exile."  
</P>
<P>
 Of the earlier version of "Fabiola" staged in L.A. in 1985, The Times' Sylvie 
Drake said it was "important work, not just because it is written well, but 
also because few plays, if any, have dealt with the immigrant experience of the 
mid-20th Century." 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, however, Rich found a 1992 New Haven production of Machado's 
"Once Removed" (1992) "a linear, realistic play that can seem Americanized to a 
fault." 
</P>
<P>
 For Machado, however, the goal, particularly with "Floating Islands," is to 
show that Cuban families come from somewhere too. "These people have political, 
emotional, intellectual and religious lives," he says. "The killer of living in 
this country as a Latin person is the perception of there being no historical 
context to you except people trying to get over a border to get menial work. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worst kind of prejudice is the assumption that Latin America, Central 
America and the Caribbean do not have sophisticated cultures," Machado 
continues. "If there's anything that makes my plays in any way radical, it's 
that I show that there's a complex culture having to do with the intellect 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 But Machado does not always write about Cubans. His 1990 play, "Stevie Wants 
to Play the Blues" (seen at the L.A. Theatre Center in 1990), tells the 
post-World War II story of a woman who cross-dresses as a man to make it as a 
jazz musician, a la Billy Tipton. 
</P>
<P>
 He has also translated Jose Ignacio Cabrujas' "El dia que me quieras" (The Day 
You'll Love Me), a Chekhovian comedy seen at the Taper, Too in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 While "Floating Islands," "Stevie" and the majority of Machado's other plays 
are works of realism, the playwright has also made forays into more 
experimental terrain. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Burning Beach" (1989), for example, is an abstract political drama set in a 
1895 Cuba that focuses on four female characters who represent different 
aspects of a culture in transition, with the figure of patriot poet-in-exile 
Jose Marti. It was staged at the American Place Theater in 1988 and the Los 
Angeles Theatre Center in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Machado didn't intend "A Burning Beach" to be as stylistically venturesome as 
it seemed. Both New York and L.A. stagings were too close to magical realism 
for Machado's own comfort -- although that was partly due to a misunderstanding 
that the playwright sees as paradigmatic of what's wrong with multiculturalism. 
</P>
<P>
 It began seven years ago, with a South Coast Repertory reading of a draft of 
"A Burning Beach." In cahoots with others, Machado decided to pull the 
audience's leg, telling the stage manager "that at the end of the play the 
dresser starts bleeding and it covers everything onstage with blood." 
</P>
<P>
 Machado got a surprise in return, though, when his script was sent out. "I get 
this call from American Place Theatre (in New York) that they want to do the 
play," he recalls. "I go in there and they (begin talking about) 'that amazing 
moment of magic realism when the dresser bleeds.' I say, 'Oh no, that's a 
joke.' And they say, 'No, you're wrong.' So we make this compromise (and have 
the) set go red at the end instead." 
</P>
<P>
 When it came to LATC, however, Machado's prank came back to haunt him. Once 
more, he insisted that the direction was a joke, only to be told, yet again, 
that he was the one who was mistaken. 
</P>
<P>
 And therein lies the moral. "Every night I would have to see this dresser 
bleed and I would just die , I would be so embarrassed that this dresser was 
bleeding," Machado says. "But I know that that play would not have gotten two 
productions if the dresser hadn't bled." 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of focus on gimmicks is what troubles Machado about magical realism 
American style. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in an interesting position, having been young in a Latin country and 
(yet) not wanting to write about magic realism, which I think is false," he 
says. "Consciously or subconsciously, writers put it in because it's what the 
marketplace is looking for. That's an easy way to have something be exotic. 
That's the ultimate in being fraudulent." 
</P>
<P>
 Machado has also had other encounters with knee-jerk multiculturalism -- as 
recently as "Floating Islands." 
</P>
<P>
 Pressured to cast only Latino performers in the Taper production, Machado 
found himself at loggerheads with prevailing attitudes. "Because I wanted to 
cast people with names like Olympia Dukakis in a few of the parts in these 
plays, I have been treated like a turncoat to my community," Machado said 
during a panel discussion at a conference in June. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've gotten phone calls, and I've been called a racist and a turncoat and a 
sell-out to the white man," Machado continued. "The only community that I am 
supposed to be loyal to, now that I have gotten to a point where my work is 
widely seen, is the community of people who have names that sound Spanish." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet now Machado says that, although he didn't know that it would be the case 
when he made the above statements, things worked out in a way that pleased 
everyone involved. "When we started working on these plays, there was a big 
hoopla here because I said I was going to hire the best people for the job," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "This time, the best people for the job all turned out to be Spanish," he 
continues. "I didn't know that in June, when I made the remark about Olympia 
Dukakis. I didn't change my mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Save for such clashes, though, Machado's career learning curve has been 
impressive. "You have to get over your conceit about what works about your 
work, and what worked about my work was that it was funny," he says. "Strangely 
enough, 'A Burning Beach' was the beginning for me of being willing to have 
people be bored and to let go of laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Laughter is an opiate in the theater, because it means that you are engaging 
(the audience) and being accepted," he says. "To be a writer, you have to be 
willing to be someone that a lot of people don't like. Silence is tough. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can sit in a theater where people are silent when they're watching my plays 
now and I don't think I could have five years ago," Machado continues. "When I 
was young, I couldn't sit through a run-through or preview of one of my plays 
without taking two Valiums. Then it took two shots of whiskey and I could sit 
through a play. And slowly it became less and less and now I can just sit 
through it." 
</P>
<P>
 So too, perhaps, have the past five years allowed Machado to close the book on 
the writing of his personal epic. "I've been living with these characters for 
14 years and they have a life of their own," he says. "They've never stopped 
talking to me. I really want to shut the door on them."

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: DOWNTOWN; STUDENTS GET LESSON ON LIFE IN SKID ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOMMY LI

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michele Schmaderer grew up in a Nebraska town of 4,000 and had never seen 
anything like the countless number of homeless people and transients that 
inhabit Skid Row. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone that I've talked to has said, 'Be careful. It's a dangerous place,' 
" said the 28-year-old woman, who moved to Southern California six years ago 
and lives in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 But her perception of the neighborhood radically changed Oct. 7 after going on 
a Skid Row tour as part of a UCLA program for students working on master's 
degrees in social work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel real comfortable here," said the first-year graduate student. "I guess 
one of the big things I've learned is that you don't have to be afraid of 
people. What they would appreciate is looking them in the eye and saying, 
'hello.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Her experience was among many eye-opening encounters for the 35 classmates. 
Most, like Schmaderer, had shied away from Skid Row until the required tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Professor Mary Brent Wehrli, a former homeless rights activist, organized the 
program to break down barriers between students and homeless people. By Friday, 
60 more social work students will have gone through the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always felt that the more people had a chance to meet, talk with and know a 
homeless person, their view of homelessness would change," Wehrli said. "It's 
very easy to put a wall up." 
</P>
<P>
 The process of tearing down those walls started Oct. 7 with presentations from 
homeless service providers and a representative from the Homeless Writers 
Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of a panel discussion, Mike Neely, executive director of the 
Homeless Outreach Program, educated students about the realities of street 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody that's scared, put that aside," said Neely, who was once homeless 
himself. "There's very little to be afraid of. Downtown Los Angeles is one of 
the safest districts in the entire city." 
</P>
<P>
 "There are very few incidents of violence against the people in the 
neighborhood. . . . It doesn't mean that your car is safe," he said, prompting 
some to chuckle along with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will break into your car," he said, becoming serious again. "(But) 
you're pretty much OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Neely ended by telling students that the homeless didn't need their sympathy 
or surprised looks -- just an open mind to "absorb what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
 After a brief question-and-answer period, students got that chance. 
</P>
<P>
 They were divided into four groups that for two hours toured homeless service 
agencies, shelters, restored hotels and after-school programs for children and 
youth from homeless families. Former homeless people volunteered as guides. 
</P>
<P>
 One group heard firsthand from a homeless person even before reaching its 
first stop at the Union Rescue Mission on Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the people down here are doctors, lawyers," said the man, holding a 
Bible in his hand. "They have good jobs. They just lost their way. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to be my social worker?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Give me two years," shot back an enthusiastic Nicholle Simmons, 26, of the 
mid-Wilshire area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do it from your heart, and do it because you want to," the man said before 
walking away. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons, who actually would prefer to do social work in the South-Central area 
where she grew up, and Schmaderer said the encounter as well as their guide's 
friendliness toward others on the street demonstrated a sense of openness, 
community and care among those living on Skid Row. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Preute, 25, who grew up in Sherman Oaks and plans to work in the 
domestic violence field, acknowledged feeling "uncomfortable during parts of 
the tour." 
</P>
<P>
 "We gained a lot of interest from the street, from the people themselves," 
Preute said. "(But) we were never under any threat." 
</P>
<P>
 The tour also had an effect beyond breaking down barriers. It convinced some 
to donate money to or volunteer at homeless service agencies. TOMMY LI

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: ECHO PARK; EPISCOPAL DIOCESE TO OPEN CENTER

<P>
 A dedication service is scheduled Saturday for a $12-million, 
102,000-square-foot center that will serve as the new administrative 
headquarters of the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 2,000 guests are expected to attend the 11 a.m. ceremony outside the 
Cathedral Center of St. Paul, 840 Echo Park Ave., said Provost John Bruno. 
</P>
<P>
 Formerly the site of St. Athanasius Episcopal Church, razed two years ago, the 
new center will include a 300-seat cathedral, office space, a gymnasium and 
underground parking, Bruno said. 
</P>
<P>
 The center also will house El Centro del Pueblo, a community service agency, 
and the Los Angeles Unified School District's Central High Continuation School, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Episcopal Diocese staff had been housed at a Downtown building at 1220 W. 4th 
St. since 1962. That site was sold in 1987 to Unocal for more than $3 million, 
said Robert Williams, communications director for the diocese. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rt. Rev. Frederick H. Borsch decided to move diocese headquarters from 
Downtown to Echo Park to be closer to the inner city, church officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles serves the counties of Los Angeles, 
Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, Santa Barbara and Ventura, totaling 80,000 
congregation members. The congregation in Echo Park totals 300 members. TOMMY

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: ECHO PARK; CLEANUP TURNS EYESORE INTO PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A community group has helped make a small park out of a vacant lot on Sunset 
Boulevard that stood out as the neighborhood's unofficial trash dump. 
</P>
<P>
 Now community leaders face another problem that will be discussed at a meeting 
this week: stopping people from vandalizing the park and stealing the freshly 
planted trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the recent cleanup, the 60-by-35-foot, privately owned property at 
Sunset and Portia Street had "attracted all the garbage and rubbish," said Echo 
Park resident Susan Borden. "There were walls there from a partially put up 
building, and those walls were an absolute magnet for graffiti," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said the area had been an eyesore for two years, despite efforts by 
the property owner to clean the lot periodically and fence it off to prevent 
vandalism of the walls. The Echo Park Improvement Assn., headed by Borden, had 
also tried to clean up the site.  
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Conroy, an Echo Park resident, drove by the weed-filled lot earlier 
this year and decided to do something about it. 
</P>
<P>
 A grant writer for Jovenes Inc., a Chinatown-based homeless youth and family 
service agency, Conroy said he received help from Tree People, a San Fernando 
Valley nonprofit agency that seeks to beautify communities by planting trees. 
Tree People used a $6,000 grant from the Yuban coffee company, which sponsors a 
campaign to improve the environment through tree plantings, to pay for much of 
the lot's face-lift last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Property owner Arthur Goldberg allowed Jovenes and Tree People to spruce up 
the parcel into a park and agreed to split the water bills with Jovenes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Land should be used for the people," said Goldberg, an attorney who is also 
the brother of Los Angeles City Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg. He said he bought 
the property three years ago and had planned to build a new home for the 
Working People's Law Center, a community law office in Echo Park. But he 
abandoned the project after running into problems with a contractor and has 
since tried to clean up the site every four to six months.  
</P>
<P>
 Conroy started the cleanup work during the summer with the help of teen-agers 
from Jovenes Inc. With the trash and debris cleared, a construction crew graded 
and filled the site with dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven 3- to 8-foot-high fruit trees, including guava, orange and lemon 
varieties, were planted throughout the lot. The lot is across the street from 
Chinese grocery stores, restaurants and a gas station. 
</P>
<P>
 A dedication ceremony was held Oct. 1, and the site was named La Paz Park -- 
Spanish for Peace Park, Conroy said. 
</P>
<P>
 But two days later, he said, the park's surrounding walls were vandalized with 
graffiti. The next day, five of the fruit trees were stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent crimes have prompted Jovenes Inc. to schedule an afternoon meeting 
Wednesday with community leaders to find ways to protect the park, Conroy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Possibilities include reinstalling a fence and strengthening Neighborhood 
Watch efforts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our original intent was this community park," Conroy said. "We were thinking 
a fence wouldn't be necessary. . . . After this, we might want to tighten 
security a little bit." TOMMY LI

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: KOREATOWN; BIG RIG GENERATES TALK -- AND POWER

<P>
 Parked on tiny White House Place, the enormous green tractor-trailer looked 
out of place Oct. 7 in the quiet residential area near 1st Street and Vermont 
Avenue, moreso considering the neighborhood is part of the Los Angeles 
Eco-Village, a community dedicated to environmental preservation. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for the environment, this was no ordinary smoke-spewing big rig.  
</P>
<P>
 Far from it -- the trailer attached to the soy diesel-fueled tractor was 
"Cyrus," a unique mobile solar electric generator developed by Greenpeace, on 
its last leg of an educational tour across the United States and Canada. The 
Eco-Village visit preceded the tour-ending stop in Wilmington the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty feet long, with 40 solar panels and 4 1/2 tons of batteries capable of 
storing 100,000 watt-hours of electricity, Cyrus -- named after a legendary 
king of ancient Persia -- has been powering concerts, radio broadcasts and 
community events nationwide since April, said Kelly Quirke, a spokesman for 
Greenpeace, the international environmental organization.  
</P>
<P>
 It was originally designed to power recording studios for the production of a 
benefit rock album titled "Alternative NRG," released last January. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided to take Cyrus on the road to demonstrate clean energy and to let 
people know that the barriers are political, not technical," Quirke said.  
</P>
<P>
 "This can do anything regular electricity can do." 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the trailer-generator are educational exhibits discussing clean energy, 
comparing it with fossil fuels and explaining the possible dangers associated 
with burning fossil fuels.  
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day, students from nearby White House Place Primary School and 
Virgil Avenue Middle School streamed through the trailer for a quick lesson on 
solar power. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't talk to the kids about the economic side, but we do talk to them 
about the dangers of waste," Quirke said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lois Arkin, who lives in and helps organize the Eco-Village neighborhood, was 
glad Greenpeace could include them on the generator's itinerary. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the first time we've had a major organization here that has had a 
resource that our community could develop,' she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man who has driven Cyrus on its route through North America is Jim Kron, 
who powers his San Diego home with solar energy. Driving around the country 
pulling a giant green solar generator with Greenpeace emblazoned on the side, 
he said, has been an enlightening experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've gotten mixed reactions," he said. "In places that are very 
resource-dependent, such as logging areas, you find some antagonism. Then 
again, one time I was at a truck stop in Wisconsin, working underneath the 
truck, and I saw these cowboy boots approaching. I thought, 'Here we go again.' 
 
</P>
<P>
 "I got up and found out the guy wanted to give me a hundred-dollar bill as a 
donation." LESLIE BERESTEIN

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: PICO-UNION; VOLUNTEERS SOUGHT IN ANTI-PROP. 187 DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERESTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Organizers of a statewide drive to mobilize voters against Proposition 187 
began recruiting local precinct leaders last weekend at a community meeting 
sponsored by Coalition '94, a nonpartisan voter education and outreach effort 
based Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Close to 500 interested residents attended the drive's initial meeting at La 
Casa, a Pico-Union rental facility, to receive phone and address lists and 
information packets on how to organize their neighborhood precincts. 
</P>
<P>
 Their job for the next few weeks will be to encourage voters in their 
community to vote -- and especially to vote "no" on the so-called "Save Our 
State" initiative, which would cut off illegal aliens from publicly funded 
education, health and social services and make public service administrators 
responsible for reporting those suspected of being undocumented to immigration 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Each precinct leader will be responsible for distributing voting guides, then 
persuading at least 50 voters in each neighborhood to vote against the 
initiative Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 They will encourage voters to follow through at the polls and conduct poll 
checks on Election Day to make sure all have remembered to exercise their 
voting rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The recruiting drive is part of a statewide effort organized by Californians 
United Against Proposition 187, a political action committee composed of 
various multiethnic organizations from throughout California.  
</P>
<P>
 Coalition '94 is the agency organizing the drive in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Rafael Gonzales, organizing director for the coalition, said the group will 
hold training meetings for anyone who wishes to be a precinct leader in 
Pico-Union as well as other neighborhoods throughout the city.

<P>
 Residents will paint, sweep, pick up trash and generally give the Rampart 
district a good scrubbing Saturday as part of the citywide Operation Sparkle 
cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 The city-sponsored effort began in the San Fernando Valley in 1989. and has 
been expanded to Central Los Angeles for the first time this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents from the five divisions of the LAPD's Central Bureau -- Central, 
Hollenbeck, Newton, Northeast and Rampart -- will participate, said Sgt. Mike 
Diaz of the Rampart Division's community relations office. 
</P>
<P>
 Rampart-area volunteers can pick up equipment such as brooms, shovels, paint, 
brushes and gloves -- most of it donated by area businesses -- at 12 staging 
areas beginning at 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to concentrate on graffiti, cleaning storm drains, painting 
telephone and light poles, painting faded red zones on curbs and trimming 
trees," said Elaine Saldivar, secretary of the Rampart Rangers East Hollywood 
Neighborhood Watch and coordinator of the staging area at Lockwood Elementary 
School, 4345 Lockwood Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be concentrating mostly on picking up litter and bulky items from the 
sidewalk," said Victor Hercules, a community liaison for St. Vincent Medical 
Center in Westlake who will supervise another staging location at Tommy's 
hamburger stand, 2575 Beverly Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents' pickup trucks will supplement city trucks in picking up discarded 
furniture and appliances, and the hospital will donate a trash bin, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants are invited to the Rampart Division's 27th anniversary open house 
and barbecue at the station, 2710 West Temple St., after the cleanup, which is 
scheduled to end at 1 p.m. Food will be donated by the Korean Restaurant Owners 
Assn., Diaz said. 
</P>

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: SOUTHWEST; VOTER REGISTRATION PUSH SURPASSES GOALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The African American Vote Project, a statewide Democratic Party-assisted 
effort launched last month to boost the number of registered black voters, 
wrapped up the first phase of its project last weekend with an all-out push at 
several south Los Angeles churches. 
</P>
<P>
 After Tuesday's registration deadline for the Nov. 8 elections, project 
spokeswoman Darolyn Davis said the final tallies of new voters exceeded the 
goal of 25,000. Davis did not yet have exact figures, "but we've gone over (the 
goal)," she said. "We did what we intended to do, and that was to get people 
who had never registered, and those who had moved and needed to re-register." 
</P>
<P>
 First African Methodist Episcopal Church, Praises of Zion and Mt. Tabor 
Baptist Church formed the core of an interfaith effort to swell the ranks of 
black voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Dubbed "Revival for Survival," the churches held rallies and called upon 
members to spread the word about registering to vote. Rallies and speakers, 
which included the Rev. Jesse Jackson at Praises of Zion, were broadcast on 
radio for 14 hours from church locations, where workers took voter registration 
forms. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is shifting gears and is now encouraging registered voters to cast 
their ballots by mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Mail-in, or absentee ballots, have determined the fate of many an election, 
Davis said. After the mail-in deadline of Nov. 1 passes, project workers will 
start knocking on doors up to Election Day to ensure that black voters exercise 
their right, even if that means offering child care or transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to let people know that they can change things, that they have to 
participate now," said Davis, whose project has three offices in the Los 
Angeles area. "It's not even about Democratic or Republican issues anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been challenging and exciting at the same time. Everybody's been working 
around the clock."  
</P>
<P>
 The vote project is sponsored by the California Legislative Black Caucus, the 
state Democratic Party, the Rainbow Coalition, many politicians and a 
contingent of 500 clergy. It is the first time such a varied coalition has 
formed with the sole purpose of recruiting black voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said the most gratifying experience of the campaign came last weekend 
when a group of gang members walked into the La Brea Avenue office in the 
Crenshaw area. They asked for voter registration forms and promised to get 
signatures from residents of the blocks they considered to be their turf. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was incredible," recalled Davis. "That's really what it's all about. If 
we're reaching people that disaffected politically, we're really doing our 
jobs." ERIN J. AUBRY

VOICES: FOOD FROM THE 'HOOD: A GROWTH EXPERIENCE; THE SALAD DRESSING COMPANY, 
OWNED AND OPERATED BY STUDENTS AT CRENSHAW HIGH, GIVES THEM A STAKE IN A REAL 
BUSINESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAYNELL GRAYSON, Jaynell Grayson, 17, is a student owner of Food From the 
'Hood, a Crenshaw High School project that's attracting acclaim not only for 
its creamy Italian salad dressing, Straight From the Garden, and the 
organically grown produce students sell at farmers markets, but for the college 
scholarships it provides students. With the help of food manufacturer Sweet 
Adelaide and salad-dressing entrepreneur Norris Bernstein and other 
professionals, the students have created, bottled and distributed their salad 
dressing to nearly 100 supermarkets and stores across the country. Jaynell was 
interviewed by Joy B. Davis. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I live in Watts, but I wanted to go to Crenshaw High School, to be part of a 
school that was vibrant and active, not gang active. 
</P>
<P>
 I've been involved with Food From the 'Hood since the beginning, October of 
1992. Miss Bird was giving out extra credit points for her biology class when I 
was a 10th-grader. Being a straight-A student, I wanted to get as much extra 
credit as possible. So I went out and worked in the garden. 
</P>
<P>
 It was fun to work in the garden, and why not sell produce? We thought up the 
name: Food From the 'Hood. We started giving produce to the local charities, 
selling it at the farmers markets and in the local community, and setting up a 
little shop in the front of the classroom to sell to the students and the 
faculty. 
</P>
<P>
 I hadn't had any actual experience, but my grandfather being a Southern 
country boy, I'd heard plenty about growing crops. He told Miss Bird the kind 
of bugs that kill other bugs, when to grow greens, not to grow strawberries 
because they were too much bother. 
</P>
<P>
 Now we work with a salad dressing manufacturing company in Hawthorne called 
Sweet Adelaide. For the first mixture, we worked with their food chemist and we 
brought them some herbs from the garden. The first batch had too much salt, and 
we know we have a responsibility to our community because of the heart disease 
problem. We finally liked the seventh batch. April 28, 1994, we introduced our 
product onto the shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 When we were writing up the mission statement for the company, one of our 
goals was to provide jobs for the people in the inner city, and the salad 
dressing is helping to do that. We still want to keep our other mission 
statement of providing organically grown produce to our community. Last 
Christmas we donated 51 boxes with donated ham, canned foods, rice, macaroni 
and cheese, canned vegetables from Crenshaw High's food drive and fresh 
lettuce, squash and greens. The garden is the basis of our company. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now we're in the process of overturning our soil. We never have to touch 
the herbs because they renew themselves. So there's basil, rosemary, parsley, 
oregano, mint, thyme, sage. We've grown lettuce, squash, pumpkins, cantaloupes, 
collard greens.  
</P>
<P>
 My grandfather cooked like nobody in the world, so I brought home some greens 
from the garden once. I cooked the greens and he made some neck bones, rice and 
gravy, and some hot water corn bread. I brought Miss Bird a plate; she got her 
fill on some soul food! 
</P>
<P>
 This summer we were literally swamped with office work. Everyday stuff 
includes invoices in the office, telephone calls, writing checks, putting the 
money in our bank account, writing thank-you letters. 
</P>
<P>
 About business in general, I am surprised at how complicated things are, yet 
how easy they can be if you demand what you want. It's OK to be assertive and 
aggressive sometimes, it's OK to speak your mind. 
</P>
<P>
 People have accepted the fact that we're kids and that we have the potential 
to be business leaders, so they treat us like business leaders now. That's 
really made me happy. Usually a person will look at inner-city kids, blacks or 
Latinos, and say maybe you got ahead because people feel sorry for you. 
</P>
<P>
 I want to go to Stanford University. I would like to study abroad. I was 
thinking of majoring in medicine, but being a student owner of a business, of 
course I changed my mind. Now I want to be an investment banker. I went from 
wanting to be a ballerina to lawyer to actress to doctor. I might change next 
week.

 I've learned that I can talk so long about something that I really know about. 
I've learned that my temper is short, but I've also learned how to control it. 
At the beginning of my 11th-grade year, I was always in the garden. But now 
that we have an office, I've learned that I like working on the computer; I 
like brainy work. 
</P>
<P>
 In 10 years, I should be getting out of school and laying the foundation for 
my own business. Of course I feel an obligation to give back to my community: 
while I'm living comfortably, I'd like everyone else to be living comfortably. 
I would like to come back here and help out. I'm not patient enough to teach; 
if I were, that's really how I'd like to give back. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that we have raw talent in the inner city and nobody sees it 
because the kids that are here don't get a chance to express their talents. 
Being able to run a business -- that's a talent that nobody knows they have 
till they get the experience. Acting and stuff, black people are already in 
that. Let's go into marketing and computer skills and technology. Let's venture 
into something else.

POOL SHARKS; BUENO, GARCIA AND VILLA CHEW UP THEIR OPPONENTS IN WATER POLO, A 
SPORT TRADITIONALLY DOMINATED BY MALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When three girls jumped into the pool for a water polo match against 
California High, opposing male players began to circle, sensing easy prey. 
</P>
<P>
 "Girls playing water polo!" said one boy with a smirk. "I'm sure they can swim 
and maybe pass a little, but how can they beat us?" 
</P>
<P>
 These girls can. Nadia Bueno, Liz Garcia and Brenda Villa are the pool sharks 
of Bell Gardens High. And for them, shallow-minded opponents are, in a word, 
bait.  
</P>
<P>
 In a sport dominated by males, it's unusual to find even one girl playing for 
a boys' water polo team, let alone three. 
</P>
<P>
 Bueno, Garcia and Villa began competing when they were 6- and 7-year olds for 
City of Commerce Aquatics. Through hard work and dedication, they are among the 
top female water polo players in the country for their age group. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia, a 17-year-old senior, was selected one of the top 13 water polo 
players in the country for girls 19 and under. She is a member of the U.S. 
Junior National women's team, which competed this summer in Havana, Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 Bueno, 17, a senior, and Villa, 14, a freshman, compete for U.S. National 
Youth age-group teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guys think we can't play," Garcia said. "They think that all they have to do 
is beat us up." 
</P>
<P>
 While the three have drawn attention within water polo circles, they must 
still constantly prove themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 In the match against California High -- won by Bell Gardens, 20-11 -- Garcia 
broke free with only the goalie standing in her way. He wandered from the goal, 
almost daring her to score. Garcia nonchalantly lobbed the ball into the right 
corner of the net for an easy point. 
</P>
<P>
 "You should have seen the look on the goalie's face," Villa said. "It was like 
'uh-oh.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Bell Gardens has seen plenty of puzzled looks while improving its record to 
18-2 overall, beating El Rancho, 37-12 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Villa, Bueno and Garcia are the third-, fourth- and fifth-leading scorers on 
the team, which is ranked third in Southern Section Division III. La Serna and 
South Pasadena are the top two teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of 187 Southern Section schools, Bell Gardens is among a handful of teams 
-- Cerritos, Anaheim Magnolia, Placentia El Dorado and Montebello are some of 
the others -- to have at least one female water polo player. Two former 
Lancers, Margo Miranda and Jennifer Bontrager, earned All-American honors in 
high school before going on to compete at UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bueno, Garcia and Villa "are good swimmers and they really know the game of 
water polo," said Hank Vellekamp, Long Beach City College water polo coach and 
head coach for the men's and women's swimming teams. "They're tremendously 
intelligent and no matter what team they play for -- Commerce, Bell Gardens or 
a national team -- they are team players." 
</P>
<P>
 "Those (Bell Gardens) girls play really good defense and cause a lot of 
turnovers," El Rancho Coach Tom Mikalson said. "They know how to make the right 
passes. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we saw three girls starting and weren't familiar with their system, we 
would be surprised to get waxed like that." 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not regular girls," Bell Gardens Coach Robert Greenamyer said, trying 
not to sound chauvinistic. "They are outstanding athletes who play better than 
boys. They're just not as strong." 
</P>
<P>
 But what they lack in physical toughness, they compensate with experience and 
swimming skills. Although they can't defend themselves as well as their male 
teammates, their speed and swimming ability give them an advantage in many 
situations. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point in the match against California, with her back turned against her 
opponent, Villa lifted the ball with her right hand and used her left hand as 
leverage. She spun quickly around her opponent until he was turned facing his 
own net. 
</P>
<P>
 The defender was so frustrated, he jumped on Villa's back and was ejected from 
the match. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one thing to get scored on," Greenamyer said. "It's another to be turned 
by a girl. That's embarrassing." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenamyer said he often hears opposing fans complain that the girls receive 
special treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hear comments from the stands," he said. "Of course, if a girl makes a skip 
shot. . . . What can they say? The goalie blinked? 
</P>
<P>
 "Good is good," he added. "It doesn't matter if the athlete is a boy or girl." 
</P>
<P>
 Vellekamp, who assigns water polo officials for the Southern Section, conceded 
that the girls might get a "tiny bit" of special treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "A good-sized guy may not be able to foul as hard against a girl," said 
Vellekamp. "Or a girl may be allowed to foul a little harder. But it's not 
noticeable to anybody but the two officials." 
</P>
<P>
 The girls, on the other hand, complain that the boys take out their 
frustrations on them. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're out to hurt us," Villa said. 
</P>
<P>
 But they get their revenge on the scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
 And another guy walks home with a shark bite.

NOTEBOOK; FOOTBALL TEAM TO HONOR SLAIN GARFIELD GRADUATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Garfield High football team will wear No. 34 on its helmets in memory of 
Carlos Alvarado, a starting fullback on the Bulldogs' 1993 Southeastern 
Conference championship team who was killed Oct. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarado, 19, was shot in the back while driving through East Los Angeles at 
about 10:30 p.m. shortly after attending Garfield's home football game against 
Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarado was able to drive his convertible jeep another five blocks before he 
collapsed at the wheel and died. Authorities, who said the killer may have 
wanted to steal his jeep, are still searching for a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked to him for a few minutes the week before and he waved to the school 
police as he was leaving the game," Garfield Coach John Aguirre said. "Within 
15 minutes he was dead. It's just a sad thing. He was in the wrong place at the 
wrong time." 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting is the second tragedy to strike the Garfield football program in 
the past two years. Coach Steve Robinson died of a heart attack in 1993.  
</P>
<P>
 Alvarado was academically ineligible as a junior, but earned a starting 
position after raising his grades in order to play his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
 "He showed a lot of potential his 10th-grade year, but he got sidetracked his 
junior year," Aguirre said. "As a senior, he made some changes in life and 
showed he was really headed for something. It's a shame he never got to reach 
those goals." 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarado, whose father was shot and killed at age 21, was raised by his 
mother, aunt and grandmother. Alvarado was attending Rio Hondo College to 
become a paramedic and working part-time installing windows. 
</P>
<P>
 About 60 people, including former teammates, coaching staff, family and 
friends, showed up at a car wash Tuesday to raise money for Alvarado's family. 
A collection was also held at Garfield last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Garfield football team attended a wake Oct. 6 and a funeral at Rose Hills 
Cemetery the next day before its game against South Gate. 
</P>
<P>
 Armando Figueroa, a childhood friend and teammate of Alvarado, remembers 
Alvardo for his generosity. He said Alvarado gave him some of his best clothes 
after Figueroa's clothes were stolen from his yard.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's the kind of person he was, a friend everyone wanted," Figueroa said. 
</P>

 Double trouble -- Quarterback controversy at Bell Gardens High? 
</P>
<P>
 Not after the performance of Eddie Negrete and Guillermo Alvarez in Bell 
Gardens' 20-7 victory over El Rancho on Oct. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Negrete, a safety who replaced Alvarez at quarterback after the first game of 
the season, completed 10 of 15 passes for 184 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Alvarez found his niche at receiver after sitting out three games 
as the backup quarterback. He caught five passes for 147 yards, including 
touchdowns of 67 and 22 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a pretty neat deal," Bell Gardens Coach Dave Newell said. "It's a 
great lesson for the other players, too. Guillermo thought he was lost in the 
shuffle but he came back and played a great game. We feel real good that we 
have found a spot he can be successful at." 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez shouldn't rule out playing quarterback yet. Alvarez proved a qualified 
backup after Negrete suffered an ankle injury midway through the third quarter 
with the Lancers' clinging to a 14-7 lead.

FILM CLIPS / NAME-DROPPERS: ROLL THOSE CREDITS ONCE MORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Richard Natale 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the truth-in-advertising front: Warner Bros. took out an ad last Sunday 
announcing this weekend's retrospective of Warren Beatty's films at the Mann's 
Festival in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "A remarkable retrospective of a man who has produced 6 films that have been 
honored with 52 Academy Award Nominations," the ad touted. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it went on to list seven films -- only six of which Beatty did indeed 
produce, including "Shampoo" and "Bonnie and Clyde." The extra film, "McCabe 
and Mrs. Miller," however, was not produced by Beatty. And when one of the 1971 
film's producers, David Foster, saw the ad, "I was surprised," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, "McCabe's" credits read as follows: A Robert Altman/David 
Foster Production, produced by David Foster and Mitchell Brower. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster didn't even give it much thought until he received a dozen phone calls 
from friends expressing their confusion at the omission of his credit, putting 
him a bit on the defensive. If he is at all sensitive, perhaps it's because 
"McCabe" is the movie on which he lost his virginity, filmically speaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Stranger, however, is that Warners would opt for the overly vague 
presentation. The studio financed and released "McCabe." 
</P>
<P>
 A Warners spokesperson insisted that the copy was correct in listing Beatty as 
the producer of six films, but that seven films were included "because they 
wanted one film for each night of the week." 
</P>
<P>
 There are no dearth of credits for Beatty's new movie, "Love Affair," the 
third time around for this tale. The ads list the original 1939 film's writers, 
including the creators of the original story, Mildred Cram and Leo McCarey (who 
also directed), and the screenwriters, Delmer Daves and Donald Ogden Stewart. 
The 1994 vintage script is credited to Robert Towne and Beatty. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a spokesperson for the Writer's Guild of America West, there is a 
provision in the guild's minimum basic agreement for the inclusion of the 
film's original writers on a remake. However, a Beatty spokeswoman said the 
guild basic agreement doesn't cover a film produced in 1939, but that Beatty 
himself, with Warners' backing, insisted that the original writers be credited. 
</P>
<P>
 Incidentally, the writing credits on the 1957 version, "An Affair to 
Remember," are not included, but are attributed to Daves and McCarey, who also 
directed the second version of the film.

FILM CLIPS / DATING GUIDE: WELL, HERE'S TO YOU, MRS. ROBINSON 
</P>

<P>
 Is there anything more nerve-racking and uncomfortable than a first date? In 
the new film "What Happened Was . . . ," writer/director/co-star Tom Noonan 
focuses a microscope on one such encounter and details all of its pitfalls with 
excruciating accuracy. But then, first dates have been fodder for film 
exaggeration for some time, as these examples show. 'The Graduate' (1967) 
</P>
<P>
 The setup: A young man's (Dustin Hoffman) parents convince him to ask out 
their friends' daughter (Katherine Ross), unaware that he is already sleeping 
with her mother (Anne Bancroft). 
</P>
<P>
 He: Is filled with dread at the prospect of crossing the mother. 
</P>
<P>
 She: Is oblivious to all of the forces at work on him. 
</P>
<P>
 First hint of trouble: He drives like a maniac and refuses to talk.  
</P>
<P>
 Disaster brewing: He walks so fast that she can hardly keep up. 
</P>
<P>
 Apocalypse now: He takes her to a strip-joint; as a stripper twirls her 
tassels over his date's head, he asks, "Can you do that?" 
</P>
<P>
 Prognosis for the future: Extensive therapy for both (after he interrupts her 
wedding and gets her to run away with him). 'After Hours' (1985) 
</P>
<P>
 The setup: Lonely young clerk (Griffin Dunne) in New York meets enticing young 
woman (Rosanna Arquette) at a coffee shop; she gives him her phone number and 
they make a date. 
</P>
<P>
 He: Thinks he's about to get lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 She: Apparently has other things on her mind. 
</P>
<P>
 First hint of trouble: On the taxi ride downtown, his last $20 blows out the 
cab window. 
</P>
<P>
 Disaster brewing: Date (Arquette) turns up dead, while her foxy roommate is in 
the other room, sculpting topless. 
</P>
<P>
 Apocalypse now: Trapped without a cent in Lower Manhattan, he finds himself on 
the run from a pack of vigilantes who think he killed Arquette. 
</P>
<P>
 Prognosis for the future: If he's lucky, he'll survive to attend her funeral. 
'Blind Date' (1987) 
</P>
<P>
 The setup: Hard-up overachiever (Bruce Willis) is fixed up with a gorgeous 
young woman (Kim Basinger) for a business dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 He: Is concerned about making a good impression on his boss. 
</P>
<P>
 She: Suffers from extreme behavior after ingesting any alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 First hint of trouble: Her psychotic ex shows up at a gallery opening and 
attacks Willis. 
</P>
<P>
 Disaster brewing: She gets drunk and embarrasses Willis in front of his boss 
and a client at the crucial business dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Apocalypse now: Her antics cause him to get into fights, to have his car 
wrecked, to lose his job and, finally, to be arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Prognosis for the future: A romantic relationship based on a 12-step program. 
'Mystery Date' (1991) 
</P>
<P>
 The setup: Cool older brother (Brian McNamara) lends shy younger sibling 
(Ethan Hawke) his credit cards, his car and his wardrobe for first date with 
dreamy neighbor (Teri Polo). 
</P>
<P>
 He: Is continually mistaken for his brother, who is leading a secret life of 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 She: Doesn't know she's in danger and thinks she's having fun. 
</P>
<P>
 First hint of trouble: Several women mistake him for his brother -- and slap 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Disaster brewing: He finds a corpse in the trunk of his brother's car and 
accidentally kills a plainclothes cop. 
</P>
<P>
 Apocalypse now: Cops hunt him as a murderer; crime lord kidnaps his date and 
demands the return of missing vase and incriminating audiotape. 
</P>
<P>
 Prognosis for the future: Sharing a life-threatening situation creates sense 
of intimacy -- isn't that what they said in "Speed"? 'What Happened Was . . . ' 
(1994) 
</P>
<P>
 The setup: Two co-workers at a law firm get together at her apartment for 
dinner -- their first such meeting outside the office.  
</P>
<P>
 He: Is a cross between Lurch and Oscar Levant -- a tall, hulking guy who'd be 
menacing if it weren't for that doofy smirk. 
</P>
<P>
 She: Mistakenly assumes that his superior attitude is a mark of actual 
superiority. 
</P>
<P>
 The first hint of trouble: He tells her the word seafood strikes him as 
"creepy"; she tells him his nickname at the office is "Mr. Strange." 
</P>
<P>
 Disaster brewing: She reads aloud from the children's book she wrote -- which 
turns out to be not your typical children's fare. 
</P>
<P>
 Apocalypse now: Will they sleep together? Or will their ingrained 
eccentricities keep them apart? 
</P>
<P>
 Prognosis for the future: Potential for uncomfortable chance encounters at the 
Xerox machine.

FILM CLIPS / THE ANSWER IS . . .: 'CAESAR' PLAYED THE GAME BEFORE 'QUIZ' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Patt Morrison 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He's encyclopedically well-read, possessed of more charm than money, and he 
intends to make a fortune on a TV quiz show, where he delights a national 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 And he takes a dive in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 Name the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Bzzzt -- sorry, not "Quiz Show." 
</P>
<P>
 Before Robert Redford and "Quiz Show," even before Charles Van Doren and 
"Twenty-One" -- the show that brought down television's house-of-cue-cards 
corruption -- there was Beauregard Bottomley. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1950, nearly a decade before Van Doren appalled the country by copping to 
his quiz-show sins, a movie ineptly titled "Champagne for Caesar," starring 
Ronald Colman, made light of rigged quiz shows in a black-and-white satire that 
is virtually forgotten today -- and shouldn't be. 
</P>
<P>
 "Caesar," which was directed by Richard Whorf from a script by Hans Jacoby and 
Fred Brady, is due for a comeback, a companion piece, a real-time concordance 
to "Quiz Show." Remember the med-school cadaver class motto: The dead teach the 
living. 
</P>
<P>
 At the dawn of the Age of Television, a scholarly ne'er-do-well (master's 
degree at 13) and his sister saunter forth from their bungalow-court flat in 
Los Angeles to watch a TV science program through the window of an appliance 
store. (This was during those few years when owning a TV was about as rare as 
owning an MX missile.) 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the crowd wants to watch "Masquerade for Money," a soap company's 
quiz show whose costumed contestants answer questions put by goofball host 
Happy Hogan -- Art Linkletter -- for cash and a six-pack of Milady soap. 
</P>
<P>
 "This man is the forerunner of intellectual destruction in America," intones 
Bottomley to the unimpressed folks outside the appliance store. "If it is 
noteworthy and rewarding to know that two and two make four, to the 
accompaniment of deafening applause and prizes, then two and two making four 
will become the top level of learning." 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, when the chronically unemployed Bottomley applies for work at 
Milady Soap, he is snubbed by Milady's president, Burnbridge Waters (Vincent 
Price, in a splendid comic turn -- no, really), and decides to beat 
"Masquerade" at its own idiotic game. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed as an encyclopedia, quiz-show contestant Bottomley, week upon week, 
unfailingly knows the eighth letter of the Greek alphabet, the second Ming 
emperor, the characteristics of upper Cretaceous deposits in Persia. 
</P>
<P>
 And he out-quips Happy Hogan, answering that "sayonara" is the Japanese word 
for goodby, "not to be confused with cyanide, which is goodby in any language." 
</P>
<P>
 The public eats it up. Whole cities grind to a stop to watch or listen. Soap 
sales bloom. Fan clubs blossom. "There's No Biz Like Quiz Biz," blares Variety. 
Boffo Bottomley runs the stakes into the millions, for he intends nothing less 
than the takeover of Milady soap. 
</P>
<P>
 Waters, like the TV sachems of "Quiz Show," had planned to wring Bottomley dry 
then dump him. But Waters has created a monster. Even canceling the show 
doesn't work -- soap sales plummet, so Bottomley is brought back. 
</P>
<P>
 Where Van Doren was seduced by fame and a check, Bottomley is seduced by 
revenge and -- chastely, of course -- by Flame O'Neil (Celeste Holm), hired by 
Waters to play Delilah to Bottomley's quiz-kid Samson. 
</P>
<P>
 Her perturbing presence, intellectual and intoxicating (that high-flown 
vocabulary! those high heels!), drives Bottomley to well-bred distraction, but 
he tests her, and his doubts, by confiding that he hasn't really nailed down 
Einstein's space-time continuum. 
</P>
<P>
 Inevitably, the $20-million question, which Flame slips into Waters' 
soap-scummy hand just before show time, is . . . the space-time continuum. 
</P>
<P>
 It gives us this scene, perhaps the best of the movie: 
</P>
<P>
 From onstage, Bottomley shoots a look at the perfidious Flame, and answers . . 
. erroneously. The nation gasps! $20 million, gone! Behind soundproof glass, 
Waters is ecstatic. 
</P>
<P>
 His phone rings. It is Princeton, Prof. Einstein calling. Bottomley was right. 
Waters passes out. Bottomley has, in fact, double-crossed Flame's double-cross. 
</P>
<P>
 A week later, with $40 million and control of Milady Soap at stake in the 
Hollywood Bowl finale, Bottomley is asked the kind of question that always 
trips up the big ones: What is your Social Security number? 
</P>
<P>
 Like Ralph Fiennes' Van Doren groping for the name of the King of Belgium, 
like John Turturro's Herbert Stempel pretending to agonize over the best 
picture when he knows the answer is "Marty," Bottomley too hems and haws 
theatrically . . . and blows it. 
</P>
<P>
 In a whimsically finessed finale of disarming ethical ambiguity, Bottomley and 
Flame -- who loves him for himself, after all -- head for Las Vegas in 
Bottomley's new convertible. 
</P>
<P>
 It is his reward, along with his own radio show, stock and other perks, for 
agreeing to throw the game, whatever question they threw at him (although he 
makes out that it's all right because it seems he really doesn't know his 
Social Security number). Finis.  
</P>
<P>
 As I said, this film drags its maladroit title around like a set of manacles. 
"Caesar" is Bottomley's eponymous parrot. It drinks; it prefers champagne. It 
appears in maybe five scenes. Even Mel Blanc's voice cannot give this bird 
verve. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the name cannot be the sole reason this movie was sent into the purgatory 
of 3 a.m. TV. Quirky satire has never been a red-blooded American pastime, and 
was perhaps especially rare and even perilous in the McCarthy era. 
</P>
<P>
 And in after-years, "Caesar's" droll prescience may have doomed it for good. 
If the quiz-show scandals were indeed so wrenching, we could hardly be expected 
to muster enthusiasm for a whimsical film that made mock of our scandals before 
they even happened. 
</P>
<P>
 The Motion Picture Guide calls this "one of the funniest movies ever made." If 
platform shoes can enjoy a revival, so can "Caesar." (Please -- a revival, not 
a remake.) After the scandal, after the movie about the scandal, it's welcome 
fun. Truly -- double or nothing.

THEATER; CARVING HIS NICHE WITH A HOT 'BLADE'; L.A. PLAYWRIGHT OLIVER MAYER, 
29, IS RUNNING ON ADRENALINE AS HIS BREAKTHROUGH PLAY PREMIERES AT THE PUBLIC 
THEATRE IN NEW YORK. 
</P>

<P>
 Oliver Mayer whips out a paperback biography of Mexican muralist David 
Siqueiros and plunks it down on the table in a downtown eatery, next to his 
Cobb salad. "I'm reading this book right now which has totally politicized me," 
he says. "I'm 29, but I look at this guy at 29 and he'd been in the Mexican 
revolution, the Spanish Civil War and he was putting himself on the line for 
Marxism. It's really exciting, galvanizing." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Mayer's not doing so badly himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in town from New York for a few days between bouts of working on his play 
"Blade to the Heat" -- slated to open the Public Theatre's season with previews 
beginning Tuesday -- Mayer is running on adrenaline. 
</P>
<P>
 He is, after all, getting the kind of break young playwrights fantasize about. 
With the Public's own George C. Wolfe at the helm, the production is an 
auspicious New York debut for Mayer, particularly given that it's only his 
third production ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Set in the Latino boxing world of America during the 1950s, "Blade to the 
Heat" tackles issues of both homophobia and racism. And as far as the latter 
goes at least, it's a world that's not entirely foreign to Mayer. "My mother's 
Mexican, my father's Anglo, so I'm not a full Chicano -- I don't look Chicano 
-- but I identify with things Mexican," says Mayer, who also boxed a bit as a 
teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a young person so I'm writing identity stuff: where I am, who I am," he 
continues. "But I'm also writing about where people stood in history." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayer's intent is to speak to the 1990s. "I like to think that there's a 
direct chain of events from the people in my play to now," he says. "The 
linkage of hands even with people you don't want to hold hands with is 
empowering. It's happening even if you're not aware of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayer grew up in the kind of Los Angeles household that you might think would 
spawn a playwright. His mother was an actor who attended Los Angeles City 
College during the 1950s -- before she gave up the theater for marriage -- and 
his father is a TV and film art director. 
</P>
<P>
 The arts were part of Mayer's life from an early age. "The first play I ever 
saw was here at the Taper," says Mayer of the Music Center's Mark Taper Forum, 
where he is now associate literary manager. "I heard the Philharmonic. And my 
Dad was really into art films." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayer says he was "pretty much of a knucklehead in high school. I got good 
grades out of negative energy because I didn't like a lot of the people who 
were doing well." 
</P>
<P>
 That didn't prevent him from applying, at his mother's behest, to Cornell. 
"She loved Nabokov and he taught at Cornell, so if it was good enough for him, 
it was good enough for me," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayer took a year away from Cornell to study at Oxford, where he nurtured an 
interest in theater. Then, armed with a sense of his vocation as a playwright, 
Mayer returned to finish out his degree at Cornell before applying to graduate 
drama school. 
</P>
<P>
 He went on to study playwriting at Columbia, under the tutelage of Howard 
Stein and others. "Howard Stein told me right when I joined up at Columbia that 
if you can't give it 10 years of apprenticeship and frustration, then you 
should go home," Mayer says. 
</P>
<P>
 After Columbia, Mayer landed a two-year internship with Jujamcyn theaters, the 
powerful Broadway producing organization. "I saw some of the worst musicals of 
all time," he says. "And then I saw Jujamcyn rise." 
</P>
<P>
 Near the end of that stint, Mayer cornered Taper artistic director-producer 
Gordon Davidson in New York. "Gordon came to town and I finagled an interview," 
Mayer recalls. "He blows you off but in a positive way." 
</P>
<P>
 As it happened though, there was soon an opening in the Taper's literary 
department. That position, which Mayer has held for more than five years, has 
given him a means of suport as he pursues a playwriting career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no desire to rise in the ranks," he says. "I just want to write plays 
and this bourgeois existence demands a paycheck. Also, I'm interested in new 
plays by people of color." 
</P>
<P>
 Reading other people's plays, however, hasn't always made it easy for Mayer to 
write his own. "For about a year and a half, I could not write," he says. "I 
was paralyzed. I'd already written three or four plays, so I was hawking them, 
changing a comma and calling it a rewrite." 
</P>
<P>
 He got back on track in part through participating in the Taper's Mentor 
Playwrights program, which calls on established writers to work with emerging 
talents. "I started writing again and for the past three, four years, I've 
written a lot," Mayer says. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayer's play "Joe Louis Blues," which tells the story of the former 
heavyweight champion's struggles with romance, racism and exploitation by 
handlers, was staged at the Los Angeles Theatre Center (LATC) in late 1992. It 
was only Mayer's second production, following one during his year at Oxford and 
numerous workshops he's had at theaters around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Like "Joe Louis Blues," "Blade to the Heat" is set in the boxing world. "I 
used to box and I had one amateur fight," Mayer says. "My first memory is 
seeing my father at the TV watching fights and my grandfather loved the fights. 
I love boxing more than theater." 
</P>
<P>
 The play centers on a group of young Latinos who are wrestling with the 
pressures put on them by a racist environment and who are, at the same time, 
coming to terms with their own ethnic and sexual identities. "The characters in 
this play are on new ground," Mayer says. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1959, if you were involved with someone not of the same ethnicity as 
yourself, it was big news," Mayer continues. "If you were gay -- or even if you 
were just independent, like my mother (who) was a Mexican beatnik -- it was 
terribly rough. In the end, I think people like that are heroes." 
</P>
<P>
 "Blade to the Heat" was originally solicited by the Public's literary 
department. "Ten days later, I got a phone call from George Wolfe and he said, 
'I just read your play and I'm thinking about doing it,' " Mayer says. "Within 
three weeks, they said they would do it." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a breakthrough, all right, but Mayer wasn't without apprehension. "I was 
afraid when I got this opportunity," he says. "I thought George will 
appropriate (my work) somehow, because he's the senior artist, powerful and all 
of that. What I found is that the level of respect is so high that he allows us 
to find things we have to find without telling us what we have to do." 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, Mayer's been able to focus on what it is about his play that's 
most relevant to his own life -- and, by extension, to the experience of other 
young Angelenos. "There's a shift that's taking place, here in Los Angeles and 
all around," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of reconfiguring of who you are," says Mayer, who stresses that 
minorities haven't cornered the market on the search for self. "You don't have 
to be of color to be in that place."

PERFORMING ARTS; COMMENTARY; BALLETIC BLIGHT STILL PLAGUES L.A.; MAJOR-LEAGUE 
OPERA HAS AT LAST TAKEN ROOT ON THE WEST COAST, SO WHY CAN'T MAJOR-LEAGUE 
BALLET GET A TOEHOLD HERE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 San Francisco has one. Houston has one. Boston has one. Toronto has one. Even 
Miami has one. New York has at least four. 
</P>
<P>
 And Los Angeles has none. Lofty and loud, proud and pretentious Los Angeles 
has no major-league ballet company. We never did. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation is embarrassing. It's sad and painful. Also, it's pathetic. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bad old days -- roughly a decade beginning in the mid-'70s -- we 
harbored a minor-league ballet company. John Clifford and his bright little 
band tried stubbornly, and, in their way, valiantly, to give the land of the 
plastic lotus an ensemble to call its own. The inherent aesthetic and ethic 
were predicated partly on hand-me-down Balanchine, partly on second-hand 
show-biz pizazz. It was an odd combination and, unfortunately, it wasn't good 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
 In those bad old days, we also enjoyed the consolation of major-league 
imports. That was when grand-scale touring was a relatively easy fact of 
artistic life, and our economy supported such endeavors. That was when an 
egocentric visionary named Sol Hurok, who died in 1974, redefined the meaning 
of the word impresario on a national basis. 
</P>
<P>
 In those days, we hosted regular, reasonably lengthy seasons by an imposing 
variety of prestigious visitors. Los Angeles was on everyone's itinerary. We 
saw the mighty Bolshoi and the delicate Kirov (everything is relative). We saw 
eminently royal ensembles from London and Copenhagen, smart upstarts from 
Stuttgart, polished stylists from New York, Havana and Paris, glamorous 
traditionalists from Australia and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 In those days, American Ballet Theatre spent a lot of time here, for better or 
worse. So did the jaunty Joffrey, which actually enjoyed an official residency 
of sorts from 1983 to 1991. In those days, the Music Center regarded balanced 
bookings as part of its cultural raison d'e tre . In those days, large 
audiences could be attracted to dance presentations at the Greek Theatre, not 
to mention Shrine Auditorium -- an ugly but useful old cavern that accommodates 
over 6,000. Awful though it seemed, we even had ballet in the wide open spaces 
of Hollywood Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't get me wrong. I'm not glorifying a problematic past. Everything wasn't 
wonderful. Still, there was a lot to see. 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't much like that any more. A few veteran dancers and ambitious teachers 
have formed organizations in Southern California that they call companies. 
Their sporadic performances can hardly be called seasons, however. The modest 
products tend to suggest workshop efforts. There is no professionalism in 
depth. No one, apparently, has the means, and/or the gumption, to think big. 
</P>
<P>
 The most dependable importer of major-league dance in the area is now the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center, which has hosted such visitors as the 
Royal Ballet of London, the Royal Danish Ballet and the Kirov Ballet of St. 
Petersburg as well as the Joffrey and American Ballet Theatre. The Costa Mesa 
impresarios -- past and present -- deserve credit for keeping the spark alive. 
Never mind that in earlier times we had frequent fires, not just occasional 
sparks. Never mind that the tour stops used to last weeks, not just days. 
</P>
<P>
 James Doolittle, a veteran huckster-hypester sponsor, has recently rejoined 
the fray. The feisty octogenarian has brought some dance, as well as 
unreasonable facsimiles thereof, to downtown L.A. and environs for the benefit 
of a needy community as well as for his own, self-advertised greater glory. It 
may be significant, however, that he sold the Radio City Rockettes this year as 
half of a vulgar dance package with the Joffrey, and the main Joffrey 
attraction was a return engagement of that shameless rock-and-schlock 
extravaganza, "Billboards." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Music Center ever gets around to building Frank Gehry's almost 
mythical, vaguely mystical Disney Hall, the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion is 
supposed to become a full-time haven for opera and ballet. Opera is doing 
fairly well there, at last. But what ballet can we expect, and how much? Who 
will pay for it? 
</P>
<P>
 If anyone knows, no one is telling us. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, we must be content, for the most part, with dancerly dribs 
and drabs. San Francisco brings Helgi Tomasson's "Romeo and Juliet" to the 
Music Center in November. "Nutcracker" season (yawn) promises the Joffrey's 
Currier-and-Ives version at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, plus one scaled-down 
edition by something called the Grigorovich Moscow Ballet (a Bolshoi rip-off) 
at Cerritos and another by the L.A. Chamber Ballet at Cal State L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 The Joffrey reprises Leonide Massine's controversial "Les Presages" and 
(shudder) "Billboards" in Orange County in April. The Royal Danish Ballet may 
cap the season, literally as well as figuratively, in the same venue when it 
introduces a mystery piece (it won't be Ashton's "Romeo and Juliet," as 
previously announced) in tandem with a controversial revision of "La Sylphide." 
</P>
<P>
 Where are the stars of yesteryear? Not here. Where are their successors? Good 
question. 
</P>
<P>
 Modern-dance companies pass through town from time to time in various locales, 
bearing numerous attractive names. The Alvin Ailey company 
(hemidemisemiclassical) brings Judith Jamison's new "Hymn," based on a text by 
Anna Deavere Smith, to UCLA in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Mini-ballet companies -- from Lincoln Center and the Paris Opera -- 
periodically offer stellar dancers in short pieces with canned accompaniment at 
Cerritos. Julio Bocca -- one of the few bravura champions who can withstand 
even faint comparisons with the likes of Nureyev and Baryshnikov -- brings a 
taste of the Teatro Colon to the same center late this month. 
</P>
<P>
 All of these attractions would be terrific supplements to the main course in 
any city's dance diet. For us, alas, they are the main course. 
</P>
<P>
 We can do better.

ART; MARGARET HONDA HAS A FIRM GRIP ON THE CUTTING EDGE; MOCA INSTALLATION MAY 
LACK RAZOR RIBBON AND BARBED WIRE, BUT HER PECULIARITY'S INTACT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Leah Ollman, Leah Ollman is a frequent contributor to Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After 10 years of sculptures using barbed wire, razor ribbon and poison, 
Margaret Honda's latest in stallation appears tame indeed. In the gallery 
beneath the pyramidal skylight at the Museum of Contemporary Art, she has 
stretched a zigzagging aluminum bracket so it appears to hover just a few 
inches above the floor. She has mounted a sliding library ladder to a bar on 
one wall punctuated by a pair of small niches, 10 feet up, and planted two 
wheeled-box forms side-by-side against the opposite wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Recto Verso," however, has its own peculiar edge and makes its own peculiar 
demands. To fully experience the installation and read what Honda refers to as 
the "creepy" medical text that runs around all four walls, viewers must 
carefully navigate the space, step over the angular metal snake, climb the 
nine-foot ladder, place their hands in dark marble-filled holes that they 
cannot see into, and resist the urge to touch or roll those two oddly enticing 
boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of movement in the piece, whether it's implied or through the 
viewer's own activity in the space," Honda says. "Not being sure of what you 
can and can't do is important. All of this will hopefully play off of the 
general idea of 'Recto Verso' -- of one side or the other side, flipping back 
and forth, not knowing how the other side of things can really enrich the side 
that you've come upon first." 
</P>
<P>
 The installation, which opens today as part of MOCA's Focus Series of 
small-scale exhibitions, is based on Honda's specific experiences. As a child, 
for example, she had to hunt around the house for marbles as an 
eye-strengthening exercise to help correct a visual disorder that keeps the 
brain from synthesizing the messages from each eye. More recently, she 
participated in a medical experiment in which she was put in a rapidly spinning 
chair so that the movements of her eyes could be recorded to show how they 
attempted to help maintain her body's equilibrium. The work is also a response 
to Honda's extensive research into binocular vision, particularly the notion 
that what we ultimately perceive is not simply the sum of the parts contributed 
by each eye's vision, but a third thing, a construct dependent on knowledge, 
expectation and experience. 
</P>
<P>
 What she wants, though, is for "Recto Verso" to be about the viewer's 
experience of the space and the sensation of being simultaneously seduced and 
repelled by elements within it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The seduction is there in the materials themselves and in your expectations 
of what you're going to find, how you think something is going to operate," she 
says. "Hopefully, the pieces will turn things around on you a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pulling the eye toward something while pushing the body away is a dynamic that 
Honda has mined since she began making art in the early 1980s. Duality and 
contradiction have threaded their way through her work, from early barbed-wire 
body armor, at once protective and punishing, to smartly crafted gift boxes 
housing toxic substances. 
</P>
<P>
 The spareness of means and seriousness of purpose that persist in her 
sculptures also announce themselves in Honda's appearance and manner. In her 
jeans and silk T-shirt, her straight dark hair parted evenly down the middle, 
she has the same pared-down beauty she ascribes to her work. The oceanfront 
cafe she has chosen for the interview is just down the coast from the Solana 
Beach home she shares with her husband, artist Brent Riggs. Home is the chaotic 
site of preparation for not only the MOCA show -- her first solo museum show -- 
but also for her European debut, a solo show at a Vienna gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 To a 33-year-old, having those two career milestones back-to-back might be 
daunting, but Honda appears simply busy. The attention is not that unusual for 
an artist whose very first public showing was at a museum just a year after she 
graduated from UC San Diego, with a degree in art history and criticism. For "A 
San Diego Exhibition: 42 Emerging Artists," at the Museum of Contemporary Art, 
San Diego (then the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art) in 1985, Honda 
presented her cerebral take on clothing -- garments with a twisted sense of 
concealment and protection. 
</P>
<P>
 In the swing of subverting convention, she went on to make body armor of 
barbed wire and razor ribbon, an ominous set of animal traps, elegant gift 
boxes filled with poison ("the most insidiously dangerous of all the works," 
she says) and installations that carpeted a floor with small lamps or inundated 
a ceiling with thousands of hanging fishhooks. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a very interesting thinker," says Elizabeth Smith, the MOCA curator who 
organized Honda's current show and who has been following the artist's work 
since its early days. "Her work has a strong conceptual rigor but also a strong 
object presence. One aspect is not necessarily emphasized over the other. Both 
are powerful and present." 
</P>
<P>
 Honda, who was born and raised in San Diego, headed to the University of 
Delaware to earn a master's in material culture after her first few years of 
making art. Trained as a scholar rather than as an artist, she is quick to 
acknowledge the difference between getting academic and studio degrees: 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's had a pretty significant impact. If you look at where someone 
went to school and who they worked with as a starting point, I have a very 
different starting point than most artists because of what I studied and who I 
studied with. Those two programs gave me a different set of references to work 
with, and they validated my natural way of working, thinking and reading a lot 
before making anything, rather than fiddling with things and seeing what comes 
out of the materials." 
</P>
<P>
 The materials, in Honda's case, vary radically from series to series, 
installation to installation. Conceptual and perceptual issues -- rather than 
formal similarities -- provide the glue that lends her disparate works a 
certain coherence. She is akin, in that regard, to Bruce Nauman, whose work she 
admires for its "frightening" ability to make you focus on something. Like 
Nauman, Honda's elastic energies also snap back to a concentrated pool of 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
 For Honda, the primary questions have to do with power, control, the 
manipulation of information and the acquisition of knowledge. In "Sift," shown 
in the Long Beach Museum of Art's 1992 show "Relocations and Revisions: The 
Japanese-American Internment Reconsidered," Honda tackles all of those issues 
through one powerfully simple metaphor. The work consists of three large 
filters -- stainless steel, copper and bronze -- hanging from the ceiling over 
a floor covered with black sand. "What goes into and what gets taken out of the 
information you receive on any subject" is at issue here, as is Honda's own 
filtered understanding of the internment suffered by many members of her 
family.  
</P>
<P>
 Smith, writing for the MOCA show's catalogue, discusses the internment as one 
of the currents that flows through all of Honda's work, charging it with a 
"malevolent element" and an "iconoclastic sensibility that seeks to question 
and subvert accepted standards of thought and behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 Not bowing to the rules is a consistent thread, Honda agrees. And two 
old-fashioned rules of the art experience that she eagerly skews are the ones 
asserting that the artist should give generously to the viewer and that what 
the artist gives, to paraphrase Matisse, should be as comfortable as a softly 
padded chair. 
</P>
<P>
 Honda's work is no easy chair, she admits with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of showing you everything and piling everything on you, it has always 
been important for me to hold something back. If you hold something back, then 
you're giving somebody a license to use their imagination about it. Hopefully 
'Recto Verso' will also function in that way. It's offering you a certain 
amount of information, but it's also asking you to offer up a little more on 
your own. I don't like for things to be too easy for people." Vital Stats

 Digable Planets' 1993 debut album, "Reachin' (A New Refutation of Time and 
Space)," put jazz-influenced rap on the map. 
</P>
<P>
 Groups had previously dabbled in the style, mainly using jazz beats as 
background for standard raps. But the New-York-based trio -- Ishamael 
(Butterfly) Butler, Ann (Ladybug) Vieira and Craig (Doodlebug) Irving -- 
shrewdly married the vocal style to the instrumentals. 
</P>
<P>
 The raps are cool, with a breezy, elusive feel, like one of those vintage 
Miles Davis solos with constantly shifting melodic lines. The Digable sound has 
its roots in the intellectual, jazz-influenced bohemian culture of the '40s and 
'50s and owes more to jazz than hip-hop. The themes are part party and part 
political. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reachin' " initially seemed fated to be a favorite of critics and a few 
hip-hop fans who were into jazz. But the single "Rebirth of Slick (Cool Like 
Dat)" was a big pop-radio hit, and the album clicked in the mainstream too, 
with sales of more than a million copies. Digable also won a Grammy for best 
rap group or duo performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Stardom was the last thing the threesome expected when they teamed up four 
years ago in New York as college students. Butler, 24, who formed the group, is 
as cool and breezy in person as in his raps. In a recent interview, he talked 
about the group's music, its new album, "Blowout Comb," ( see review, Page 72 ) 
and adjusting to stardom. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Has it been difficult adjusting to being in a hit group? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: It's not easy. It's tough to learn how to deal with the record 
industry. There's this constant struggle of trying to gain control over what is 
represented as your art. It's a constant struggle -- business vs. art. You 
don't realize that until you're deep into it. That struggle is always going on. 
It takes a lot of energy -- too much sometimes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Have you had any hassles now that you're more recognizable to the public? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Some hassles, I guess. But we're not that famous so it's not a real 
problem. We try to keep it all in perspective. We're not the kind of people who 
are going to get crazed by fame. If I didn't think I could handle that part of 
it -- and it's a real small part -- I wouldn't be in this business. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How is the new album different from the first one? 
</P>
<P>
 A: We made a concerted effort to be more literal and less abstract. The first 
album is lyrically much more abstract. The language is so personal it's almost 
cryptic. Nobody who isn't real hip can really understand it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you have a sense that people really understand the first album? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No. I think most people were reacting to the sound of the album rather than 
what we're saying. Maybe some bought it because their friends did. People will 
be able to understand this one much easier. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How about musical differences? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The first one used a lot of different kinds of music, old jazz as well as 
funk and fusion. The new one has much less traditional jazz. It's a new kind of 
thing for us. It's a whole bunch of stuff put together. It doesn't sound like 
any type of jazz -- be-bop, fusion or free jazz. I don't think it sounds like 
any kind of jazz. It's interesting combinations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why did you decide to take that musical route? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It wasn't a conscious decision. We don't work that way. We're real loose. 
We don't have a great plan. We just do what feels right -- things just happen. 
We all write. We get inspired by something, and we write it down and use it. If 
we sat down and planned things and did things in a very organized way, we just 
might ruin the music. The music has a loose feel that reflects the way we do 
things. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why did you first decide to incorporate jazz into hip-hop? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The nature of hip-hop as a resourceful art form is to use the resources 
that were close at hand. Growing up, we didn't have the money to learn how to 
play instruments. When we were looking for musical backing to the raps, we went 
to the things that were already there. Those jazz records were already on hand. 
My parents were avid jazz fans, so I was familiar with it. Nobody else was 
doing much with jazz and hip-hop, so it seemed like an area that was open to 
innovation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you like rap that's not jazz-influenced? 
</P>
<P>
 A: People make the mistake of thinking I'm some kind of intellectual snob. I 
like hip-hop, and I listen to all the hip-hop that comes out. My favorites now 
are Outkast and Guru. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you think about other groups that blend jazz and hip-hop? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I like Gang Starr, but I don't care for Us3 too much. They're not doing 
anything special. The rappers are cool but the music isn't that interesting to 
me. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Will jazz ever be a dominant force in hip-hop? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I doubt it. Hip-hop is always changing. It changes so fast that something 
like jazz would never get a chance to dominate it. Jazz still doesn't have 
great mass appeal. If something was to dominate hip-hop it would have to have 
great mass appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Conversely, could hip-hop be a force in jazz? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Never. This rap thing is just one area that jazz is expanding into. Some 
interesting things will happen musically for a while and then jazz will move 
on. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What rappers influenced you? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Public Enemy did in a big way. They make you think politically, and they 
make sense about black-nationalism issues. They knew how to get their message 
across on those early albums and really make people listen. They showed that 
you can get a point across about black nationalism and be entertaining too. I 
learned from that. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you think hip-hop is too frivolous? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I'm not sure I'd say that, but there's room in it for social and political 
messages. It doesn't always have to be a party. Hip-hop ultimately is about 
life, and life isn't a party -- particularly when you're black. There should be 
things in hip-hop that deal with serious issues about being black in this 
country. We try to do that in our music. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What are some of the black-oriented themes you deal with? 
</P>
<P>
 A: If you're black in this country, you have some scars from being a have-not. 
Listen to our music carefully, in the feeling in the horns or in the lyrics or 
in the tone we use to say certain things. You'll feel that sense of being a 
have-not. In some ways, that's what our music is all about.

WEIRD SCIENCE: STRETCHING THE MIND AT CALTECH; EDUCATION: IN PROF. TOM 
TOMBRELLO'S PHYSICS CLASS, THE FOCUS IS NOT ON ARRIVING AT THE CORRECT ANSWER. 
THAT'S BECAUSE, IN SOME CASES, THERE ARE NO CORRECT ANSWERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Imagine a planet of warring rocks, paper and scissors, based on the popular 
hand game. Decide initial populations and birthrates of each species, and then 
figure out how each population evolves as they attack each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Hint: There is no right answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Each fall quarter, Caltech Prof. Tom Tombrello comes up with such 
brain-twisting questions as a way to screen freshmen applicants for his coveted 
Physics 11 course at the Pasadena university. 
</P>
<P>
 The class teaches students to nurture the creative side of the mind -- not 
just the analytical part -- and drop the high school habit of trying to kill a 
problem with math alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "The creative process is not something that one gets to in some linear 
fashion," said Tombrello, 58, in his warm North Texas drawl. "The really good 
scientists saw the world in a different way, and in seeing it in a different 
way, worked real wonders in science." 
</P>
<P>
 In the fall, interested students pick up their screening question. In 
December, Tombrello will pick five or so students from a field of about 30 for 
the winter quarter class, based on their responses to two screening questions. 
Meanwhile, the current Physics 11 students, who are now sophomores, are meeting 
for the class's third and final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Physics 11 is a teen-age think tank, with no grades, no absolute answers and 
no pressure to produce anything but thought. Sometimes, students will attack a 
problem for weeks and never come up with an answer -- but in the process, they 
learn to defy 'X + Y = Z' thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 One Physics 11 student described the class as "paradise," replete with 
undergraduate luxuries such as paid research projects and shared office space 
in a complex within earshot of their professor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tombrello, a respected researcher and 30-year Caltech professor, 
good-naturedly admits that he believes the Physics 11 students are smarter than 
he is. Smarts are easy to come by at a place like Caltech, but these students 
are brains with killer instincts to boot, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that I can give them the knack if they don't have it," 
Tombrello said. "But I can sharpen up their ability to use that knack." 
</P>
<P>
 Each student gets a $3,600 stipend to work on individual research projects, 
funded by an anonymous donor, Caltech and the National Science Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Tombrello teaches the class in the center lounge of the small office complex, 
where a secretary keeps the coffee pot on and freshly baked cookies on hand. 
The students share offices in the facility, a converted warehouse with worn 
couches, rocking chairs and well-thumbed science magazines. On some mornings, 
Tombrello finds students plopped on the couch after all-night work sessions, 
the blackboards full of scribblings and waste baskets overflowing with empty 
pizza boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Students work on individual research projects, meeting once a week to discuss 
their progress. In class, they also take on smaller problems, like the ones 
used to screen applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 Last quarter, Tombrello grabbed a jar of M & Ms, shook it and asked students 
to explain why the peanut ones rose above the plain ones. The students do not 
get to skip the math; they have to produce equations on the blackboard, 
figuring out the effects of mass, size and shape. Afterward, Tombrello told 
them the question has no known answer that works out mathematically. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that the most frightening thing a professor can do is take an 
extremely bright group of students and ask them something the professor doesn't 
know the answer to," said physics professor David Goodstein, Caltech's vice 
provost. "I wouldn't have the courage to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of the course is to cut to the chase, the way great thinkers do. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Take physicist Enrico Fermi, who died in 1954. In New Mexico, he and other 
scientists gathered in the desert to watch tests for the first atomic bomb. 
While other scientists observed their sensitive calibration instruments, Fermi 
tore up a piece of paper and threw the bits on the ground. After the blast, 
Fermi was quickly able to calculate the force of the blast, simply by noting 
how the bits of paper had moved. 
</P>
<P>
 Or consider Richard P. Feynman, a Caltech physicist who died in 1988. To 
explain how the space shuttle Challenger exploded in 1986, Feynman dropped a 
synthetic rubber O-ring in a glass of ice water and showed how it stiffened. 
And then Feynman summed up the problem: Cold weather probably affected the 
seals on the shuttle's rocket boosters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are we finding young Dick Feynmans?" mused Tombrello, who was awarded 
Caltech's first Feynman prize, established last year to recognize creativity in 
teaching. "We hope so. That's the point. Find the ones who really will make the 
world different, or see the world in an interesting and different way, which is 
just the essence of creativity." 
</P>
<P>
 Tombrello's approach is rare, said Yale physics professor Allan Bromley, who 
served as science adviser to former President George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not at all afraid to shoot sacred cows," said Bromley, who once hired 
Tombrello as an assistant professor at Yale. "The kind of person who challenges 
students to really think and develop the spirit of innovation that all too 
frequently tends to get muffled in traditional course structures." 
</P>
<P>
 Physics 11 student Dave Bacon is studying the mystery of the sliding boulders 
on a dry lake bed in Death Valley. Scientists note that the large rocks -- 
weighing up to 600 pounds -- change position, although no one has ever seen 
them move. In a paper he co-authored, Bacon, 19, came up with a likely 
explanation of why 30 of 31 rocks move (the stationary 31st remains a mystery). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His theory is that wind gusts help move the rocks, at times when the lake bed 
is slick from rain or other moisture. Bacon, who is submitting his paper to 
scientific journals, backs up the theory with mathematical equations on wind 
velocity and friction. 
</P>
<P>
 The literature and physics major said the class taught him to think with a 
twist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, maybe you'd look at it and say, 'I have these tools (and) I can apply 
them," Bacon said. "But this type of problem, you can't really do that. You 
have to say, 'What hasn't been tried? What's new?' Once you think of something 
new, you use those tools to do the grunge work." 
</P>
<P>
 Bacon is taking on a second project -- the puzzle of the booming sand dunes. 
For decades, scientists have been trying to figure out why certain sand dunes 
in the Mojave Desert make humming noises when sand is displaced by a kick, 
breeze or other force. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Middle East, which has its own noisy sand dunes, legend has it that the 
sound comes from the bells of churches swallowed whole by the ghostly mounds. 
Bacon is focusing on individual sand grains in the booming 700-foot-tall Mojave 
dunes -- are they smoother or rougher, for instance, than the grains in 
non-booming dunes? 
</P>
<P>
 In another project, Ben Siron, 19, is trying to figure out why sand dunes near 
the Salton Sea are moving and why they "give birth" to tiny, faster-moving sand 
dunes. The dunes, which are a few hundred feet long and 30 feet high, move 
several feet a year, and sometimes head on a collision course with a road or 
canal. Siron's research focuses on the direction of the wind, the amount of 
sand in the area and the ruggedness of the terrain. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Outside class, even late bloomers to physics are starting to question the hows 
and whys of life at every turn. Physics 11 student Sebastian Maurer had only 
one high school physics course. Now, at home, the 19-year-old will 
absent-mindedly twirl a ring on his pen, and then try to predict the 
oscillation frequency. Or he will put a fan in front of his TV and study how 
the picture wavers. Then, he tries to calculate how fast the fan is spinning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look around and say, 'What kind of fun can I have now?' " said Maurer, 
working barefoot in his office one day. "Through this class, I learned I can 
solve problems -- not just to solve a math problem in a textbook, but ones that 
have bearing on nature around us." 
</P>
<P>
 Before class one recent afternoon, students swapped logic problems just for 
fun, their voices raised as they tried to talk over each other's ideas, their 
minds working faster than their mouths. Tombrello jumped into the fray, tossing 
out a twist on the traditional tick-tack-toe game, in which players are allowed 
to switch their "X" or "O" position with an opponent's, in lieu of making a new 
move. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not easy selecting students who will fill the handful of available slots 
for the Physics 11 class, so Tombrello must give his full attention to dreaming 
up the tricky screening questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you want to pick is something slightly outrageous and stated in an 
incomplete way, so their imagination can take hold," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of this year's two screening questions, which students must return by Oct. 
24: An interstellar expedition is on a centuries-long, one-way voyage to a 
planetary system for colonization. They have exhausted their stored food and 
are limited to the food resources they can produce. So students must figure out 
a plan of strategic cannibalism, or whom to eat first, so that the group ends 
up at its destination with an optimal population. 
</P>
<P>
 Tombrello's students help pick their successors. The students are usually more 
demanding than he is, dismissing applicants who have good ideas but do not back 
them up with math. Some freshmen turn in responses as long as 30 pages backed 
with computer programs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In one of last year's screening questions, students looked at an imaginary 
world based on Tombrello's wording of a 1940s song. He used: "Mares eat oats 
and does eat oaks and little lambs eat ivy." The question: Assume a small, 
equal number of each type of animal and type of vegetation; assuming that all 
compete for space, describe the evolution of the ecosystem. 
</P>
<P>
 One student came up with "The Oak Catastrophe" theory. Say the oaks dropped 
acorns with a long germination period. Meanwhile, the animals eat up all the 
food. Then, there's nothing to eat, so they die too. But the acorns are time 
bombs. They grow, and there is nothing to eat them. And they become so big that 
their shade kills any other plants that grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Clever, Tombrello said, but the student made one big mistake: She did not back 
up her theory with math. She did not get in. 
</P>
<P>
 The ones who do get in, Tombrello said, are "potential superstars" at a place 
that has had 22 Nobel Prize-winning alumni and faculty. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life isn't problem-solving, right?" said student Connie Chang, 19. "Life is 
the process of searching for the answer."

A RETURN ENGAGEMENT FOR COMPTON PLAYERS OF '55; RACE RELATIONS: FORMER JUNIOR 
COLLEGE FOOTBALL CHAMPIONS ARE INVITED FOR A REUNION WITH THE TEAM THEY 
DEFEATED. THE SCHOOL WAS THE FIRST IN MISSISSIPPI TO PLAY AN INTEGRATED 
OPPONENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. MICHAEL KENNEDY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One is a loan consultant. Another was a former all-pro safety with the 
SanDiego Chargers who committed suicide in January. His twin brother will 
retire later this year after a long career with the Northrop Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 No one seems to know for certain what happened to a couple of them. One was 
listed as Nat Washington in the yearbook, though some seem to think his first 
name might actually be Nate. 
</P>
<P>
 There were eight in all, the black players on the 1955 Compton team that won 
the junior college national championship: Billy Brown and Joe Lewis; Charles 
McNeil and his brother, Edis; Lee Sampson and Lee Mack; Jim Waddell and 
Washington, Nat or Nate. And now, after all those years and careers and 
children, those who are still alive are being drawn back together. 
</P>
<P>
 The magnet is an unlikely one -- a little junior college in Mississippi that 
Compton defeated for the national title, in a game played at the Rose Bowl in 
Pasadena. Jones Junior College of Ellisville, Miss., wants to bring the black 
Compton players south next year, let them ride in a homecoming parade, honor 
them at a lunch and take them to a football game. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a gesture to show how the bad times of segregation have turned for the 
better. For Jones Junior College was the first school in Mississippi to play an 
integrated opponent, and not without an ugly fuss. That opponent was Compton. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no organized effort to bring the Compton players to Mississippi, no 
great pronouncements of how such a move would enhance the school's reputation. 
Rather, it was the idea of a retired country newspaper editor who wrote a book 
titled "Mississippi's Defiant Years" about the segregationist days of the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 The players, those who have been found, have been both stunned by the offer 
and pleased that it has actually happened. They are in their late 50s and early 
60s, at the closing years of their careers. The sudden notoriety has caught 
them off guard. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's funny how times change," said Edis McNeil, who has spent 22 years as a 
painter for Northrop. "I think it's beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The same is true for Mack, a Compton star who broke his hip in the last game 
of the regular season and sat on the sidelines in a wheelchair during the fight 
for the national championship with the Jones Bobcats. 
</P>
<P>
 "For them to recognize that time after 40 years, it's an honor," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampson, the loan consultant who has been the driving force in finding most of 
the players, agrees. "We need to put the past behind us and make it a better 
place for our next generation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 This is, to be sure, a little-known historical footnote. There may have been a 
major fuss in Mississippi, but little of the rancor found its way outside the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, to be honest, those kids were real nice. It was the older people who 
caused the trouble," Mack said.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1955, almost seven years before James Meredith became the first black 
student at the University of Mississippi, Jones Junior College was riding high. 
Its football team was ranked second nationally among junior colleges and was 
invited to play in the Junior Rose Bowl. The team ranked first in the nation 
that year was the undefeated, untied Compton Junior College. 
</P>
<P>
 Then word began to spread in Mississippi that there was a problem. The local 
press began to publish reports that Compton had black players on the squad. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then everything went backward," said Erle Johnston. "The lieutenant governor 
who made such a big speech about how he was going to be such a big booster 
decided not to even go." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The board of supervisors from the neighboring county announced that it was 
withdrawing support for the college band, which was trying to raise money to 
make the trip. The editor of the state's largest daily newspaper wrote that 
there "is no middle ground on the subject of segregation, nor should any 
exceptions be made." 
</P>
<P>
 The Jones team voted to play anyway and, for its trouble, lost the game 22-13. 
McNeil, who would later go on to play for the Chargers, was named the game's 
most valuable player. Waddell, the Compton player targeted by the Bobcats as 
the running back to key on, was injured in the first quarter and was out of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the contest, the players from Compton and Jones went on their 
separate paths until Johnston's idea spawned the search for the black players 
of the Compton Tartars. 
</P>
<P>
 "A great gesture toward race relations" was how he saw it. And so he began 
lining up sponsorships for air fares and lodging even before he knew whether 
any of the Compton players could be found. "It's all full speed ahead," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Compton's alumni association was only this year being revitalized after 
decades of dormancy. There was no record at the school about where any of the 
graduates could be found. The only clue was the file that showed where their 
transcripts had been sent after graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Mississippi, it was not an open and shut case of welcoming the Compton 
players to the 40th reunion. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't make a lot of sense to bring in a bunch of guys who kicked your 
butt," said Paul Barrett, editor of the nearby Laurel Leader-Call. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy Stites, the director of alumni affairs at Jones, said she wondered if it 
might change the tenor of next year's reunion and said Johnston's idea was 
greeted at first with mixed feelings. "They (the team members) don't feel like 
they were responsible for any history being made," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Terrell Tisdale, the current president of Jones, liked the idea, and so 
did Ken Schultze, who was the team captain in 1955. Tisdale was a tuba player 
in the band that went to Pasadena for the game. "If any of them want to come, 
they would be very welcome," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schultze is amused by the irony of how things were then and how they are now. 
"If you look at Ole' Miss and Mississippi State, their teams are almost all 
black now." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Finding the players has been an ongoing struggle at Compton Community College. 
Those in the public spotlight, the ones who went on to play pro ball, were 
easiest to track down. And sometimes, it is their children who have kept them 
more visible long after their own glory has faded. McNeil's daughter is tennis 
star Lori McNeil. 
</P>
<P>
 Mack's son, Shane, plays for the Minnesota Twins. Another of his four boys, 
Quinn, is a promising player in the Seattle Mariners' farm system. Mack lives 
in Inglewood and works as a baggage handler for American Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Others have been harder to find. Billy Brown is a question mark, though there 
is a story that he worked in a copper smelter for many years. Washington has 
been difficult to track down, though Mack said he heard he had died. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis played for the Pittsburgh Steelers and Baltimore Colts, but neither team 
has a record of what happened to him later. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampson has been working to find the players who are left. Compton, spurred on 
by the Mississippi reunion, is trying to find all the players -- black and 
white -- from the 1955 team. The plan is for a reunion here next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Waddell said he is even looking forward to finding the Jones player who kicked 
him in the eye in the first quarter of the game. He wants to buy him lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 As the cobwebs have receded for Waddell about those days, it occurred to him 
that it was the Jones Bobcats who deserved the praise, even though they lost 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sense, a visit by the Compton players is a testimony to that time when 
the Jones Bobcats took a vote and decided that they would rather play football 
and risk the consequences of blatant racism. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are the ones who had to show a lot of courage," he said. "All the 
rhetoric before the game was pressure put on them from their own state and 
town."

WEAVING MEMORIES; PARENTS FASHION QUILT TO REMEMBER YOUNG VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 They come Saturdays with bulging scrapbooks and framed family photographs 
cradled carefully in their arms. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The parents of children killed in drive-by shootings and stabbings gather at a 
storefront in South-Central Los Angeles in hopes of putting a personal face on 
an all-too-often anonymous crime statistic in the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 They are sewing together a quilt that uses pictures and words to depict the 
lives of 18 young murder victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was 14. He was at a Valentine's Day party," says Hattie Ellis, leafing 
through the bound family album crammed with memories of son Renard Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here, this is his birth certificate," says Ellis, pulling it from beneath a 
plastic page covering. There's a resolution from the City Council, which 
adjourned in her son's memory after his 1987 murder. There's the pathology 
report that shows there were no drugs or alcohol in her son's body when he 
died. There are happy school pictures and sports photos. 
</P>
<P>
 The photographs and mementos Ellis and the others brought with them are being 
reproduced on fabric at a copy shop and then sewn to 30-inch patches of cloth 
that make up the quilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Its 18 squares depict the young victims as their parents remember them -- 
bright-eyed and innocent, not coroner's case listings or homicide file numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Smith attached a brilliant gold border around the photo of his son, 
Hushun Smith, shot in the back last year at age 21. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll put some words on it next. I have to go down in my soul and get the 
thoughts back up -- I've kept them down," the salesman said as he worked on his 
swatch. "I'm doing this for my benefit. I want to keep my son's memory alive." 
</P>
<P>
 But the parents admit their stitch work is for others, as well. Maybe the 
faces on the quilt will motivate government leaders to spend more on crime 
prevention. Maybe they will shame a few gang-bangers into putting away their 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "All these good-looking faces staring out at you has to have an effect," said 
Myrtle Faye Rumph, who has sewn the Statue of Liberty medallion and the watch 
her son was wearing when he was killed in a 1989 drive-by shooting next to his 
high school graduation picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumph helped organize the quilt makers and invites them each Saturday morning 
to the Western Avenue storefront, headquarters for the Al Wooten Jr. Heritage 
Center. That is the nonprofit youth center Rumph started four years ago and 
named after her slain son. 
</P>
<P>
 The quilt will be taken to City Hall and shown to politicians when it's 
finished, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will tell people what's going on," Rumph said. "It will tell people 
there's a crisis going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Victims' parents were recruited for the quilt project through churches and 
family counseling centers. Several experienced quilt makers are helping teach 
sewing and photo-transfer techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the things they are putting on the quilts make me cry," said quilter 
Ann Anderson, a Manhattan Beach computer saleswoman.  
</P>
<P>
 Linda Clark's son was shot to death in late 1991. She pulls a newspaper 
clipping from her scrapbook: "Drive-by Shooting Kills College-Bound Athlete," 
reads the headline. 
</P>
<P>
 "James was 19. This is him when he was born. This is a picture of him when he 
was 14 wearing a football jersey. That's the picture I'm going to use on the 
quilt," Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Across the room, Maglean May is starting to sew the words "Joseph Rueben May, 
July 1961-March 1993" next to a smiling portrait of her son. 
</P>
<P>
 "He loved cars. I think I'm going to put a car up here," she said, pointing to 
the upper-right corner. "This is very difficult -- I had to lie down after 
sewing his picture on. But it's something I have to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Over by the door, Cathy Bower has sewn a fabric-transferred photograph of her 
brunet daughter, Bethany, onto a heart. There are souvenir patches from rock 
'n' roll groups Kiss, the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin positioned around the 
heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "She loved music," said Bower, an office administrator from El Segundo. Her 
daughter was working in an anti-narcotics program when a drug user stabbed her 
to death in 1988, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every push of the needle through this cloth was like a knife in my heart," 
Bower said. "But maybe this will give meaning to our children's lives. Maybe it 
will have the impact of stopping other people before they're dead in their 
tracks." 
</P>
<P>
 Television actor Ron Glass, who starred in "Barney Miller" and "The New Odd 
Couple," agrees. Glass is a Wooten Center volunteer who introduced retired 
businessman Costantin Patarias to the center after Patarias proposed the 
drive-by victims' blanket idea after seeing a similar quilt made for AIDS 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope this is a powerful wake-up call in terms of people recognizing these 
are real people's lives," Glass said. "The ones who have passed on. And the 
ones left behind."

THE LONE RANGERS; CRIME, PEOPLE SPARSE IN VAST PATROL ZONE

<P>
 14:00 hours . Deputies Randy McNary and Bill Axelrod report to work for what 
is often the loneliest shift in the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Today they are the only law force in a 600-square-mile chunk of unincorporated 
territory in the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 How lonely is it out there for a pair of law enforcement officers? 
</P>
<P>
 Let's just say that the most exciting event of their shift is catching a 
15-year-old urinating against a building. 
</P>
<P>
 We are a long way from "NYPD Blue." 
</P>
<P>
 14:50 hours. McNary, 28, is behind the wheel. His route is largely at his 
discretion, unless a call comes in via radio or the computer terminal mounted 
near the dash. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a lot of choices. The territory stretches north along the Golden State 
Freeway from the Antelope Valley Freeway interchange to the Kern County line. 
From west to east, it ranges from the Ventura County line to near the edge of 
the Leona Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies who work the area have pointed out that getting to a trouble scene in 
a prudent amount of time can be a problem when they happen to be on the other 
side of the territory. Nonessential calls naturally get put on the back burner. 
</P>
<P>
 "When someone asks us to come out to handle a burglary, it can take a couple 
of hours," says Axelrod, 38. 
</P>
<P>
 The largely unpopulated territory does have a few potential trouble spots. 
There's Six Flags Magic Mountain, the impoverished community of Val Verde where 
numerous gang members reside, and the area around the Peter J. Pitchess Honor 
Rancho county jail, where the deputies are sometimes called in to search for an 
escapee. Along the maze of winding roads leading into desert hills are 
scattered mobile homes and other dwellings sometimes used for drug labs. 
</P>
<P>
 McNary drives up Lake Hughes Road toward the northeast corner of the 
territory, to the town of Three Points, population 150. 
</P>
<P>
 Axelrod talks about the contrasts between patrolling the territory and his 
last post in West Hollywood, where his assignments included posing as a male 
prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
 The deputy knew he was no longer in the city when one night on patrol in the 
territory he received a call to help in a domestic matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to one house, basically to tell a 10-year-old boy he has to go to 
bed," he says. "I couldn't believe it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said to myself, 'What am I doing out here?' " 
</P>
<P>
 16:45 hours. All is quiet in Three Points. 
</P>
<P>
 While heading back to the heart of the territory, McNary pulls into Los 
Angeles County Fire Department Station 149 in Castaic to use the restroom. The 
fire station is like a branch office where the deputies often stop to write 
reports and handle other administrative duties. 
</P>
<P>
 Axelrod waits outside, smoking a cigarette. This has not been a good day to 
bolster arguments in favor of adding more patrols to the territory. 
</P>
<P>
 But just as the deputies leave the station, they spot a group of teen-age boys 
at the side of an abandoned convenience store. One of them is a 15-year-old 
with the sides of his head shaved and a long pony tail. He is the urinator. 
</P>
<P>
 McNary and Axelrod spring into action. McNary pulls the car over, gets out and 
approaches the teen-ager, who has finished relieving himself. The deputy 
searches the youth and then tells him his action is illegal and could land him 
in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager has only a weak excuse. "It's all water," he says, quietly. 
</P>
<P>
 McNary and Axelrod let him go with a warning. 
</P>
<P>
 18:15 hours. Of course, on some days the deputies find themselves in far more 
serious situations. As they drive past a mobile home park near Val Verde, they 
point out a mobile home with boarded-up windows. They are all too familiar with 
the man who lives there. 
</P>
<P>
 "He beats his wife, he sells dope and he has lots of guns," Axelrod says. "But 
he's real cool to us because he's on parole." 
</P>
<P>
 The deputies return to the Santa Clarita station so McNary can make a 
correction on a police report from the night before. Like law enforcement 
officers everywhere, he views paperwork with disdain. 
</P>
<P>
 "One call can eat up your entire shift, especially if you have a suspect in 
custody," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 21:45 hours. McNary pulls into the Santa Clarita station after driving more 
than 200 miles during his shift, a personal record. 
</P>
<P>
 Both deputies insist this is the first time they have gone through an entire 
shift without one call. 
</P>
<P>
 McNary collects his equipment and prepares to head to his Santa Clarita home 
and his family. Axelrod isn't as lucky -- he has volunteered for overtime and 
is scheduled to patrol another shift in Canyon Country at 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 23:00 hours. Two students from a Christian college are having a private prayer 
devotional in a parking lot near Magic Mountain when three men wearing orange 
pants emerge from the brush. 
</P>
<P>
 The three men, who had just escaped from Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho, 
carjack the students' pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Unhurt but truckless, the students call for help at a nearby hotel. A manhunt 
for the three escapees begins. 
</P>
<P>
 McNary and Axelrod missed the excitement. But it probably would have meant 
doing a lot of paperwork.

TIFFANY TASTES ON A THRIFT-STORE BUDGET; COMMERCE: THOUSANDS OF VALUE-SEEKERS 
THRONG GOODWILL'S SALE OF PREMIUM GOODIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 She could have had her pick from a rack of fur coats all under $50, a pair of 
blue-and-gray Tony Lama boots for $27 or matching crystal decanters at $24.99 
apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead, Renate Smart of Reseda was attracted to a red suede belt for 
under $2. She had a dress in mind she hoped it would go with. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, unable to withdraw with her pocketbook still intact, Smart joined a 
small crowd in jewelry. After intently examining rings, necklaces and trinkets, 
she put a large silver brooch under the magnifying glass to inspect an inlaid 
swan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doesn't it look like a Lalique?" the crisply dressed Smart asked in a 
European inflection. "It's not, but it's handmade. It's got an artist's name. 
It's unusual. I've never seen anything like it." 
</P>
<P>
 She had the sales clerk wrap it in a plastic bag. Total for the shopping 
spree? $15.98. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't get bargains like that every day. 
</P>
<P>
 Smart was one of the thousands of value-seekers who showed up at Goodwill 
Industries' Valley plant Saturday for the opening day of the annual Preferred 
Merchandise Sale. 
</P>
<P>
 All year long, as donated goods come in, Goodwill's marketing specialists set 
aside the rare finds: antiques, china, fur, beaded gowns, silk ties and 
collectibles. 
</P>
<P>
 An antiques dealer helps price the goods at a cut below fair market value. 
Then, in a pair of two-day merchandising binges, it all goes up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's sale began two weekends ago at Goodwill's main headquarters on San 
Fernando Road in northeast Los Angeles. When the doors opened at 9 a.m. 
Saturday at the Valley plant next to the Department of Public Social Services 
on Lanark Street, hundreds of shoppers were waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody wants to get in the door first," said Tracy Powers, director of 
sales and marketing for Goodwill of Southern California. "We couldn't get the 
door open." 
</P>
<P>
 The memorable items were gone in a flash: a six-piece setting of Spode 
dinnerware sold for $84.99, a pre-World War II Rolex watch for $1,000 and a 
three-quarter-length sable jacket, slightly coming apart at the seams, for 
$500. 
</P>
<P>
 "All somebody has to do is take it to a furrier and they'll have a jacket 
worth tens of thousands of dollars," Powers said. 
</P>
<P>
 By noon, the bargain-basement crush had dissipated to a Nordstrom-like calm as 
about 20 milled about quietly. You couldn't sell a baseball card to this crowd, 
but the two jewelry counters stayed busy all day long. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Sills and his companion, Jeannie White, spent 20 minutes picking five 
silver rings and a silver necklace out of the hundreds of items on display. 
</P>
<P>
 "My daughters are going to be happy," said Sills, a Van Nuys machine shop 
owner and confessed thrift-shop junkie. "Last year I bought them leather 
jackets." 
</P>
<P>
 Then White spotted three small pewter locomotives priced at $15 apiece and 
grabbed one impulsively. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's Merry Christmas to Iowa," the transplanted Midwesterner said. "I have 
friends who collect pewter. I know they don't have any trains." 
</P>
<P>
 She figured she'd pay three times as much for them from a catalogue.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun more than anything else," Smart said, clutching her two carefully 
chosen purchases. "If you go to a department store, every one has the same 
thing at the same season. Here, it's like a treasure hunt." 
</P>
<P>
 Treasure hunters put $21,000 into the register Saturday. The sale resumes 
today at 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if you missed the three-quarter-length sable jacket, there's still a rack 
of fur and plenty of unexpected finds, like a Body Glove one-piece wet suit for 
$99.99.

WHERE ALL VOTERS ARE LANDLORDS; SAN FERNANDO: LEASE AGREEMENT FOR OLD POLICE 
STATION WILL BE DECIDED IN NOVEMBER ELECTION. SPECIAL BALLOTS COULD COST 
$13,000 TO $15,000. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 If small-town governing is sometimes a quirky business -- with the local 
police chief acting as mayor, or a law on the books mandating church attendance 
-- San Fernando has a favorite quirk of its own: 5,920 landlords overseeing its 
old police station. 
</P>
<P>
 In most American cities, officials manage city property. Here, the voters are 
the keepers of 120 MacNeil St. And they manage by election. 
</P>
<P>
 Needless and costly elections, say critics. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a pain in the neck," longtime City Councilman Doude Wysbeek said of the 
unusual 8-year-old ordinance. "It's a thorn in our side." 
</P>
<P>
 And the thorn is pricking for the third time since the law was passed in 1986, 
as the city, seeking to lease the building to the Los Angeles city attorney's 
branch office, has been forced to place the issue on the Nov. 8 ballot.  
</P>
<P>
 The law is the child of disagreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Carmillas M. Noltemeyer, who spearheaded the effort to pass the ordinance when 
she was a councilwoman, said it may rub some people the wrong way but it was 
necessary to mitigate "the poor decisions of the San Fernando City Council." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986 it became obvious to all that the time had come for a new police 
station in San Fernando. Four of the five City Council members voted to swap 
the old station, at 120 MacNeil St., for a nearby piece of land belonging to 
Los Angeles County, and build a new police facility there. 
</P>
<P>
 Noltemeyer, however, didn't like either the land swap or the notion of 
building a new police station. The old one, she said, should simply be 
refurbished. 
</P>
<P>
 So she rounded up supporters, collected a little more than 1,000 signatures 
and put the ordinance on the ballot. It passed. 
</P>
<P>
 The city, saying it would take too long to get voter approval for the swap, 
purchased the county lot and went about building the new police station.  
</P>
<P>
 The law, supporters say, is a way of keeping tabs on city "shenanigans" and 
making sure the town of 22,000 gets the most from its property. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think anything that has to do with city-owned property should go before the 
voters," Noltemeyer said, adding that the lease on the November ballot was a 
poor deal for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending the ordinance, she said: "It isn't my saying it. The people said 
they want it." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, voters upheld the ordinance in 1990, narrowly defeating an initiative 
that would have rescinded it. 
</P>
<P>
 But every time the issue makes a ballot, the city coffers shrink. The November 
vote -- asking if the Los Angeles attorney's office should be granted a 
$6,300-per-month lease for five years -- will cost San Fernandans between 
$3,000 and $4,000 just to piggyback on the countywide ballot. In terms of 
administrative hours, the cost is much higher, officials point out. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1990 effort to overturn the ordinance cost the same amount. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, voters were asked this question: Lease space to the federal 
Drug Enforcement Agency, yea or nay? This time, the measure cost very little 
because it joined others on a city ballot for an election that was being held 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it has not yet happened, should the city have to hold a special 
election on the future tenants of the building, that would cost $13,000 to 
$15,000 in election costs alone, said City Administrator Mary Strenn. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of all that, some question what caliber of landlords voters make, 
especially when they may be inadequately informed about the terms of the leases 
or the prospective tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Moon, the city's director of finance, said leases and other land matters 
are often complicated, esoteric deals that are impossible to explain in a 
ballot measure. So, he said, residents may not understand the question even as 
they cast their votes. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance "screwed up the whole process," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the ordinance -- many of whom have criticized the City Council 
on other issues -- say the cost of putting such proposals to a vote is small 
when compared with the money that might be lost if the city entered into a poor 
business deal. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials, whether they agree or disagree with the premise of the 
ordinance, have taken it largely in stride. Quirky or no, this is the law of 
the land in San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue may have long passed," said Strenn, speaking of the land-swap 
controversy that prompted the ordinance, "but the requirement remains. It's 
obviously unusual and costly, but . . . it is the law, and so we are following 
it."

VALLEY BRIEFING: THEY'RE BACK; SANTA ANAS BLOW BACK INTO TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Santa Ana winds are on their way, and with them comes the reminder of the 
wildfires last fall that claimed 1,241 structures, almost 200,000 acres and $1 
billion in damages. Three people, each from Topanga Canyon, lost their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana season runs from late summer to autumn, but sometimes extends into 
winter, knocking out power, tripping burglar alarms and whipping up other bits 
of mischief as desert winds blow. 
</P>
<P>
 The phenomenon originates hundreds of miles from Southern California in a 
high-pressure system over Utah. Although the topography and position of the San 
Fernando Valley put it in the route of the hot, dry winds that blow in from the 
desert -- the Valley has had gusts of up to 60 m.p.h. -- the condition is 
generally strongest in the Riverside-San Bernardino area. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana's aren't all bad. In addition to granting warm weather, they 
also blow the San Fernando Valley's pollutants out of our area. But they also 
carry mysteries in from the east. Wrote Joan Didion: "It is the season of 
suicide and divorce and prickly dread, whenever the wind blows." Tracing the 
Name 
</P>
<P>
 There are many theories, some legendary, as to why the winds are called Santa 
Anas. Some believe the name comes from the Satanas, Spanish for Satan. But most 
likely they are named for the Santa Ana Canyon, the narrow gap in the Santa Ana 
Mountains in Orange and Riverside counties, where the winds are especially 
strong. Contributing Factors 
</P>
<P>
 Dry cold fronts passing through the Great Basin states are followed by a 
high-pressure system that is centered over the Utah-Nevada border, creating 
westerly winds that eventually become Santa Anas. Flowing from Desert to Valley 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana winds move through the San Gabriel Mountains and approach the Valley 
from the north-northeast, funneling through the Soledad Canyon and Weldon 
Canyon area into the Valley. The heat of the wind is more the result of its 
downhill motion than its movement across the desert. This is their path: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Air is cool and holds fair amount of moisture 
</P>
<P>
 2. Air loses moisture as it moves up mountains

3RD SUSPECT SOUGHT IN FATAL SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police continued to search for a third suspect in the weekend shooting death 
of a local 19-year-old man who was attacked after he "exchanged looks" with his 
killers, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two others who allegedly participated in the Friday-night shooting -- 
20-year-old Anne Marie Barajas of North Hollywood and a 15-year-old girl from 
Sun Valley -- were booked on suspicion of murder shortly after the incident, 
said Detective Mike Langston of the San Fernando Police Department.The girl's 
name was not released because of her age. 
</P>
<P>
 Langston said Javier Rodriguez of San Fernando was in a mini-mall in the 1000 
block of North Maclay Street about 9:15 p.m. Friday when he was approached by 
two women and a man in a car. Witnesses told police Rodriguez was shot 
following a verbal exchange with the people in the car. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested Barajas and the 15-year-old, who are not related, after 
locating the vehicle believed to have been used in the incident, Langston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Langston said the two did not appear to know Rodriguez, but that "there was an 
exchange of looks between the suspect and the victim."

EXXON SPILL ENDS UP TARNISHING IMAGE OF SCIENCE; ECOSYSTEM: AS THE LITIGATION 
WORE ON, SCIENTISTS WATCHED IN SILENCE. NOW THEY STAND BAFFLED OVER WHAT STEPS 
ARE NEEDED TO PROTECT ALASKA'S FUTURE. 
</P>

<P>
 Alaska's 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill left a little-noticed but costly residue: 
tarnished scientific reputations and a mass of uncoordinated data that will be 
of scant use in measuring the spill's long-term effects on the ecosystems of 
Prince William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Scores of science projects were launched to prove or disprove damage claims. 
While lawyers battered each other with carefully selected facts, scientists 
watched in silence, forbidden to communicate their work to the public or even 
to each other. 
</P>
<P>
 The stakes -- and the payoff -- were astronomical. On Sept. 16, an Anchorage, 
Alaska, jury levied a $5-billion punitive judgment against the Exxon Corp. The 
company already had paid out $2.8 billion in cleanup costs, criminal penalties 
and civil damages to state and federal agencies, fishermen and Alaskan natives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many well-known scientists who did outstanding work before the spill now find 
that their reputations have been tainted -- that they were used as 
mouthpieces," said Gary Shigenaka, a marine biologist with the National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) biological assessment team in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 The team is at the midpoint of a 10-year study of the sound. "We can never go 
back to the days when scientists exchanged information," Shigenaka said. "Exxon 
Valdez is the template for things to come. Now we will have science by press 
conference." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 How selectively the facts were used was demonstrated in August, when a jury 
heard scientific testimony that disastrous pink salmon harvests in 1992 and 
1993 were possibly due to the oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
 As jurors deliberated, they were not permitted to learn that a harvest of 
almost 37 million fish was in progress -- the third largest in Prince William 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have real misgivings about applying data on oil to salmon," Shigenaka 
said. "I don't think there's a salmon scientist out there who'd rest his case 
on an oil injury to salmon." 
</P>
<P>
 NOAA is charged with providing unbiased scientific information to assist 
spill-response organizations in handling emergencies. Frequently, the agency 
winds up in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 "We performed a study of subsistence seafood utilized by native populations -- 
a major effort -- and found that salmon and halibut were free of hydrocarbons," 
Shigenaka said. "Most hydrocarbons were found in Kodiak Harbor, from diesel 
fuel. Nevertheless, a jury awarded $20 million to Alaska natives for damage to 
their food supply." 
</P>
<P>
 That was only slightly more than the $18.3 million Exxon spent to rehabilitate 
222 oil-drenched sea otters -- about $80,000 per animal. 
</P>
<P>
 A different set of facts applies to Prince William Sound herring, a commercial 
species whose population has plummeted for three straight years, from an 
estimated biomass of 300,000 tons to 17,000 tons. Biologists believe the fish 
will remain at low levels for at least two more seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Herring populations are being depressed by a marine virus or bacterium -- one 
they normally carry with no ill effect," said Ted Cooney, a University of 
Alaska marine biologist. "But the organism is triggered by stress, such as 
temperature or lack of food -- and the oil spill was certainly one of the 
biggest stress factors around." 
</P>
<P>
 This year, a trustee council established to administer Exxon's court-ordered 
$1-billion restitution fund began a five-year, $25-million ecosystem assessment 
of the sound, concentrating first on salmon and herring. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too bad it didn't start five years ago," said Cooney. "Alaskan science has 
come away with a bad name because we spent huge amounts of dollars, but no 
results were made public. And if there were another spill tomorrow, I doubt if 
it would be any different." 
</P>
<P>
 Can science find a better way to clean up its environmental act? 
Administrators at the U.S. Interior Department hope so. On Oct. 27, the 
department will reveal an elaborate computer model that will calculate damages 
from a given spill by analyzing a vast database drawn from hundreds of 
thousands of existing research studies. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is unique -- trying to predict injury and damage. For the first time, we 
have tied biology and economics with the fate of chemicals in water," said 
Deborah French, a biological oceanographer who is part of a team at Applied 
Science Associates of Narragansett, R.I., which has labored for five years to 
compile the ambitious program. 
</P>
<P>
 In a few months, after a required review period that probably will produce 
some changes in the program, it will become an official government method of 
calculating damages from future spills. But spillers will have the option of 
asking for a real-time assessment -- and paying government agencies for costly 
on-site research. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most spills we've test-run so far calculate damages in hundreds of thousands, 
not millions, of dollars," said French. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the model's most sensitive measurements estimates loss of aesthetic 
values. "Essentially, we try to answer the question, 'How much is a duck 
worth?' " said David Rosenberger, of Interior's Office of Environmental 
Affairs. "So we collect data on shore facilities, on what an average tourist 
spends to visit a site, either to hunt or fish, or just enjoy aesthetic value. 
</P>
<P>
 "This model represents the best available science, done in a nonpolitical 
time," said Rosenberger. "Politically, I think, there's no chance this program 
would be used in an Exxon Valdez-size spill. But in smaller spills, we hope we 
don't have to go to court every time." 
</P>
<P>
 To Doug Helton, head of NOAA's damage-assessment and response team in Silver 
Spring, Md., the furor over oil is environmentally counterproductive. He sees a 
paradox: 
</P>
<P>
 "The amount of gasoline and diesel fuel used in the Exxon Valdez cleanup 
exceeded the volume of the spill. And, in many ways, the cleanup created 
longer-term damage than the oil. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the sad fact is that it's easier to file a lawsuit than to do scientific 
research. And when the two camps go to war, the public loses."

200 RALLY IN SUPPORT OF KOON AND POWELL; ACTIVISM: PROTESTERS DECRY DECISION 
MANDATING LONGER PRISON SENTENCES FOR FORMER LAPD OFFICERS INVOLVED IN THE 
RODNEY KING BEATING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Calling them "the first political prisoners in the history of our country," 
more than 200 people were present at a rally Saturday to protest the extension 
of jail sentences given to two former Los Angeles Police Department officers 
convicted in the beating of Rodney G. King. 
</P>
<P>
 Family and friends of ex-Officer Laurence M. Powell and ex-Sgt. Stacey C. Koon 
said a petition will be circulated nationwide seeking support for the two men, 
who were convicted by a federal jury last year of violating King's civil 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 An appeals court ruled in August that the 30-month sentences given to the 
former officers were too lenient. The sentences could be increased to 70 months 
or more. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one's ever been resentenced like that after serving a year in prison," 
said Michael Paran, a Granada Hills resident and friend of Powell. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants pinned yellow ribbons to their shirts and wore headbands made of 
police barrier tape as they gathered at Canyon Country Park for the rally. Koon 
and Powell were both residents of the Santa Clarita Valley, in Castaic and 
Valencia, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Rep. Howard (Buck) McKeon (R-Santa Clarita), who signed the petition 
supporting the two former officers, told demonstrators that he will look into 
the feasibility of introducing legislation to help Powell and Koon. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is still a silent majority that knows what's really right," he told the 
cheering crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 of the demonstrators spent an hour marching two miles east on 
Soledad Canyon Road to the park, carrying signs that said, "Stop Triple 
Jeopardy," and "Don't Put the Good Guys in Jail." Other signs asked passing 
motorists to honk in support of the officers, which many drivers did. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to prove that more people care about him," said Powell's 12-year-old 
brother, Louis, who walked among the front of the protesters. 
</P>
<P>
 The collecting of signatures on the petition began locally about a week ago, 
said Powell's father, Ed, wearing a T-shirt with his son's picture underneath 
the slogan, "Fight Crime Not the Police." The elder Powell, a lieutenant with 
the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, said he hopes to collect up to 
50,000 signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need graphic evidence that there is strong support for the officers," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 T-shirts and bracelets were being sold at the rally to raise money for 
Powell's legal defense. Ed Powell said the event's purpose was to also show 
support for Koon, but the former officers are handling their fund-raising 
efforts separately. 
</P>
<P>
 The 9th District U.S. Court of Appeals on Aug. 19 ordered U.S. District Judge 
John G. Davies to resentence Powell and Koon for their involvement in the 
beating of King. A resentencing date has not been set. Both men are appealing 
the ruling.

VOLUNTEERS STRUGGLE TO BUILD BUTTERFLY SAFETY NET; ENDANGERED SPECIES: 
EXPIRATION OF $430,000 GRANT WORRIES THOSE WORKING TO RESTORE DUNES NEAR LAX 
WHERE THE EL SEGUNDO BLUE FLOURISHES. 
</P>

<P>
 They stride across the dunes like foot soldiers in some ecological army, 
sporting T-shirts emblazoned with a single blue butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
 Some stoop to do battle with the alien ice plant and brushy acacia trees that 
threaten the El Segundo dunes. 
</P>
<P>
 Others kneel in the sand to plant native shrubs that vanished from this 
seaside kingdom long before many members of this volunteer gardening army were 
born. 
</P>
<P>
 What has brought these volunteers here, weekend after weekend, is a heartfelt 
vision that time can be rolled back and the dunes restored. 
</P>
<P>
 Their mission is to rebuild an ecosystem that vanished a generation ago as 
urban Los Angeles pressed toward the sea. They operate by a simple but delicate 
equation: banishing the ice plant and other non-native species while nurturing 
coast buckwheat, the El Segundo blue butterfly that feeds on it and a myriad of 
other plants and insects that once called the dunes home. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's icon is the El Segundo blue, a federal endangered species whose 
primary home is this fragile snippet of dune-scape wedged between sprawling Los 
Angeles International Airport and the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the ice plant is nearly vanquished. The butterfly is flourishing, up 
from 400 10 years ago to more than 10,000 today. But on this misty October 
morning, what should have been a celebratory event -- a salute to a job nearly 
finished -- takes on a somber cast. 
</P>
<P>
 Triggering concern is the Oct. 7 end of the $430,000 grant that financed 
restoration work under the direction of Rudi Mattoni of Beverly Hills, who has 
received national attention for his fight to save the El Segundo blue. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, no one knows for sure how the dunes will be protected in years to come. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who looks after these plants that we've just planted?" asks a frustrated 
Mattoni. 
</P>
<P>
 The El Segundo dunes is at a crossroads. When the grant expired, 
responsibility for the area moved from the city Department of Environmental 
Affairs to the city Department of Airports, which owns the dunes.  
</P>
<P>
 The juxtaposition is a curious one: LAX, the nation's third-busiest airport, 
high-tech launching pad for hundreds of jumbo jets each day, is charged with 
protecting the habitat of a fluttering thumbnail-size butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
 Although an airport official promises to "do the right thing by the dunes," 
some environmentalists are nervous that a mammoth agency accustomed to dealing 
with high-powered airlines and fast-flying machines may not fully grasp the 
importance of buckwheat and insects. After Mattoni began studying the dunes for 
the Department of Airports in 1984, he discovered that it contained 28 plants 
and animals that are native to the Southern California dunes system.  
</P>
<P>
 But years of development and soil contamination helped foster non-native 
species, he reported, threatening the survival of native wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 As departing jets screech overhead on this overcast Sunday, Mattoni and his 
supporters issue a rallying cry to about 60 people gathered at the dunes for 
the last scheduled volunteer cleanup-and-planting effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "The work is not done," says Jon Earl, director of Rhapsody in Green, a Los 
Angeles environmental group that has championed the dunes. 
</P>
<P>
 A botanist shows a group of Westside students how to plant seedlings of 
coastal buckwheat and how to mulch them with withered strands of ice plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Harrison, 17, of Van Nuys displays the spindly insect called a 
"walking stick" she just discovered in a pile of mulch. On an earlier visit, 
she reports, she found two legless lizards, which she describes as "wormlike 
with scales."  
</P>
<P>
 As the volunteers weed and plant, Mattoni, 66, stands slightly apart, ear 
protectors cupped around his neck, observing the activity with deep blue eyes 
that nearly match the blue of the butterfly imprinted on his T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 In a playful moment, he disappears under a tattered, turquoise-colored tarp 
until his head re-emerges through a hole in the center. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as giggling teen-agers watch, he slowly flaps his tarp-covered arms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sweet butterfly . . ." he sings under his breath. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mattoni's life has been intrinsically tied to blue butterflies -- the El 
Segundo blue he has helped preserve at the dunes, the Palos Verdes blue 
butterfly he rediscovered in San Pedro this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the butterfly is simply a metaphor, he says, of the complex native 
ecosystem that is slowly taking root again. 
</P>
<P>
 Mattoni, a UCLA visiting lecturer in geography and environmental science, 
talks passionately of the dunes' other crown jewels, the 11 species of plants 
and animals that can be found only on this narrow strip of sand: the El Segundo 
goat moth, the El Segundo Jerusalem cricket, the Lange's dunes weevil, the El 
Segundo spineflower, the El Segundo crab spider. 
</P>
<P>
 He sounds astonished that others might not notice the mysteries to be found 
here. It is baffling to him that Angelenos can be obsessed with saving the 
Amazon rain forest -- even reporting the acres lost on a lighted digital 
monitor outside the Beverly Center's Hard Rock Cafe -- while they ignore the 
home-grown wonders just west of LAX. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know how many insects there are in Downtown L.A.," he laments. "We 
don't even know what we have right here." 
</P>
<P>
 Mattoni found his first blue butterfly 50 years ago mounted in a cardboard box 
at the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, he was a schoolboy fascinated by butterflies, collecting them, 
puzzling over the colors of caterpillars that clung to the bush outside his 
bedroom window in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as a teen-ager during World War II, he visited the dunes for the first 
time and witnessed the butterfly alive. The airport was tiny then, and only a 
few houses perched on the dunes. He remembers flocks of butterflies and huge 
expanses of coastal buckwheat. 
</P>
<P>
 He left Los Angeles to study entomology at UC Berkeley, returning to earn his 
Ph.D. at UCLA in population genetics. 
</P>
<P>
 His resume portrays him as a Renaissance man of science, assessing the effects 
of the first atomic explosion on native insect populations in New Mexico, 
conducting studies on astronauts' personal hygiene in space. 
</P>
<P>
 A company he founded produced millions of cotton pink bollworm moths -- so 
named because of their bright pink larvae -- that were sterilized with 
radiation and used to control the bollworm attacking the San Joaquin Valley 
cotton crop. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he is not a professional entomologist, he kept returning to 
butterflies -- especially blue butterflies. 
</P>
<P>
 And in 1984, he returned to the dunes, charged with studying how blue 
butterflies and other native insects remained. 
</P>
<P>
 The dunes had changed dramatically since he last saw them. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the dunes coastal buckwheat was probably destroyed when homes were 
built. Ice plant, which was popular among developers who used it to stabilize 
sand, can squeeze out the remaining buckwheat and other native species.  
</P>
<P>
 "The ice plant was all over the place. It was ghastly," he recalls. To worsen 
matters, after constructing Pershing Drive on the dunes' east side in the 
1970s, the city had planted the wrong kind of buckwheat, Mattoni said. Instead 
of coast buckwheat -- the sole food of the El Segundo butterfly -- workers had 
planted common buckwheat, throwing the ecosystem out of sync.  
</P>
<P>
 One of the most startling changes of all was not on the dunes, but above them. 
As many as 900 to 1,000 low-flying jets roar above the butterflies and walking 
sticks each day. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the noise can be deafening, volunteers are so passionate about the 
dunes cause that they simply bring earplugs. One volunteer wore a Sony Walkman 
as he planted buckwheat, hoping to drown out the jet noise with music. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, it was the burgeoning growth of LAX that created the dunes 
preserve and thus enhanced the El Segundo blue's hopes for survival. 
</P>
<P>
 Once houses and streets covered the very dunes where the butterfly now 
frolics. But the rise in jet traffic in the early 1960s forced the removal of 
almost 800 homes under the noisy takeoff routes, baring the dunes again. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the preserve exudes an eerie sense of in-between. 
</P>
<P>
 Remnants of the old neighborhood remain, like ruins of some Roman village. 
</P>
<P>
 Cracked concrete streets run like frayed ribbon through the dunes, weeds 
sprouting through the cracks. Street numbers are barely visible on decaying 
curbs. A peeling yellow fire hydrant sits next to one dune, and brick steps 
lead nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet most of the area has returned to wilderness, a soothing tapestry of 
brown-gray shrubs against tan sand. Then, a dune away, LAX comes into view, its 
terminals and control towers spread across the horizon like a space-age 
metropolis. 
</P>
<P>
 This juxtaposition of sand and city, nature and technology endows the 
restore-the-dunes project with much of its drama. 
</P>
<P>
 The 300-acre area is the last large remnant of a series of dunes systems that 
once ran from Point Conception north of Santa Barbara to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport officials had long planned to use about 200 acres of the cleared dunes 
to build a seaside golf course, with the remaining 100 acres set aside as a 
preserve. But then the California Coastal Commission questioned how the 
development would affect the El Segundo blue butterfly.  
</P>
<P>
 City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter helped spearhead a 1990 city agreement under 
which 200 acres were designated a preserve, with 100 acres to the north set 
aside for the golf course. Activity shifted to restoring the dunes, although 
airport officials say that a golf course is still possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Mattoni and his colleagues have been working to restore the dunes, most 
recently with the $430,000 grant from the state Resources Agency and a $75,000 
grant from the Coastal Conservancy. The work was overseen by the city 
Department of Environmental Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The project has spawned a small but intensely loyal band of defenders. 
Hundreds of volunteers, including UCLA professors and Westside schoolchildren, 
regularly visit with trowels and gardening gloves.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, as the Department of Airports shoulders responsibility for the dunes, 
trepidation is apparent among some dunes defenders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to assure those people that we're not going to turn our backs on the 
work they've done," Phil Depoian, Department of Airports deputy executive 
director, promised. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mattoni says the airport has promised only that he can volunteer at the 
dunes for an additional 30 days. He has no idea if he will be allowed on the 
site after that time, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Galanter has written airport officials to urge them to plan for long-term 
maintenance. She said that she is "reasonably optimistic" that the airport can 
be persuaded to arrange for that maintenance, which she estimates would cost 
about $45,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Some environmental groups have banded together to form the Coastal Dunes 
Conservancy, hoping to provide management and scientific expertise for 
preserving the dunes, said Fred Heath, president of the Los Angeles Audubon 
Society. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Department of Airports, Depoian said he does not know enough about the 
conservancy plan to say if it is feasible. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, environmentalists hope the airport will continue to allow the 
hands-on volunteer work that they say has been key to the restoration's 
success. 
</P>
<P>
 "It surprises me that I feel this way about this pile of sand," said Heath. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's something very different about pulling out weeds and planting 
plants," Heath said, "a rush that I've never gotten from saving a piece of land 
by political means."

JIM MURRAY: WHEN EVENTS DICTATE COVERAGE, ALL SUFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While, basically, few things in the world of sport shock me anymore, I must 
confess to being taken aback by the actions of one of my favorite golfers, Tom 
Watson. 
</P>
<P>
 If you've been paying attention, you know that Watson is the poison-pen letter 
writer who started the chain of events that got announcer (and fellow golfer) 
Gary McCord fired from his post as one of the broadcasters of the Masters golf 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom apparently sent the letter to the Masters chairman, Jackson Stevens -- and 
to McCord's boss, network golf producer Frank Chirkinian -- complaining about 
McCord's commentary and likening him to shock jock Howard Stern and urging, 
"Get rid of him now." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, what makes this extraordinary is that Tom Watson has never been one you 
might identify as a card-carrying member of the Moral Majority. Stanford 
graduate Watson has mostly been identified as one of the Liberal Minority on 
the golf tour, where the political persuasion of most players is to the right 
of Rush Limbaugh. Your average touring golfer is more interested in removing 
Bill Clinton than Gary McCord. Watson is one of the few in a golf locker room 
not registered as a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 But the shocking story is not that Watson objected to McCord's presence, it's 
that the Masters, acting on Watson's protest, got CBS to remove McCord. It's 
that the network acceded to pressure.  
</P>
<P>
 First of all, it's a violation of the Fourth Amendment, freedom of the press. 
McCord is entitled to the same Constitutional protection as, say, Arthur Krock 
would be. Or George Will. Or Dan Rather or Tom Brokaw. A sitting president 
can't get them removed from their jobs whatever the provocation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Masters is hardly a government organization, but it should have as little 
to do with how it's handled by the press as any other public event. It can bar 
the press, it can't manipulate it. Or shouldn't be able to.  
</P>
<P>
 The Masters has a straight-line reputation as an autocrat among sporting 
events. Not too many years ago, it was able to bar commentator Jack Whitaker 
from its telecasts because he referred to an unruly gallery as a "mob." 
</P>
<P>
 That was unconscionable. Whitaker is as elegant, non-controversial, high-class 
an individual as broadcasting has developed.  
</P>
<P>
 When that bit of despotism worked, I guess the Masters thought this was a 
tap-in. A slam dunk from here on out.  
</P>
<P>
 You know, in my business, the notion that a story subject didn't like you or 
what you wrote -- or said -- was worn like a badge of honor. It meant you were 
doing your job. No self-respecting city or managing editor would ever take a 
man off a beat because the police or D.A. or Congress or White House -- or 
sport franchise -- didn't like what he wrote. A newspaperman who did that 
earned the contempt of his craft. We're in the truth business, not the public 
relations business. We are, great city editors used to tell us, "the palladium 
of democracy." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kremlin can't dictate press policy anymore. Why should a golf tournament? 
</P>
<P>
 And, suppose the practice spreads? Suppose we have to watch what we write, say 
only positive things, take care not to offend? I can just see it now:  
</P>
<P>
 "World Series, 1995 -- Barry Bonds missed a third strike in the ninth inning 
with the bases loaded in Game 7 today, but it should be pointed out that the 
ball curved. Bonds simply swung an inch above it. The unfortunate event gave 
the Yankees the World Series, but it was noted Bonds was trying hard. 'I was 
hoping for fastball,' he said. 'The guy just double-crossed me. Curveballs 
should be illegal on 3 and 2. I'll get my lawyer.' There was some sentiment in 
the game to make pitchers declare what kind of pitch they were going to make -- 
on the legal principle of discovery." 
</P>
<P>
 Or, 
</P>
<P>
 "World Series, 1996 -- The Texas Rangers lost the World Series today in the 
ninth inning of Game 6 when a fly ball dropped safely in center field. 
Actually, the ball didn't exactly drop, it ricocheted off the head of Jose 
Canseco and over the fence for a bases-loaded game-winning homer. 'Well, we got 
Jose for his home run power,' acknowledged the Ranger manager. 'He got a good 
jump on the ball. My question is, who gets credit for the homer, Jose or Mike 
Piazza who only hit a routine fly? Jose will probably want the RBIs credited to 
him in contract negotiations next year. In a way, he's right. Jose's simply a 
better hitter than he is a fielder. He doesn't even need a bat to hit a home 
run.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "U.S. Open, 1995 -- Greg Norman lost the Open on the 72nd hole here today when 
he left a 15-foot putt short -- twice. His first putt bit off seven feet, his 
second five more. 'I didn't misread the putt, just the distance,' Norman said. 
'I had it on line all the way.' Norman maintained his composure until dinner 
that night when the waiter incautiously recommended the artichokes. Norman 
screamed, 'What did you say?' The waiter will recover. Norman's punches were 
short too." 
</P>
<P>
 "NBA finals, 1995 -- Patrick Ewing missed six consecutive free throws in the 
final seconds of the seventh playoff game tonight. But he hit the rim on one of 
them. And some of the others had nice trajectories. Spike Lee blamed the 
referee. 'He should have given the foul to Hubert Davis. That's what Hue 
Hollins did last year.' Houston won the championship. Spike Lee said it was 
unfair. 'Patrick has to play Hakeem Olajuwon every year. I may do a movie 
exposing it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Finally:  
</P>
<P>
 "NFL Playoffs, 1995 -- Tom Watson argued that the network should remove 
announcer John Madden from the broadcast booth. 'He keeps reporting Joe Montana 
getting sacked. We don't need that kind of negative reporting. Let's just get 
some kind of upbeat guy who will report that Joe just had an incomplete pass. 
Because no one was open. Including him.' " 
</P>
<P>
 On second thought, maybe Watson is right. Maybe telling-it-like-it-ain't is 
exactly what the country needs. Washington found that out years ago.

LONG LAYOFF NO ACHILLES' HEEL FOR MARINO; PRO FOOTBALL: DOLPHIN QUARTERBACK 
TAKES 15 TOUCHDOWN PASSES INTO GAME AGAINST RAIDERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dan Marino was in pain. More pain than he ever felt getting crushed by an 
onrushing, 295-pound linebacker. More pain than he ever felt getting his helmet 
twisted and turned by a ferocious defensive tackle. More pain even than he had 
felt in suffering a torn Achilles' tendon early last season. 
</P>
<P>
 That was physical pain and it would fade in time. This was emotional pain, the 
pain of loss, reality setting in as one of the top-ranked quarterbacks in pro 
football history came to grips with the jarring thought that his talented right 
arm would not always be throwing a football. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went for 10 years and never really missed a game," Marino said. "I think 
you kind of take it for granted that it's going to always be there. . . . It 
made me realize that, someday, this is going to be over. Ever since I was a 
little kid, I've been playing football every fall. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're injured and there are questions whether you can come back or not 
from it, you really learn to appreciate the game itself and going out there on 
Sundays and playing and the preparation during the week and all that kind of 
fun stuff that you do, and when you win games what that feeling was like. 
That's what I missed and that's why I was looking so forward to coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 There were those who had serious doubts whether the 33-year-old Miami Dolphin 
quarterback would ever again perform as he had over the previous 11 years, when 
he used his whip-like delivery, overpowering arm and masterful field sense to 
become the third-rated passer in NFL history, with an 88.1 mark, and the 
second-leading producer of touchdown passes, 298 before this season. 
</P>
<P>
 But the longing Marino felt during those long days on the sideline instilled 
in him a resolve to fight back to where he had been on Oct. 10, 1993, when his 
Achilles' betrayed him in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's always been a guy who just loved to play," Miami Coach Don Shula said. 
"But that's the first time he's missed any ball of any consequence. I think it 
has given him an additional purpose. You watch him in practices and on game 
day. He's always been a very intense player, but he's even more so now." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, through six games, Marino's numbers are as impressive as ever. He has 
completed 60% of his passes for 1,786 yards and 15 touchdowns with five 
interceptions heading into today's game against the Raiders at Joe Robbie 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's still not back to where he was before the injury," Shula said. "But he's 
been so focused, so dedicated and working hard. He's really a driven football 
player." 
</P>
<P>
 Good thing for Shula. He could ill afford to have an ineffective quarterback, 
considering his problems at running back. A knee injury put leading rusher 
Terry Kirby on injured reserve last month. Running back Irving Spikes has also 
been hampered by knee problems. 
</P>
<P>
 That has left most of the work to third-year man Bernie Parmalee, who has 
gained 223 yards, scored two touchdowns and averaged 4.6 yards per carry, and 
veteran Mark Higgs. Parmalee assumes a featured role with little experience. He 
had carried the ball only 10 times in his two previous seasons, but he came up 
with the best game of his career in last week's loss to the Buffalo Bills, 
gaining 91 yards and running his total to 164 in the last two games. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on hand is former Ram Cleveland Gary, signed last week. Shula indicated 
that Gary might play today. 
</P>
<P>
 All this uncertainty in the backfield might leave opponents thinking Miami is 
a pushover on offense. Think again. The Dolphins remain the league leader in 
points scored with 160 and are second in yardage per game to the New England 
Patriots. Amazing what Marino can accomplish even with holes popping up all 
around him. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami, however, has slowed considerably since opening the season with three 
victories, having lost two of its last three, including last week's AFC East 
showdown against the Bills. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders are coming off a big victory last week over the Patriots, but they 
can take little solace in that when they take the field today. At 2-3, in a 
division where the 5-0 San Diego Chargers are threatening to run away from the 
pack by Halloween, the Raiders must keep pace. 
</P>
<P>
 The key to their success is the same as that of the Dolphins -- the ability to 
run the ball. That's an old story for the Raiders, but it appears to have a new 
twist with the emergence of Harvey Williams from a mediocre group. Williams ran 
for 65 yards last week, and, according to Coach Art Shell, will be getting an 
increased workload. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders have always done well against Miami, even back in the Oakland 
days, even since the advent of the Marino era. The Raiders are 14-4-1 against 
the Dolphins (16-5-1 counting postseason play), have won four of the six they 
have played against Marino and four of the last five in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 But that doesn't figure to have any bearing on today. Nothing lasts forever. 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask Dan Marino. Raider Notes: 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive tackle Chester McGlockton has a sore shoulder, cornerback Albert 
Lewis a sore neck and receiver James Jett a tender hamstring, but all are 
expected to play.

RAMS BELIEVE THAT THIRD TIME'S THE HARM; PRO FOOTBALL: THEY HOPE TO BEAT GIANTS 
TODAY AND AVOID REPEAT OF LAST SEASON'S THREE-GAME LOSING STREAK, WHICH LEFT 
THEM 2-5.

<P>
 It might take some imagination, but view today's game against the New York 
Giants in Anaheim Stadium as the Rams (2-4) do. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jim Erkenbeck, Ram offensive line coach: "The approach Chuck Knox and 
everybody on this team is taking is that this is like a playoff game. We are 
overly committed to winning this one." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Joe Vitt, Ram assistant head coach: "No question, this game is critical 
for us. We've talked about it all week long -- this is like a playoff game for 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Wayne Sevier, Ram special teams coach: "That's the way we're talking, and 
I hope the players are listening. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hoping that I'm right, that this is a good football team that is just not 
quite getting it done, as opposed to a team that could be 2-5 or 2-6 at the 
break." 
</P>
<P>
 Two more victories before their bye and the Rams would be at .500 for the 
first time so late in the season since 1989, when they opened 5-3 on their way 
to an 11-5 finish and a playoff appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Two victories in a row, however, have not been accomplished by this team since 
1991, when the Rams defeated Green Bay at home, took a week off for a bye and 
then beat San Diego at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last two games were important, but not critical," Erkenbeck said. "This 
is different." 
</P>
<P>
 A loss today to the Giants (3-2), and the Rams will have lost three in a row 
in dropping to 2-5 -- as they did a year ago after opening 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "And even though five losses doesn't keep you out of the playoffs, your team 
psyche at 2-5 is a whole new deal and then you have to go on the road to play," 
Sevier said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants, stung by a loss to Minnesota on Monday night and forced to make 
the cross-country trek to California, have also lost two games in a row and 
have never had much success against the Rams. The Rams hold a 21-10 series 
advantage, including five victories in their last seven meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox has a 5-0 record at home against the Giants, but he has never had to play 
New York with Wayne Gandy and Chuck Belin starting in the offensive line. 
Jackie Slater is sidelined because of an arm injury and Gandy will make his 
first NFL start. Center Bern Brostek is on crutches because of a broken bone in 
his leg, and guard Tom Newberry is now playing center, requiring Belin to make 
his first NFL start. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put that in our calculations of what we want to do," said Chick Harris, 
Ram offensive coordinator. "But these people know they have to step up, play a 
hell of a game so there's no drop-off from what we've been getting." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams will try to run against the Giants, who are giving up only 2.9 yards 
per rush. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are very difficult to run against," Knox said. "People have been 
throwing the ball a lot against the Giants because they gave up trying to run 
against them." 
</P>
<P>
 Teams have also been passing against the Giants because their secondary has 
played poorly. Before this season, in their last 49 regular-season games the 
Giants saw only one opposing quarterback -- Steve DeBerg -- pass for more than 
300 yards against them. In five games this year, Randall Cunningham and John 
Friesz have surpassed that mark, and Warren Moon had 299 yards in Monday 
night's victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams will start Chris Miller at quarterback. He has recovered from a 
shoulder injury suffered on Sept. 18 against San Francisco. Miller has 
struggled this season and will be playing to keep his job, with Chris Chandler 
waiting in the wings to replace him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time to get things rolling," Miller said. "The ball is in my hands, and 
I'm going to go out and play some good football and get us some wins." 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants will counter at quarterback with Dave Brown, who has thrown five 
interceptions in the last two games, two of which were returned for touchdowns. 
Running back Rodney Hampton, who ran 41 times for 134 yards in the Giants' 
20-10 victory over the Rams in Giants Stadium last season and who is supposed 
to take the heat off Brown, has suffered from a kidney injury. Hampton returned 
last week and ran 13 times for 27 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must give Brown more support in the running game," Giant Coach Dan Reeves 
said. "Our passing is not at the stage now where it can carry us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ram defense, although effective recently, ranks last in the NFL in 
stopping the opposition on third down. The Giants' offense, meanwhile, has 
given up an NFC-high 19 sacks, while ranking 27th in the league in first downs 
and total yards gained per game.

MIKE DOWNEY: A SINGLE HIT PROPELS RAIDERS' BIEKERT TO TOP OF THE CHARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On an autumn day in Massachusetts, an entire football season was on the line 
last weekend for the Raiders, and by on the line, what we mean is inches from 
it. There stood the Raiders, a length of a football away from becoming the 
biggest busts in the league, from being a 1-4 team that had actually fancied 
itself a Super Bowl contender, har-har-hardy-har-har. 
</P>
<P>
 Stacked together in a human pyramid, they barricaded the middle of the field 
as best they could. The New England Patriots had bulled the ball to within 
centimeters of the goal. It was getting late in the afternoon, the Raiders were 
leading by only four points and they kept giving the Patriots extra chances, 
committing penalties about as foolish as football players can commit. 
</P>
<P>
 On third down, New England needed only to budge the ball three feet. Then two 
feet, after an encroachment rap against Anthony Smith. Then one foot, after a 
false start by Nolan Harrison. There seemed to be no way that the Raiders would 
be able to prevent some Patriot from falling face forward into pay dirt, 
particularly if lanky Drew Bledsoe called a quarterback sneak. 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily, Greg Biekert found a way. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, a single thing can wake up a football team. One big smack. Somebody 
pops somebody. That was the kind of tackle made by Biekert, the second-year 
player from Colorado who has taken over as the Raiders' middle linebacker, in 
the 21-17 triumph last Sunday that kept this team from total collapse as it 
headed into today's game at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Biekert claims, "All I did was guess where the guy was going and get there 
before he did." 
</P>
<P>
 No, he did more. With the sort of alert play that made him the leading tackler 
three years running for the 1991 national champion Colorado Buffaloes -- once 
against Illinois, he personally accounted for 20 tackles and a safety -- 
Biekert spared the Raiders from a wasted 3,000-mile trip. He did exactly what 
Coach Art Shell had been begging each of his players to do: "Stop waiting for 
somebody else to make a big play! You make one!" 
</P>
<P>
 The Patriots, for reasons maybe Bill Parcells can explain, handed off the 
football rather than having Bledsoe plunge forward. After twice trying Marion 
Butts and twice being butted backward, this time the quarterback gave the ball 
to Kevin Turner, who propelled himself like a man on a trampoline. Turner was 
picking up altitude when he bumped into Biekert. 
</P>
<P>
 Repelled once, Turner made a second lunge toward the end zone. It could have 
been decisive, since the so-called "invisible plane" that represents the goal 
line had already been broken once in this contest, by a New England receiver 
who was given a touchdown. (If "breaking the plane" is not the No. 1 most 
maddening rule in sports, it is no worse than second most.) 
</P>
<P>
 When Turner stretched forward, he came down atop his own blocker, Butts. The 
ball grazed Butts' helmet, squirting from Turner's grasp. Patrick Bates 
retrieved it and the game was L.A.'s. 
</P>
<P>
 It was about time somebody from the Raiders had put a smack on somebody. Once 
famed for their prowess, the Raider defenders had done nothing noteworthy all 
season. They had been unusually subdued and humiliated at San Francisco, doubly 
humiliated by Seattle and careless against San Diego. Worst of all, their 
supposedly strong defensive line had been unimpressive, continually making 
mistakes of the sort Smith and Harrison made last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally speaking, the Raiders' biggest weakness has been at linebacker. Time 
and again, they have heard it said that their linebacking was among the worst 
in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 At camp the other day, owner Al Davis was speculating about a couple of young 
linebackers who hadn't yet made an impact, but soon might. Rob Holmberg. James 
Folston. Kids with a lot of speed and desire. 
</P>
<P>
 The subject had come up because the Raiders, who had better get to Dan Marino 
today in Miami if they intend to win again, already have turned to a couple of 
fresh linebackers in an attempt to pump up their defense. Not only is Biekert 
occupying the middle, making use of things he learned from Joe Kelly last 
season, but starting beside him now is Rob Fredrickson, the rookie from 
Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
 "What did Rob make -- 14 tackles last week?" Biekert asked. "He's coming on 
strong." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe so, but it is Biekert whose presence seems to be strengthening the 
Raider defense by taking pressure off the down linemen. He did the same thing 
for Colorado, making more solo tackles than any Buffalo player before. But when 
the Raiders drafted the 6-foot-2, 240-pounder from Longmont, Colo., in the 
seventh round in 1993, they hardly expected him to become their starting middle 
linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
 Biekert enjoys his new status. Upon returning home a few weeks ago for the 
Denver game, he said, "I did a radio interview with a guy who kept talking 
about my college years. I told him, 'I guess you've only got two subjects to 
talk about these days -- Buffs and ex-Buffs.' Because nobody's talking about 
the Broncos there right now."

 FOILED AGAIN 
</P>
<P>
 USC had an unexpected visitor at practice Friday afternoon at Stanford Stadium 
when Bill Walsh showed up wearing red shorts and a long, fake beard and 
carrying a video camera. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh walked down the track and knelt eight feet behind Coach John Robinson, 
pretending to film the practice. The guise did not last long as Robinson 
recognized his old friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh has played the prankster before. Once, at a Super Bowl, he posed as a 
hotel bellman, and carried many of his players' bags before anyone recognized 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps he should stick to book writing. START WORRYING 
</P>
<P>
 George Perles, Michigan State coach, was a bit defensive before his team 
played host to Ohio State in East Lansing. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's hanging over my head?" he asked. "The only thing hanging over my head 
is my contract. I don't worry about those things and you shouldn't worry about 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been schooled too long and too hard for me to worry about things I can't 
do something about and right now the only thing I can do anything about is to 
try and to play as well as we can against Ohio State." 
</P>
<P>
 After losing, 23-7, he might reconsider. SO FAR, SO GOOD 
</P>

 For Jay Macias, Wisconsin backup quarterback, there is always Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
 Macias started in 1991 when the Badgers lost, 28-7, to the Boilermakers. 
Macias came off the bench in 1992 against Purdue when starter Darrell Bevell 
was injured, and led Wisconsin to a 19-16 victory. Last year, with Bevell 
injured again, Macias threw a 14-yard touchdown pass in a 42-28 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel good when I play against them because I've always done pretty good 
against them," Macias said before facing the Boilermakers for the fourth time. 
</P>
<P>
 After two interceptions led to 14 points, Macias was not feeling as good. 
Wisconsin Coach Barry Alvarez made a surprise switch by returning to Bevell, 
who was injured this year too. Bevell led the Badgers on two scoring drives to 
salvage a 24-24 tie. McNAIR SHOW

COMMENTARY; FOR DONAHUE, ROSES ARE QUICKLY WILTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL DWYRE, TIMES SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are times when it must be great being Terry Donahue. This season is not 
one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 It is Saturday night at the Rose Bowl. Donahue's 2-4 Bruins, 0-3 in the 
Pacific 10, are playing Oregon State (1-4 and 0-3). The game is actually being 
televised. Call this one Saturday Night Dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, Oregon State was one of those teams UCLA used to flick away, 
like a fly on the dinner table. But there is very little traditional about this 
bleak Bruin season. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon State leads at the half, 7-3. The Beavers are actually playing a 
wishbone offense -- anybody wearing leather helmets? -- and making it look more 
exciting and creative than Donahue's supposedly more explosive multiple 
offense. If Troy Aikman is watching somewhere, he is sick to his stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 It is hard to tell if the UCLA natives are restless or disinterested. There 
aren't all that many of them here. They announce 35,347, which must include the 
inhabitants of every other car driving by on the Foothill Freeway. That crowd 
figure means that UCLA's average for its four home games so far is 43,508. You 
have to go back to 1975, the year before Donahue took over, to get an average 
below that. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, why should fans flock here? Their team is lousy and the game, which 
could have been played on a beautifully cool and crisp autumn afternoon in 
Southern California, is at night because television says it must be and Pac-10 
schools lap-dog along for something like $27.56 a game for doing the bidding of 
the great TV god. Sports used to be for spectators; now it's for Nielsens and 
shaving cream. 
</P>
<P>
 What a difference a few months can make. Last Jan. 1, Donahue had his team in 
the Rose Bowl, after securing his third consecutive victory over hated USC. But 
then the University of Wisconsin, sparked by 87% of the population of the 
Badger state, most of whom had swarmed the game with tickets secured from 
thousands of UCLA entrepreneurs, turned the Bruins into the visiting team, not 
to mention the losing one. 
</P>
<P>
 And what a difference a few weeks can make. When UCLA got past Tennessee in 
its opener this season, there was talk that that victory had opened the door 
for a Bruin national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings us to the vaunted Beavers, Donahue and some restless UCLA 
natives. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week's mailbag at The Times brought much more than the usual venom toward 
Donahue, a man who, at age 50 is in his 19th season at UCLA, is the winningest 
football coach at UCLA and the eighth active winningest coach in the country. 
He is also a man who has stuck around Westwood despite lucrative offers from 
such places as the Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all this, there has always seemed to be something about Donahue that 
brings out the loudest whines amid the normally whiny Bruin fans. Who knows? 
Maybe it's because he still looks as if he could play the 35-year-old leading 
man in the movies. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his loudest critics is, surprisingly, a former Bruin player named Frank 
Batchkoff. Batchkoff, now a stockbroker, played defensive tackle for Donahue 
from 1983-86, and played in two Rose Bowls, a Fiesta Bowl and a Freedom Bowl in 
that time, all winning efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which makes Batchkoff more credible perhaps than the average fan 
penning poison after four beers. Batchkoff has been there, done that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Donahue was our Achilles' heel," wrote Batchkoff, who played on teams that 
won 33 games in his four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, in a phone interview, Batchkoff expanded on those views, issuing the 
opinion that Donahue projected a negative air over the entire program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll give you an example," Batchkoff said. "My senior year (1986) against 
Washington, we went out and had a great warm-up. Washington's a tough team to 
play, so you need every edge you can get. We went back into the locker room, 
raring to go. Then Donahue walked in, said he had watched warm-ups and said it 
looked like we hadn't gotten ourselves ready properly. Well, it was like the 
air going out of a balloon. We went out flat." 
</P>
<P>
 And ended up with a 17-17 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, Donahue is a big boy who understands about taking the heat, and who 
has done so and gotten through times such as these before. But clearly, all 
things are not wonderful in Westwood these days. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday night's final score was Oregon State 23, UCLA 14. When the game was 
still up for grabs at 10-6, UCLA's All-American kicker, Bjorn Merten, missed a 
32-yard field-goal try. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Bruins scored in the last few minutes, in front of a crowd of 
hundreds, and quarterback Wayne Cook ran in for a two-point conversion, a 
handful of Bruin players actually celebrated. Somewhere, Frank Batchkoff was 
hanging his head in shame.

CURVE THROWN INTO FREE-AGENT ELIGIBILITY ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Less than 24 hours after the appointment of William J. Usery as special 
mediator in the baseball labor dispute, the convoluted off-season continued to 
unravel Saturday amid an ongoing dispute over the free-agent eligibility of 14 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of those players -- Jack McDowell of the Chicago White Sox, Jim Abbott of 
the New York Yankees, Kenny Rogers of the Texas Rangers and Erik Hanson of the 
Cincinnati Reds -- filed for free agency Saturday, opening day of the 1994 
filing period, but their eligibility was rejected by the owners' Player 
Relations Committee on the basis that they do not have the required six years 
of major league service, falling short because of time lost during the strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Eugene Orza, associate general counsel of the players' union, maintains that 
the players continued to accumulate service time during the strike because the 
clubs maintained active rosters. He has said that if the owners continue to 
block the claim, the union will file a grievance with baseball arbitrator 
George Nicolau. 
</P>
<P>
 But management sources said they might claim that Nicolau is no longer 
eligible to hear grievances because the bargaining agreement that established 
his position expired Dec. 31. Orza, in turn, said the owners have never 
proposed eliminating arbitration and that the players would fight that action 
in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those whose free-agent eligibility is jeopardized by the issue of 
service time is Chris Gwynn of the Dodgers, who needs one more day to be 
eligible. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Wallach of the Dodgers was among the initial nine players who have met the 
eligibility requirement to file Saturday. The nine included Kevin Brown of the 
Rangers, Bill Swift of the San Francisco Giants and Mark Grace of the Chicago 
Cubs. About 170 players are eligible for free agency. One who files can talk to 
any club before Nov. 1, but can sign only with his own. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners have reserved the right to impose a 45-day freeze on signings. The 
union has said it would respond by filing a collusion grievance.

LAKER UPDATE; NEW ARENA WOULD BE ON OR NEAR PRESENT SITE, BUSS SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Laker owner Jerry Buss said he has talked to several groups regarding a new 
arena, but reiterated that whomever he is involved with on the project, chances 
are the building would be on the current site in Inglewood or somewhere very 
close by. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's far and away the most likely situation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also not terribly pressing. Buss said he is looking at somewhere around 
the end of the decade to begin construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Buss' other comments as he met here with reporters: 
</P>
<P>
 -- He remains interested in buying the Angels and has talked with a third 
party, but not Gene or Jackie Autry, and that he doesn't expect any 
negotiations to take place until the "current chaos" is settled in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He believes that the Lakers are capable of winning 47 games, which would be 
an improvement of 14 victories. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, he was cutting classes about every other day at the University of 
Hawaii to watch practices on campus in steamy Klum Gym, standing in the corner 
so that Rainbow Coach Riley Wallace would not see him and tell him to go 
school. Trevor Ruffin is back again, except everyone can see him now. 
</P>
<P>
 He is on the court with the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought," he said. "Not in a million years. I always had confidence I 
might be able to play at the next level, but just to be right here, back in 
Klum, and the same atmosphere that I was trying to sneak into. This is unreal." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruffin has a good chance to make the team as an undrafted rookie, even if 
playing time would be limited behind Nick Van Exel and Sedale Threatt at point 
guard. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Cedric Ceballos came off the bench to score 24 points and pull down six 
rebounds and lead the Lakers to a 110-103 victory over the Sacramento Kings in 
the exhibition opener for both teams Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby Hurley, playing his first game since being seriously injured last 
December, had 21 points for the Kings, and Mitch Richmond added 18.

KINGS' KURRI PLANS TO RETURN TO FINLAND TODAY; HOCKEY: HE WILL JOIN THE JETS' 
SELANNE ON HELSINKI'S JOKERIT CLUB. HIS FAMILY WILL REMAIN IN CALABASAS, 
HOWEVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 King forward Jari Kurri will return today to his native Finland and plans to 
play alongside his friend, the Winnipeg Jets' Teemu Selanne, by the end of this 
week in Helsinki. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurri, 34, was the Kings' third-leading scorer last season with 31 goals and 
77 points. Previously, he ruled out a return to Finland, but has grown 
pessimistic during the NHL's lockout. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hoping we could get things going," Kurri said Saturday. "But I feel I 
need to keep playing at this stage of my career. I need ice (time). I need to 
play, it's as simple as that. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the money thing -- I just need to play." 
</P>
<P>
 The decision was not easy for the Kurri family. For the immediate future, his 
wife, Tiina, and twin sons Joonas and Ville will remain home in Calabasas. 
Kurri said it was premature to pull the fourth-graders out of school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really hard after working out all summer and with training camp," he 
said. "It's not a fun way to do it. But we have to stick together." 
</P>
<P>
 Kurri and Selanne will play for their old team, Jokerit, in the Finnish 
League. Apparently, club officials understand it might be a temporary stay.  
</P>
<P>
 "They know everything that has happened so far," Kurri said. "They knew it 
could be one game or two weeks.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's funny, both of us playing for the same team. I haven't been there (with 
Jokerit) for 15 years. The whole city has gone crazy about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the president of the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) has 
said that European clubs won't be allowed to sign NHL players, Kai Hietarinta, 
president of the Finnish Hockey Federation, told the Canadian Press that he 
does not feel bound by the IIHF. "We will welcome our players back with open 
arms," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Kurri of the ruling by the International Ice Hockey Federation: "They've 
tried to stop us. It would be a big mistake if they did." 
</P>
<P>
 Already, Kurri was looking at Jokerit's schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too early to say when I'll play," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurri paused, adding: "But there's a game Thursday, it's a rivalry. A big 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 He certainly wasn't talking about the Kings' schedule, which had them playing 
the Stanley Cup champion Rangers at New York on Thursday.

PORT OF ORANGE COUNTY; FIRST-EVER DETAILED EXAMINATION OF SCOPE AND TONNAGE OF 
THE CARGO MOVED BY LOCAL IMPORTERS AND EXPORTERS OFFERS OVERVIEW OF FOREIGN 
TRADE AND IMPACT ON ECONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cotton isn't grown in Orange County, but about 2,000 metric tons of the fluffy 
white stuff -- packed in bulging, 600-pound burlap-wrapped bales -- was shipped 
overseas last year by a Santa Ana exporter from the ports of Los Angeles and 
Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The cotton shipped by R.W. Zebrowski Inc. came mostly from mills in central 
California, Texas and Oklahoma -- the nation's major cotton-growing regions. 
</P>
<P>
 But like most export brokers, Zebrowski does business all over the world, 
buying products at the source and having them moved by truck or train to the 
most convenient seaport for shipment to buyers overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 When a seller is in Orange County and its buyer is in Japan, China or anywhere 
along the Pacific Rim, it likely means the goods will travel through the Long 
Beach or Los Angeles ports. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the size of the county's export-import business has been a matter 
of educated guesswork by local economists. But trade analysts at the ports of 
Long Beach and Los Angeles recently prepared for the Times Orange County 
Edition a first-ever look at the scope of the cargo that exporters and 
importers load each year onto the decks of the S.S. Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The analysts' numbers for the first half of 1994 show a nearly 8% increase in 
ocean cargo exports by Orange County-based shippers as well as a 15% hike in 
imports being sent to Orange County companies. That could add 2,000 more jobs 
to local payrolls and boost the economy by about $500 million, said Esmael 
Adibi, director of the Chapman University Center for Economic Research. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Examining the county's entire volume of exports and imports is clouded by the 
lack of information about goods shipped by air and truck -- the shipments are 
not tracked by city or county of origin, as are goods moved by ship. But the 
U.S. Customs Bureau estimates that 75% of all export and import goods -- by 
weight -- comes through the nation's seaports, so a review of Orange County's 
use of the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach is indicative of the county's 
foreign trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's own harbors are given over to a military base and several 
marinas, but having two of the nation's largest commercial seaports less than 
30 miles away has helped bring a large and growing number of export-import 
companies here: companies like 19-year-old R.W. Zebrowski and the recently 
opened national headquarters of Japanese electronics giant Hitachi Corp.'s U.S. 
transportation and distribution subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County is a major distribution center for importers and exporters 
alike, and it is because the county is near the two ports," said Adibi, an 
economics professor at the private university in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 The adjacent ports, which stretch in an arc from Long Beach to San Pedro, 
handle the majority of Orange County's export and import goods. Ocean transport 
is far less expensive than air freight and many products are too bulky to go 
any other way: cars, business machinery, heavy construction equipment and scrap 
steel and paper are among Orange County's leading exports. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent export shipment by Fluidmaster Inc., the Anaheim plumbing repair 
parts maker, illustrates the case for ocean cargo when time is not a factor.

 "We just pulled a 20-foot container off the dock and sent it by air instead, 
at the customer's request," said Fluidmaster's international trade director, 
Tricia Murdock. 
</P>
<P>
 The Australian customer wanted the material sooner than the five weeks it 
would have taken to get it there by freighter. By air, it took four days from 
the time the container left Anaheim until it cleared customs in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 But the customer paid dearly. The approximately four-ton shipment would have 
cost $3,500 to send by sea. The air freight bill was $15,007, Murdock said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anil Puri, Cal State Fullerton's dean of economics, said the business of 
exporting represents 9.6% of Orange County's gross annual production and is 
responsible for about 10% of the jobs in the county. For 1994, that would equal 
$7 billion and 112,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are two principal reasons for the increase, economists and trade 
specialists say. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of its location, Orange County is a principal distribution point for 
goods being shipped out and brought in by companies throughout the nation, and 
the U.S. import-export industry has grown as most states participate in a mild 
recovery from the recession that began in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, said export consultant Marilyn Loewy, Orange County businesses 
have become more aggressive in their overseas marketing to make up for domestic 
sales lost in the recession. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, companies in Orange County shipped almost 400,000 metric tons of 
goods from the two ports and imported about 500,000 tons. 
</P>
<P>
 That places the county just slightly above the midway mark in a list of 18 
regions that use the two ports: at just under 2% of the total tonnage shipped 
through the ports, Orange County's businesses are a bigger user than all of the 
companies in Mexico or Washington state, for instance. But local firms ship 
fewer goods through the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports than the combined 
businesses of the nine New England and Mid-Atlantic states, which use the two 
ports as their outlets to the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulkiest and heaviest cargoes shipped by Orange County businesses are 
scrap-paper and metal -- destined for recyclers in Japan, Korea, Taiwan and 
China. Last year, brokers such as Global Fibers in La Palma and Yao Yang 
Enterprises in Los Alamitos shipped nearly 175,000 metric tons of paper to 
customers in Asia. In the first half of 1994, an additional 122,000 metric tons 
were shipped. 
</P>
<P>
 (Shipments are weighed in metric tons -- 2,204.6 pounds versus 2,000 pounds 
for a standard U.S. ton -- because most of the world uses the metric system.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like Zebrowski's cotton, most of the paper and a lot of the produce, scrap 
metal and consumer goods shipped by Orange County companies originated in other 
parts of California or in other states and was transported directly to the 
ports without ever entering Orange County. It is credited to the county as an 
export because that's where the shipper is based. 
</P>
<P>
 Chemicals are the second largest of the county's export cargoes by weight -- 
more than 100,000 metric tons in the 18 months ended June 30. In third place is 
fresh fruit -- 45,000 metric tons. 
</P>
<P>
 Export cargo tonnage drops rapidly after that, though in many cases the value 
of the cargoes -- everything from hides and fabrics to resins and auto parts -- 
goes way up: the 5,245 tons of electronic machinery, scientific instruments and 
other electronic equipment shipped to foreign buyers by Orange County companies 
in 1993 and the first half of 1994 had a cumulative worth well in excess of the 
value of the 175,000 tons of paper, trade analysts said. So did the 3,000 tons 
of computers and other office equipment. The value of specific cargoes is not 
released for competitive reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 But the trade office of the Port of Los Angeles, which has handled about 45% 
of the tonnage shipped in and out of Orange County in the last six months, said 
the value of all exports from Orange County-based businesses from January 
through June was $3.7 billion while the value of imports destined for companies 
in the county was $2.9 billion -- an aggregate of $6.6 billion for one port for 
half a year. 
</P>
<P>
 At first glance, the list of Orange County's exports and imports makes the 
area look like an underdeveloped region -- more raw material and agricultural 
products than finished goods are exported and far more high technology and 
consumer products are imported than shipped out. Imports also outweigh exports 
by nearly 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 "The imbalance between imports and exports is a problem and the whole country 
faces it," said Eugene J. Milosh, president of New York-based American Assn. of 
Exporters & Importers. "But we have to trade goods where we have an economic 
advantage. That means we ship a lot of chemicals and forest products, because 
we have more than most other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "And we ship a lot of scrap metal and paper because we produce and consume so 
many more finished products than most other countries that we produce a lot 
more waste." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to being an attractive place for brokers and freight forwarders 
like Zebrowski and Burlington Northern in Irvine to set up shop, the nearby 
ports have helped Orange County manufacturers, including computer maker AST 
Research Inc. and scientific equipment maker Beckman Instruments Inc., achieve 
significant growth through foreign trade. 
</P>
<P>
 "We also have the U.S. headquarters of big companies like Hyundai and Toshiba 
and Mitsubishi," which has both automobile and electronics subsidiaries in 
Orange County, "and they're not here just for the weather," said Adibi, the 
Chapman University economist. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hitachi Transport System America Inc., in fact, held an open house earlier 
this month to show off the 340,000-square-foot warehouse complex it opened in 
Anaheim in August to handle goods that Hitachi ships to the United States -- 
most of it arriving at the Port of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 110 employees there and in just two months in business they have 
distributed $55 million worth of consumer and commercial products ranging from 
sophisticated surgical equipment and medical instruments to televisions and 
video players through Anaheim to Hitachi sales facilities throughout the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, R.W. Zebrowski has only five employees, including Hans J. Holste, 
the company's president and buying agent, and majority owner Hilla Zebrowski -- 
whose late husband, Rolf, founded the business 19 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Though small, Zebrowski ships about $50 million worth of cotton linters -- a 
type of short cotton stubble recovered when cotton seed is processed for its 
oil -- to customers throughout Europe and Asia. A lot of it goes through the 
ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 A week ago, the company sent 1,000 metric tons of linters to China via the 
Port of Long Beach. This cotton byproduct is used to produce high-quality 
cellulose for explosives, food processing, plastics and paper-making. It was 
Zebrowski's first deal with the Chinese and one of the first shipments of 
foreign-produced cotton linters into that nation in the wake of a dramatic 
fall-off in Chinese cotton production last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As different as they are, the American cotton shipper and Japanese-owned 
electronics company illustrate Orange County's import-export industry and its 
reliance on the neighboring seaports. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign trade is important to entrepreneurial Orange County, where most 
companies are small: It rewards drive and initiative as well as size and 
financial muscle. And for several years it has been one of the only growth 
areas in an otherwise sluggish economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had 10% to 15% growth in the business in each of the last two years even 
though the economy has been down," said Don Miller, president of the World 
Trade Center Assn. of Orange County. "And we expect that growth again this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 Without the ports, however, the growth would not be as significant or 
constant, he said. Port of Orange County 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Orange County companies shipped almost 400,000 metric tons of goods 
from the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. Imports totaled about 500,000 
tons. One metric ton equals 2,204.6 pounds. Orange County's share amounts to 
about 2% of the tonnage shipped into and out of the ports. Cities that shipped 
and received the highest tonnage for both ports combined during 1993:

INFORMED CONSENT; BUSINESS, CONSUMERS ARE GETTING SAVVIER ABOUT CHOOSING HEALTH 
PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID R. OLMOS and KATHY M. KRISTOF, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As President Clinton's ambitious health reform plan died a slow death in 
Congress, a long-slumbering giant awakened across the country: the health care 
consumer. 
</P>
<P>
 Employers were preparing "report cards" to better compare the cost and quality 
of health insurers. State agencies were demanding information from hospitals 
about surgical outcomes. And individual consumers were asking more questions of 
their doctors and health plans. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, the medical industry has stepped up its efforts to supply 
accurate information about doctors, prescription drugs, hospitals and health 
plans. The goal of these efforts: better-informed and emboldened consumers who 
can comparison-shop for health care much as they would for cars or 
long-distance telephone service. 
</P>
<P>
 Employers, who have been driving much of this change, are gaining access to 
previously unavailable data on medical care. And entrepreneurs have sprung up 
to supply this information for them and others. A San Mateo firm is collecting 
and analyzing hospital data for a group of Cincinnati employers, for example, 
and a small New York company has begun publishing slick consumer guides to 
medical care in several U.S. cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's long overdue that health providers share some information about what 
really goes on at the physician or hospital level," says Tom Elkin, chief of 
health care for the California Public Employees Retirement System, one of the 
nation's largest purchasers of medical care, representing 950,000 government 
employees, dependents and retirees. 
</P>
<P>
 Examples of the type of questions such data could answer include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Which hospitals in a city have the best outcomes -- and the best prices -- 
for heart surgery? 
</P>
<P>
 * How do members of Acme Health Plan rate its doctors and hospitals? 
</P>
<P>
 * Which hospitals have the lowest and highest rates of Cesarean-section 
births? 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say it will be several years before reliable medical information for 
health care shoppers is widely available. But in the meantime, projects are 
popping up in California and across the country to compile such information and 
get it into the hands of consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bay Area Business Group on Health, a health care purchasing cooperative 
that includes 21 major California employers -- including Bank of America, 
Lockheed Corp., Safeway Stores and Pacific Telesis Group -- just completed a 
"satisfaction" survey of 40,000 workers enrolled in 55 health plans. The 
findings will be given to employees during open-enrollment periods that are 
starting at many companies this month or next. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, people are making decisions based on how much my plan costs, is my 
doctor in the network and what my neighbor tells me," says Patricia Powers, 
executive director of the Bay Area group. The survey, however, "will tell 
employees how their colleagues rank health plans, how long they have to wait in 
doctors' offices, how long it takes to get an appointment," among other things, 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
 When American Express Co. wanted to find out how well its health care dollars 
were being spent, it surveyed 18,000 workers nationwide and asked them to rate 
their medical plans. 
</P>
<P>
 After using those results to create a satisfaction index that ranked 52 health 
maintenance organizations from best to worst, American Express did something 
more: It discounted the cost to employees who joined the best plans and 
increased it for those who joined plans low on the index. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York-based financial and travel services firm is already seeing 
results: One highly rated HMO saw its enrollment among American Express 
employees jump 30%, even though it was more expensive than rival plans in its 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found that oftentimes there is a big difference between what our employees 
say about the quality of an HMO and what the HMO says," says LouAnne Cash, an 
American Express vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 California, New York and Pennsylvania are among a growing number of states 
that have enacted laws requiring public disclosure about the medical outcomes 
and costs of certain hospital surgical procedures. Last year, for example, 
California's Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development released its 
first study of the outcomes of back surgeries and the treatment of heart attack 
victims at the state's hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, such studies have not always been popular with the health 
care industry. California hospitals sharply criticized the state report last 
year, saying its data was flawed. 
</P>
<P>
 For many years, the health care industry resisted efforts to make information 
on medical prices and quality available to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1980s, for example, hospitals opposed government efforts to 
disclose medical data because "the information coming out was just terrible and 
gave misleading impressions," says David Langness, spokesman for the Hospital 
Council of Southern California. Some early data on hospital mortality rates 
were not "risk-adjusted," meaning they did not ac count for differences in the 
patient populations at various hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found out that many of the hospitals on the 'bad' list were some of the 
best hospitals in the country," Langness says. "When other hospitals couldn't 
deal with these very sick patients, they would send them to the best hospitals, 
and they would often die." The industry now supports efforts to develop 
accurate yardsticks for measuring medical quality, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 One key effort to measure medical data and make it understandable to consumers 
is being led by the National Committee for Quality Assurance, a 
Washington-based nonprofit group set up by managed-care companies to accredit 
health plans and develop report-card standards for the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Health plans in recent years have been inundated with requests from 
purchasers and government groups for performance information," says Janet 
Corrigan, an NCQA vice president. "It used to be the only way a purchaser and 
consumer could make a decision about a health plan was cost, whether the 
premium was paid or what the member's out-of-pocket costs were. But that can 
hurt the better-quality health plans, because it keeps driving people to the 
lowest-cost plans." 
</P>
<P>
 Some medical experts question whether consumers really have the sophistication 
to use comparative information on doctors, hospitals and health plans to shop 
for medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. David Goldstein, chief of general internal medicine at USC's School of 
Medicine, says consumers can easily digest information about doctor office 
waiting times, patient satisfaction studies or an HMO's policy on referrals to 
specialists. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if consumers are given mortality statistics or success rates on certain 
operations, it becomes a much more complicated issue," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Goldstein notes that most health care shopping will be done by big 
companies, state agencies, unions or employer groups, which are better equipped 
to make a sophisticated analysis of medical data. 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts note that at the same time consumers are getting the information 
they need to make better choices about health care, many employers are 
restricting choice by offering only one or two health plans, often an HMO, 
which also restrict choice of physicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "I clearly believe people should have the information," says Alexander M. 
Capron, a USC professor of law and medicine and, with Goldstein, co-director of 
USC's Pacific Center for Health Policy and Ethics. "But we're in a funny stage 
now where people will have less choice of the providers than they used to, but 
may have a chance to make better-informed decisions about those providers." 
</P>
<P>
 While many employers are getting more sophisticated about evaluating health 
care, the vast majority of workers still have little information on which to 
make a choice. The typical company sends employees a chart listing health plan 
options, the benefits each offers and the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeanne Finberg, senior staff attorney for the Consumers Union, said people 
need much more than financial information to make an informed choice about 
health care. 
</P>
<P>
 "People need to know what are the waiting times for getting an appointment, 
are there translation services or Spanish-speaking providers, and can you get a 
nurse practitioner on the phone if you can't get the doctor?" Also, a woman 
might want to know if she can choose an obstetrician-gynecologist as her 
primary-care physician, and parents might want to know if there is an evening 
telephone help line to call when they have a sick child, she adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without sophisticated data on medical outcomes, many experts say, 
consumers are getting more vocal about health care. Some say that all the 
attention focused on the issue over the past year is creating significant 
changes in behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Many consumers who once were content to accept the recommendations -- and 
charges -- of anyone wearing a stethoscope are now more skeptical, questioning 
bills and the necessity of certain tests and treatments. Some savvy individuals 
are also actively shopping around, recognizing that the cost of different 
procedures can vary widely even when the quality of care is the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Dickman of Los Angeles is one of these new consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 When a short visit to the emergency room spurred a raft of triple-digit bills 
from the hospital, doctors and a lab, Dickman didn't just throw up his hands. 
He took action. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was outraged," Dickman says. "The hospital visit alone was $500, and then 
every other day I was getting another bill." 
</P>
<P>
 Dickman called the hospital and demanded an explanation of the charges and 
whether the procedures were necessary. In the end, the hospital slashed the 
bill 20%, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's Barry Boscoe, a benefits consultant from Tarzana. His health 
insurance pays 100% of the cost of accident-related injuries. But when he 
injured his knee skiing last year, he interviewed four doctors and their 
billing departments about the services that would be rendered and the amount 
his insurance company would be charged. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, he chose a doctor who was willing to negotiate away some fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told the insurer what I had done and they couldn't believe it," says 
Boscoe. "People need to be more proactive in what they spend. It may not seem 
like it's your money, because the insurance company is paying the bills. But 
you are paying the premium -- so it is your own money." GAUGING THE COSTS 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the yearly health care needs of a hypothetical family: John and 
Juanita Johnson and their two children, George and Nikki. All four get annual 
checkups, billed at $150 each. Between them, the children required three $50 
office visits -- and three $25 prescriptions -- for ailments. The portion of 
the costs covered by insurance and the amount the family must pay out-of-pocket 
vary based on the health plan. Here's how the annual costs stack up in some 
faily standard plans: INDEMNITY PLAN

after deductible.

 * Would pay $400 deductible for care outside network 
</P>
<P>
 ** Would pay 30% for out-of-network care or prescriptions 
</P>
<P>
 Another Scenario 
</P>
<P>
 The HMO option is clearly the least expensive for the Johnsons. But what if 
the family wants to keep seeing a certain pediatrician who isn't an HMO member 
-- and the children get sick a lot? In that case, the Johnsons may be better 
off with the point-of-service plan, because it pays a substantial portion of 
their expenses when they go outside the system. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming total doctor and hospital visits for George and Nikki cost $1,000, 
while the family's other expenses stay constant: 
</P>
<P>
 The point-of-service plan would cost a total of $2,203 annually -- $1,792 in 
premiums and deductible, $60 for in-system visits and pharmacy plus a $180 
co-payment for out-of-system visits. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the PPO would cost $2,059 and the indemnity plan would cost 
$2,099. In this case, the HMO would be the costliest plan: out-of-network 
expenses and $18.50 in co-payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Note: While the Johnson family is hypothetical, the examples have been 
designed to accurately represent a typical family's medical expenses. The 
figures and plan parameters draw on studies and information from several 
sources, including the U.S. Department of Labor, the Group Health Assn. of 
America, the Health Insurance Assn. of America and Foster & Higgins benefits 
consultants.

JAMES FLANIGAN: NEW STUDIO PROMISES TO UNREEL A REAL DRAMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The eye-catching venture announced last week by Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey 
Katzenberg and David Geffen sent a confident message to the Hollywood 
entertainment business -- and offered insights for all other business as well. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was also like the first chapter in a new adventure series, a real-life 
"Raiders of the Lost Ark" promising cliffhangers to come. For clues to the 
story ahead, we should follow the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Spielberg's expansive declaration that he and his cohorts were founding a new 
motion picture studio -- the first since 20th Century Fox was formed 59 years 
ago -- reflects renewed buoyancy in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Indirectly, it also said that the day of Japanese investment in Hollywood is 
over, scarcely five years after it began amid a U.S. recession and fearful 
claims that Japan's money was buying U.S. culture. 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is, Japanese business has reaped mostly bewilderment from 
investments in movies -- although one Japanese company could shortly chalk up a 
sizable capital gain. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports in Hollywood say a move may be initiated this week to buy back all or 
part of MCA, the parent of Universal Studios, from Matsushita Electric 
Industrial Co., which bought the studio for $6.6 billion in November, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The price could be a whopper: Considering that Paramount went for $10 billion 
earlier this year, all of MCA would bring at least $12 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Matsushita reportedly is not interested in selling, which is understandable. 
The Osaka company owns "Jurassic Park," thanks to Spielberg, whose independent 
production company works through Universal. 
</P>
<P>
 The dinosaur film, a classic for the ages, has taken in $1 billion in revenue 
so far. And Universal has Spielberg under contract to produce a Jurassic II 
sequel by June 1997. A film like that recalls the remark of MGM founder Louis 
B. Mayer, who started out in scrap metal before getting into movies. "I've 
found a business where the product never wears out," Mayer said in wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Matsushita may as well resign itself to selling, because Spielberg is 
now turning his attention elsewhere. In movies, as in many other businesses, 
the most important assets can walk out the door at any time. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what Katzenberg, who recently left Walt Disney Co., and Geffen, the 
billionaire founder of two successful record companies, are doing along with 
Spielberg: turning to a fresh challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Possibilities are exciting. Their new entertainment company could become the 
focus of investments from U.S. telephone and cable companies, which are 
ambitious to own programming for their envisioned interactive networks. 
</P>
<P>
 But before they -- and ordinary small investors -- put a dime in Hollywood, 
they should understand how the business really works. They should ask: What is 
a studio today, when the former realities of sound stages and Judy Garland and 
Mickey Rooney under long-term contract are ancient history? 
</P>
<P>
 A studio today mainly finances and distributes films and programming -- 
functions central to a business that guarantees 12 to 20 films a year to 
theater owners and 26 weeks of programming to TV channels. It's a subtle system 
built on relationships dating back more than half a century -- and on money. 
</P>
<P>
 Studios regularly charge independent producers, or their own operations, a 
hefty fee for distribution from the studio's 40% of gross box office receipts. 
(Theater owners get slightly more than half of box office.) All sorts of 
overhead expenses, from marketing to percentage payouts to stars and directors, 
are allocated to studio distribution charges -- which often, frankly, are 
overstated. 
</P>
<P>
 Why overstated? So that cash flow from a successful picture can cover losses 
on unsuccessful ones. Historically, losers outnumbered winners in the movie 
business. So any operation that promised to deliver dozens of films a year 
hoarded cash to pay for failures, explains Art Murphy, a scholar of the film 
industry who teaches at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why movie studios have never shown returns on investment as high as 
those of computer or pharmaceutical companies and have seemed something of a 
risky proposition for small investors. 
</P>
<P>
 But half a dozen studios have survived more than 50 years in a business of 
crazy expenses. It costs $200,000 a day to shoot a film on location now; the 
average picture costs about $25 million to make. Some cost much more. The final 
budget for "Water World," now filming in Hawaii, is estimated at $135 million 
to $175 million. Universal is producing that one, which may make Matsushita 
eager to sell MCA. Coca Cola Co. backed away from its ownership of Columbia 
Pictures in 1987 when "Ishtar" lost $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
 What does all that mean for the Spielberg-Katzenberg-Geffen venture? A couple 
of possibilities. Even though the partners are promised big backing from Wall 
Street, their fledgling company won't have the reserves to absorb inevitable 
losses. So that argues for an affiliation with a major studio or involvement in 
whatever deal emerges for MCA. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports in Hollywood say that major investors are eager to finance an 
arrangement that would bring the three to the top of MCA to serve with and then 
succeed Chairman Lew R. Wasserman, 81, and President Sidney Sheinberg, 59. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the big truth today is that the movie business has become 
less failure-prone. With new revenues from videotapes, cable, international 
distribution and merchandise licenses, almost all films sooner or later show a 
profit. (Film libraries accordingly are immensely valuable; when MCA sold for 
$6.6 billion, 40% of the price was the value of its library -- which is now 
even more valuable with the additions of Spielberg's "Jurassic Park" and 
"Schindler's List.") 
</P>
<P>
 So a new company led by three talented individuals, and backed by the kinds of 
investment the telephone companies are capable of, could pioneer new kinds of 
entertainment and interactive distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 To learn how the story comes out, watch episodes in the coming weeks -- and 
years. For all its talent, it will take a year or two for the new company to 
produce an initial couple of pictures and four years to produce an animated 
feature, not to mention the imponderable of interactive programming. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the exuberance of Spielberg, Katzenberg and Geffen last week promised 
adventure -- and it was a very confident indicator for The Industry and its 
hometown.

INNOVATIVE PRODUCE COMPANY TAKES FINANCIAL BATTERING; SUN WORLD'S SETBACKS 
BLAMED ON UNTIMELY DEATHS, MEXICAN TOMATO COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Think of Sun World, the California produce giant now in deep financial 
trouble, as a beautiful piece of fruit that got bruised on the way to market. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has taken a series of hits in the past three years, ranging from a 
disastrous year for California vegetables and the high cost of growing a tomato 
in Mexico to the untimely deaths or departures of key executives and a 
reluctant French lender who has moved to shut off its credit. 
</P>
<P>
 The setbacks forced the heavily indebted firm to file for protection from its 
creditors early this month under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've lost a lot of money," acknowledged Sun World Chairman Howard P. 
Marguleas, a part owner of Irvine Co. in Orange County and a widely respected 
figure in California agriculture and public life. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the ambitious firm, which Marguleas says has every intention of continuing 
scaled-back operations, has also made a lot of money in the past 18 years, 
while carving out a unique position in the high-risk industry that brings fresh 
fruits and vegetables to supermarket shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea behind Sun World -- which introduced to consumers such popular items 
as the Red Flame seedless grape and the seedless watermelon -- has been to grow 
and ship one-of-a-kind, user-friendly fruits and vegetables, particularly 
during seasons when no one else is growing similar produce. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bigger, redder, blacker, sweeter -- and off-season," Marguleas said during an 
interview in Century City days after the bankruptcy petition was filed in San 
Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Sun World has marketed as many as 75 produce varieties at a time, it 
has been most aggressive in promoting fruits with those features, many of which 
are patented. It also has one of the most elaborate research and development 
operations of any in agribusiness, every year scrutinizing 35,000 new varieties 
of fruit trees and 100,000 new grapes at a facility in Bakersfield, where the 
firm is based. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been very strong marketers," said David L. Moore, president of the 
Western Growers Assn. "They're one of the top produce companies in the country, 
for quality and for quantity.' 
</P>
<P>
 But Sun World also is bogged down with only interim financing for working 
capital -- and with $182 million in long-term debt and other liabilities, 
compared to $188 million in assets. The company maintains that much of its 
assets are in real estate with a market value higher than its book value. 
</P>
<P>
 Sun World was formed in 1976 by three of California's best-known produce men, 
who together still own more than 85% of the stock. 
</P>
<P>
 A former board chairman of the California Chamber of Commerce, Marguleas has 
been the dominant partner, whose strong suits are marketing and promotion as 
well as citrus and date production. He owns more than 65% of Sun World. 
</P>
<P>
 Marguleas was one of the wealthy investors, led by Donald Bren, who in 1977 
bought a 35% interest in Irvine Co. for $337 million after a furious bidding 
war. Now Marguleas is in the process of selling his 5% of the Orange County 
real estate giant for an estimated $94 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The other Sun World founders were Domenick T. (Cookie) Bianco, with 7% of the 
company, a well-respected table grapes grower, and Carl Sam Maggio, an 
experienced vegetable farmer and marketer who owns more than 12% of the 
privately held firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Sun World's first project in uncommon produce was a big success for the fruit 
but an expensive lesson to the company. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1977, Sun World spent millions of dollars on full-page newspaper ads and 
other promotions to market Red Flame seedless grapes, a crisp, tasty variety 
developed by the University of California. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers loved it. But the Red Flame was unpatented, public property. Sun 
World's competitors planted hundreds of acres of the same grape -- and the 
price dropped through the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It became too generic a commodity" to bring the premium price that Sun 
World's promotion and development costs required, Marguleas recalled. "That 
really focused us." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1978, Sun World bought a 50% interest in Interharvest, the big Salinas 
Valley lettuce grower that long had been a focus of angry labor strikes by the 
United Farm Workers of America. Renaming the company Sun Harvest, Sun World 
eventually shut it down after six more years of labor complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 The kind of niche-market success the partners had in mind came in 1983, when 
Sun World delivered its first branded specialty product: the Le Rouge Royale 
sweet red pepper. Yellow and orange patented peppers followed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sun World seedless watermelon debuted in 1988, and the DiVine Ripe tomato 
-- a variety that can be ripened in the field -- arrived in 1990. The next 
year, the Star Sweet deep red grapefruit hit the market, the Black Diamond plum 
arrived one year later. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, despite the distractions of its business problems, Sun World is 
promoting the first California-grown mango, an off-season version of the 
world's most popular fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, Sun World mangoes are selling for as much as $18 each. But it has 
also cost the company an enormous amount to get them into Japanese shopping 
baskets. 
</P>
<P>
 Developing a mango (a fruit normally grown in the tropics) that could be 
produced in the Southern California desert during a part of the year when the 
rest of the world was mango-less was a multimillion-dollar research effort that 
began more than a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The experimental mangoes, planted on a secret plot near Indio, survived a 1990 
freeze only because Sun World used a helicopter to circulate warm air over the 
field. The effort was set back when armed intruders scaled a 12-foot razor-wire 
fence and killed a guard dog to steal a row of the trees in an apparent act of 
commercial espionage. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the company had to familiarize Japanese consumers with a mango that was 
big and tasty but green-skinned even when ripe. Sun World set up sample tables 
in Japanese supermarkets, offering slices of the fruit to shoppers. Each mango 
now bears a Japanese decal that translates, "I'm green, but I'm sweet and ready 
to eat." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Sun World bought Bakersfield-based Superior Farming Co., with 25,000 
acres of farmland and what many believe is the largest tree fruit and grape 
research center in the world. At the same time, the company was expanding its 
operations overseas, particularly in Mexico and Japan as well as 28 other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1992, however, some of the company's projects began to unravel. 
</P>
<P>
 In December of that year, Sun World says, its working capital financier -- 
Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole, France's largest bank -- told the company 
it was pulling out of its investments in the western United States. 
</P>
<P>
 This has left the company without permanent working capital for the past year, 
though Credit Agricole has agreed to provide interim financing until a 
bankruptcy lender can be found. 
</P>
<P>
 "If any farmer's bank pulled their line of credit midseason, the financial 
consequences would be terrible," said Don Johnston, senior partner in Johnston 
Farms, a Bakersfield grower. 
</P>
<P>
 John R. Zivnuska, a Credit Agricole executive, denied that the bank is pulling 
out of its U.S. loans and says the Sun World decision was "based on facts the 
bank became aware of." He declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 However, like other international banks, Credit Agricole has been hit hard by 
soured foreign loans since 1990. In the fallout, heads have rolled at the 
bank's Paris headquarters. The Los Angeles office has been closed, and the San 
Francisco staff cut to four. 
</P>
<P>
 By all accounts, the already-conservative bank has tightened its loan policies 
even further. 
</P>
<P>
 "Credit Agricole was part of all the mess," said Katharine Rossow, a senior 
analyst at Salomon Bros. Since then, all the international banks are more 
conservative in their lending policies, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter what caused Credit Agricole to withdraw, the bank would soon have 
more "facts" to be concerned about. 
</P>
<P>
 The most expensive project to go bad was one involving tomatoes in Mexico. 
Though fertilizer and other essentials cost the same or more there as in 
California, transportation, border-crossing and labor costs were far higher 
than Sun World expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you get done, the unit-per-acre cost is higher in Mexico than in the 
United States -- with labor costing seven times higher," Marguleas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Turnover at Sun World became an issue in the industry. By most reports, the 
inevitable differences of opinion between three strong-minded founders had 
always made Sun World a challenging place to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had some real knock-down battles," one industry executive said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl Sam Maggio quit to start his own business in December, 1992, though he 
remains an owner. President James R. Rinella then 57, retired in 1992. His 
successor, Robert V. Igleheartthen 52, resigned in April, 1993, saying he 
wanted to spend more time with his family. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Poindexter, vice president of sales, resigned last January after 11 
years with the company. In early April, Marguleas himself stepped down to 
concentrate on the sale of his holdings in Irvine Co., though he has since 
returned to active leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Sending more jitters through the produce world, Sun World's longtime 
controller, Jo A. Horning, known for keeping her work close to the vest, died 
of a heart attack after a medical examination at a Rancho Mirage hospital in 
June, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 After the company's books were turned over to a new controller, the company 
began to send -- and is still updating -- a series of financial "adjustments," 
with less optimistic numbers, to its lenders and others. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, in a haunting if apparently coincidental development, the new 
controller, Gary A. Winters, died of a heart attack on a Bakersfield golf 
course. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, California's cauliflower, broccoli, celery and iceberg lettuce 
harvest, crops that Sun World also markets, had a terrible season in 1993. 
Produce on the West Coast couldn't be trucked past the Midwest floods to 
customers who were storm-besieged themselves on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last 11 months have been about the worst that I have ever seen in the 
fresh vegetable business," said Moore of the Western Growers Assn. "We had a 
lot of production, but we didn't have anyone to take the product. And produce 
is a special business. If you don't eat a salad today, it doesn't mean you'll 
eat two tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 As word of Sun World's troubles quietly spread in the industry, growers that 
had marketed their crops through the company began to turn elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, even Irvine Co. shipped 500,000 boxes of avocados through Mission 
Produce Inc. of Oxnard, instead of through Sun World. It sent a million cartons 
of Valencia oranges and grapefruit to Dole Citrus for marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Sun World brought in a new chief executive, turnaround expert John 
P. Brincko, who quickly persuaded the company to file for bankruptcy 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the firm operates year-round, Brincko doesn't expect to have his 
restructuring plan complete for another year. But some elements are already 
clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Plantings will be reduced for the DiVine Ripe tomato. It faces increasing 
competition from two gene-altered varieties that claim the same vine-ripened 
tastiness and long shelf life. The Mexico operation will be cut back, and some 
farmland and other assets will be sold. 
</P>
<P>
 But the mangoes are a big hit in Tokyo, Marguleas says. His Japanese buyers 
expect to take 100,000 boxes next year, up from 5,000 at the beginning of the 
promotion just two years ago. Sun World At-a-Glance

TIMES BOARD OF ADVISERS: WILSON IS BETTER CANDIDATE TO LEAD STATE OUT OF LONG 
NIGHTMARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL J. BOSKIN, MICHAEL J. BOSKIN, former chairman of the President's 
Council of Economic Advisers, is Tully M. Friedman professor of economics and 
senior fellow, Hoover Institution, at Stanford University. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Brown-for-Governor campaign says it will plaster the state with a million 
copies of its (fourth) economic plan for California, which it claims would 
dramatically improve the state's economy. The Wilson-for-Governor campaign 
denounces the plan as a recipe for higher taxes and more bureaucracy that would 
seriously impede the state's recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 But can a governor, working with or over the Legislature, make a sizable 
difference in California's economic life? And if so, how? 
</P>
<P>
 Buffeted by global and national economic forces and severely damaged by 
federal tax and defense policy, the state is slowly emerging from its worst 
downturn since the Depression of the 1930s. Employment is growing, and state 
revenues are running ahead of projections -- business taxes by about 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Clinton tax rate increases hit particularly hard; California is a 
high-income state, so the hikes took their toll further down the income 
distribution here than, say, Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Clinton defense drawdown will be three times as large as the 
Reagan-era buildup. More than half the jobs lost in California during the deep 
recession were defense-related, and the size of the future defense drag on the 
rest of the California economy will be one of the prime determinants of whether 
the recovery will be slow or solid. Even the governor of the nation's largest 
state lacks direct control over these forces -- and has only limited indirect 
influence. 
</P>
<P>
 Technological, demographic and economic forces have also been at work. For 
example, the ability to decouple the sites of corporate headquarters, R&D, 
design, manufacturing and marketing has led to a substantial decentralization 
of corporate America. That, in turn, has increased the competitive pressure to 
have a more hospitable business tax and regulatory environment. 
</P>
<P>
 The early 1990s punctured Californians' naive confidence that rising incomes 
and plentiful jobs would continue regardless not only of national or 
international business cycles, but also of state and local tax, regulatory, 
land-use and judicial policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the previous 20 years, California had developed a reputation as not very 
hospitable to business. Tax rates became non-competitive, regulation and red 
tape excessive and the judicial system an unbalanced albatross often used to 
halt any economic development. The state's economic policies began to exert a 
powerful negative effect on business location and expansion decisions, 
eventually eroding the job climate. 
</P>
<P>
 In this context, it is instructive to compare the different philosophies of 
Pete Wilson and Kathleen Brown. The easiest way to do so is to survey the 
really big economic issues and policy choices that have confronted the state 
over the last few years and the positions each has taken on them. 
</P>
<P>
 First, look at the vision of California's role in the national and world 
economy, revealed in the candidates' different stands on the North America Free 
Trade Agreement. Wilson strongly supported NAFTA; Brown opposed it. Apparently, 
the governor's view is that California can compete and win in the global 
economy, while Brown's view is that California needs to be shielded from global 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 The second big issue is regulation and the micro-management of business. The 
"Big Green" initiative of a few years ago was overwhelmingly rejected by the 
state's voters as an outrageous overreach. Big Green would have been the single 
most economically damaging initiative in the history of the state, ensnarling 
innumerable businesses in red tape and bureaucracy, preventing them from 
growing or locating in California and costing untold jobs. Wilson opposed Big 
Green; Brown supported it. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, it has been widely understood that one of the serious problems facing 
employers in California was an out-of-control, expensive and fraud-ridden 
workers' compensation system. Last year Wilson and the Legislature took an 
important first step toward workers' comp reform; in an appearance before trial 
lawyers, Brown condemned the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth, businesses, like homeowners, pay property taxes. Wilson opposes the 
notion of a "split roll," in which businesses would be charged higher property 
tax rates than homeowners; Brown supports it. 
</P>
<P>
 It appears that Wilson envisions a California in which businesses are allowed 
-- indeed encouraged -- to locate, grow and hire workers. He envisions a 
California taking advantage of its location as the hub of Asia-Pacific trade to 
successfully compete in the global economy, its businesses and their workers 
less encumbered by government bureaucracy, red tape and expensive litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 It appears that Brown, by contrast, envisions a state hospitable to more trial 
lawyers, more government regulation and more regulators -- and afraid of 
confronting new global trading realities. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most explosive issue is taxation. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, the Brown campaign blasts Wilson, somewhat disingenuously, for 
having agreed to raise taxes to get the spending cuts necessary to deal with 
the state's huge budget crisis three years ago. Recall that a $15-billion 
deficit -- roughly a third of the total general-fund budget -- came out of 
nowhere. Yet Brown has said many times she would have done the same thing and 
has proposed several other tax hikes in the interim. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While I am no fan of higher taxes -- they damage the economy -- the proper way 
to think about where taxes would be is to look at the overall budget, not just 
the tax ledger. The independent Commission on State Finances forecast back in 
1990 that state general-fund spending this year would be $60 billion. By taking 
tough action -- much of it very unpopular -- Wilson has kept such spending flat 
at about $40 billion. If spending had been allowed to grow to $60 billion, 
state general-fund taxes would be 50% higher than today, a whopping $20 billion 
more per year, or $2,500 per family of four. 
</P>
<P>
 To conclude, state policies will affect California's economy for better or 
worse in coming years. The choice appears to be between Pete Wilson's approach 
of improving the job climate for businesses to expand and locate in California, 
and Kathleen Brown's 1930s- or 1960s-style government activism and 
micromanagement, albeit muted. 
</P>
<P>
 Even a cursory look around the world or among the states reveals that the 
former approach is what is producing prosperity and growth for regions and 
nations, while the latter has simply not worked.

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: LENDERS READY TO HELP CREDIT-SCARRED 
CONSUMERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Scrambling to find new borrowers in a time of rising interest rates and 
moribund loan demand, mortgage lenders are becoming increasingly accommodating 
to credit-scarred consumers who once would have been turned away. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past few months, several companies have launched loan programs geared 
specifically to prospective home buyers who have had credit woes ranging from 
numerous late payments to bankruptcies and foreclosures. And lenders without 
formal programs say they are ready to be flexible -- particularly if the 
borrower's credit woes stemmed from a job loss or recession-related event 
largely out of the individual's control. 
</P>
<P>
 All this spells opportunity for wanna-be homeowners -- even if they've been 
rejected for a mortgage in the past. Although there have always been a handful 
of lenders willing to make mortgages to so-called "sub-standard" risks -- for a 
price -- the number of lenders in this market has recently started to boom. And 
that has resulted in greater loan availability and more reasonable interest 
rates and fees, experts maintain. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole lender community is looking at this," says Robert M. Rosenblatt, 
director of surveys and statistics at the Mortgage Bankers Assn. in Washington, 
D.C. "They're looking for growth opportunities. And this is an area that they 
may have overlooked before." 
</P>
<P>
 The attention to second-tier risks is a major departure for mortgage lenders, 
which had become increasingly strict after back-to-back years of record loan 
demand in 1992 and 1993. But it's no coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest rate hikes that started in February have decimated loan demand. 
Currently, experts estimate that loan volume is down by 40% or 50% from 
year-ago levels. For the year, largely thanks to a strong first quarter, 
mortgage originations are expected to drop by about 30% to roughly $700 billion 
from more than $1 trillion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 As mortgage volume began to dive, lenders started to scramble to find 
business. That's led to rapid development of new mortgage products, including 
programs geared to individuals with checkered credit histories. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis, Mo.-based Prudential Home Mortgage, for example, launched a 
"flexible home financing program" this summer that drastically lowered the 
hurdles to qualify for a mortgage. Specifically, Prudential says it will 
overlook past credit problems if the consumer has steady income and readily 
pays his or her debts. It won't hold minor charge-offs or collection accounts 
against you, and it will try to create a credit history for those who do not 
have one by tracking rent or utility payments. 
</P>
<P>
 ARCS Mortgage goes a step further. You can have a home foreclosure or even a 
bankruptcy in your not-to-distant past and still qualify for a loan, says John 
Lucas, vice president and manager of ARCS Van Nuys branch. 
</P>
<P>
 And the big secondary market leaders -- the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 
and the Federal National Mortgage Assn. -- say they're stressing "flexibility" 
in their ordinary lending guidelines for anyone whose credit woes were spurred 
by the economy rather than poor credit management. These federally chartered 
firms, which are better known by the monikers Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, don't 
originate loans directly. But they buy millions of loans from banks, thrifts 
and mortgage bankers. As a result, Fannie and Freddie lending standards become 
the industry's lending standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's say you lost your job and, because of the economy, couldn't find a new 
one right away. You also couldn't sell your home, so it went into foreclosure. 
But three or four years later you have stable income and have re-established 
yourself," says John Hemschoot, director of home mortgage standards at Freddie 
Mac. "You were clearly in a situation that was beyond your control. We would 
still consider you to be an A credit." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The catch to all this is that loan rates and fees for "substandard" mortgages 
are still substantially higher than on loans made to borrowers with pristine 
credit. Lenders are also likely to be sticklers about the home's appraised 
value, since the risk of foreclosure is relatively higher. 
</P>
<P>
 How much more you'd pay varies based on your actual credit problems, though. 
At Prudential, where the acceptable credit problems are relatively minor, you'd 
pay about one-half to two percentage points more for a loan than a perfect 
credit risk. At ARCS, where truly bad risks can apply, the risk "premium" is 
three percentage points or more. In other words, where a good risk would pay 
5%, a bad risk would pay anywhere from 8% to 12% on an adjustable mortgage, 
depending on your credit record. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, that's better than what was available to credit scarred borrowers in 
the past, when the only option was often so-called "asset-based" loans that 
came with double-digit interest rates and fees that could amount to 10% to 15% 
of the mortgage amount. 
</P>
<P>
 It's worth mentioning that if your problems were strictly recession-related, 
you may be able to get a loan at standard rates. However, it may take a lot of 
shopping -- and explaining -- to do so, says Hemschoot. Why? Standard-term 
loans are usually sold to Fannie and Freddie. And many lenders still believe 
they will only accept perfect risks. Hemschoot has orchestrated an education 
campaign aimed at explaining why that's not true. But between banks, thrifts 
and mortgage bankers there are more than 20,000 lenders in America and some 
have yet to get the message.

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: KEEP EMERGING-MARKET INVESTING IN PERSPECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES, a financial writer for the Arizona Republic, 
specializes in mutual funds. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The sideshow's over, and it's time to head back to the main tent. That's the 
way Michael Perelstein, lead portfolio manager for two new MainStay 
International funds, sizes up the global-investment arena. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when investors' passion for emerging stock markets has never been 
higher, Perelstein is recommending that fund shareholders get back to basics -- 
which in his view means the established foreign markets of Western Europe and 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, he has recently reduced the emerging-markets exposure in the MainStay 
funds and the other foreign portfolios he runs to zero, while boosting Japan to 
35% and Western Europe to 65%. Perelstein oversees $500 million for 
MacKay-Shields, a New York firm that manages the MainStay funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Perelstein's belief that the world's developing nations aren't worth investing 
in at current prices is debatable. But his caution is well-advised considering 
the recent flood of money that has headed into international mutual funds 
generally and Third World portfolios in particular. 
</P>
<P>
 Shareholders would be wise to keep emerging-markets investments in proper 
perspective, best viewed as dessert rather than the main course. 
</P>
<P>
 And with the economies of Japan and Western Europe finally emerging from 
recession, that idea is becoming more palatable. 
</P>
<P>
 "The emerging-markets rationale made sense when the developed economies 
weren't growing," says Perelstein, who hails from a country with an emerging 
market, Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "But now the cycle's turning in Europe and Japan." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not an isolated message. 
</P>
<P>
 Heinrich Looser, a top investment official at Switzerland's Bank Julius Baer, 
says he currently finds only two emerging Asian markets attractive, Thailand 
and Taiwan, but likes several European markets, including Germany, France and 
Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 "The growth rates in the European economies have been picking up nicely over 
the last six months," says Looser, who is predicting a 10% to 15% rise in those 
key markets by mid-1995.  
</P>
<P>
 Perelstein said he thinks German corporate profits could advance 30% this 
year, with profit increases of up to 25% in Japan over the next 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
 An emerging-markets enthusiast who avoided Japan would have missed nearly a 
20% average gain through the first nine months of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 More critical, some people might not appreciate the greater economic and 
political risks of investing in small markets where declines of 30% or 40% 
aren't uncommon. 
</P>
<P>
 Mutual funds are excellent vehicles for diversifying these risks, but the 
voracious buying and selling power of emerging-markets funds has itself added 
an element of volatility. 
</P>
<P>
 "This huge flow of cash into international markets seems to have upset the 
normal supply and demand, particularly in the very small marketplaces," says 
Harry Papp of L. Roy Papp & Associates, a Phoenix fund-management company that 
sticks exclusively with American stocks and those of a few developed nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Perelstein agrees. "There are no institutional buyers in many of these 
emerging markets, only U.S. mutual funds," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, there's no question that developing nations such as China, Mexico 
and India will offer exceptional growth opportunities over the long haul. But 
fund shareholders should keep in mind that all such markets currently weigh in 
at only one-tenth or so of the global value of all stocks, so it's best not to 
go overboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Several well-known international funds -- including EuroPacific Growth, T. 
Rowe Price International, Templeton Foreign and Warburg Pincus International -- 
have been maintaining ample stakes in Third World nations anyway, sometimes in 
excess of 33% of assets. Adding a pure emerging fund on top of this could bump 
up your overall risk substantially. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Penney, an investment adviser at the Acacia Group in Phoenix, suggests 
that middle-of-the-road investors earmark 15% to 20% of their overall fund 
holdings to foreign markets, but only one-third of that in the emerging sphere. 
</P>
<P>
 For aggressive shareholders, he suggests roughly a 30% foreign weight, with 
one-third of that in emerging nations. 
</P>
<P>
 These postures would imply a 5% to 10% overall position in developing 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "A 10% stake can have a dramatic effect on your portfolio, if it grows 35% a 
year annually over time, which I think is possible," Penney says. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you have to realize that these funds will be among the most volatile 
investments in your portfolio." 
</P>
<P>
 Moral of the story: Invest in emerging markets via mutual funds, but don't put 
them at the core of your foreign holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 Scudder, Stevens & Clark has opened a walk-in investor center in San Diego, at 
9450 Scranton Ave. The no-load fund group has nine other offices across the 
country, including centers in Los Angeles and San Francisco. Third-World Slice 
</P>
<P>
 Investors might want to be wary of getting carried away with mutual funds that 
invest in emerging economies of Asia and Latin America, given that the stock 
markets in these nations remain relatively small. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is how selected nations and regions weigh in as a percentage of global 
stock market values. 
</P>
<P>
 United States: 34.6% 
</P>
<P>
 Japan and Hong Kong: 25.3% 
</P>
<P>
 Europe: 24.3% 
</P>
<P>
 Emerging Asia: 7.5% 
</P>
<P>
 Australia, Canada, N.Z.: 4.0%

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: IRS SETS DONATED-PROPERTY TRAPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q: I bought a time share in foreclosure for an amount that was many times less 
than identical units are currently selling for. I want to donate this time 
share to a charitable organization. What kind of tax deduction am I allowed to 
claim? Is it based on what I paid or the fair market value of similar units not 
sold at foreclosure? -- R.P.B . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: You are venturing, perhaps unknowingly, into some potentially treacherous 
waters. Be warned that this territory has been filled with IRS traps designed 
to ensnare those who would bottom-fish for distressed properties and later 
transform them into tax-deductible charitable contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 There are several tests you must meet for your strategy to work. For starters, 
you must hold your property for at least one year to claim a deduction higher 
than the amount you paid for that asset. If you wait this period, then you may 
value your donation based on what similar properties are selling for. 
</P>
<P>
 However, if the value of the donation is more than $5,000, you must secure an 
independent appraisal of the asset. The appraisal must be signed by the person 
performing it and filed with your tax return. (You must complete Form 8283 as 
well.) An independent appraisal is not necessary if the value of the donation 
is less than $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 There's more. If the charity disposes of the property you donate within two 
years of its receipt and receives more than $500 for it, the IRS must be 
notified of the price the charity received, along with the name of the donor. 
You should know that most charities dispose of gifts such as real estate, 
automobiles, time shares and the like rather quickly because they cost the 
charity money to maintain. And you should also know that any significant 
difference between the amount the charity receives for the asset and its 
appraisal can trigger an immediate IRS audit. Be careful. IRS Casualty 
Insurance Proceeds Rules Cited 
</P>
<P>
 Q: In two recent columns you discussed the circumstances under which taxes 
could be levied on unreinvested casualty insurance settlement proceeds. Will 
you cite the actual IRS code section and explain its rationale? I can't fathom 
why unspent homeowner casualty insurance proceeds should be potentially 
taxable. Why don't the same rules apply as with auto insurance settlements that 
are not spent for car repair? -- H.J.F . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: The rules governing casualty insurance proceeds are covered in Sect. 165 of 
the Internal Revenue Code. Now for the "why" of these regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Basically, the government does not want us to collect money without paying 
taxes on it, and they consider insurance proceeds a source of such funds. To 
understand why, you must first understand that unreinvested insurance proceeds 
are considered taxable only to the extent that they result in a gain for the 
taxpayer. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider this scenario: You receive a $50,000 insurance settlement that you 
choose not to spend to repair your home. Then you sell the home, on which you 
had a $100,000 taxable basis, for $300,000. You must add the $50,000 settlement 
proceeds to your $200,000 taxable gain because your tax basis in the house was 
reduced by the amount of the unspent settlement. Of course, you may defer 
payment of the tax by purchasing a home for equal or greater value. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite your belief to the contrary, this philosophy applies equally to auto 
insurance payments. However, because cars generally depreciate in value -- 
unlike real estate which typically has appreciated -- a sale of a used car 
rarely results in a gain. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, if you bought a car for $20,000 and received a $2,000 repair 
settlement that you did not spend on repairs, you would be liable for taxes on 
that amount if you received more than $18,000 when you sold the vehicle. But as 
you well know, unless the car is a vintage model -- and in terrific condition 
-- you are unlikely to see such a sales price.  
</P>
<P>
 By the way, if you really want to be angry at Uncle Sam's taxation policy, you 
should focus on the fact that he taxes gains from residential home sales -- but 
does not offer tax deductions for any losses suffered on the sale on your 
principal residence. Homeowner Settlement Gain or Profit Exclusion 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Can you take a few more questions on casualty insurance reinvestments? If a 
home is sold within the four or so years allowed for reinvestments, is the 
unspent portion taxable? Can a homeowner apply his or her $125,000 profit 
exclusion to this amount if they are eligible to invoke it? -- R.E . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: If the home is sold before the settlement money is spent -- and that sale 
results in a gain for the homeowner -- the settlement proceeds are added to the 
taxable gain on the transaction. If a homeowner qualifies for the $125,000 
profit exclusion, it can be applied against the entire gain, including the 
amount of the insurance settlement.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Note: Due to an editing error, last week's item on the taxability of casualty 
insurance settlements was misleading. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer addressed how taxes are assessed on homeowner insurance settlement 
proceeds that are not spent within approximately four years of receipt to 
repair the damage to the house.  
</P>
<P>
 Taxes are levied on unreinvested insurance proceeds to the extent that the 
settlement results in a gain to the taxpayer. How the gain is realized differs 
according to the circumstances of the taxpayer. If the unreinvested proceeds 
are greater than the taxpayer's basis in the home, that excess is subject to 
taxation at the end of the four-year period. 
</P>
<P>
 If the unspent proceeds are less than the basis, they are not immediately 
taxable. However, the taxpayer's basis in the home is reduced by the amount of 
the settlement -- thus subjecting the taxpayer to taxation on a larger gain.

A PLAN TO HELP YOU CHOOSE AMONG HEALTH PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many public and private employers encourage their workers to choose so-called 
managed-care plans that limit your health care options but save you -- and your 
employer -- money in premiums, deductibles and co-payments. 
</P>
<P>
 However, some workers are reluctant to enroll in managed-care plans such as 
health maintenance organizations because they're concerned about the quality 
and availability of services. In the past, it was difficult to gauge quality, 
because plans volunteered little quality-related information -- and consumers 
didn't know what questions to ask to make such determinations. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's changing too. A variety of organizations are creating formulas to 
measure plan quality. For example, a group of employers, consultants, insurers 
and health care providers came up with a measurement called HEDIS, for Health 
Plan Employer Data and Information Set. Meanwhile, the California Public 
Employees Retirement System, which offers 25 different plans to roughly 336,000 
state, county, municipal and special assessment district workers, is conducting 
satisfaction surveys. 
</P>
<P>
 Although few open-enrollment packages include the results of these efforts 
yet, consumers can benefit by knowing the questions these experts are asking -- 
and the kind of responses they expect to hear. 
</P>
<P>
 The HEDIS program, which was designed to help employers (rather than 
employees) screen plans, rates them in four broad categories: quality, access 
and patient satisfaction, membership and utilization, and finance. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In many cases, the HEDIS questions are technical and require significant 
medical knowledge to weigh the responses. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, HEDIS aims to measure how well individual plans perform in 
preventive medicine. It looks at the availability -- and use of -- 
immunizations, cholesterol screening, mammograms and Pap smears. 
</P>
<P>
 It also measures the number of low birth-weight babies born to members of the 
plan and the percentage of the plan's participants receiving prenatal care in 
the first three months of pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 HEDIS also attempts to measure different plans' quality of treatment for acute 
and chronic diseases -- as well as mental health and substance abuse -- by 
evaluating readmission rates and follow-up procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in the category of "access and patient satisfaction," the HEDIS 
questions are easy to fathom: 
</P>
<P>
 * Does the health plan survey participant satisfaction? 
</P>
<P>
 * What percentage of its members are "very satisfied" with the plan? 
</P>
<P>
 * What percentage of the plan's physicians are actually accepting new 
patients? (This reflects a criticism often voiced by some members of 
managed-care programs, who say that even though their plan has a long list of 
participating doctors, many on the list say they're too busy to take new 
patients.) 
</P>
<P>
 * How do consumers gain access to the plan's services? Are there published 
procedures regarding what you must do to see a doctor or specialist? Does the 
plan provide employees to answer questions over the phone? 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, after conducting a series of public meetings and focus groups, 
CalPERS developed a set of 80 questions to determine participant satisfaction. 
The pension fund divides its questions into nine categories that address 
everything from administrative problems to quality of care. 
</P>
<P>
 Asking plan sponsors variations of these questions can help you determine how 
likely you are to be satisfied with any given plan. The questions: 
</P>
<P>
 * How long must you wait to get an appointment for a routine visit? How long 
must you wait to get an appointment for an urgent problem? To get advice over 
the phone? How long are patients typically kept waiting during office visits? 
Are patients informed when the doctor is running more than half an hour late? 
How are after-hours medical needs addressed? 
</P>
<P>
 (If the plan sponsor can't answer some of these questions, consider asking 
participating doctors directly.) 
</P>
<P>
 * How are the plan doctors chosen? What percentage are board-certified? Does 
the plan have physician profiles or biographies available so you can consider 
the doctors' backgrounds and education before choosing? 
</P>
<P>
 * Is there a medical "gatekeeper" who determines when you can see a 
specialist? If so, how flexible is the gatekeeping process? Must you always see 
the gatekeeper first, or can you self-refer to a specialist in some 
circumstances? If so, what are they? 
</P>
<P>
 * What is the procedure in an emergency? Does it vary based on the type of 
emergency? For example, if your child has a bad fall and you're worried about a 
concussion, can you seek out-of-system care close to home, or must you go to an 
in-system doctor or hospital to get reimbursed? Is the answer the same for 
heart ailments, strokes, premature labor, asthma attacks and broken bones? What 
happens if an emergency turns out to be a false alarm? Can your claim be denied 
after you've already received care? 
</P>
<P>
 * How are administrative problems handled? Is there an appeals process for 
denied claims? How does it work? 
</P>
<P>
 Soon -- possibly within a year -- many employees will receive the results of 
consumer satisfaction surveys with their open-enrollment materials, says Nancy 
Quinlan, a spokeswoman for CalPERS. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, consumers must do their own homework. Health Cost Work Sheet 
</P>
<P>
 How do you determine the most cost-effective health plan for your family? Plot 
your out-of-pocket costs in each plan by adding up your health-care usage in a 
typical year. A look at last year's check register -- or your family health 
insurance file -- may help you complete this work sheet.

NEWS ANALYSIS; MIDEAST VIOLENCE LEAVES PEACE QUEST AT CROSSROADS; TERROR: 
ISRAELIS, IN SHOCK, WONDER IF IT'S SAFE TO PROCEED. PLO FEARS A CRACKDOWN ON 
RADICALS COULD TRIP CIVIL WAR. 
</P>

<P>
 With two devastating attacks in the heart of Israel last week, Islamic 
militants have thrown into serious doubt the course of Middle East peace 
negotiations, forcing Israel and its Arab partners into a hard reassessment. 
</P>
<P>
 Israelis -- horrified by the abduction and killing of a young soldier and by 
the murderous attack earlier on a popular cafe district in Jerusalem -- are 
asking themselves whether it is safe to proceed if this is the result of the 
tentative peace with the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 Even supporters of peace with the Palestinians find it difficult to argue that 
the pace should be faster, not slower, to deny the radicals time and space to 
strike again. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palestine Liberation Organization, held accountable by Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Rabin for the terrorist upsurge by the Islamists, is confronted with a 
need to crack down on the radicals -- but not at the cost of a civil conflict 
that could quickly engulf all of the Palestinian territories. 
</P>
<P>
 PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, who has carefully encouraged the moderation of 
Hamas, the largest Islamic group, now sees it pulled back toward radicalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighboring Arab states, notably Syria, must worry about a sharp diminution in 
Israel's will to make peace, about an understandable preference among many here 
for the security they have known through the strength of arms. What price must 
the Arabs then pay to engage and reassure Israel? 
</P>
<P>
 And the Islamic militants themselves, while exulting in the success of their 
two latest attacks, must consider whether to attempt to frustrate the 
peacemaking process totally, as they have wanted, and risk being crushed by 
Israel and the PLO, or to settle for a place within a future Palestinian 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very much in danger of losing our bearings through events like those 
of the past week," said Ziad abu Zayyad, a PLO activist in Jerusalem. "Emotions 
take over. Worst-case scenarios somehow become real. When they kidnaped that 
soldier, they tried to kidnap the peace process and hold it hostage. Let us 
hope peace did not die when he was killed. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "All of us -- Palestinians, Israelis, Syrians, Jordanians, Lebanese -- are at 
the mercy of the radicals, those who are willing to offer their lives and to 
take the lives of others to make up for their lack of popular support," he 
added. "This is no less true of Israelis than it is of Palestinians. None of us 
has escaped from the extremists." 
</P>
<P>
 Although two bus station bombings by Hamas in the spring and a massacre by an 
Israeli settler at a West Bank mosque caused many more Israeli and Palestinian 
casualties, the two attacks last week by the Islamic Resistance Movement, as 
Hamas is formally known, dramatized for both Israelis and Palestinians the 
dangers they face in pursuing peaceful coexistence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Upon reflection, I doubt that our people will want to reverse course," a 
senior Israeli official said Saturday, "nor even to slow the process. But we 
all want reassurance because, frankly, we are nervous because of what has 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Last Sunday evening, Hamas gunmen attacked Jerusalem's popular cafe district, 
opening fire with automatic rifles and hurling grenades. Two people were 
fatally wounded before police and soldiers killed the attackers. 
</P>
<P>
 The same evening, other Hamas guerrillas abducted Cpl. Nachshon Waxman, 19, 
near Tel Aviv and demanded that Israeli authorities release 200 prisoners from 
radical Palestinian groups and meet other demands in return for his freedom. On 
Friday, Waxman, three of his captors and an Israeli commando died in an 
abortive rescue attempt in an Arab village just outside Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have hit us hard and they have hurt us badly," another Israeli official 
said. "Any attack, particularly any death, resonates through the whole country. 
That these attacks occurred when and where they did, and despite all of our 
security, just deepens the sorrow and the anger." 
</P>
<P>
 This is what has put the joint Israeli and Palestinian search for peace at a 
crossroads: Each side expected much more of the other than it has delivered, 
possibly more than it can deliver; each consequently faces the hard decision of 
whether, how and at what pace to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Israelis, the goal of peacemaking has been to enhance long-term 
security; for the Palestinians, self-rule and the hope of independence. 
</P>
<P>
 The aims of both now appear to be further away. 
</P>
<P>
 As Rabin and other Israeli leaders made clear this weekend, they expected that 
the PLO would deal with Palestinian radicals -- the main threat to the peace 
process -- as part of the agreement on self-government. That Hamas' latest 
attacks occurred inside Israel did not matter, Rabin argued, for the radicals' 
headquarters was in the Gaza Strip, which the PLO controls. 
</P>
<P>
 So certain was Rabin that Waxman had been taken to "a Hamas dungeon in Gaza" 
that he held Arafat "personally responsible" for the soldier's fate, closed the 
Gaza Strip and applied further pressure through the United States and Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
 When Waxman was found in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, less than two miles 
from his parents' home in northern Jerusalem, Rabin still asserted that Hamas 
was a Palestinian responsibility, declaring that the operation had been ordered 
and planned in the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 But Arafat's initial moves against Hamas -- massive police sweeps of the Gaza 
Strip, the roundup of more than 300 Hamas members and on Saturday an order to 
disarm its military wing -- brought threats from the group to "set Gaza ablaze" 
with protests against the PLO and the Palestinian Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the Palestinian Authority has won few gains in the 
continuing negotiations with Israel -- little to show its many critics that the 
year-old accord on self-government was worth the compromises involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinian officials quickly tick off the outstanding issues: the release of 
almost 5,000 prisoners still held by Israel, national elections envisioned in 
the agreement on self-government, redeployment of Israeli forces out of West 
Bank towns and villages, expansion of the Palestinian Authority in the West 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "The peace process is based essentially on trust, and that trust has been lost 
to the point where each side expects the worst of all the others," said Dr. 
Ahmed Tibi, a Jerusalem physician who advises Arafat on relations with Israel 
and who attempted to mediate the kidnaping crisis last week. "An effort will 
have to be made to get beyond all this and to rebuild that trust." 
</P>
<P>
 The first moves, Palestinian officials said, should be the lifting of the 
closure of the Gaza Strip that Rabin imposed after Waxman's abduction and 
immediate resumption of negotiations on Palestinian elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "The negotiations should not be used as a weapon whenever an incident occurs 
-- it will jeopardize the relations between both sides," Palestinian 
Information Minister Yasser Abed-Rabbo said in Gaza City. "It's important to 
regain the momentum we lost in the past weeks, to get down the road." 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin, while acknowledging that his harsh demands upon Arafat were "not valid" 
because Waxman was not in Gaza, said it is "not so simple" to return to the 
negotiations. Israel, he implied, would want to reach an understanding with the 
PLO on control of Hamas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gaza has become a fertile ground for the activities of Hamas, not only within 
the Gaza Strip but beyond," Rabin said, demanding that the Palestinian 
Authority succeed where the Israeli occupation failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat, he added, "cannot have peace with Israel and peace with Hamas."

ARISTIDE, IN JOYFUL RETURN, CALLS ON HAITIANS FOR RECONCILIATION; CARIBBEAN: 
THOUSANDS GATHER TO WELCOME FIRST DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED PRESIDENT BACK FROM 
THREE-YEAR EXILE. AMERICAN TROOPS MAINTAIN TIGHT SECURITY IN CAPITAL.

<P>
 Jean-Bertrand Aristide stepped onto Haitian soil Saturday for the first time 
in more than three years, restoring his presidency and resuming his nation's 
fragile attempts at democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 He returned, he said, bringing a message of "honor, respect, nonviolence and 
reconciliation. The 15th of October. What a beautiful day this is . . . a day 
to celebrate, a day of deliverance, a day of nonviolence." 
</P>
<P>
 The exile for Haiti's first democratically elected president ended at 12:26 
p.m., when he waved and walked down the stairway from his U.S. Air Force Boeing 
707 and stepped onto the tarmac. 
</P>
<P>
 The airport was closed to the public, with only caretaker Prime Minister 
Robert Malval and a handful of diplomats and other dignitaries attending. The 
slightly built Aristide, wearing a blue and red presidential sash, waved, shook 
hands and saluted when a brief version of the national anthem was played. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of people lined roads around the fenced-off airport, and thousands 
more gathered throughout the city, particularly at the Presidential Palace, 
where Aristide was flown by U.S. Army Blackhawk helicopters to deliver his 
message of reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanying Aristide were 200 diplomats, dignitaries, politicians, 
journalists and others. Secretary of State Warren Christopher was the ranking 
American official. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference later, Christopher called the return of Aristide a 
culmination of President Clinton's vow to restore democracy, made during his 
1992 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope all the coup leaders, all the military men in the hemisphere who have 
designs on their democratic government will take a lesson from this," 
Christopher told reporters before returning to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide said his return to Haiti signaled the end of a three-year reign of 
military terror and a history of violence and hatred. 
</P>
<P>
 But even the military has a place in the new Haiti, Aristide said, urging his 
followers to "walk hand in hand with (members of) the Haitian military who want 
peace. To the soldiers and officers," he said, "I come here to bring peace to 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 To show that he accepted some military presence, but not too much, there was a 
small group of Haitian officers sitting near him. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide also said it was time to put aside past disputes with the United 
States over his former policies and his tactics for returning. 
</P>
<P>
 The Haitian leader, who privately had criticized President Clinton for his 
initial reluctance to totally support his resurrection, thanked the President 
before leaving Washington on Saturday morning, saying he and the U.S. troops 
had made his restoration possible. 
</P>
<P>
 When he arrived here, he turned to poetry to thank Clinton, telling the tens 
of thousands or so people filling the streets and parks in front of the palace 
that "I have bought a bouquet of flowers and sent its perfumed aroma to 
President Clinton." 
</P>
<P>
 To the hundreds of thousands of Haitians who gathered throughout the capital 
and the nation it wasn't the words, no matter how poetically stated, that 
mattered. Only the second coming of a man several supporters called their 
"messiah" mattered. 
</P>
<P>
 They went wild when they heard via radio that Aristide had landed at the 
airport, wilder when his helicopter touched down on the palace lawn and wildest 
when he stepped out and blew kisses. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowds, sweating from their frenzy and the 90-degree heat, stretched hands 
toward the sky, chanted Aristide's name, danced and waved flags and green, 
leafy branches as signs of renewal. 
</P>
<P>
 But almost as if it were only his presence that counted, people began to drift 
away from the palace during the brief welcoming ceremonies that preceded his 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he was about halfway through the 40-minute speech, given from 
behind a three-sided bulletproof shield, and had switched from Creole to 
English, probably 20% of the crowd had drifted away. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, for the thousands who continued pushing against the green, wrought-iron 
fence and strained to hear Aristide's words, there was emotion aplenty when the 
man called "TiTid" -- or "little Aristide" in Creole -- released a small white 
dove and called out, "Honor, respect. . . . I open my heart and my arms to 
salute you." 
</P>
<P>
 If there were any regrets over his return, any sign of the nervous conditions 
his foes said clouded and distorted his judgment, Aristide kept them buried 
deep. 
</P>
<P>
 He was clearly the master of the people. He was, in the words of Dejoie 
Thibauld, who had waited in the Champs de Mars since Friday afternoon, "my 
messiah." 
</P>
<P>
 That emotion had brought Aristide and his radical populism nearly 70% of the 
vote in December, 1990. The implications of such support for a man who clearly 
wanted to radically reform and weaken the existing system of class privilege, 
elite economic domination and military power made Aristide vulnerable from the 
start. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide was only in the seventh month of his five-year term when a military 
revolt organized first by a then-obscure police major, Michel-Joseph Francois, 
and later joined by the army commander in chief, Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, drove 
him from office. 
</P>
<P>
 Those two officers and Brig. Gen. Philippe Biamby, the army chief of staff, 
joined to create one of the most brutal and corrupt regimes Haiti has ever 
witnessed, a considerable feat in a country ruled almost constantly throughout 
its existence by slave owners, tyrants and killers. 
</P>
<P>
 Francois left Haiti nearly two weeks ago under an agreement negotiated by 
former President Jimmy Carter that removed the three officers. Biamby and 
Cedras left on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 There was one banner printed in English that called for "Justice First, 
Reconciliation After," but the clear mood of Aristide and the crowd was to put 
the past aside and focus on the present and future. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a day on which the sun of democracy never sets," he called out, "a 
day of reconciliation. . . . We must be tolerant, (and) that means reconciling 
the rights of others." 
</P>
<P>
 But there was a hint of warning. "Never, never, never ever again will blood be 
shed in this country. We are all thirsty for peace. . . . Coups must never 
occur again." 
</P>
<P>
 The stress on peace and reconciliation brought praise from his American 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "His message of no vengeance, no violence, is the right thing to heal Haiti, 
attract investment and create jobs to break the cycle of poverty," the Rev. 
Jesse Jackson told reporters right before the speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Maxine Waters, the Democratic congresswoman from South Los Angeles and a 
leader of the Congressional Black Caucus, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what we have been working for," she said, "the return of President 
Aristide to take his rightful place. We have done the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means Haitians finally have a chance for democracy and can move to rebuild 
the country and build a future for their children. . . . It's never too late 
for democracy." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Aristide talked about the imperatives driving Haitian democracy and 
the need for Haitians to come together and solve the nation's problems, there 
was no doubt that his return was the work of Americans and that any solutions 
for the future lie in their hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of employees of the U.S. Agency for International Development already 
live here, and more are to come. AID is the chief American agency that will 
administer and pay for many of the multimillion-dollar development programs 
Aristide and the international community hope will propel Haiti into a 
meaningful recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most evident symbol of American importance for, if not domination of, 
this tiny Caribbean nation are the U.S. troops, the soldiers who made 
Aristide's physical return possible and who will stay on to protect his life 
and government. 
</P>
<P>
 They were everywhere, American faces looking out from under distinctive 
American helmets, American hands clutching American weapons and American tanks 
on every major street and around almost every corner. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-plane convoy that brought Aristide home from exile were American 
jetliners, and most of the 1,000 people allowed onto the palace grounds were 
Americans -- U.S. officials, dignitaries, journalists, politicians and 
Aristide's closest American friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of security concerns and in deference to the important foreigners, 
ordinary Haitians were kept outside the gates and many were unable to hear the 
soft-spoken president over an inadequate sound system. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the thousands who stayed in the tropical heat in the Champs de Mars -- 
made up of the parks and 12-lane roadway outside the palace -- thundered their 
approval at every squawk and squeal from the speakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide: "Has my (squawk) return (screech) brought about a (inaudible)?" 
</P>
<P>
 Crowd: Cheers. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide: (Inaudible) reconciliation?" 
</P>
<P>
 Crowd: Large cheers. 
</P>
<P>
 "TiTid, TiTid, TiTid," chanted the people. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is my blood, my life," shrieked one aged woman, her stooped body 
straightening as she thrust her bone-thin arms into the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is us, he is us!" one gaunt man boomed. "He belongs to me!" 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide was brisk and self-possessed as he walked to the podium in a black 
suit and the presidential sash. His face was framed by gold-rimmed, wide 
aviator-style glasses, his eyes shining. 
</P>
<P>
 His gapped teeth were brilliantly white as he smiled broadly at his followers. 
</P>
<P>
 After his speech, Aristide disappeared into the cavernous palace to lunch with 
guests. By the time darkness had settled and street parties were developing 
outside the palace gates, the restored president had not re-emerged. 
</P>
<P>
 That was what American and Haitian security officials had recommended. They 
hope to keep him out of the public eye for the next two or three days to allow 
for people to settle down and return to a routine. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of that routine will be barbed wire and cordons of tanks, armored 
vehicles and troops positioned all around the palace and on the route between 
his office and the home he will eventually occupy. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are still plenty of people out there who want to kill him," said Col. 
Mike Sullivan, commander of the American military police unit here. "I suspect 
we will protect him for a long time to come."

ON FLIGHT HOME, ARISTIDE SAVORS THE MOMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The night before his return to Haiti, Jean-Bertrand Aristide said, he stayed 
up until 4:30 in the morning working on his speech. Then he went to bed in his 
Washington apartment, his last night of sleep in exile. 
</P>
<P>
 Half an hour later, the telephone rang. It was Aristide's mother, calling from 
Miami with some last-minute advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Be sweet," she told her son. "Be very cool. . . . Celebrate your 
reconciliation." 
</P>
<P>
 And would he take her advice? "Sure," Aristide said Saturday with a broad 
smile -- a sweet smile, even -- speaking with reporters on the U.S. Air Force 
plane taking him back to Port-au-Prince. "It went straight to my heart." 
</P>
<P>
 On the 3 1/2-hour flight, Aristide sat in a large captain's chair at the head 
of a small conference table, surrounded by his closest aides, and put the 
finishing touches on his speech. The Haitian president used the cabin that is 
normally occupied by the senior aides to Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
during his trips abroad; Christopher, who was also aboard the flight, kept 
largely to his own private cabin. 
</P>
<P>
 When a reporter asked why Aristide had chosen to return to his native land 
aboard a U.S. Air Force plane -- seemingly an odd note for a poor country 
fiercely proud of its independence -- Aristide smiled and said it was because 
the U.S. military intervention in Haiti "is so peaceful." 
</P>
<P>
 A senior U.S. official said the White House was astonished when Aristide asked 
to ride to Haiti as a guest on Christopher's plane. 
</P>
<P>
 National Security Adviser Anthony Lake "assumed that Aristide would want to 
charter a plane of his own," the official said. "But Aristide came back and 
said no, there's no hiding the fact that he is returning thanks to American 
intervention -- so he might as well capitalize on it." 
</P>
<P>
 In effect, the official suggested, Aristide was reminding his opponents that 
he has the full weight of the United States behind his newly re-established 
regime. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of his three years in exile, Aristide struck many in Washington -- 
even some of his own supporters -- as a prickly, difficult man who revealed 
little of himself save an iron will to return home and an abiding suspicion of 
the United States government. That Aristide was the one on display last month, 
when he stolidly refused to accept a deal for his return negotiated by former 
President Jimmy Carter until he was fully convinced of its virtues. 
</P>
<P>
 But in recent weeks, a new Aristide has been on display: ebullient, confident 
and occasionally even straightforward in his political pronouncements. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been a visible change," said John Plebani, a Washington lawyer who 
has been one of the Clinton Administration's main day-to-day liaisons with 
Aristide. He laughed. "It's been visible ever since Sept. 19" -- the date the 
first of more than 20,000 U.S. troops landed in the Caribbean nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration has pinned large hopes on the confidence and ability of 
this slight man, and puts great store in the notion that exile has transformed 
him from a mass-movement rabble-rouser to a more tempered and moderate 
statesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "The time for struggle and resistance is past," Christopher said, just as a 
reminder, as he loaded Aristide on the plane in Washington on Saturday morning. 
"The time for governance has begun." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to a few reporters accompanying him on his flight, Aristide hit the 
conciliatory notes his American backers had hoped for -- themes he would also 
stress in his speech mostly in Creole a few hours later to a chanting, swaying 
crowd in Port-au-Prince. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am hopeful we will succeed through reconciliation, peace, respect for every 
single citizen," Aristide said. "Once we can create political stability, once 
we share this peaceful reconciliation, we have the most important key to open 
the door of the economy." 
</P>
<P>
 A few minutes before noon, as Aristide sat chatting with Christopher in the 
airplane's forward cabin, President Clinton's special envoy for Haiti, William 
H. Gray III, looked out the window, saw mountains below and exclaimed: "That's 
Haiti!" 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide, who had not been facing the window, leaped up and leaned over to 
look. Another sweet smile spread across his face, and he shook his head as if 
not quite believing the day was real. 
</P>
<P>
 Just after noon, the plane touched down. Aristide, helped by his aides, bowed 
his head and donned a red and blue presidential sash over his dark 
double-breasted suit. 
</P>
<P>
 He paused at the door of the plane, squared his shoulders and walked out into 
the warm, almost-muggy air of Port-au-Prince. As American troops of the 10th 
Mountain Division stood guard, a Haitian military band struck up "Ruffles and 
Flourishes" and the Haitian national anthem. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide grinned again, waved and marched down the stairs. One minute before, 
he had been a guest of the United States government. Now he was again president 
of Haiti.

GULF WAR THREAT EASES; PENTAGON REMAINS WARY

<P>
 The threat of war in the Persian Gulf seemed to recede Saturday, with Iraq's 
last Republican Guard division apparently preparing to leave southern Iraq and 
Defense Secretary William J. Perry telling American troops here that they 
"saved the United States, saved the world from war." 
</P>
<P>
 The elite Iraqi troops, who raised new fears by stopping and redeploying 100 
miles from the border three days ago, were now ready to comply with American 
demands that they depart, Perry said. And Iraq's information minister said "the 
time has come to transfer those troops" to their former positions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The encampment they're making right now, according to our intelligence, looks 
like a temporary encampment rather than digging in," Perry told Army troops 
stationed here. "It looks like they're simply waiting for the transportation 
they need to take them north." 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, the Pentagon was more cautious in its assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have any indication that they are digging in, but we also don't have 
any indication that they are preparing to leave, so it's still a big question 
mark at this point," one senior Pentagon official said. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton noted in his weekly radio address to the nation Saturday 
that a "significant" number of Iraqi troops were still "within striking 
distance of Kuwait." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a day of decision for America and the world," Clinton later told a 
political rally in Bridgeport, Conn. "We will stay there until we are sure the 
threat is gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Perry's threat Friday to use military force if the troops did not leave 
southern Iraq, and signs of possible diplomatic solutions to the crisis Baghdad 
had sparked, appeared to have prompted Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to resume 
the withdrawal, analysts here said. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats in the Gulf also saw the sharp increase Saturday in anti-American 
rhetoric from Baghdad as a sign that Iraq wanted to put the best face on its 
decision to end the military buildup on the Kuwaiti border. 
</P>
<P>
 Iraqi Information Minister Hamid Youssef Hammadi described Washington's anger 
over the halted retreat of one division as "a tempest . . . stirred by the 
Americans." And the Iraqi government newspaper, Al Jumhuriyah, portrayed the 
crisis as a defeat for the American President. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened has completely cornered Clinton," the newspaper said. And it 
likened Clinton to "the veteran criminal George Bush," who as President during 
the 1991 Persian Gulf War was the target of similar personal attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The paper, in a reference to scandals in the Clinton presidency, said the Gulf 
crisis had "exposed" Clinton's "weakness, indecisiveness, infidelity and 
crooked financial practices." 
</P>
<P>
 Late Saturday, the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution condemning Iraq's 
military movements and demanding the immediate withdrawal of Revolutionary 
Guard units to their original positions. The resolution also bars Baghdad from 
using its forces in a hostile or provocative manner to threaten either its 
neighbors or U.N. operations in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 Madeleine Albright, the United States' ambassador to the United Nations, 
issued an implied threat of force against Iraq if it failed to abide by the 
resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me assure this council that . . . my government will take all appropriate 
action if Iraq fails to comply with the demands of this resolution," Albright 
said after its unanimous adoption. 
</P>
<P>
 An Iraqi Information Ministry official condemned the resolution Saturday. 
Writing in a Baghdad newspaper, Nouri Marsoumi said the United States "may have 
thought that Iraq is an American state and (that) the last thing left for it is 
to ask for a seat in the operations room of the Iraqi army." 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations will also be asked in coming days to consider a peace plan 
drawn up by Hussein and Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev in meetings 
last week in Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
 Kozyrev, who met Kuwait's leaders Saturday and planned to head to New York 
today, told reporters here that he is still confident of winning support for 
the plan despite strong opposition from the United States and Britain and a 
lukewarm response from Kuwaiti leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, which would secure formal Iraqi recognition of Kuwait in 
exchange for Moscow's help in lifting U.N. sanctions that have crippled 
Hussein's regime, "does not mean any reward for (Iraq) in this crisis," Kozyrev 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he added, the United Nations should lift the sanctions if Iraq recognizes 
Kuwait's disputed border and allows U.N. officials to monitor Iraq's military 
financing, among other U.N. conditions. Kozyrev's argument was bolstered by 
U.N. weapons inspectors who said Saturday that the Iraqis were cooperating in 
the task of dismantling weapons of mass destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 All signs Saturday were that the immediate crisis in the oil-rich Gulf had 
passed. Half of the estimated 80,000 Iraqi troops that massed on the border 
with Kuwait a week ago had already moved north of the "no-fly" zone, Perry 
said. The United States had threatened to deploy more troops and even use force 
if Iraq did not pull its tanks and soldiers out of that zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe we have been successful in deterring the war with Iraq," Perry told 
Army troops at Kuwait's airport before leaving for a three-day visit to China. 
Nevertheless, the defense secretary said the current American deployment will 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the lessons we've learned from all this is preparedness works and is 
the key to responding rapidly to ground forces in an emergency," Perry said. 
</P>
<P>
 American officials say about 3,300 troops are on the ground in Kuwait, with a 
2,000-member Marine Expeditionary Force off the coast.  
</P>
<P>
 Sen. John W. Warner (R-Va.) traveling with Perry, said Kuwaiti officials had 
given their personal assurance "that this nation together with all other Gulf 
nations . . . will help to defray very substantially the cost of this 
operation." 
</P>
<P>
 In pep talks to troops on two of the 19 warships in the Persian Gulf, Perry 
lauded the U.S. military as an effective deterrent to rambunctious dictators, 
and he vowed that U.S. forces will remain at "high readiness" until all Iraqi 
troops retreat. 
</P>
<P>
 But he added: "The good news is . . . you'll probably be able to go back home 
on your regular deployment time. That's back in California before Christmas."

NEWS ANALYSIS; RACE OFTEN PLAYS REAL BUT UNSPOKEN ROLE IN POLITICS; CAMPAIGNS: 
CANDIDATES SHUN OVERT APPEALS TO PREJUDICE, BUT SOCIAL SCIENTISTS SAY IT 
UNDERLIES MANY ISSUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 No one talks about it. But beneath a landscape dominated by crime, immigration 
and welfare reform, politics in California this year is riven by a silent fault 
line. Race. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the candidates overtly appeal to prejudice. Everyone denies even 
suggesting racial themes. But social scientists believe the undercurrent is 
implicitly there, looming large from the anti-illegal immigrant Proposition 187 
to the emphasis on crime that has recently dominated the governor's contest. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the candidates intend to or not -- and many political scientists 
firmly believe they do -- they are playing on a field strewn with racial land 
mines when they engage in the abbreviated, slogan-heavy discussions of these 
issues that dominate political discourse, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Racially implicit advertisements, including some that have marked California 
campaigns, can strike a nerve of prejudice even among well-meaning voters who 
pride themselves on an absence of bias, according to recent studies. That 
tendency is all the more pronounced under the conditions present in California, 
where an overwhelmingly white electorate finds itself increasingly convulsed by 
economic and social worries. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they say welfare, the white voter thinks of blacks, in spite of the fact 
that the majority of welfare recipients are white," said Joe Feagin, a 
University of Florida sociologist who specializes in race and politics. "When 
white voters hear about crime in the streets, most think blacks and Latinos 
despite the fact that most crimes are done by whites. 
</P>
<P>
 "Politicians play off of that. . . . They make very good use of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, candidates deny any such intent. 
</P>
<P>
 "The premise is crap," said Larry Thomas, a senior adviser to Gov. Pete 
Wilson's reelection campaign. Wilson came under fire this year for a commercial 
that pictured immigrants massed at the California-Mexico border as an announcer 
intoned, "They keep coming." 
</P>
<P>
 "The principal issues," Thomas added, "are of concern to people of all races 
in this state. Whether it's crime, illegal immigration, jobs -- the fact is 
that our campaign has communicated about each subject to everyone regardless of 
their race or age or makeup." 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Brown's gubernatorial campaign has gone out of its way to be 
sensitive, senior aide Steven M. Glazer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Glazer said that when the campaign was seeking a case to symbolize its claim 
that the Wilson Administration has mismanaged the state's parole system, it 
deliberately picked a white convict who had committed crimes while on parole. 
To do otherwise would have perpetuated a stereotype about minority criminals, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite these denials, political scientists who have watched the campaigns for 
governor, U.S. Senate and various propositions in California this year say that 
the appeals in them are typical of a new, indirect way that race affects 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
 In most cases, ethnicity is not directly raised in advertising, which is the 
main tool of political communication in California. 
</P>
<P>
 But those who study the collision of politics and race relations say that when 
Wilson and Sen. Dianne Feinstein pledge to curb illegal immigration, or when 
Brown and Feinstein challenger Rep. Mike Huffington vow to cut welfare, voters 
can receive signals about the candidates' perceived views on minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Bobo, a UCLA professor of sociology and director of the Center for 
Research on Race, Politics and Society, said that crime, immigration and 
welfare reform all "have a strong racial subtext." 
</P>
<P>
 "In many ways the discussions that we might see on the news and in political 
speeches sound rational and dispassionate, based on information," he said. 
"What underlies that is not so neutral and clean and antiseptic. There's 
basically, unfortunately, a large element of . . . negative stereotyping that 
underlies the potency of some of these issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates argue that the issues are legitimately part of this year's 
political campaigns because they are in the forefront of voters' minds and they 
have financial repercussions for the battered California economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Social scientists acknowledge that candidates do have to discuss issues of 
importance to voters. And they agree that it is possible to be, say, against 
welfare without being racially biased. But they argue that many people express 
biases with their positions on the issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "People can oppose these policies without being racist," said Frank Gilliam, 
associate professor of political science at UCLA. "The question is, how tight 
is the correlation between people's underlying negative (beliefs about) groups 
and their opposition to policies. There's some suspicion that the correlation 
is high." 
</P>
<P>
 Even those who are critical of candidates for their treatment of racially 
sensitive issues acknowledge that the candidates and the voters are in 
something of a box on the subject. To discuss sensitive issues while 
simultaneously shooting down stereotypes would take a far deeper discussion of 
social problems than exists in most campaigns, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult to have a nuanced discussion in a 30-second commercial," said 
Melvin L. Oliver, director of the UCLA Center for the Study of Urban Poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 The countering arguments can be seen in the immigration issue. Wilson argues 
that illegal immigration is an important issue because cash-strapped California 
is footing a multibillion-dollar bill for such immigrants, a cost that he says 
should be borne by the federal government. The governor says that is the sole 
reason he has discussed it, and vehemently denies even indirectly raising 
issues of ethnicity. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it also is true that it has been in Wilson's political interest to rally 
the largely white electorate -- 83% white in the June primary -- to his side. 
One way to do it, Bobo said, is to play on fears stirred by changing social 
conditions, such as the growing prominence of minorities in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "If one were to take the cynical view for the moment: Say you've got a 
moderate to conservative governor who's found him- or herself in the first term 
raising taxes and forever infuriating the far right element to his or her 
constituency," Bobo said, drawing an undeniable portrait of Wilson. "I don't 
think you could have found a better issue than immigration to (solidify) a 
right-wing base and (touch) an issue that is making some in the middle of the 
road or Democrats increasingly uncomfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 Racially implicit appeals are certainly not new to politics. Among the more 
celebrated in recent years was then-Vice President George Bush's use of the 
Willie Horton case against Democrat Michael S. Dukakis in 1988. Horton, a 
convicted killer, was released from a Massachusetts prison on a furlough, 
during which he raped a woman and assaulted her husband. The Bush campaign used 
the case to underscore its contention that Dukakis, the state's governor, was 
soft on crime -- a view that Dukakis was never able to dispel. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way the Willie Horton ad worked was not because of explicit appeals," 
said Michael Dawson, associate professor of political science at the University 
of Chicago. "It was that it appealed to stereotypes of black male rapists that 
have been around since the Civil War." 
</P>
<P>
 Another infamous campaign advertisement was run by North Carolina Sen. Jesse 
Helms in his 1990 race against Harvey Gantt, a black former mayor of Charlotte. 
What became known as the "hands" ad featured a pair of white hands crumbling a 
job application while the announcer laments that the job went to a minority 
because of a "racial quota." 
</P>
<P>
 Both ads had one intention, according to Dawson: "To mobilize white voters." 
</P>
<P>
 Arguments like these have the veneer of discussing an issue rather than 
impugning a specific race. The distinction, Dawson says, could be seen in the 
extreme in the 1991 candidacy of David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klansman, for 
governor of Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
 "David Duke became a viable candidate when he talked about welfare and crime, 
as opposed to when he was wearing the white sheet," Dawson said. "It was the 
same David Duke, and a different way of characterizing the issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Recent studies by Tali Mendelberg, a Princeton University political scientist, 
suggest that indirect racial appeals are more powerful that overt ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendelberg conducted two studies. In the first, she showed participants news 
footage that included part of the Willie Horton ad. She sought to determine 
whether the ad sent a message, as the Bush campaign contended, only about 
crime. Interviews with participants showed that it decidedly did not. Rather 
than hardening the participants' views about crime, the ad played to racial 
resentments, Mendelberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 The participants "decided they really didn't want more spending to aid 
blacks," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second study, Mendelberg created newscasts featuring make-believe 
candidates talking about welfare. Some of the white participants saw 
accompanying pictures of white welfare recipients; the others saw black 
recipients. The results seconded her earlier findings.  
</P>
<P>
 The studies also reinforced the widespread belief among scholars that indirect 
racial appeals work better than direct ones: When the "candidates" featured in 
the welfare study made a point of talking about black welfare recipients, the 
study participants realized that the intent was racial and the appeal "did not 
work the same way at all," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Mendelberg's welfare study also suggested that voters are not necessarily 
aware that a racial appeal has worked on them. When she asked study 
participants whose racial concerns had been affected by the welfare footage 
whether they thought it was a racial appeal, "almost everyone said no." 
</P>
<P>
 According to some political scientists, even the best-intentioned candidate 
can pluck a racial chord that runs deep within people. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of white voters are ambivalent about issues dealing with race," 
Mendelberg said. "On the one hand, they are committed to some extent to the 
idea of racial equality. On the other hand, they are scared about crime, which 
they see as black crime, and concerned about the burden that welfare has placed 
on them or in the case of California about the consequences of illegal 
immigration." 
</P>
<P>
 The University of Florida's Feagin is among those who believe that stereotypes 
rise faster in uncertain times -- such as those facing California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Growing up as white people in this country we develop a shelf in our heads, a 
cultural shelf of racial and ethnic images and stereotypes," he said. "In 
troubled times, we start searching for cultural explanations, no matter how 
prejudiced they are, that we can trot out to explain things when we don't know 
any better." 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the stereotypes. According to Feagin, whites generally assume that 60% 
to 80% of violent crimes in which whites are victimized are committed by 
blacks. The truth, according to federal statistics, is that 80% of crimes are 
black-on-black or white-on-white. Although fear of crime is rising 
exponentially, crime is statistically dropping -- down 7.7% in the first half 
of 1994, according to the state attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics also belie the widespread belief that blacks and Latinos dominate 
the ranks of welfare recipients. For the last period available, the 1990 
census, most recipients of public assistance in California were white. Blacks 
made up 15.9% of recipients of all forms of public assistance, while Latinos 
accounted for 23.1% and whites composed 47%. 
</P>
<P>
 A higher proportion of blacks were dependent, with 9.1% of them receiving aid. 
But Latinos were no more prone to take aid than whites, with slightly more than 
3% of each group receiving benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigration statistics show that although Latinos form the majority of illegal 
immigrants, only half come from Mexico. A study by the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service in 1992 determined that of 1.4 million illegal 
immigrants who traveled to California, 786,000 were from Mexico. Another 
205,000 were from El Salvador and the rest were spread among other nations, 
including 24,000 from Canada and 60,000 from the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
 Repeated studies by sociologists have concluded that many whites still hold 
negative stereotypes about ethnic minorities. Regularly, nearly 60% of whites 
rate blacks as less intelligent than them, Bobo and others said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when the subject matter is seemingly race-neutral, such as when 
candidates argue who is the best manager or will stick up more for the middle 
class, ethnicity can enter into the picture in subtle ways. Although he has 
aired advertisements that some observers criticized as insensitive, Wilson also 
took pains this summer to run commercials that showed him seated at a round 
table of people from various races. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, the representative of a party that has traditionally appealed to 
minorities but is now struggling to attract white voters, at the same time 
aired an appeal to middle-class families that was notable for the utter absence 
of ethnic faces. When the ad was later targeted to Latinos, the film footage 
was re-shot to include Latino families. 
</P>
<P>
 The messages, according to political analysts? While hammering a conservative 
theme of toughness on immigration and crime, Wilson wants to be seen with 
minorities to persuade moderates that he is sensitive to all racial groups. And 
while Brown is seeking support from minorities, she is still trying to persuade 
moderate whites that she is not captive to traditional liberal interests -- 
hence the white faces and her tough talk on immigration and crime.CALIFORNIA

THE CROWD REJOICES, 'WE'VE BEEN DELIVERED'; HAITI: EUPHORIA IS THE ORDER OF THE 
DAY, AS ARISTIDE FOLLOWERS SEE HIS RETURN AS A RESURRECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 His face plastered against the green metal fence that surrounds the 
Presidential Palace, Colbert Dejeus strained to get a better view of the man he 
fully regards as the Savior. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Army Blackhawk helicopter hovered momentarily above the white-domed 
palace, then landed on the lawn and deposited Jean-Bertrand Aristide in the 
distance. White doves and blue and red balloons filled the sunny sky as tens of 
thousands of Haitians screamed in joyous wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am so happy I could cry," Dejeus said. "We are delivered from evil. Now we 
are free! We have been delivered!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Our Father has returned!" cried Esaie Joseph, 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday was a day Haitians had long awaited and a day few thought would ever 
really come. For Haiti's poor and hopeless masses and for many victims of the 
past three years of murderous military intimidation, Aristide has come to 
represent something larger than life. Despite the fear and dread he inspires 
among the elite, Aristide, a suspended priest, inspires a nearly biblical 
admiration among the desperate who invest in him their endless expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, what a beautiful day," Aristide said from a heavily guarded podium 
flanked by several hundred Haitian and foreign dignitaries. "Today . . . we are 
celebrating a day of deliverance, deliverance without vengeance. For three 
years we have waited. . . . Isn't this return bringing new reconciliation? 
Isn't it bringing new hope? Hope helps you to live." 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Fleursint, unemployed and crippled, rolled his wheelchair nearly three 
miles from his ramshackle home to the Champs de Mars park area in front of the 
palace, where he spent Friday night sleeping on the grass and awaiting 
Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see the way the country is starting to change, and I want that to 
continue," said Fleursint, who was not sure of his age but appeared to be in 
his mid-20s. "The country will change so that everybody can find work and food. 
There should be peace. Aristide will bring peace." 
</P>
<P>
 In the capital and in towns all over Haiti, people were celebrating as the 
U.S. military kept careful watch. Haitians were encouraged to remain in their 
neighborhoods rather than flood downtown Port-au-Prince for Aristide's arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 In revelry that started Friday, lasted all day Saturday and well into the 
early morning hours today, Haitians paraded, sang and danced through streets 
festooned with streamers and thousands of pictures of the slight, bespectacled 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 "Welcome, TiTid," proclaimed signs written in Creole and using Aristide's 
nickname. Light poles and trees were painted in the national colors of red and 
blue -- colors that were restored after the fall of the Duvalier dictatorship 
in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 In Cite Soleil, the sprawling slum on the edge of the capital which suffered 
the brunt of military repression, residents erected shrines in honor of 
Aristide. They emptied their homes of pots and pans and velvet paintings and 
placed them as humble offerings to the man who would bring jobs, food and 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know who he is anymore," resident Serge Damas said in reverent tones. 
"He is more than just a president. He is more than a mere human." 
</P>
<P>
 "He is God's son, without question!" chimed in Denise Vendretti. "God sent him 
away on a divine mission. Now he has returned to make our nation whole." 
</P>
<P>
 Back at the palace, ordinary Haitians watched Aristide's arrival from a 
distance of about 100 yards and then could barely see him from behind the 
three-sided bulletproof glass where he sat and then spoke. 
</P>
<P>
 The president's safety was a primary concern for the U.S. military that 
occupied this country last month and helped eject the leaders of Haiti's 
dictatorship. The helicopter arrival on the palace lawn was deemed safer than a 
motorcade. He was surrounded by security agents from the moment he stepped from 
the chopper to the lawn, and 20 guards stood around him as he delivered a 
lyrical speech in four languages -- Creole, French, English and Spanish. Guards 
were placed on the stairs to block any effort to rush the podium. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would have liked to see him closer, but there will be time," said Jean 
Chavanes, 21, one of scores of people who pressed against the palace gates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, we were sleeping with our eyes open, and now we can close our eyes," 
said Eduis Bathold, 29, standing behind U.S. Army barbed wire. "Before, we were 
starved. And now we feel fed." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the gates, celebrants surged through the streets and past the army 
headquarters from which military strongman Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras ruled until 
Monday. They waved tree branches and hoisted live roosters in the air, both 
symbols of Lavalas, the grass-roots movement that took Aristide to power in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today is the day when the sun of democracy has risen and will never set," 
Aristide said. "Today, the eyes of justice are open and will never close. 
Today, security will be set morning, noon and night." 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the many incongruous sights that have become common in occupied 
Haiti, the Haitian army band pushed through the crowd, escorted by U.S. Army 
10th Mountain Rangers and playing American military marches.  
</P>
<P>
 Nine Haitian policemen, all clad in blue uniforms and two wearing military 
helmets, marched periodically before the crowd but within the safe confines of 
the palace fence. Each time, the crowds hissed, booed and taunted the men. 
</P>
<P>
 "I entered the armed forces just to help my parents and family and to defend 
the country," said Paul Frisnel Bonnet, one of the policemen and a lonely man 
on Saturday. "I have two children, and my wife is pregnant. If I leave the 
police, I do not know what I would do. Haiti needs change. Prices are very 
high. Maybe (Aristide's) return will improve things." 
</P>
<P>
 To keep the crowds under control, the American military's psychological 
operations section was working overtime. Armored vehicles with loudspeakers 
passed through the crowd regularly, broadcasting Creole messages in soothing 
tones. "Democracy without violence." "The president is returning."  
</P>
<P>
 The Haitians who filled the streets Saturday spoke of an almost impossible 
hope that their returned president would stop the violence in a country where 
thousands have been killed in the past three years, and he would give jobs to a 
country where more than 85% of the population is unemployed. He would make life 
easier and better in the poorest, sickest country in the Western Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bad guys came to our houses and killed our parents and raped our people," 
said Dejeus. "We have been suffering so much. Now we have started to be free." 
</P>
<P>
 "I had goose bumps all over my body seeing Aristide in the national palace," 
said George Wilbert, 22, who was partying with thousands of Haitians in the 
downtown Heroes of Independence Plaza, long after Saturday's ceremony had 
concluded. "I was praying for nothing to happen to him, and I was a little bit 
afraid." 
</P>
<P>
 More than concrete plans or announcements, it was Aristide's presence that 
unleashed the euphoria of Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where are you, youth of Haiti?" Aristide called out. "Haitian people, where 
are you? . . . Where are the valiant men? Where are the strong women?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Here!" the crowd responded.

MODERATE DEMOCRATS FACING HEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As chairman of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council once headed by Bill 
Clinton, Rep. Dave McCurdy of Oklahoma has long clamored for a "New Democrat" 
agenda distinct from traditional liberalism. 
</P>
<P>
 As a candidate for a Senate seat this fall, McCurdy still emphasizes some 
signature New Democrat ideas, such as personal responsibility, skill-training 
and welfare reform. But in his closely fought contest against conservative 
Republican Rep. James M. Inhofe, McCurdy almost never describes himself as a 
New Democrat anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Clinton has undermined the standing of that label," McCurdy said 
between campaign stops here on Friday. "It is just too Clinton." 
</P>
<P>
 For Democrats everywhere, association with President Clinton is proving 
hazardous this fall. But it is proving most hazardous for the Democrats who 
invested the most in his election -- the moderates from conservative regions 
who saw Clinton's centrist 1992 campaign message of fiscal discipline, 
middle-class priorities and personal responsibility as deliverance from a 
left-leaning national party agenda that is anathema in their states. 
</P>
<P>
 "The conservative Democrats, who were such a powerful force in nominating 
Clinton, are going to get punished more than the liberal Democrats because it 
is the conservatives' constituents who are most disenchanted with him," said 
Tom Cole, a Republican pollster in Oklahoma City. "Those Democrats have the 
worst of all possible worlds: They have to say either 'I was dumb and got taken 
by this guy' or 'I agree with what he has done.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in a bitter irony, the President's unpopularity has created an 
electoral climate that could deplete the centrist party reform movement that 
once looked to him as its leader. With the election a little more than three 
weeks away, Democratic strategists are facing the prospect that November's 
voting could leave the party not only severely weakened in Congress but also 
considerably more liberal at a time when voters are resisting traditional 
liberal ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 Though some prominent liberals are threatened this fall, such as Sen. Edward 
M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, the heaviest losses appear likely among Democratic 
moderates in Southern, Midwestern and Western states where Clinton is now 
widely perceived as a "big government" liberal who disguised his true colors in 
the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 That possibility is especially acute in the House of Representatives, where 
moderates in swing districts are more endangered than liberal members, who are 
largely ensconced in overwhelmingly Democratic districts. But dissatisfaction 
with Clinton is also fueling conservative Republican challenges to prototypal 
"New Democrats" in gubernatorial and Senate races in such states as Oklahoma, 
Wyoming, Virginia and Georgia.  
</P>
<P>
 In Georgia, Democratic Gov. Zell Miller, whose staunch support was critical to 
Clinton's 1992 victory, is still leading, but facing an unexpectedly vigorous 
challenge from Republican Guy Millner -- whose television ads show Miller's 
speech nominating Clinton at the 1992 Democratic Convention. 
</P>
<P>
 In Virginia, Democratic Sen. Charles S. Robb, a Clinton predecessor as 
chairman of the Democratic Leadership Council, is locked in a dead heat with 
Republican Oliver L. North -- whose ads describe Robb as "a liberal who votes 
with Bill Clinton 95% of the time." In the Wyoming Senate race, Republican Rep. 
Craig Thomas is holding a steady lead over conservative Democratic Gov. Mike 
Sullivan -- whose friendship with and early endorsement of Clinton has been 
perhaps the campaign's central issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the South, Republicans are threatening to pick up congressional 
seats from moderate and conservative Democrats in districts where Clinton's 
approval ratings have collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 "In every congressional race where we are competitive, he is in the tank from 
a reelection standpoint," said Florida GOP Chairman Tom Slade, who predicts the 
party could gain as many as five House seats in the state next month. 
</P>
<P>
 In Oklahoma, Clinton looms over the contest between McCurdy, an ambitious and 
telegenic 44-year-old, and Inhofe, a resolutely conservative 59-year-old former 
Tulsa mayor more diligent than dynamic. The two men are vying to replace 
Democratic Sen. David L. Boren, who spent much of the past two years as a thorn 
in Clinton's side before unexpectedly resigning to become president of the 
University of Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent private polls in both parties have shown McCurdy with a narrow 
yet steady lead over Inhofe. "McCurdy raised a bunch of dollars, got on the air 
early, solidified his lead, and we have to chip away at it," said Ed Goeas, 
Inhofe's pollster. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the state has turned so thoroughly against Clinton that the race 
remains very much in doubt. "In a normal year, it wouldn't be a race," McCurdy 
insisted. "It just isn't a normal year; what you fear is a wave." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the depth of antagonism here toward Clinton's agenda and character is 
breathtaking. Clinton attracted only 34% of the vote here in 1992 in losing the 
state to George Bush -- and he's given ground even from that modest beachhead. 
In Cole's last survey, just 30% approved of Clinton's job performance, while 
62% disapproved -- 47% of them strongly. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent day spent campaigning with Inhofe around Oklahoma City, it was 
almost impossible to find a good word for Clinton. "Being Oklahomans, we're 
kind of just folks, hunters and all that, and he hasn't done anything that we 
like," said Paul Tyler, an Oklahoma City banker visiting a home building show. 
</P>
<P>
 Though many issues are swirling through the campaign, Clinton's unpopularity 
frames the central dynamic here. McCurdy is trying to present himself as an 
independent conservative "in the David Boren tradition" as his ads put it; 
Inhofe is trying to paint his opponent as a Washington liberal who has lost 
touch with the state.  
</P>
<P>
 In that effort, Inhofe's most compelling piece of evidence is McCurdy's ties 
to Clinton. Outside a National Guard air base in Oklahoma City on Friday 
afternoon, Inhofe lashed McCurdy for supporting the defense budget cuts in 
Clinton's 1993 budget. Later, in a visit to two newspapers and a radio station 
in the town of Shawnee, Inhofe told reporters that McCurdy voted with Clinton 
90% of the time in 1993 -- and singled out for criticism his support of the 
crime bill, the assault-weapons ban, the 1993 budget and Clinton's efforts to 
allow gays in the military. At one point, he referred to his opponent as 
"McClinton." 
</P>
<P>
 If anything, Inhofe draws the noose even tighter in his television 
commercials. A new ad that began running last Tuesday features convicts dancing 
in tutus to ridicule McCurdy's vote for "Clinton's (crime) bill." Another new 
ad features Oklahomans questioning McCurdy's ties to the President: "He 
basically is a rubber stamp for Bill Clinton," one says. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, McCurdy's relationship with the 48-year-old President has always been 
more complex -- almost like a brotherly rivalry. In 1991, McCurdy briefly 
considered his own presidential bid -- partly because he considered Clinton a 
flawed vessel for the New Democrat message. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, though, he campaigned for Clinton and delivered a seconding speech for 
him at the Democratic Convention -- which has turned up in ads the National 
Rifle Assn. is now running against McCurdy in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the election, the relationship has been equally tumultuous. Though 
McCurdy has supported Clinton on most votes, he has also registered pointed 
dissents on health care, foreign policy and the balanced-budget amendment; he 
points out that even his support for the 1993 budget resolution was conditioned 
on Clinton's agreement to remove in the Senate the BTU energy tax that is 
bitterly opposed here. On gays in the military, he says, he supported the 
"don't ask, don't tell" compromise backed by Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) and 
ultimately by Inhofe himself. 
</P>
<P>
 In a series of campaign events around Tulsa on Friday, McCurdy defended some 
centrist Administration initiatives: the family leave law, youth apprenticeship 
and national service programs and the provisions of the crime bill that 
provided funds for programs aimed at reducing violence against women and hiring 
more police. 
</P>
<P>
 But more often he expressed disappointment with Clinton and tried to shift the 
lens away from Washington. His strategy for survival -- echoing the approaches 
of Democrats from Kennedy to Dianne Feinstein in California -- has two prongs: 
stressing his service to the state and raising ethical doubts about his 
opponent.  
</P>
<P>
 McCurdy portrays himself as best positioned to defend state interests like the 
giant Tinker Air Force Base, which could be threatened by further Pentagon base 
closings. And in his television ads, he rakes Inhofe concerning a federal 
election law violation and for declaring for years that he was graduated from 
the University of Tulsa in 1959, when in fact he did not complete all the 
requirements until 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 Inhofe protests that McCurdy's ads don't make clear the election law violation 
occurred eight years ago, during his first campaign for Congress. And he says 
he reported he was graduated from college because he was permitted to go 
through the graduation ceremonies even though he still had to complete one 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts on both sides generally consider McCurdy a more supple and engaging 
politician than Inhofe. Somewhat stiff in manner, Inhofe has won election to 
Congress four times, as well as earlier races for the Statehouse and City Hall 
in Tulsa, but he has also suffered three electoral defeats, including a 
crushing loss to Boren in the 1974 gubernatorial race. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, Inhofe last week campaigned with the confidence of a man with the wind at 
his back. Like Republicans such as North and Millner, Inhofe is running an 
unabashedly ideological campaign: At every stop, for instance, he highlights 
his support from conservative groups such as the Christian Coalition ("I've 
always been 100%" with them, he told one reporter in Shawnee). "(McCurdy) calls 
me a conservative and I call him a liberal," Inhofe said. "But I admit it and 
he doesn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Like many other Democrats in conservative-leaning states this year, McCurdy is 
stressing the time-honored formula of moderation and bipartisanship: His latest 
campaign handout touts his support for Ronald Reagan "in his drive to rebuild 
our military forces, and (for) George Bush in Desert Storm." And he accuses 
Inhofe of being excessively partisan, voting with the GOP leadership more 
frequently than McCurdy voted with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 In ordinary times, that appeal to the center has allowed talented moderate 
Democrats like Boren and McCurdy to survive in states increasingly Republican 
in their fundamental outlook. But as McCurdy observed, these are not ordinary 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 For McCurdy -- like the other embattled centrists who once enlisted behind 
Clinton's New Democrat banner -- there remains the nightmare possibility that 
the voters will push past their promises of bipartisanship to send their own 
explicitly partisan message of disappointment over the President's course.

COLUMN ONE; CALIFORNIA'S PROFUSION OF PRISONS; IN THE PAST DECADE, 16 HIGH-TECH 
FACILITIES HAVE BEEN ADDED AT COSTS FAR ABOVE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. 'THREE 
STRIKES' WILL FURTHER FUEL A GROWTH INDUSTRY THAT OPERATES WITH LITTLE 
OVERSIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By DAN MORAIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With minimal outside oversight, California has spawned a multibillion-dollar 
prison construction industry that extends from Wall Street money managers to 
hard hats who build the bastilles of concrete, steel and razor wire. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry is expected to grow on an even grander scale as tens of thousands 
of felons are sentenced to prison under the state's new "three strikes" law. 
</P>
<P>
 "We call it our Pentagon around here," said Sen. Robert Presley (D-Riverside), 
who has sponsored many prison construction bills. "We say that because it costs 
so much. It's like the military." 
</P>
<P>
 During the past decade, the Department of Corrections, carrying out the 
tough-on-crime policies of the past two governors, has added 40,524 prison 
cells and dormitory beds by building 16 prisons and renovating old ones. 
</P>
<P>
 The department has spent $5 billion on planning, engineering and construction 
of new prisons, and created a bond debt that will double that amount to $10 
billion with interest payments. 
</P>
<P>
 That money has bought the nation's biggest, most expensive prisons. Each 
houses 4,000 inmates and costs $200 million or more to build. Each has 8 1/2 
miles of razor wire, an arsenal of 337 guns, and a $2-million computerized 
alarm system. 
</P>
<P>
 With high-tech security, a guard can scan a console in a control booth and 
unlock 200 cell doors by pushing a button. Prisons also have amenities such as 
$550 milkshake makers for staff and $850 electric pottery wheels for inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 While the defense industry shrinks in California, officials and contractors 
who design and build prisons are readying themselves for a new and more costly 
boom necessitated by the "three strikes" law signed by Gov. Pete Wilson in 
March. On Nov. 8, the electorate will vote on an initiative duplicating the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Under "three strikes," terms for many second-time felons will double. Many 
three-time losers will be sentenced to 25 years to life. Time off for good 
behavior will be slashed. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, state corrections officials estimate that the population behind 
bars will surpass 230,000 by the turn of the century -- about 100,000 more than 
today's total -- and 25 new prisons will be needed, including one for women. 
That would give California 58 prisons, plus several minimum security work 
camps. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Legislature can fund them, we can build them," said Craig Brown, 
undersecretary of the Youth and Adult Correctional Agency, in charge of the 
prison system. "We have been at it a long time. We're damned good at it." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown knows that it's a big if. This summer, the Legislature turned down 
Wilson's request to place on the November ballot a $2-billion prison 
construction bond for six prisons as a first installment on "three strikes." 
</P>
<P>
 To examine the current prison construction program and trace its roots, The 
Times reviewed thousands of pages of documents and interviewed dozens of 
officials, contractors and critics. 
</P>
<P>
 Records show that the Corrections Department consistently has put up prisons 
in four years, from the time planning begins until the cell doors lock. And the 
prisons generally have been built within budget, with overruns averaging 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 But The Times also found: 
</P>
<P>
 * California's prison construction budget is the biggest in the nation, partly 
because the state builds prisons almost exclusively to house the highest risk 
inmates, rather than erect lower security institutions, such as work camps. "We 
can shave costs today, and we'll pay for it later -- either in staff costs 
immediately, or in maintenance," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Legislators, auditors and budget analysts acknowledge that they have 
provided limited oversight of the construction program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, the Administration is able to do whatever it wants," said Gerald 
Beavers of the legislative analyst's office, which no longer has the staff to 
scrutinize prison construction. "There are no controls." 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature's Joint Committee on Prison Construction and Operations once 
had four staff members, but now has one part-time aide. The committee has met 
only once this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The chairman, Presley, is leaving office to run for the State Board of 
Equalization. Although he believes the construction program is efficient, 
Presley fears that with the boom coming, no one will take over his role. "They 
need oversight, something that big," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Corrections Department Director James Gomez insists that his actions are 
watched closely. Although legislators often call him to testify on policy 
issues, he could not recall when he last testified about construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time we have a freeway mile, do we have a hearing?" Gomez asked. "We 
had a tremendous number of hearings in the 1980s. Now there is a comfort level 
among the members of the Legislature that we are doing a good job." 
</P>
<P>
 * The new prisons have had numerous construction or equipment-related 
problems. Kitchen floors have had to be torn out and replaced. Sophisticated 
alarm systems have needed replacement. All 2,200 cells doors in one prison were 
replaced for $8 million because inmates could kick them open. Officials say 
such problems are to be expected in such a large undertaking. 
</P>
<P>
 * Long after prison construction is finished, the costs keep rising as the 
state pays off the debt. California's $5 billion prisons debt is paid down 
annually from the state's $38-billion general fund. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1982, when California embarked on the prison building program, the state 
paid $218 million in debt service on bonds used for all state projects, from 
university construction to purchase of state park land. Now, the state pays 
almost twice that sum each year to repay principal and interest on prison bonds 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
 * The construction program is heavy with administrative costs, critics say. 
The Corrections Department's planning and construction division has grown from 
two in 1983 to a staff of 216 with an annual budget of $17 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The main consultant is Kitchell Capital Expenditures Management, which since 
1982 has been paid $73 million to manage the construction program. 
</P>
<P>
 State prison officials insist that the staff is lean. But federal prison 
officials say they are using a planning and construction staff of only 120 to 
oversee the design and construction of two dozen federal prisons. High-security 
federal prisons cost $28,000 per cell less than the $113,000 per cell that 
California spends, according to the private Criminal Justice Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 William Patrick, head of the federal prison building program, said 
California's "high-priced construction management" is one reason the state 
prisons are pricey. "We could not afford the level of management that the state 
of California has, both in-house and outside," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prisons officials who have run the construction program have been courted by 
lobbyists. Prison contractors regularly take corrections officials to lunches 
and dinners, officials declare in annual conflict-of-interest statements. 
</P>
<P>
 Kyle McKinsey, a top corrections official, reported taking a complimentary 
$500 steelhead fishing derby ticket. Glenn Smedley, a Del Norte County 
supervisor, said he helped arrange the trip, which was paid for by a local 
business as a "goodwill" gesture because of McKinsey's work on Pelican Bay 
State Prison. 
</P>
<P>
 * A revolving door swung between prison contractors and state corrections 
officials during the George Deukmejian Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodney Blonien -- who was in charge of prison building as Deukmejian's 
undersecretary of the Youth and Adult Correctional Agency -- is now a prominent 
lobbyist. In 1987, he went to work for a New York-based law firm, which helped 
arrange financing for two prisons while Blonien was undersecretary. 
</P>
<P>
 Blonien later put on a $6,000 golf party for his friends in the Deukmejian 
Administration. In the Wilson years, he has represented prison contractors, 
cities that have or want prisons, and landowners who sold land on which a 
prison sits. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Blonien said:"Corrections is an area of specialized expertise 
that most people don't have. The fact that I supervised that area for three 
years and did well at it established a certain amount of credibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Two other top corrections officials went to work for prison contractors. One 
took a post managing Kitchell's West Coast operations, and since has returned 
to the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez said he warns contractors not to raid his staff. 
</P>
<P>
 * Although individual prison contractors are not major campaign donors, 
politicians who support prison construction receive money from one of the 
biggest beneficiaries -- the California Correctional Peace Officers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 As the prison system has expanded, the guards union has grown by roughly 10% a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The union has become a major source of campaign money. It gave more than 
$900,000 to Wilson in his run for governor in 1990, and $75,000 so far this 
year. After Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara) signed a ballot 
argument against new prison construction and questioned pay for prison 
officers, the union spent $90,000 in 1992 attempting to unseat him. This year, 
the union is the second-largest donor to the "three strikes" initiative, giving 
$101,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Union President Don Novey said his organization donates money "to change the 
system" so career criminals are locked up for life, not to increase the number 
of guards. "There are scumbags out there," Novey said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three strikes" is the latest of roughly 1,100 changes to the Penal Code made 
during the past 15 years lengthening prison terms. In that period the state 
prison population has grown from fewer than 30,000 inmates to more than 
126,000, the majority serving time for drug and property crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The result is an exploding Department of Corrections budget and prison 
construction program that divert resources from other valuable, needed state 
programs," the Little Hoover Commission concluded in a report this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the middle 1970s, there were 12 prisons, and many of the old and 
overcrowded institutions such as San Quentin, Soledad and Folsom were targets 
of civil rights lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, 1982, voters approved a $495-million bond issue to remodel old 
prisons and build new ones. The next year, Deukmejian took over as governor and 
set out to follow through on campaign promises to make streets safe by locking 
up criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 At his urging, lawmakers began passing bills to speed prison construction. 
Perhaps the most important one gave the Legislature authority to approve bond 
sales without voter consent. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters have approved general obligation bonds to build prisons five times 
since 1982 for a total of $2.4 billion. However, since 1984 lawmakers also have 
sold a different type of bond, called a lease revenue bond, without voter 
consent to construct prisons at an ultimate cost of $5.6 billion to taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 California's use of bond financing has made Wall Street a key part of the 
prison industry. Investments houses, bond attorneys and other consultants have 
received more than $35 million from the sale of lease revenue bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Prison construction also is a boon for architectural firms and builders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not many people are building high-rise buildings and hotels anymore," said 
Dave Grubb, president of Swinerton & Walberg, a construction firm in San 
Francisco that routinely bids on prison jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Contractors hungry for work submit bids that often are below the estimated 
cost, making them marginally profitable and lowering the cost to the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Department of Corrections is a very difficult client," said a small 
contractor. "We would not be working for them if we didn't have to. They 
recognize they're the only game in town, and they use it to their advantage." 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, prison construction is a $5-billion-a-year business. It is a niche 
that has attracted large builders, including many that have done major projects 
for the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has allowed us to have a reasonably steady flow of work," said Jim Thomas, 
regional head of CRSS Constructors Inc., which has been construction manager at 
four California prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas' company is part of the Assn. of California Construction Managers, a 
consortium of firms represented by Blonien. CRSS has given $17,000 to 
California campaigns since 1987. "Have we contributed a little money to 
campaigns? Yes," Thomas said. "Is it to get work? No." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With few exceptions, every cellblock, kitchen and exercise yard in every new 
prison looks like the next. Prison officials call it a cookie-cutter design. 
The dough needed for construction is considerable. 
</P>
<P>
 State-by-state comparisons are difficult because of accounting differences. 
But a survey by the private Criminal Justice Institute in New York shows that 
although the national average for a high-security prison cell is $80,000, 
California spends $113,000 per cell. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey also found that California builds its minimum-security cells for 
almost $60,000 each, twice the national average. 
</P>
<P>
 California's heavy use of high-tech equipment, concrete and steel contribute 
to the higher costs, according to Patrick, head of the federal construction 
program. "They have a lot of specialty detention stuff -- locks, grills, 
electronics," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although California has the nation's most expensive construction program, 
Texas claims title for building the most cells. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next year and a half, Texas will construct 80,000 prison beds. The 
cost: $1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Wilson this year called for six new prisons with about 28,000 
beds. The cost: $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 G. Kevin Carruth, head of the California Corrections Department's planning and 
construction division, said the Texas estimates seem low, and he cited reasons 
for steeper costs here: Labor rates are 35% higher; California has costly 
earthquake and environmental codes, and this state taxes construction material 
and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 California spends extra on design work to reduce the need for staffing, 
Carruth said. In new prisons, a single housing unit, populated by 200 felons, 
has no more than three officers, including one who is armed and located in a 
control booth, and two on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you look at construction costs, you have to look for quality, 
durability, and for security and minimal staffing. Sometimes those things cost 
you money," Carruth said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Texas cuts costs by building more low-security housing and making far 
heavier use of inmate labor, California provides comforts not found there. For 
example, California has cafeterias for employees. At Calipatria and Centinela 
prisons in Imperial County, air-conditioning systems were installed for $11 
million. Other new prisons have swamp coolers for cellblocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Some comforts are partly attributable to the influence of California's prison 
guards union, which deploys an officer to the department's planning and 
construction division. "If it wasn't air conditioned, the thing wouldn't last 
60 days," Novey said of the Imperial County prisons, suggesting that more 
officers would transfer out and inmates might riot. 
</P>
<P>
 Others amenities, such as the apartments maintained at each prison for 
conjugal visits, are a valuable way of controlling inmates through the reward 
system, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawmakers often call on the Corrections Department to cut costs. Assemblyman 
Ross Johnson (R-Fullerton) has urged that the state build Spartan barracks, 
patrolled by armed guards with directions to shoot escapees. 
</P>
<P>
 But Carruth called the barracks idea simplistic, and said the state tries to 
hold down costs in other ways. One money-saving idea is lethal electric fences, 
designed to prevent escapes and to reduce the need for guards. 
</P>
<P>
 When the department pitched the concept, officials said 40 prisons and camps 
could be equipped for $10 million, resulting in annual savings of $47 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the governor and Legislature signed off, the department concluded 
that fences should be installed at only 19 prisons. Yet the cost has risen to 
$18 million -- and the estimated savings dropped to $26 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the fences, the department is building air-conditioned guard towers 
at a cost of $1.2 million per prison, although the towers will not normally be 
staffed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Electrified fences are a big experiment," Brown said. "We think it's going to 
work. But it may not work, and more importantly, they have scheduled 
maintenance. They are going to be shut down periodically." 
</P>
<P>
 The fences may end up costing more. They do not distinguish between escapees 
and wildlife. Birds, including some protected burrowing owls, have been 
electrocuted at Calipatria prison. After hiring ornithologists and other 
consultants to study the problem, the Corrections Department is considering 
installing anti-perching devices at a cost of $150,000 per prison. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The budget for maintaining and improving the current stock of prisons runs 
about $55 million annually, including repairs to new prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 One that has had repeated problems is R. J. Donovan, which opened near San 
Diego in 1987. Guards encountered so many problems with electronic panels -- 
which control vital functions such as opening and locking cell doors -- that 
officials are considering replacing them at a cost of more than $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Several electrical fires have occurred in these control panels, sending 
dangerous fumes and smoke into the confined area of a manned control booth," a 
recent memo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carruth said the department tried to save money during Donovan's construction, 
and is paying for the "savings" now in high repair bills. 
</P>
<P>
 But records show that other new prisons, including some that opened later than 
Donovan, also have had problems: 
</P>
<P>
 Underground piping has corroded at Corcoran, Avenal, New Folsom and the new 
prison at Vacaville. Repair cost: $45,000 per site. 
</P>
<P>
 At Corcoran State Prison, control consoles failed, leaving whole housing units 
"entirely electronically disabled" for several days in 1991 and 1992. Repair 
cost: $113,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Corcoran also had problems with low technology. Tower guards discovered that 
windows would jam, and tended to crash shut. There were 29 reported injuries, 
and the union filed a grievance. Replacement cost: $72,000. 
</P>
<P>
 At Avenal, utility poles are sinking, tilting and collapsing beneath the 
weight of phone cables, threatening the entire communications system. Repair 
cost: $1.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 At Chuckwalla State Prison near Blythe, desert sand made its way into natural 
gas valves, jamming them and causing failure of 20 gas-fired pieces of 
equipment, such as stoves, in one year. In 1992, gas leaked into a cellblock, 
resulting in a small explosion and an evacuation. Repair cost: $722,942. 
</P>
<P>
 California prisons employ high-tech gadgetry. And when such systems fail, the 
costs are high. 
</P>
<P>
 Each officer has a personal alarm, which can be triggered in an emergency, 
alerting a central command center. The $2-million system also includes fire 
alarms and various other sensors. At the prisons in Delano and Wasco in the 
Central Valley, and one in Imperial County, alarms have experienced "numerous 
malfunctions, rendering the systems substantially unreliable and unstable," 
according to the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The matter has degenerated into litigation with the contractor, Shorrock 
Electronics of Maryland. The department claims that the entire system must be 
replaced and has hired a Utah firm to do the work at a cost of more than $3.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Shorrock counters that the system was properly installed and that any problems 
can be repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 The department's most embarrassing construction mishap occurred at 
$240-million Pelican Bay State Prison just south of the Oregon border -- 
California's highest-security prison. 
</P>
<P>
 When Pelican Bay was being designed, corrections officials agreed to use a 
different type of locking device, a pneumatic design, rather than electrically 
operated doors. After the prison opened in 1989, guards found that inmates 
could kick the doors open, jam them and knock them off their tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 Corrections officials hired a new contractor to install an entirely new 
electronically operated system for the 2,226 doors. The project cost: $6.6 
million, plus $1.9 million in design. 
</P>
<P>
 The department is seeking more than $8 million from the firms that originally 
installed the doors, Blount Inc. and J. A. Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 The contractors insist that any defects could have been fixed easily. "The 
doors did not need to be replaced. They could have been repaired," said Richard 
Sipos, attorney for J. A. Jones. "We gave them what they wanted, and they were 
dissatisfied with it." About This Series

MAYOR MAY HOLD KEY TO VALLEY RAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the coming showdown between two seasoned politicians over the east-west San 
Fernando Valley rail project, the key to victory may lie in the hands of yet a 
third powerful official, Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisors Mike Antonovich and Ed Edelman have staked out their 
positions for years: Antonovich supports an elevated line above the Ventura 
Freeway, while Edelman champions a subway along Burbank and Chandler 
boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the 13-member Metropolitan Transportation Authority board, which will 
select a route later this month, both men control only one vote apiece -- their 
own. It is Riordan who by law not only sits on the panel, but appoints three 
others, forming an influential bloc of four votes. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's chief executive, who like a majority of the MTA panel is still 
undecided on the issue, has thus become the object of ardent wooing in the 
politically charged effort to bring the Valley its own rail line in the coming 
century. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, Antonovich and his aides have huddled with Riordan, extolling 
the merits of a monorail-type system straddling the Ventura Freeway. After the 
mayor's return from a European vacation Monday, Edelman hopes to have his turn 
to argue the case for a mostly underground line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Antonovich is putting on a full-court press," Edelman said, "and we have to 
do the same." 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides are also courting Riordan's appointees -- Northridge real estate 
agent Mel Wilson, attorney Stan Sanders and Los Angeles City Councilman Richard 
Alatorre. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing requires the three to vote in step with the man who picked them to 
serve on the MTA board, one of the region's most powerful policy-making bodies. 
But Sanders said in an interview that he will adopt whatever position Riordan 
takes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to vote with the mayor," Sanders said. "I'm his appointee. . . . 
The Valley is an important political base for him, and he should be able to 
take four votes with him" to the table. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said he will come to a decision this week, but added that he does not 
feel obligated to follow Riordan's lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel bound to hear him (out)," Wilson said, "but I don't feel bound to vote 
a particular way." 
</P>
<P>
 Alatorre voted for the Ventura Freeway alignment in 1992 as an appointee of 
former Mayor Tom Bradley, but "at this point he's neutral," spokeswoman Liz 
Chavez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some transit officials and aides to MTA board members -- even those now trying 
to persuade Riordan to their point of view -- downplay the mayor's influence on 
the board, which includes members from smaller surrounding cities as well as 
Los Angeles County and city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every member of the transit authority is a key person. They are all equally 
vital and important," said Antonovich, adding that he has discussed the Valley 
rail project with other MTA directors in addition to Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
 But privately, transit officials acknowledge that Riordan can sway the 
opinions of his MTA colleagues and that even as a single vote, his support is 
crucial. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of the Ventura Freeway alignment -- such as the Van Nuys Homeowners 
Assn. -- hope Riordan sticks with an endorsement of the route he made last year 
during his mayoral campaign. At the time, he cited the huge financial advantage 
transit planners believed a monorail would hold over a subway. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the monorail has a savings of approximately $1 billion, and if the 
monorail can be constructed and operated without impairing the health and 
safety of our citizens, I will favor the monorail," then-candidate Riordan 
wrote in a transit-oriented newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 But recent cost comparisons have narrowed the gap between the two proposals. 
According to an independent review released last month, a subway would outstrip 
the monorail by only $19 million -- less than 1% of the total cost of either 
project -- if open-air stations were built in some locations. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Deputy Mayor Rae James said that despite his earlier backing of 
the Ventura Freeway line, Riordan has not yet made up his mind how to vote at 
the MTA board meeting Oct. 26. In a hopeful sign for subway advocates, she 
added that his position would not be determined by cost alone, to date the 
monorail supporters' most potent argument. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cheaper is not necessarily better," she said. "The Valley has waited a long 
time for rail, and they deserve the best they can get." 
</P>
<P>
 James said Riordan will reserve judgment until the city Department of 
Transportation publishes its own analysis of the two alternatives, including 
the impact of construction on nearby surface-street traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor will also hearken to the City Council, which is expected to take a 
stand on the issue this week, James said. Several council members have already 
voiced support for an underground system, but the spate of tunneling problems 
beneath Hollywood Boulevard has eroded some of its allure. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, those who side with Edelman and want to see an extension of the Red 
Line from Downtown to North Hollywood and then across the Valley are confident 
the City Council will agree with them. 
</P>
<P>
 That, coupled with the endorsement of most local homeowner and civic groups, 
would strengthen the subway's case before a mayor who is highly conscious of 
the Valley's role in electing him to the city's top job. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since he's been in office, he's been responsive, he's been concerned about 
the Valley," said Marcia Mednick of the Valley Industry and Commerce Assn., a 
prominent business group that backs the Burbank-Chandler route. "I hope that 
would carry through with this issue." 
</P>
<P>
 But, subway opponents contend, if Riordan wants to follow the will of the 
people, he should take a cue from an advisory vote put before residents in 
1990. The monorail garnered the most votes among various options for a Valley 
rail system, including a subway. 
</P>
<P>
 As currently envisioned, the Ventura Freeway line would boast 15 stops -- five 
more than the subway -- from Universal City to Warner Center, with possible 
future extensions west into Ventura County or north along surface streets to 
Metrolink stations. Gridlocked motorists on the freeway would see the monorail 
zip along above them and, the theory goes, would abandon their cars for mass 
transit. 
</P>
<P>
 Monorail supporters cite the recent tunneling problems in Hollywood as 
evidence that subway construction is burdened with too many risks, delays and 
cost overruns. 
</P>
<P>
 "The taxpayers know they've been ripped off with subway tunneling disasters 
beginning from Day 1," Antonovich said. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents counter that construction in the Ventura Freeway median would 
further snarl traffic on one of the nation's busiest thoroughfares. They 
contend that commuters would be discouraged from riding the elevated railway 
because they would have to switch over to the Red Line subway in Universal City 
to get to Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 A subway extension from North Hollywood to Woodland Hills would provide a 
seamless ride into Downtown, with stops close to Pierce and Valley colleges and 
the Van Nuys government center. Supporters, such as Edelman, note that the MTA 
has already spent $159 million in acquiring the right of way for the subway. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding themselves at loggerheads is no novelty for Edelman and Antonovich, 
who have clashed repeatedly over the years on the Board of Supervisors. But 
traditional alliances among supervisors, who each hold a seat on the MTA board, 
appear muddled. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Edelman is often allied with liberal Supervisors Gloria Molina and 
Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, an aide to Molina said the supervisor favors the 
Ventura Freeway alternative, putting her in Antonovich's camp.  
</P>
<P>
 Deane Dana is also leaning toward an above-ground route, according to 
spokesman DennisMorefield. Burke said she remains undecided.

 TOUGH IN POCKET: It's Week 7 in the NFL, and many questions remain: Can the 
Cowboys threepeat? Are the Chargers for real? Can Lonnie Lardner take a hit? 
Who? Lonnie Lardner, the Sherman Oaks reporter who does human-interest stories 
for Fox's NFL pregame show. Some critics have called them puff pieces. . . . 
"Yes, I can take a hit," she says. "Human interest is my specialty, and I like 
football better knowing the players." 
</P>
<P>
 FAR OUT: Sheriff's Deputies Randy McNary and Bill Axelrod patrol a long, 
lonely beat -- from Santa Clarita all the way out to the Kern County line (B1). 
. . . Bright lights and big city are miles away, and so are urban problems. "I 
went to one house, basically to tell a 10-year-old boy he has to go to bed," 
Axelrod says. "I couldn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 FACE TO VASE: A Goodwill Industries employee, Rose Ruiz (above) can't resist 
checking out a vase at the company's Preferred Merchandise Sale, where 
not-your-average discards were snatched up by hundreds of shoppers who waited 
for doors to open Saturday morning (B1). . . . Spode china, Rolex watches -- 
all were on sale below retail.

 WARM RECEPTION: Charlie Arango's accomplishment in a football game Friday 
night was well-recorded, with cameras from three local television stations 
rolling as the Birmingham High senior, who is missing his left hand, made his 
first reception of the season (C14). . . . But it was nothing new for his 
teammates. "Charlie makes that catch all the time in practice," said Tony 
Nichols, one of his closest friends on the team.

 PROTEST MARCH: A rally in support of jailed former Los Angeles Police Officers 
Laurence M. Powell and Stacey C. Koon drew more than 200 people to Canyon

BAKERSFIELD'S GLITZY CIRCUS OF THE STARS; EVENT: ANNUAL BUSINESS CONFERENCE 
UNDER A BIG TOP DRAWS THOUSANDS WHO PAY UP TO $295 TO SEE VIPS FROM JAMES BAKER 
TO SHIRLEY MACLAINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The Lear jets are landing, the limos are purring, the media army is dug in and 
the gigantic tent looms taut and ready. Here they come: Colin L. Powell, Henry 
A. Kissinger, James A. Baker III, two former heads of state, the three Apollo 
11 astronauts, Peter Jennings, Larry King, Shirley MacLaine and -- yes -- a lot 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 The spectacle unfolded Saturday in -- where else? -- Bakersfield, home to oil 
wells, cotton fields -- and, quite possibly, the most bizarre celebrity event 
in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Calgary may have its Stampede, New Orleans its Mardi Gras and Capistrano its 
swallows. Pamplona runs its bulls and Pasadena salutes its roses. 
</P>
<P>
 But now this San Joaquin Valley community, long dismissed by outsiders as a 
hot, dusty oil town, can brag of its own unique way to attract attention. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual Bakersfield Business Conference, put on by a local law firm, has 
ballooned into a media extravaganza that draws an audience from around the 
country. Not that there is any mystery to booking big-name speakers -- just 
offer cash, up to $60,000 a pop. 
</P>
<P>
 And one other thing: Make very sure the VIPs sign on the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want them to wake up one Sunday morning and say, 'God, did I say I 
was going to do a tent show in Bakersfield?' " said George F. Martin, the 
lawyer who dreamed up this curious synthesis of Ringling Bros. and "Meet the 
Press." 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, 12,500 enthusiastic guests paid up to $295 a pop for the pleasure 
of sitting inside the 148,000-square-foot tent -- or "fabric building system," 
in conference jargon -- to munch popcorn and gaze upon a Who's Who of media 
stalwarts. Outside, a Ferris wheel whirled beneath billowy white clouds, and 
latecomers drifted past a replica of Apollo 11 near the flag-festooned 
entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside their own tent, pampered by a stream of snacks and coffee, reporters 
from as far away as Germany and Japan followed events on monitors and grilled 
the occasional guest star who drifted in. 
</P>
<P>
 Most steered clear: "Sam Donaldson wants to hear George Will," conference 
spokeswoman Cindy Pollard told the press corps in explaining why the ABC 
newsman would not be visiting his counterparts. But, she added excitedly, "I 
just got word that Dr. Henry Kissinger is on his way over!" 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson passed through the big tent in the morning. But in the A-list 
wonderland of the Bakersfield Business Conference, many did not even hear about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 The jamboree, said Martin, 50, provides him the "satisfaction of putting on a 
good show," besides meeting his broader goals of publicizing Bakersfield and 
his law firm, Borton, Petrini & Conron. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, show biz is in his blood: Martin once promoted rock bands on his own 
Frantic Records label, including such notables as Mogen David and his Grapes of 
Wrath ("They were from Napa," he explained). 
</P>
<P>
 But the native of Olivehurst, a blue-collar community north of Sacramento, 
shifted his interest from rhythm and blues to contracts and torts. He studied 
law at UC Davis and now is managing partner of Borton, Petrini & Conron, which 
has 16 offices throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Some may see his firm's home base of Bakersfield as an uninviting sprawl of 
oil pumps, billboards and motels on California 99. For their part, residents 
may view their hometown as an underappreciated haven from the horrors of Los 
Angeles and urban life. 
</P>
<P>
 But to a growing number of stars from the lecture circuit -- not to mention 
Las Vegas -- Bakersfield is getting known as a juicy payday, a place where 
speakers can hold forth before a rapt audience in between comic banter and 
other entertainment. Some give their standard speech, others are interviewed 
and still others perform comic routines. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Reagan, George and Barbara Bush, Jimmy Carter and Gerald R. Ford have 
all played Bakersfield. Donald Trump, Lee Iacocca, Willard Scott, Burt 
Bacharach, Dionne Warwick and T. Boone Pickens Jr. showed up last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, Reba McEntire, Walter Cronkite and former German 
Chancellor Helmut Schmidt came before them. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Gov. Mario M. Cuomo described the event as "a parade of power." Andy 
Rooney confessed he couldn't fight off the pleasure of being recognized by 
Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 Without naming names, Martin said the most he ever paid a speaker was $60,000, 
with this year's top earner netting about $50,000. The few lesser lights 
allowed into the tent have garnered a few thousand dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is more to this Medialand than a desire for attention by a 
well-heeled law firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Enthusiasts describe the event as a marvel of detail; a fantasy world for 
grown-ups somehow conjured on 27 grassy acres at the Cal State Bakersfield 
campus. Planners spent more than $250,000 on temporary landscaping this year, 
which included 200 ficus and myrtle trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Need money to rent binoculars? Drop by the ATM trucked in from Bank of America 
for your convenience. Want a break from those speeches? Stroll over to the 
sports tent, where you can sip a drink and follow three college football games 
on 20 television monitors.  
</P>
<P>
 Does that spaceship near the entrance look authentic? It should: The Apollo 11 
model, 10% the size of the real one, was lent by NASA. Saturday's soiree was 
scheduled to climax with an interview of the lunar mission astronauts by 
television personality -- and former Air Force flyer -- David Hartman (a last 
minute replacement for Mike Wallace, who was not feeling well). A "fireworks 
spectacular" was set for the grand finale. 
</P>
<P>
 There were plenty of not-so-serious exchanges: Peter Jennings and Jay Leno 
pushing each other around on the podium; Kissinger declaring his satisfaction 
that the previous speaker, Texan James Baker, also had an accent, and Rich 
Little doing his impression of Richard Nixon. ("I've finally moved my jowls.") 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the speakers spent most of their time on weighty matters. Will 
critiqued the Clinton presidency along with much of modern society. Kissinger 
warned that America cannot be the global policeman. The former secretary of 
state expressed deep reservations about U.S. policy in Haiti, contending that 
our national interest there is not crucial enough to justify the loss of 
American lives. Jennings expressed his concern about cynicism in the news 
media. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is reality?" asked Shirley MacLaine, during her moment after Jennings 
and before former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. 
</P>
<P>
 A rare snafu took place last week when residents took offense at the red, 
white and blue plastic liners intended for use in the trash cans. After irate 
citizens barraged officials with complaints about using the flag-like liners, 
Martin apologized and had all 700 replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, however, the trickiest part is coordinating the schedules of all the 
VIPs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev was booked elsewhere, much to 
Martin's disappointment. But the attorney pointed with pride to uniting 
astronauts Buzz Aldrin, Neil Armstrong and Mike Collins in a rare joint 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like bringing the Beatles together -- they just don't do this," Martin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once upon a time, the Bakersfield Business Conference was a cozy seminar for 
250 people at a local country club. Now in its 10th year, it has become a 
show-biz festival that draws 14,000, perhaps half from out of town, including a 
press contingent of 200 and scores of workers. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's ticket revenues of $3.2 million will probably cover the law firm's 
direct costs, Martin said. Any profit will be plowed into next year's event. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the planning goes on. 
</P>
<P>
 Five former heads of state are being sought for next year, and more than 7,000 
tickets have been sold already. Do not circle your calendar: Preference goes to 
former attendees and their guests. Everyone else lands on the waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound like a crowd pleaser? It is, according to the International Platform 
Assn. of Winnetka, Ill. 
</P>

 The group, made up largely of booking agents and people who put on seminars, 
has given Bakersfield its best conference award twice. "This is one of a kind. 
It's amazing. It's off the charts," said Luvie Owens, the group's executive 
director, proclaiming that Bakersfield has set the standard for the rest of the 
country. "It's like Christmas or the 4th of July."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; 77TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT; INCUMBENT SPOTLIGHTS HIS SPOTTED 
PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In politics there is a strategy called "hanging a lantern" on your troubles, 
as in a candidate throwing light on all his dark corners before his opponent 
does it for him. 
</P>
<P>
 First-term Assemblyman Tom Connolly (D-Lemon Grove) has decided to hang such a 
lantern. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, a lone lantern may not cast enough light to cover the territory. So 
many troubles does he have, politically speaking, that Connolly, 48, an affable 
bundle of energy who loves to talk about politics, poetry and football, needs 
the level of candlepower capable of lighting up nearby San Diego Jack Murphy 
Stadium on the darkest night of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Connolly campaign began showing a 30-second commercial on local 
television the likes of which may have never been seen before in the politics 
of California or any other state. 
</P>
<P>
 In the commercial, Connolly admits having been an addict, a failed husband, a 
deadbeat dad, a tax delinquent and a bankrupt businessman. And he asks for 
votes not despite these shortcomings but, in a way, because of them: 
</P>
<P>
 "Hi, I'm Tom Connolly. Until five years ago, I had an addiction. It cost me my 
marriage and my business. I fell behind in my child support payments, and, 
although I paid that off, I owed the government thousands in back taxes and 
penalties.  
</P>
<P>
 "But on July 4, 1989, while in the back of an ambulance being raced to the 
hospital, I asked God for a second chance, and I got it. And now I'm using my 
life to help others, especially children, stay off drugs, and that's why I want 
to keep this job."  
</P>
<P>
 True, the commercial does not mention the sex harassment allegations made 
against Connolly by former staffers or the fact that the San Diego police vice 
squad tailed him for several months when they suspected that he was consorting 
with streetwalkers. 
</P>
<P>
 On those points, Connolly is quick to note that the Assembly Rules Committee 
staff concluded that the sex harassment charges were groundless and that the 
San Diego police never found enough evidence to arrest him. 
</P>
<P>
 Connolly said he sees himself as a role model for the redemption-minded. "I'm 
trying to demonstrate through my life that people can rebound," he said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 If voters miss the TV commercial, Connolly is going door to door distributing 
copies of what politicians call a "walking piece," in this case, a mea culpa 
brochure that tells of his checkered past. 
</P>
<P>
 Subtitled "From the Eve of Destruction to the Pinnacle of Redemption," the 
brochure includes a passage from Matthew 7:1, "Do not judge, or you too will be 
judged," and refers to Connolly as "a living example of the mythical phoenix, 
rising from the ashes of personal destruction to the heights of public office." 
</P>
<P>
 Connolly's Republican opponent, Steve Baldwin, believes that the phoenix 
analogy is a bit overdrawn. And it does not take much prodding for him to say 
Connolly is unfit to serve. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the state Assembly should be a rehabilitation center," said 
Baldwin, 38, a property manager for his family's real estate firm and a onetime 
strategist for the Christian right. 
</P>
<P>
 Even for a Democrat without Connolly's problems, the 77th Assembly District 
would be a tough seat to retain. 
</P>
<P>
 Consisting of the eastern San Diego County communities of La Mesa, El Cajon, 
Lemon Grove and Bonita and slivers of Chula Vista and San Diego, the district 
is 43% Republican and 41% Democrat. No other Assembly district in the state 
where Republicans hold a registration edge of two points or more has a Democrat 
representing it. 
</P>
<P>
 Like their Republican brethren, Democrats in the 77th have conservative 
tendencies, a fact not lost on Connolly or Baldwin. 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates support Proposition 187, which would deny most public services 
to illegal immigrants. Both candidates get high marks from the National Rifle 
Assn. Both believe in getting tough on welfare mothers. Both promise to protect 
the interests of the real estate industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago Connolly beat Baldwin, thanks to a last-minute infusion of 
$100,000 from the state Democratic Party and some television coverage that 
proved devastating to Baldwin. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC News and the MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour had tried to interview Baldwin for 
stories on the Christian right. Eager to downplay his role in the 
religious-political movement, Baldwin refused to be interviewed and fled. 
</P>
<P>
 The resulting coverage had the grainy, bumpy quality of a Bigfoot sighting, 
with Baldwin playing the role of Bigfoot. His campaign never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Connolly, a criminal defense attorney whose personal history had gone largely 
unnoticed by the press, squeaked to victory. This spring, however, just as the 
1994 primary season was dawning, the press discovered Connolly's history of 
cocaine addiction, multiple marriages and money problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two years ago, the focus was on Baldwin," Connolly said. "Now the focus is on 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 As in 1992, Baldwin can count on support from conservative Christian groups 
and the anti-abortion movement. Connolly has backing from the California 
Teachers Assn., veterans (he was in combat in Vietnam with the Army), and the 
National Organization for Women. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tom readily admits he's made some mistakes and he's willing to look for 
remedies in his life," said Jennifer Coburn, NOW president in San Diego County. 
"We look at that as a very positive sign." 
</P>
<P>
 With Connolly willingly reminding voters of his past indiscretions, Baldwin 
said he is unsure whether his campaign will have to do any hit pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen anything like it before," Baldwin said of Connolly's tell-all 
campaign strategy. "But then again, there has never been a candidate with this 
much baggage." 
</P>
<P>
 What Baldwin sees as baggage, Connolly calls learning experiences that left 
him sadder but wiser. He has until Nov. 8 to convince voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a very determined man," Connolly said. "What I say is that hard work and 
determination can make legends out of ordinary people."

ON CALIFORNIA / PETER H. KING: THE DEBATE: A FUNERAL DEFERRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We came, quite frankly, to bury Kathleen Brown. By we I mean the press, the 
pack, the purveyors of conventional wisdom. Tapped into laptops, scratched down 
on note pads, ready and stored for quick handling, were the rough drafts of 
eulogies to a curiously stillborn campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday night the funeral was to begin. Everybody knew the ritual. Brown would 
enter a public television studio and debate Gov. Pete Wilson for one hour. She 
would give one of her off-key, minimalist performances, demonstrating anew why 
she had fallen 13 poll points behind. Wilson would be Wilson, a passable if 
unexciting mix of ex-Marine and Statehouse wonk. Brown's last hope to resurrect 
her campaign would go unrealized. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you tell us," the debate panelist asked right away, sensing the kill, 
"just where your campaign has gone wrong?" 
</P>
<P>
 "My campaign," she replied, "has only begun." 
</P>
<P>
 And there was the hitch. Brown had not been told that her campaign was about 
to be put out of its misery. She not only showed up alive and kicking, she 
departed wearing the grin of Lazarus, a corpse that wouldn't stay in the 
coffin. If only for one night, Brown performed like the candidate so many 
people thought they saw a year ago, when they all but smothered the Democrat 
with golden expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She was sharp, poised, aggressive. By contrast, Wilson rarely got off his 
heels. He muddled and stammered and tossed around numbers like a hyperactive 
statistics professor. The debate topics were predictable -- immigration, 
economics, crime. Wilson, the wisdom had it, "owns" these issues. If so, he let 
Brown borrow them for the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigration became a discussion of Wilson's inconsistencies, comparing his 
advocacy in the U.S. Senate for more seasonal pickers to his more strident 
rhetoric of today. Instead of heartily embracing Proposition 187 for what it is 
-- a strategy to chase out undocumented Mexicans -- the governor instead took 
the equivocal, weak-sounding line that he supported it only as a means to 
trigger a lengthy and costly legal challenge. And so much for tort reform as 
the next big Republican issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Economic debate was framed around Brown's 62-page booklet, "Building a New 
California." Wilson challenged the notion that it constitutes an "economic 
plan," deriding it as a mere "pamphlet." Still, plan or pamphlet, Brown's 
booklet was the only one on the table. What Wilson might intend for a second 
term, incredibly, never came up as a topic. 
</P>
<P>
 The most startling reversal, though, involved crime. Wilson has made an art of 
standing grimly beside crime victims while the cameras roll. The implication 
behind the image is empathy -- that Wilson gets it on crime, and his opponent 
does not. On Friday night, in a moment her advisers insisted was spontaneous, 
Brown stepped on Wilson's favorite photo op. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I resent most of all," she said, pivoting to engage the governor, "is 
you questioning, questioning my commitment to be tough on crime. You cannot 
possibly imagine what it's like to be a woman, at night, leaving the office, 
going to your car at night, worrying about your safety. And you cannot imagine 
what it's like to be a mother, waiting at home late at night for your kids to 
come home -- waiting for your daughter to come home in the evening, and having 
her come home and comfort her because she's been raped." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Except for this disclosure about a daughter's date rape, much of what Brown 
said in the debate was not new. Rather than her text, it was her delivery, her 
bearing, that seemed most transformed. For once, she did not appear to be 
searching for pitch, straining to remember scripted sound bites. She was 
Kathleen Brown, rather than Kathleen Brown, candidate. It made all the 
difference. She won the debate, and she cheated the obituary writers. 
</P>
<P>
 The question now is can she build on the success. There was new wisdom passed 
about in the post-debate klatches. Brown, it was said, had failed to deliver 
the knockout punch she needed. Such analysis seemed a bit overextended. Debate 
victories, no matter how lopsided, almost never move great blocs of voters 
fast. What they can do is solidify support, open some minds and reorder the 
political debate. What they can do, too, is revise the story line. 
</P>
<P>
 This, more than anything, is what Brown accomplished Friday night. She 
canceled for now any post-mortem analyses of her campaign. She ensured that the 
last weeks before the election will be covered, not as a funeral march, but as 
a chase: Can she catch Pete Wilson? She entered the debate a presumed corpse 
and emerged a still viable candidate -- an underdog, but still in the hunt. It 
was no small feat. Ask Lazarus.

HELPING HOMELESS HELP THEMSELVES; SAN DIEGO: THE NEIL GOOD DAY CENTER OFFERS NO 
COTS, FOOD OR HANDOUTS. IT OFFERS STREET PEOPLE SOMETHING ELSE: HOPE THROUGH 
EMPOWERMENT, DIGNITY AND JOBS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWARD J. BOYER and TONY PERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The last thing the Neil Good Day Center wants to be seen as is just another 
shelter for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 The center -- which is the model for a similar facility that Los Angeles Mayor 
Richard Riordan wants to build in Downtown -- is driven by a philosophy of 
offering hope to the hopeless, by taking tough stances toward the people whose 
lives it aims to turn around. 
</P>
<P>
 For that reason, it offers no sleeping cots or food to the homeless. But it is 
a place where street people can come during the day to take a shower, do their 
laundry, sleep on a lawn beneath a tree, or maybe take a step toward gainful 
employment. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I give a guy a sandwich and I know that he is slamming drugs all night, 
all I'm doing is helping to kill him," said Bob McElroy, the former drug addict 
and panhandler whose Alpha Project runs the center under a contract with San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm about creating jobs," said McElroy, a former Bible student, whose early 
work with the homeless included passing out sandwiches in a San Diego park. 
"We're into empowering these people out here to take control of their own 
lives. You give me rakes, shovels and weed whackers, and you get dignity, 
self-respect, value, earning potential, hope." 
</P>
<P>
 McElroy said he supports efforts in several cities to crack down on the 
homeless, saying "amen" to ordinances aimed at controlling homeless 
populations. "Guys out there on the floor will tell you the same thing," he 
said, gesturing toward the Good Center's day room. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas E. Suggs, a homeless man who sat reading a book, agreed. If he were a 
business owner, Suggs said, "I wouldn't want the homeless hanging around. They 
are an eyesore, a deterrent to customers." 
</P>
<P>
 More stringent city ordinances could be "an incentive for some people to get . 
. . off the street," McElroy said. "These people are survivors. Why are there 
panhandlers? Because people give them money. If nobody gave money to the 
panhandlers, there wouldn't be any panhandlers."  
</P>
<P>
 If he had the power, McElroy said, "there wouldn't be one food line, one 
feeding center, one drop-in shelter with a cot, one program that I could check 
into for 90 days at my own discretion and come and go as I please with no 
requirement placed upon me." 
</P>
<P>
 By eliminating those services, he said, homeless people "would have to come to 
me with a serious attitude and say: 'I'm really hungry and I want to earn my 
sandwich, earn my bed, earn my way out of here.' "  
</P>
<P>
 As McElroy sees it, people who set policy never talk to the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people got so many smarts out here," he said. "They designed our whole 
program -- told us the right and wrong things to do." 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego's City Council chose McElroy's Alpha Project to run the center after 
the contract was turned down by the Episcopal Community Services because 
officials thought the city was not committed to sufficiently funding the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 McElroy grabbed the opportunity and soon organized homeless people into work 
details doing landscaping, tree-trimming, painting and graffiti removal for a 
variety of paying customers. 
</P>
<P>
 McElroy said his Alpha Project put 120 homeless people to work building the 
Kansas City Steak House in San Diego, one of the city's largest restaurants. 
More than 80 of those people went on to full-time jobs in the private sector, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He is now trying to raise about $800,000 to fund a jobs program for homeless 
workers to control litter and clean up the Logan Heights area of San Diego 
where most programs for the homeless are concentrated. 
</P>
<P>
 The center has caught the eye of Los Angeles officials struggling to cope with 
the ever-increasing problem of urban homelessness. A City Council committee 
Monday will consider a proposal from the mayor's office to develop a similar 
facility in an industrial area east of Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 The L.A. Center would be open 24 hours, with 50 beds and, like the Neil Good 
Center, a lawn for homeless who prefer outdoor accommodations to sleeping 
inside. Three locations that would be financed by federal funds are under 
consideration, James said. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates for the homeless have criticized the proposal, calling it a 
transparent scheme to put the unsightly throngs in Downtown out of the sight of 
tourists, shoppers and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 McElroy does not argue with that assessment. That is exactly what the San 
Diego center was designed to do, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But if city officials in Los Angeles are looking at the center as a way to get 
the growing number of homeless out of sight, McElroy has one caution: "It won't 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 Four hundred homeless people come through the San Diego center each day, he 
said, but that still leaves 2,500 in the city's downtown business district. 
</P>
<P>
 "The center was supposed to be a magnet to draw the homeless out of downtown," 
he said. The "proof of that pudding," he said, is that the center was 
originally designed to be open only five days a week because "all of the 
business people go home on the weekends. So it's OK for the place to be 
closed." 
</P>
<P>
 McElroy focused press attention on the five-day plan, and was able to persuade 
officials to open the center for seven days. 
</P>
<P>
 The Neil Good Center is composed of a 5,000-square-foot building and a similar 
sized patio and lawn. Funding came from the city and county governments, the 
San Diego Unified Port District and the city's redevelopment agency. The center 
has a budget of $177,000 a year, and serves about 400 people a day. 
</P>
<P>
 And it has been far from free of controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council is debating whether social service agencies in the eastern 
section of downtown serve only to concentrate the homeless. San Diego City 
Councilman Juan Vargas was one of the early critics, but he has become a 
supporter of the center's emphasis on trying to put people to work. 
</P>
<P>
 One morning last week, several dozen homeless people were in the center by 8 
a.m., doing laundry, showering, picking up mail and looking over classifieds. 
Regulars found their partners for bid whist, pinochle and chess. Others simply 
took a load off, sitting and resting in the center's reading area. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, more than a dozen people slept on the ground in the warm sun, their 
shopping carts parked in a row nearby. Several people standing in a courtyard 
agreed that the center is a badly needed facility for people who have nowhere 
else to go. 
</P>
<P>
 For others, it is a respite from the rigors of the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mostly want to come here when I want to read a good book," said Jim 
Jackson, 32, a former commercial artist and self-described alcoholic. Reading, 
he said, "is the only entertainment I have right now." 
</P>
<P>
 When Los Angeles city officials spent two days at the center, McElroy said, 
his constant message was "work, work. Give these people some hope. Give them 
the opportunity to take back Skid Row, to build houses." 
</P>
<P>
 An idea suddenly hit him: "Maybe Alpha Project will go up to Los Angeles and 
apply to run that program."

KOHL'S COALITION FAVORED AS GERMANS VOTE TODAY; ELECTION: CHANCELLOR STANDS FOR 
PEACE AND STABILITY, HIS MAIN RIVAL SCHARPING FOR JOBS AND SOCIAL JUSTICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARJORIE MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Continuity or change. The old, post-World War II generation or the new '60s 
breed. Those are the options in the German federal election today, when voters 
must choose whether to return conservative Chancellor Helmut Kohl to office for 
a fourth term or replace him with the younger Social Democrat, Rudolf 
Scharping. 
</P>
<P>
 Kohl, 64, who aspires to become Germany's longest-serving chancellor since the 
war, has barnstormed the country with such optimism that he already has 
journalists asking if he plans to run again in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Scharping, meanwhile, seeks to be the Bill Clinton of Germany, a 46-year-old 
pragmatist leading his party back to power after 12 years in the back seat. 
Enough is enough, he says. It's time for a change. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kohl camp is betting that, no matter how much Germany's 60 million voters 
might worry and complain, ultimately they will choose the status quo. "No 
German government ever has lost power in an election," a confident senior 
government official said. "Never has a challenger replaced an incumbent through 
an open election." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the latest polls give a slight advantage to Kohl's three-party 
coalition, made up of the Christian Democratic Union; its Bavarian sister 
party, the Christian Social Union, and the liberal Free Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are enough wild cards in the multi-party race that the weekly 
newsmagazine Der Spiegel has prepared five possible cover stories for its 
Monday edition. And the weekly newspaper Die Woche asks in a headline if there 
will be "A Chancellor Change?" 
</P>
<P>
 The yearlong campaign has been an American-style competition of personalities 
over issues: The veteran statesman Kohl versus the bearded Scharping, who 
quotes Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Kohl stands for peace and stability, 
Scharping for jobs and social justice. 
</P>
<P>
 The business community clearly prefers Kohl. And despite the prevailing issue 
of "change," neither candidate has spoken of making any radical changes in 
Germany's existing economic or foreign policies, especially its relationship 
with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither man, though, will have the votes to govern alone, and Germany's small 
parties ultimately will determine who rules a coalition government. 
</P>
<P>
 With two ballots each to elect a Parliament, Germans vote for a deputy in 
their district and for a political party. Elected deputies are guaranteed a 
seat if their party gets 5% of the national vote; the party list vote 
determines the overall percentage of seats each party gets. The chancellor is 
then picked in Parliament by the largest party or the party that can control 
the most seats in alliance with others. 
</P>
<P>
 For decades, the kingmakers have been the Free Democrats. They helped bring 
Social Democratic Chancellor Willy Brandt to power in 1969, and brought his 
party down again in 1982 when they switched sides to the Christian Democrats, 
putting Kohl in office. 
</P>
<P>
 The liberals have vowed to go with Kohl again, but they failed to win 
legislative seats in the last six state elections, raising questions about 
their viability in the federal vote. Can they scrape together the 5% minimum 
needed to win seats in Parliament? 
</P>
<P>
 If the liberals fail to make the cut, or if the two parties together fall 
short of a clear majority, Kohl could be forced into a "grand coalition" with 
the Social Democrats. This option, last tried in the 1960s, is a last resort 
for both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one really wants it," said Stephan Kornelius, political reporter for the 
newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung. "A grand coalition increases the extreme 
parties on the left and right. In the middle term, it will harm both of the big 
parties." 
</P>
<P>
 The "extreme" vote is another uncertainty for Kohl, who ran a Cold War, 
anti-Communist campaign. Although the ultra-rightist Republikaner Party almost 
certainly will not make it into Parliament, the reformed Communist Party of 
East Germany, now called the Party of Democratic Socialism, has a shot under 
the leadership of its top candidate, Gregor Gysi, whom many consider to be 
Germany's most dynamic politician. 
</P>
<P>
 Polls show that the PDS has less than 5% support nationwide but strength in 
several eastern districts. Under a quirk in the election law, if it wins three 
districts it could take up to 27 seats in the 656-seat Bundestag. 
</P>
<P>
 The Social Democrats sought to form a government with the ecological Greens 
Party, which is expected to win its way back into the Bundestag today after 
losing out in 1990. The two parties alone are not likely to have enough votes 
to govern, and the question of whether they would ally with the PDS became a 
campaign issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Kohl hammered the Social Democrats for forming a state government in 
Saxony-Anhalt earlier this year with the support of the former Communists. His 
attacks forced Scharping to say he would not turn to the PDS to form a federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 The key may be in the question of change. At the beginning of the campaign 
season, more than half of all voters said they wanted a change in government. 
Now, according to the pollsters at the Allensbach Institute, only 46% say they 
do. And it takes more than that to oust Kohl.

PRINCE CHARLES GIVES HIS SIDE OF FAILED MARRIAGE IN NEW BIOGRAPHY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The London Sunday Times today begins serializing a new biography that presents 
Prince Charles' side of his unhappy marriage and gives details of a lonely 
childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The book, written by television documentary-maker Jonathan Dimbleby, has 
already stirred controversy in the Royal Family. Palace sources have worried 
that the serialization will overshadow the long-planned visit of Queen 
Elizabeth II to Russia, which begins Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Passages about Charles' unhappy school days are likely to displease the queen 
and Prince Philip, who often spent long periods away from their eldest son. 
</P>
<P>
 The biography includes Charles' views about his failed marriage -- in 
particular, how Diana insisted he change his friends and adapt to her ideas of 
wedded behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 In a June television documentary made by Dimbleby, the prince admitted that he 
had committed adultery, but only after his marriage had irretrievably broken 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 In writing the biography, Dimbleby had access to about 10,000 of Prince 
Charles' papers, including letters to his wife and to his mistress, Camilla 
Parker-Bowles. But Buckingham Palace sources said Saturday that no intimate 
letters were used in the book. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the prince's supporters said they believe he should not have exposed 
such private details of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 One Buckingham Palace aide said: "The documentary was a mistake. This book is 
a huge mistake. The monarchy has been damaged enough by all these revealing 
books. But this one is more damaging, because every word has been inspired by 
the prince himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Other friends said the biography presents "the outlines of the truth" and was 
necessary because there has been so much "speculation, fabrication and 
intrusion" into royal affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The book is part of a public relations campaign by the Prince of Wales and his 
new advisers, the aim of which is to show the prince in a more human context. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dimbleby book, called "The Prince of Wales: A Biography," will be 
published Nov. 3.

INDIA SUCCESSFULLY LAUNCHES SATELLITE-CARRYING BOOSTER ROCKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 India took a major step forward in space Saturday with the successful launch 
of its own four-stage booster rocket, meant to make the country one of the "big 
boys" in the business of commercial satellite launches. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirteen months after the first try ended in failure, Saturday's blastoff was 
a white-knuckle triumph for India's space scientists, who have had their share 
of flops and have had to work around a two-year U.S. ban on sales of space 
components to their nation. 
</P>
<P>
 But the launch is certain to revive concerns that the achievements of India's 
space program will sooner or later be put to military use. Some media here have 
said the experimental booster could be used as an intercontinental ballistic 
missile, or ICBM. 
</P>
<P>
 The 145-foot-high prototype, designed to carry payloads of more than one ton, 
blasted skyward from Sriharikota Island off the eastern Indian coast at 10:30 
a.m. local time.  
</P>
<P>
 Seventeen minutes later, the rocket put a 1,900-pound, Indian-made remote 
sensing satellite into a 500-mile-high orbit looping over the poles. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists at the launch center in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh broke 
into stormy applause as the bulb-nosed rocket, officially designated the Polar 
Satellite Launch Vehicle, rose into a clear sky atop a pillar of flame. 
</P>
<P>
 The successful flight of the largest and most powerful booster ever built by 
Indians was a benchmark in the country's drive to place its own satellites in 
orbit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The PSLV's launch success is a step toward our quest for self-reliance," 
President Shankar Dayal Sharma said in a message of congratulations to the 
Indian Space Research Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great, great day for us, a great day for ISRO, a great day for the 
country," K. Kasturiraman, the space agency's chairman, said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first attempt at launching the 283-ton PSLV failed Sept. 20, 1993, when 
the booster and satellite plummeted into the Bay of Bengal. That abortive 
565-second flight was blamed on a software error in the on-board guidance 
system, and modifications were made. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Kasturiraman's predecessor, U. R. Rao, predicted that the PSLV 
would put India "among the big boys in space." Indian officials predict that 
the $135-million program will give them a commercial launcher competitive in 
technology and price with similar U.S., European, Russian and Chinese rockets. 
</P>
<P>
 India's once-introverted and heavily regulated economy is now eagerly courting 
foreign capital and customers for its products, and the PSLV should be no 
exception. Indian officials estimate the country could earn $10 million to $15 
million for each commercial launch of the PSLV. 
</P>
<P>
 India will not be shopping for business immediately, however. There must be at 
least two more successful flights before the PSLV is certified as operational, 
and the next flight is at least 12 to 15 months away.

SEAT OF POWER BACK IN HAITI WITH ARISTIDE

<TEXT>
<P>
 While cameras Saturday focused on the front door of the airplane from which 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide was disembarking, a crew was unloading a big, 
blue-upholstered armchair through the rear door. 
</P>
<P>
 It was built by the youths of La Fanmi Se La Vi, Creole for The Family Is 
Life, an orphanage founded by the priest-president, who said he would never sit 
in a chair occupied by one of Haiti's previous, undemocratic presidents. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was driven from power in a military coup in 1991, Aristide took the 
chair with him into exile in Washington.

U.N. LIFTS HAITI SANCTIONS TO WELCOME ARISTIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Security Council welcomed the return of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide 
to Haiti on Saturday by lifting its crippling sanctions against the Caribbean 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote was 14 in favor with one abstention, Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our hopes and our prayers are with the people of Haiti as they begin to 
rebuild their country," U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright told the council. 
"To the people of Haiti we say: We are with you and we will help you." 
</P>
<P>
 Security Council President David Hannay of Britain said sanctions would be 
lifted at 12:01 a.m. today.  
</P>
<P>
 "Now that President Aristide has returned to Haiti, sanctions will be lifted," 
the resolution said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council "expresses its confidence that the people of Haiti can now rebuild 
their country with dignity and consolidate democracy," the resolution said. It 
also reaffirmed "the willingness of the international community to provide 
assistance to the people of Haiti." 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide returned to Haiti on Saturday after three years and 15 days in exile. 
</P>
<P>
 The council said Sept. 29 that the sanctions would be lifted as soon as 
Aristide returned to power. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations imposed sanctions against Haiti in June, 1993, and 
tightened them four months later, measures aimed at forcing military rulers 
from power. 
</P>
<P>
 The sanctions barred all oil shipments and trade with Haiti except food, 
medicine and humanitarian supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 The sanctions also limited travel to and from Haiti and froze overseas assets 
of Haiti's military leaders and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 Haiti's army rulers resigned last week under a Sept. 18 agreement negotiated 
by a mission led by former President Jimmy Carter. The accord helped forestall 
an imminent U.S. invasion and led to the peaceful deployment of U.S. troops in 
Haiti on Sept. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 The council had voted July 31 to authorize the use of force to oust the 
Haitian military and restore Aristide to power. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil abstained on that vote, saying it could not agree to the use of force. 
It abstained again on Saturday's vote saying that approving the resolution 
would give tacit endorsement to the U.S. intervention in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 A 6,000-member U.N. peacekeeping force is expected to replace U.S. soldiers in 
Haiti in the coming months.

EXILES FLOOD MIAMI STREETS TO MARK ARISTIDE'S 2ND COMING; FLORIDA: HAITIAN 
IMMIGRANTS CELEBRATE RETURN OF DEMOCRACY. ONE SAYS THE PRESIDENT'S ARRIVAL 
'FELT LIKE JESUS WAS BACK ON EARTH.' 
</P>

 The aroma of fried pork and plantains, the rhythmic pulse of Creole music and 
splashes of red and blue -- those of the Haitian flag and the sash worn by 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide -- floated over the streets of Little Haiti on Saturday, 
a rich sensory backdrop for thousands of Haitians celebrating their president's 
return home. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do I feel? My gosh, is there a word for it?" asked a beaming Maria Simon, 
who danced down the middle of Northwest 54th Street here about an hour after 
Aristide ended three years of exile and returned to his embattled Caribbean 
homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw him on television actually touch the ground, it felt like Jesus 
was back on Earth," said Simon, a 28-year-old nurse who left Haiti when she was 
14. "Haitians, Americans -- we are all happy. Just look around." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, there was no mistaking the mood that powered this party. Through a 
10-block area in the heart of South Florida's Haitian community, just north of 
downtown, people hugged and danced, waved Haitian flags and exchanged 
exclamations of joy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Democraci pou tou tan!" cried one Creole-speaker with a can of Budweiser in 
his hand. Democracy forever! 
</P>
<P>
 Almost every other person, it seemed, wore one of several commemorative 
T-shirts bearing the image of Aristide, the diminutive Roman Catholic priest on 
whose shoulders so many dreams ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps 10,000 people -- about a tenth of South Florida's Haitian population 
-- were in the streets at any one time for the celebration that began Friday, 
when Miami police barricaded the area from traffic, and was expected to 
continue through Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had hope for so long. Now it's here," said Chesly Cherizol, 24, a 
mechanic, referring to Aristide's return to the Presidential Palace from which 
he was driven by a military coup in September, 1991. "Now I can't wait to go to 
Haiti for a visit. You know, with the money people make here, you can live like 
a king there." 
</P>
<P>
 If Aristide's return is followed by a smooth transition to democracy, many 
Haitians in Miami will face a tough choice of whether to stay in the United 
States or go back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it would be better if people like me went back," said Simon, who has 
three children, all born here. "I know my husband wants to go." 
</P>
<P>
 With the street party in full swing, however, those decisions would wait until 
another day. 
</P>
<P>
 All along Little Haiti's main street, music boomed from banks of speakers set 
up outside storefronts, and strollers stopped to sway and shuffle in the bright 
sunshine. Vendors hawked fried chicken and cold sodas, Aristide hats and vanity 
license plates. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone was prospering. Paul Phanor, manager of Ziggy Furniture, said he 
had marked down a four-piece black-and-gold living room set (couch, love seat, 
easy chair and coffee table) from $850 to $600 as a "Father Aristide special." 
But home furnishings were not on many minds here Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Next week," said Phanor. "When the (U.N.-imposed economic) embargo is lifted, 
and once again people will be buying furniture to resell in Haiti, this special 
will sell. Eventually, what is happening today will be good for business. But 
today, no."

MAN SUSPECTED OF STABBING NOBEL-WINNER IS ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Egyptian police have arrested the man they believe stabbed and wounded the 
country's best-known novelist, Nobel Prize-winner Naguib Mahfouz, security 
sources said today. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahfouz, 82, had an operation on Friday after the man, apparently a Muslim 
militant, stabbed him in the neck outside the writer's Cairo apartment.Doctors 
say his condition is now good. 
</P>
<P>
 The prime suspect was arrested Saturday evening in one of a series of sweeps 
against what the security sources called terrorists, the usual official term 
for members of violent Muslim fundamentalist organizations.  
</P>
<P>
 Mahfouz, speaking about the incident on television on Saturday, said 
"terrorism" was an evil to be fought. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pray to God to make the police victorious over terrorism and to purify 
Egypt from this evil, in defense of people, freedom and Islam," Mahfouz, in a 
croaky voice from his hospital bed, told Interior Minister Hassan Alfi.

ISLAMIC MILITANTS RALLY AGAINST ARAFAT IN GAZA; SOLDIER IS LAID TO REST IN 
JERUSALEM; MIDEAST: PLO CHIEF IS THREATENED WITH MORE UNREST IF ARRESTS OF 
FUNDAMENTALISTS CONTINUE. 15,000 MOURN KIDNAPED CORPORAL KILLED IN RAID.

<P>
 Moving toward a showdown, thousands of Islamic militants rallied against PLO 
chief Yasser Arafat on Saturday, and gunmen threatened to "make Gaza burn" if 
the arrests of fundamentalists continue. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palestinian self-rule government led by Arafat urged Israel to resume 
talks on expanding autonomy and to reopen Israel to Gaza workers. It said the 
sanctions imposed after the kidnaping of an Israeli soldier played into the 
hands of extremists. 
</P>
<P>
 The hostage, Cpl. Nachshon Waxman, 19, was shot to death Friday during an army 
raid on the kidnapers' West Bank hide-out. Waxman's three captors and an 
Israeli commando were also killed. 
</P>
<P>
 In Jerusalem, 15,000 Israelis attended Waxman's midnight funeral. In his 
eulogy, army Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai said commandos "were seconds late" in 
saving Waxman: "The scoundrels (the captors) shot you while you were tied and 
could not fight back." 
</P>
<P>
 Near the grave site, dozens of soldiers held each other and wept. Hundreds of 
police were deployed at the funeral to prevent anti-Arab riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamas, the Muslim fundamentalist group that held Waxman, warned Saturday that 
it will kidnap more Israelis unless Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin agrees to free 
200 Palestinian prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 A strike called by Hamas to mourn the dead kidnapers shut down most of the 
West Bank on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Izzidin al-Qassam, Hamas' underground military wing, threatened to unleash 
a civil war if Palestinian police continued to arrest Hamas activists. Under 
pressure from Israel and the United States, Arafat ordered more than 160 
rounded up last week as part of the effort to find the kidnapers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Izzidin al-Qassam's answer will be to make Gaza burn," said a Hamas leaflet 
distributed Saturday. "Hamas doesn't allow any faction to lay a finger on its 
followers." 
</P>
<P>
 Waxman's abduction forced Arafat into an unwanted showdown with Hamas, his 
strongest political rival. In the past, Arafat was reluctant to crack down, 
fearing his fragile government might not survive a confrontation in the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the kidnaping, Rabin turned up the pressure, insisting that the 
hostage was held in Gaza and that Arafat was solely responsible for the 
soldier's fate. Palestinians have self-rule in all of Gaza but only a portion 
of the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Arafat ordered the arrest sweeps. 
</P>
<P>
 Yasser Abed-Rabbo, information minister in the self-rule government, suggested 
Saturday that the crackdown against Hamas will continue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will not permit anything to harm the national security," he told reporters 
after the weekly Cabinet meeting. "The Palestinian Authority . . . will 
continue taking measures to ensure national security." 
</P>
<P>
 In a first step, the Cabinet decided to ban the use of mosque loudspeakers for 
political propaganda.

</P>
<P>
 Hamas, the Muslim fundamentalist group that held Waxman, warned Saturday that 
it will kidnap more Israelis unless Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin agrees to free 
200 Palestinian prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 A strike called by Hamas to mourn the dead kidnapers shut down most of the 
West Bank on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Izzidin al-Qassam, Hamas' underground military wing, threatened to unleash 
a civil war if Palestinian police continued to arrest Hamas activists. Under 
pressure from Israel and the United States, Arafat ordered more than 160 
rounded up last week as part of the effort to find the kidnapers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Izzidin al-Qassam's answer will be to make Gaza burn," said a Hamas leaflet 
distributed Saturday. "Hamas doesn't allow any faction to lay a finger on its 
followers." 
</P>
<P>
 Waxman's abduction forced Arafat into an unwanted showdown with Hamas, his 
strongest political rival. In the past, Arafat was reluctant to crack down, 
fearing his fragile government might not survive a confrontation in the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the kidnaping, Rabin turned up the pressure, insisting that the 
hostage was held in Gaza and that Arafat was solely responsible for the 
soldier's fate. Palestinians have self-rule in all of Gaza but only a portion 
of the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Arafat ordered the arrest sweeps. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmed Bahar, a Hamas leader, accused Arafat of surrendering to the Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Palestinian Authority knelt before Rabin and arrested our fighters to 
appease the Israelis," he said as he paid his condolences to the family of 
slain kidnaper Salah Jadalla, 22, in a Gaza City slum. 
</P>
<P>
 Yasser Abed-Rabbo, information minister in the self-rule government, suggested 
Saturday that the crackdown against Hamas will continue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will not permit anything to harm the national security," he told reporters 
after the weekly Cabinet meeting. "The Palestinian Authority . . . will 
continue taking measures to ensure national security." 
</P>
<P>
 In a first step, the Cabinet decided to ban the use of mosque loudspeakers for 
political propaganda. 
</P>
<P>
 The PLO also criticized Israel's actions, saying the sanctions imposed after 
the kidnaping violated the peace agreement signed in September, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "The negotiations should not be used as a weapon whenever an incident occurs. 
. . . It will jeopardize the relations between both sides," Abed-Rabbo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinian sources said Rabin called Arafat late Friday and promised to 
reopen the Gaza Strip "very soon." Rabin told reporters that he would contact 
the PLO soon about restarting negotiations on expanding autonomy in the West 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Across town, about 5,000 Hamas supporters marched to the central jail Saturday 
to press for the release of the detainees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arafat, Arafat, hear the news, the soldiers of Qassam are waiting for you," 
chanted the marchers, some raising the Koran, the Muslim holy book. 
</P>
<P>
 Scores of armed police formed a chain to block the prison gate, and snipers 
looked down from surrounding rooftops. However, march organizers kept the crowd 
at bay, and the protest broke up after several hours without violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The mood was defiant and angry at a wake for the dead kidnapers that drew 
thousands who gathered under a large canopy in a sandy lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Two masked men fired shots in the air from the rooftop of an adjacent 
kindergarten, and from loudspeakers blared a Hamas fighting song, "Load your 
guns, oh Izzidin." 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech to the mourners, Ahmed Turk, student council president at Gaza 
City's Islamic University, accused Arafat of collaborating with the Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (Israeli) occupation authorities have located the hide-out of the 
kidnapers based on information they received from the Palestinian Authority," 
Turk claimed. 
</P>
<P>
 Abed-Rabbo denied the charges, but the accusation could erode public support 
for Arafat's government. Even Palestinians who support reconciliation with 
Israel reject the idea of collaborating with the former occupying power against 
fellow Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel's army chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Ehud Barak, said Israeli and 
Palestinian security services shared information throughout the affair.

LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS; 'THREE STRIKES' LAW WILL BOOST WALL STREET FIRMS THAT 
SELL BONDS TO FINANCE CONSTRUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN MORAIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wall Street will be one of the biggest winners as California builds prisons to 
house felons sentenced under the "three strikes" law. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1984, big investment firms have made more than $35 million from this 
state's prison construction program. As more prisons are built to house "three 
strikes" inmates, they will reap far more. 
</P>
<P>
 To finance prison construction, California sells two types of bonds -- 
traditional voter-approved general obligation bonds and more complex lease 
revenue bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters approved general obligation bonds five times between 1982 and 1990 
totaling $2.4 billion. Interest to be paid on the bonds will bring that sum to 
$4.1 billion. But in the early 1980s, legislators concluded that voters would 
not approve all the debt needed to build prisons. So in 1984, legislators 
changed the law enabling themselves to directly authorize lease revenue bonds 
to build prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature and the two most recent governors have approved the sale of 
$2.9 billion in lease revenue bonds for prisons. By the time the lease revenue 
bonds are paid off, the total cost will be $5.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 To sell the bonds, the treasurer turns to Wall Street. Investment firms such 
as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs form syndicates to buy the bonds at a 
discount, then resell them. 
</P>
<P>
 Retailers market the bonds as safe long-term investments to consumers. 
Treasurer Kathleen Brown has sold prison bonds in denominations as small as 
$250 as part of a program to help families save for college tuition. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislative analyst contends that lease revenue bonds cost taxpayers 20% 
more than voter-approved bonds in higher interest rates and administrative 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond defaults are not unheard of. The most infamous example came in 1983 when, 
to the horror of 25,000 investors, the Washington Public Power Supply defaulted 
on $2.25 billion of lease revenue bonds when it failed to complete nuclear 
power plants in Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say there is no chance that California will go the way of the utility 
that came to be known as WHOOPS. "We're way overcrowded. There is a lot of 
stability in this," said G. Kevin Carruth, chief of the state Department of 
Corrections construction program. 
</P>
<P>
 Because lease revenue bonds do not require a vote of the public, corrections 
officials say they can be approved more quickly, which speeds construction and 
can save taxpayers money. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the job of government is to be more efficient and more effective, and to 
accomplish a job, you want to be able to move," Carruth said. "There is a cost 
to delay, a very significant cost." 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco investment banker Thomas Dumphy helped devise the concept of 
using lease revenue bonds for prisons. While working for the investment firm of 
L.F. Rothschild, Dumphy met with officials in corrections and in the office of 
then-Treasurer Jesse M. Unruh, now deceased, regarding the financing method. 
One Rothschild partner was Grover McKean, formerly a top aide to Unruh. 
</P>
<P>
 Unruh awarded the first four lease revenue prison bond deals, amounting to 
almost $1 billion, to Rothschild. The firm, like many involved in such deals, 
was a major campaign donor to Unruh. 
</P>
<P>
 Investment bankers say their profit margins are slim. Although the amount is 
difficult to determine, the treasurer's records show that Rothschild's discount 
on the four prison bond deals was $19.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 From that sum, Rothschild paid various consultants, including its lawyers. For 
deals in August, 1986, and February, 1987, to finance Corcoran and Pelican Bay 
state prisons, Rothschild hired the law firm of Finley, Kumble of New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Finley, Kumble was a high-flying and high-powered firm that made splashes by 
hiring former governors and senators. In March, 1987, Rodney Blonien left his 
position as undersecretary of the Youth and Adult Correctional Agency, where he 
was in charge of prison construction, and went to work for Finley, Kumble in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Blonien said Unruh introduced him to Finley, Kumble partners, and urged him to 
join the firm. "Jess took a liking to me," Blonien said. "He told me he would 
be helpful to me if I went into private practice, and went into bond business." 
</P>
<P>
 McKean said Finley, Kumble's work was solid. The law firm might have gotten 
more bond work, but it broke up in late 1987 amid litigation among its partners 
and lawsuits by clients. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the job of underwriting prison bonds has been spread among 
several investment houses. In a 1990 deal, an investment house that employed 
former Orange County Assemblyman Richard Robinson, who left the Legislature in 
1986, won the contract to be lead underwriter.

THE PRICE OF PUNISHMENT; PAYING A HIGH PRICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This chart shows the growth in annual budgets of the California Department of 
Corrections since 1943. By the Numbers 
</P>
<P>
 During the past decade, the prisons budget grew from less than $730 million to 
more than $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 A decade ago, California allocated less than 3% of its general fund budget to 
prisons. This year, the state will allot more than 7.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past 10 years, the number of inmates increased by 90,000, the number of 
prison employees rose by 22,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The state estimates it will need 25 more prisons by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Each prison costs roughly $200 million to build, for a total of $5 billion in 
construction costs, plus interest. 
</P>
<P>
 By the turn of the century, the prison system will cost $645 million more in 
annual and recurring costs to operate than it does now. 
</P>
<P>
 Note: California did two-year budgets in the 1940s 
</P>

 1943-1945: $5.4 million*

SMALL INVESTMENT PAYS OFF BIG FOR CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN MORAIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It began with a $15,000 investment in a small niche in the building trade -- 
prison construction. A dozen years later, that investment has returned $73 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 The investor was Kitchell Inc., a privately held firm in Phoenix, on behalf of 
its subsidiary, Kitchell Capital Expenditures Management. Kitchell won the 
contract to serve as program manager of California's new prison construction 
program in July, 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 In the years since, no contractor has forged a closer relationship with the 
Department of Corrections. Although other contractors have been paid more, 
Kitchell's contract has been lucrative. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1982, Kitchell's contract has been amended and extended 35 times. Prison 
officials say payments to Kitchell this year will be $9.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a significant project. That's an understatement," said George Denk, 
president of Kitchell CEM. "When the project started, I don't think anyone 
really anticipated the growth." 
</P>
<P>
 Kitchell assigns 72 employees to its Sacramento office. Those employees write 
yearly updates to the department's five-year master plan for prison 
construction. They also oversee design and construction work by other 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Denk said Kitchell's innovations have saved the state millions of dollars and 
have helped ensure that construction is done on time. "We have to prove 
ourselves every day," Denk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitchell works from a leased office building six blocks from the Capitol, 
three floors above the Corrections Department's planning and construction 
division. The proximity "has allowed us to create an unusually close and strong 
working relationship," the firm says in its promotional material. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitchell has used its prison design experience to win jobs building jails in 
Los Angeles and Orange counties, and prisons in other states. Last year, 
Hochtief of Germany, one of the 30 largest construction firms in the world, 
purchased a 35% stake in Kitchell. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitchell started its work with the Department of Corrections as a sort of 
junior partner to Paul Rosser, an Atlanta engineer who specialized in prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Rosser said he invited Kitchell into the project. Each put up 
$15,000, documents show. 
</P>
<P>
 They were hired in July, 1982, in the final days of Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) 
Brown's tenure, and Rosser began designing small prisons, housing about 500 
inmates, with ample space for inmate programs and education. As he envisioned 
it, guards would not carry guns. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in 1983, Gov. George Deukmejian took office. To cut costs, his aides 
designed larger prisons with less program space. Correctional officers would 
keep their guns. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosser was concerned that the prisons might not meet Supreme Court standards, 
and by 1984, he cut his ties to the program. Kitchell remained. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been a rather tragic series of events," Rosser said. "The decisions 
that were made were absolutely counter to the practices of what was accepted as 
the norms. California went in one direction. The rest of the country went in 
another direction." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Deukmejian years, Kitchell was a target of criticism. "As CDC expanded 
its staff and acquired expertise," said an internal memo from the state 
controller's office, "the role Kitchell played was to diminish. To date, CDC 
has increased its planning and construction staff from roughly 15 to 200, but 
the Kitchell contract has not declined." 
</P>
<P>
 However, an auditor general's report found no major irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Corrections put the program manager contract out for bid in 
1989. Kitchell won the contract out of a field of three firms. G. Kevin 
Carruth, head of the department's planning and construction division, said he 
intends to put the contract out to bid again in the coming years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not a good strategy to change often," Carruth said.

THE PRICE OF PUNISHMENT; A PRISON EXPLOSION

<TEXT>

 In the past decade, California has built and opened 16 prisons and several 
minimum security camps, and made major renovations and additions to the 12 
prisons which existed when the state embarked on the nation's most expensive 
prison construction program. Four other prisons are being built and 
construction is scheduled to begin shortly on two others. Here is a look at the

ULYSSES GRANT HEIRS ISSUE UNCONDITIONAL DEMAND: FIX TOMB 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The descendants of President Ulysses S. Grant threatened Saturday to move the 
bodies of the Civil War hero and his wife out of Grant's Tomb unless the 
blighted site gets a multimillion-dollar renovation. 
</P>
<P>
 The family, represented by the President's great-great-grandson, Ulysses Grant 
Dietz, delivered the same message to the National Park Service at a meeting 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The tomb, on Manhattan's Upper West Side, has become a magnet for the 
homeless, graffiti and drug use in recent years. Although federal officials 
announced a plan to spend $375,000 on the site this year, the Grant family was 
not appeased. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government is basically throwing nickels and dimes at the site," Dietz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was in the Park Service's offices Saturday to comment. Interior 
Secretary Bruce Babbitt had said earlier that the site could use up to $10 
million in renovations.

DENVER TEACHERS TENTATIVELY AGREE TO END FIVE-DAY STRIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Public school teachers tentatively ended their five-day strike over salaries 
early Saturday, agreeing on a proposal crafted during an all-night bargaining 
session. 
</P>
<P>
 The teachers were scheduled to vote Saturday night on the deal.Details were 
not released. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Roy Romer, who headed off a teachers walkout threat in 1990, took over 
mediation on Wednesday after a judge ruled the teachers had a right to strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me say that this will mean the children will be back in school Tuesday 
morning," Romer said in a news conference just before dawn. 
</P>
<P>
 No classes were scheduled for Monday, a teacher-planning day. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard Fox, president of the Denver Classroom Teachers Assn., said the 
agreement "set the groundwork" for resolving troubles that led to Denver's 
first teacher strike since 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the children of the Denver public schools have won," said school 
board President Tom Mauro. "I think we have a strong agreement for many years 
and hopefully we will never have to experience one of these again." 
</P>
<P>
 About 2,200 teachers went on strike Monday, demanding salary increases, 
improvements in working conditions and representation on committees that decide 
curriculum and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials had tried to keep the city's 107 schools open, using 1,200 
substitute teachers and 1,500 teachers who crossed picket lines.

CLINTONS MIX FAMILY TIES, PARTY POLITICS; CAMPAIGN: PRESIDENT, FIRST LADY SPEAK 
AT SPARSELY ATTENDED RALLY FOR BROTHER-IN-LAW HUGH RODHAM, A LONG-SHOT U.S. 
SENATE HOPEFUL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The voters have been ignoring one of them. A lot of Democratic candidates have 
been shunning the other. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hugh Rodham and Bill Clinton found mutual support in each other's company 
Saturday as the President made his first and perhaps only campaign appearance 
for the fast-fading U.S. Senate campaign of his brother-in-law. With Rodham's 
sister, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, beaming at his side, Clinton called 
the first-time candidate a "good man" at a fund-raiser that sold $10 tickets to 
about 200 Miamians. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want somebody who will say yes to your future, no to going back . . . 
you vote for him," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd wasn't nearly enough to fill the seats at a rented hall, even though 
the gathering included a few flag-waving Haitians and several busloads of 
elderly Democratic volunteers who had been brought in from more than an hour's 
drive away. Hillary Rodham Clinton admitted at the outset that the fight 
against Sen. Connie Mack is "an uphill battle." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet for all that, the 45-minute appearance has been the biggest event to date 
in the former public defender's campaign. An Oct. 1 poll showed him trailing 
Mack 20% to 65%. The Rodham campaign has been plagued by staff departures and 
fund-raising problems, and it has yet to broadcast a TV ad in a state where 
they are a necessity. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodham has so far amassed about $450,000, including $2,000 recently 
contributed by the Clintons, compared with the $2.5 million in Mack's coffers. 
Saturday's fund-raiser and $1,000-a-plate dinner added $52,000. 
</P>
<P>
 While some top Democrats have praised the 44-year-old Rodham for taking on a 
race no stronger candidate would brave, many of them are lined up with Mack, 
the one-term former banker. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Joffee, director of the nonpartisan Mason-Dixon Florida Poll, struggles 
to stifle laughter when he tries to describe the race. "If Bill Clinton thinks 
he had a hard time with health care, he ain't seen nothing yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodham beat a primary rival earlier this month, but even this victory seemed 
only a minor accomplishment. His opponent was a disc jockey known for his views 
that the government was covering up visits by extraterrestrials. 
</P>
<P>
 Political professionals in Florida point out that the race puts the Clintons 
in an uncomfortable position: They'll be embarrassed by too close an 
association with the race, yet, since Rodham is kin, they can't entirely avoid 
him without provoking criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodham acknowledged that the Clintons had tried to talk him out of the 
long-shot undertaking. But the White House is now all for him, says an aide. 
"This is about the President and First Lady being supportive of their family." 
</P>
<P>
 Campaigning earlier Saturday in Connecticut, Clinton accused Republicans in 
Congress of returning to Nixonian "enemies list" politics and blocking lobbying 
reform to curry favor with powerful Washington interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton was referring to a controversial private meeting last week in which 
Republican House Whip Newt Gingrich told lobbyists they should contribute to 
Republicans in gratitude for the GOP's block of a lobby-reform bill. He also 
referred to Gingrich's assertion that if the Republicans regain the House, they 
will form a committee to look into alleged Administration corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll give you trickle-down economics and abuse-of-power politics," Clinton 
told an enthusiastic Democratic fund-raiser.

CLINTONS LINK GOP TO SPECIAL INTERESTS; CAMPAIGN: PRESIDENT AND FIRST LADY GO 
ON ATTACK AT RALLIES. THEY ACCUSE REPUBLICANS OF BLOCKING LOBBYIST REFORM, THEN 
SEEKING THEIR MONEY.

<P>
 President Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton turned a Saturday 
campaign blitz into a family affair, delivering a one-two punch in which they 
accused Republicans of blocking reforms to curry favor with special interests. 
</P>
<P>
 As the tone of the fall campaign sharpens, Clinton said Republican 
congressional leaders had pledged to lobbyists: "We killed campaign finance 
reform for you. We killed lobby reform for you. We share your values. So you 
give us money and don't you give the Democrats money, or else." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton told an enthusiastic airport rally that Republicans, if they take over 
Congress, "are going to gang up with the Washington lobbyists whose values they 
share and run this country any way they please." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Clinton's first direct swipe at a controversial meeting that House 
Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) and other GOP congressional leaders held 
last week with lobbyists, GOP activists and corporate officials. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a memo by a participant at the meeting, obtained by the 
Associated Press, Gingrich said they should promote giving to GOP candidates to 
"get even with the Clinton tax increase" and because the party would save them 
money through favorable legislation if it takes over Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich said lobbyists should give to Republicans out of gratitude that the 
party had killed a bill that would have required them to register and report 
their activities more fully. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democrats are trying to turn the Republicans' "contract with America" 
platform against them by tarring it as a return to the huge deficits and 
trickle-down economics of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillary Clinton echoed the theme, saying the elections would determine: "Do we 
keep going forward, do we keep solving problems or do we stop and go backward?" 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also predicted Republicans would "give you the politics of the enemies 
lists of the 1970s," alluding to a Gingrich proposal to establish a special 
committee to probe corruption in the Clinton Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons' stop in Connecticut included two fund-raisers expected to raise 
$300,000 for the gubernatorial campaign of Democrat William Curry Jr., who is 
trailing Republican John G. Rowland. 
</P>
<P>
 A Time magazine-CNN poll released Saturday showed why some Democratic 
candidates would rather steer clear of Clinton. Only 44% of respondents said 
they approve of the way Clinton is handling his job, while 47% said they 
disapprove. 
</P>
<P>
 However, that indicated a slight improvement from Sept. 21-22, when the same 
poll put Clinton's disapproval rating at 53%.

 Boeing Co. is advising airlines that a mechanism used to make a plane go up or 
down should be replaced in several models of the Boeing 737 because of reports 
of malfunction. A Boeing alert service bulletin sent from Seattle to all 
airlines says that five carriers reported that the horizontal stabilizer, the 
small wing at the rear of the plane, rotated farther than the pilot commanded. 
A company spokesman said none of the malfunctions occurred in flight, nor is 
the problem believed to have contributed to any crash.

BUSH WANTED QUAYLE OFF '92 TICKET BUT REFUSED TO PUSH HIM, BOOK SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 George Bush concluded that Dan Quayle was hurting his bid to be reelected 
President but refused to force him off the ticket, according to a new book 
excerpted in Newsweek. 
</P>
<P>
 The book, "Quest for the Presidency 1992," includes quotes from unidentified 
sources who discuss what Bush said and thought during the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quayle had become the mouthpiece for the party's farther right," Bush 
thought, and pressure was heavy to push him out, according to excerpts in the 
Oct. 24 issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Two top campaign officials, Robert M. Teeter and Frederic V. Malek, were 
behind the dump-Quayle campaign, and even former Presidents Gerald R. Ford and 
Richard Nixon told Bush that Quayle should go, the book says. 
</P>
<P>
 "He hadn't objected in principle to the idea of doing Quayle in," an 
unidentified source said of Bush. "He didn't want his fingerprints on the 
weapon. . . . He could not bring himself to be more than a passive actor in the 
drama, hoping against hope that Quayle would jump without having to be pushed." 
</P>
<P>
 The book by Peter Goldman, Thomas DeFrank, Mark Miller, Andrew Murr and Tom 
Mathews will be published Nov. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Bush's strategists wondered about replacing Quayle with Gen. Colin Powell. 
</P>
<P>
 "He gave the strong impression that he would accept a place on the ticket if 
it were offered to him," the book says of Powell. 
</P>
<P>
 So why did he keep Quayle? If he forced Quayle out, he told aides, "I think 
the press would murder me."

 Police in Inverness, Fla., have upgraded the charges against a nurse accused 
of raping five patients while they were sedated.The charges against Bruce Alan 
Young were upgraded to rape of an incapacitated person using an intoxicating 
substance. The harsher charges each carry a penalty of 30 years in prison. The 
previous charges of rape carried a 15-year penalty. Young, 45, was arrested 
Oct. 3 after a nurse allegedly caught him having sex with a 15-year-old girl in

 Troopers relying on fingerprints taken in the 1940s said they have identified 
the skeletal remains of Joe Vogler, who vanished from his Fairbanks, Alaska, 
house 17 months ago.There was no word on how the 80-year-old politician died. 
In midweek, searchers using cadaver-sniffing dogs found his body in a 
three-foot grave in woods about 300 miles northeast of Anchorage. Vogler, a 
miner whose estate was valued at millions, came to Alaska nearly 50 years ago. 
He founded the Alaskan Independence Party and ran unsuccessfully for governor 
three times.

 The bodies of 29 Branch Davidians that remained unclaimed since April, 1993, 
when fire destroyed their compound in Waco, Tex., were given a pauper's 
burial.They had been stored in a freezer at the medical examiner's office in 
Ft. Worth since the end of the 51-day standoff between the cult and federal 
authorities last year. Cult leader David Koresh and about 80 followers died in 
the blaze that destroyed their compound April 19, 1993. The bodies of Koresh's 
wife, Rachel, and their two children were among those buried amid rain and 
drizzle at the Restland Cemetery in Waco.

 Because of an editing error it was implied that Africanized Honeybees have 
been detected in Imperial County.Their presence is suspected, however, since 
they have been noticed in Yuma, Ariz., only three miles from the California 
border. Africanized bees have "hitchhiked" to California several times, most 
recently in July on a freighter entering the L.A. harbor from Guatemala.

TRAVELING IN STYLE; FOLLOWING FAMOUS FOOTSTEPS

 Stretching through the Hanbury Gardens, a botanical preserve near the Italian 
town of Ventimiglia on the Ligurian coast, is a fragment of the Via Amelia -- 
an ancient Roman road. Now little more than a wide dirt pathway, it is marked 
with a sign that proclaims, "Here passed Pope Innocent IV, Pope Paul III, 
Emperor Charles V, Machiavelli, Catherine of Siena, Napoleon."Although I 
realize full well that the stones that line the road weren't laid by Romans, 
that the trees and shrubs that crowd its flanks are probably no more than a few 
generations old, that the dirt itself must date from modern times, still the 
road and sign evoke a momentary chill. 
</P>
<P>
 How many legendary souls have trudged or sauntered along this road? And does 
the earth still feel the footsteps of those who have trod it? Maybe not -- but 
when the illustrious have passed through a place, lingering or not, their 
luster can illuminate it for decades, and even centuries, to come. Ernest 
Hemingway all but defines Key West and pre-Castro Cuba for us; once we see New 
York's gritty corners through Edward Hopper's eyes, the whole city starts to 
look Hopper-esque; Charles Darwin's ghost guides every traveler in the 
Galapagos Islands, in one way or another; Thomas Jefferson gives us entree into 
the capital of France when we discover that even he, our nation's first 
Renaissance man, was just another American in Paris at heart. With a bit of 
imagination, we can recognize traces of the troubled Roman Emperor Tiberius 
amid the charm and beauty of Capri and Sperlonga -- and, perhaps just barely, 
make out the faint strains of a Noel Coward tune wafting past Ian Fleming's 
house in Jamaica, where now the reggae roams. Famous footsteps sometimes take 
unexpected turns. Colman Andrews

 Bram Stoker's famous vampire, Dracula, was based on a real person, the 
metaphorically bloodthirsty Transylvanian ruler named Vlad Dracula, or Vlad 
Tepes ("the Impaler"). Dracula hailed from Sighisoara, a picturesque medieval 
hamlet about 140 miles northwest of Bucharest in what is now Romania, and the 
quaint two-story house in which he lived has been turned into an eatery called 
Restaurantul Berarie.The food is traditional Romanian: local carp 
(disconcertingly called "crap" in the local language) fried with vegetables, 
hearty soups, grilled beef sausages -- and the decor is appropriately medieval 
and largely dragon-themed, since Dracul means dragon. For a nightcap after 
dinner, the bar serves Dracula Vodka -- dyed blood-red. Restaurantul Berarie, 
Piata Muzeului 5, Sighisoara, Romania; local telephone 71-596. Dinner for two, 
including wine, about $5. Mark Ehrman

 Whether following in famous footsteps or wandering aimlessly about, feet can 
give out before the urge to sightsee does. Here are some tips to prevent (or at 
least delay) podiatric problems: 
</P>
<P>
 * Pack the right shoes and socks."Take along at least one good pair of walking 
shoes that are comfortably broken in," says Suzanne Felson, a podiatrist in Los 
Alamitos and Seal Beach. Athletic shoes are a great choice. Sandals can be OK, 
too, if they are not flimsy, says Franklin Kase, a Burbank podiatrist and 
secretary of the Los Angeles County Podiatric Medical Society. "Wear sandals 
with a strap around the heel," he advises. "Pick acrylic-blend socks with 
fibers that wick away moisture," Felson adds. Cushioned insoles, available 
over-the-counter, can also keep you mobile longer. 
</P>
<P>
 * Assemble a podiatric first-aid kit. Include moleskin, bandages, antiseptic 
cream, baby powder or cornstarch, a sterile lancet, an antifungal cream (if 
prone to athlete's foot) and a good moisturizer. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pamper your feet en route. While flying, elevate your feet, if possible, to 
minimize swelling. "Every hour, get up and walk the aisles," Kase advises. He 
adds that it's fine to slip your shoes off -- as long as you elevate your feet 
and wiggle your toes around several times an hour to keep the circulation 
going. 
</P>
<P>
 * Learn podiatric first aid. If feet or lower limbs become sore, ice the area 
immediately, Kase says. Use an ice pack for 15 or 20 minutes every hour. 
(Travelers with diabetes or other health problems should seek their doctor's 
advice.) If a blister is bothersome, use a sterile lancet to make a 
quarter-inch incision, Kase says. "Drain the fluid and clean the area with soap 
and water. Apply an antiseptic ointment and bandage." Kathleen Doheny

 If Woodstock II made you nostalgic for the '60s (whether or not you were 
around for them), check out Rachel Heller's Flower Power walking tour of San 
Francisco's Haight-Ashbury district, birthplace of an era. The two-hour tour 
progresses down Haight, Page and Waller streets, with stops at the Grateful 
Dead's onetime crash pad (now a beautifully restored Victorian), Janis Joplin's 
house and the sites of the now-vanished Psychedelic Shop and Straight Theatre, 
where Bill Graham staged pre-Fillmore shows with the Dead, Jimi Hendrix and 
Jefferson Airplane.(The Fillmore Auditorium itself has recently reopened for 
concerts, but it is not included in the tour.) Heller adds pre-'60s sites as 
well, including the turn-of-the-century mansion built by San Francisco merchant 
prince Isaac Magnin. Tours begin Tuesdays and Thursdays at 9:30 a.m. and other 
times by appointment. Fee is $15 for adults and $13 for seniors, with discounts 
for groups. For reservations and more information, call (415) 221-8442. For 
Fillmore Auditorium show information, call (415) 346-6000. Anna Scotti

 Even the famous have to rest their feet sometimes. Five Times correspondents 
from around the world reveal the favorite rest-stops, loitering places and 
relaxing haunts of celebrities of an earlier time. ZAGORSKI'S RATHSKELLER, 
Chicago 
</P>
<P>
 To Nelson Algren, author of "A Walk on the Wild Side" and "The Man with the 
Golden Arm," Chicago was "the city on the make." From the 1930s through the 
1960s, he trapped in gritty prose its petty thieves, addicts, whores and 
gamblers. Nearly all of his characters were barflies, too, swilling Old Fitz or 
dime beers to fuel their adventures and ease their inevitable encounters with 
cruel cops and judges. They frequented joints like the real-life Zagorski's 
Rathskeller, owned by the lively -- and, local lore has it, possibly male -- 
Lottie Zagorski. Algren was a regular here, and everything that could happen in 
a tavern did: basement stripteases, betting on horses, all-night poker and 
(this is Chicago, after all) payoffs out the side door to the sergeant's 
"pension fund." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Zagorski's is known as Lottie's Pub, in tribute to its founder. 
The Bucktown neighborhood is a mix of Polish old-timers, Latino immigrants, 
artists and the first wave of a yuppie invasion advancing west from the 
lakefront. The original mahogany bar accommodates them all. A photo of Lottie, 
in a floral print dress with one meaty fist clenched, hangs above the juke, as 
Algren called it. Coins can summon music by Van Morrison, Billie Holiday, Barry 
White and Mr. Blotto. Excellent burgers are served, along with trendy beers 
like Samuel Adams and Bass Ale. There is no nod at all to Algren. "Who?" asked 
the bartender.

 Even the famous have to rest their feet sometimes. Five Times correspondents 
from around the world reveal the favorite rest-stops, loitering places and 
relaxing haunts of celebrities of an earlier time. THE ORIENTAL HOTEL, Bangkok 
</P>
<P>
 British novelist and playwright W. Somerset Maugham ("Of Human Bondage," "The 
Moon & Sixpence," "The Razor's Edge") first visited Bangkok in 1923, making his 
way overland from Burma, then the jewel in the crown of Britain's Asian 
colonies. Like many travelers in those days, "Willie" Maugham and his lifelong 
companion, Frederick Haxton, stayed at the Oriental, a small hostelry on the 
Chao Phraya River that had opened in 1876. Maugham kept coming back and 
celebrated his 85th birthday there in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 "Towards the evening a flight of egrets flew down the river, flying low and 
scattered," Maugham once wrote of the his view from the terrace. "They were 
like a ripple of white notes, sweet and pure and springlike, which an unseen 
hand drew forth, like a divine arpeggio from an unseen harp." 
</P>
<P>
 The river is still there and so is the Oriental, but Bangkok is now a city of 
towering skyscrapers and mind-blowing traffic jams. Nevertheless, the hotel's 
old wing, with just four suites (one of them named after Maugham) and four 
smaller rooms, looks much the same as it did in the author's day. The rooms 
feature four-poster beds, Tiffany lamps and Persian carpets. Instead of harp 
arpeggios, though, visitors today are likely to hear the chain-saw sound of 
river taxis revving up their truck engines as they speed up and down the 
waterway. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oriental makes an effort to preserve memorabilia of Maugham and other 
noted writers who stayed here (Joseph Conrad was another), but the clientele 
today is more likely to be heads of state and rock stars. This was, for 
instance, Michael Jackson's hotel of choice during last year's ill-fated tour.

 Even the famous have to rest their feet sometimes. Five Times correspondents 
from around the world reveal the favorite rest-stops, loitering places and 
relaxing haunts of celebrities of an earlier time. BUCKHORN EXCHANGE, Denver 
</P>
<P>
 From the overstuffed Victorian chairs and settees of Denver's Buckhorn 
Exchange saloon, it's easy to imagine late owner and hunting guide Henry H. 
"Shorty Scout" Zietz blustering in, lugging a six-point buck elk with his pal 
President Theodore Roosevelt. After days of reconnoitering the Rocky Mountains 
for big game, Zietz and Roosevelt, who visited on several occasions between 
1903 and 1905, would return to this working-class bar and dining emporium to 
hoist a few and feast on the wild game that has made the Buckhorn famous for 
most of its 101 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Every nook and cranny of this two-story frontiersman establishment is covered 
with trophies of days gone by. There are moose, geese, badger, wolverine, 
antelope, bear, buffalo, even a granddaddy rattlesnake and a two-headed calf. 
Sprinkled among them are examples of the kinds of guns that brought them down 
-- from flintlock rifles to Winchesters to Civil War-era smooth bores. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buckhorn may not have been the first saloon in this high plains territory, 
but it bears the distinction of being granted the first liquor license in 
Colorado after the repeal of Prohibition. Started by Zietz in 1893, the 
watering hole was renovated in 1978 by new owners, who shampooed the stuffed 
animals and re-blackened their noses. Much remains as it was when Roosevelt and 
such other famous guests as J. Edgar Hoover, Will Rogers and Dwight D. 
Eisenhower stepped in to drink up the Old West atmosphere and sample menu 
specialities such as steak, elk, pheasant, buffalo prime rib and sliced Rocky 
Mountain oysters with horseradish dipping sauce. In step with tradition, the 
bar crowd is entertained by house musician Roz Brown, who strums an autoharp 
and croons old favorites such as "When My Blue Moon Turns to Gold" and, of 
course, "Springtime in the Rockies."

 Even the famous have to rest their feet sometimes. Five Times correspondents 
from around the world reveal the favorite rest-stops, loitering places and 
relaxing haunts of celebrities of an earlier time. HOTEL IMPERIAL, New Delhi 
</P>
<P>
 To cross the threshold of the Hotel Imperial in the 1940s, wrote the late 
British journalist and author James Cameron, was to get a "crash-course in 
Indian affairs." The place, he said, "(w)as full to the doors with a 
fluctuating tide of politicians, princes, newspapermen, idealists, cynics, 
black marketeers, beards, turbans, uniforms, sweat, Australian whisky and 
obsessed fanatics of all persuasions." 
</P>
<P>
 New Delhi's Imperial Hotel opened in 1935. The British viceroy in India, Lord 
Willingdon, had encouraged its construction. In a delicious irony of history, 
though, this posh hostelry -- today an opulent assemblage of 230 guest rooms 
set on eight green acres in the city's heart -- became both drawing room and 
social center for the movement that brought India freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 India's moody and brilliant Jawaharlal Nehru and his Congress Party colleagues 
held innumerable caucuses and strategy sessions here, sometimes in the huge 
chandelier-lighted and mirrored ballroom. On other occasions, they adjourned to 
individual suites with 14-foot-high ceilings or to the white-trellised veranda. 
Later, as independent India's prime minister, Nehru frequently dropped by for 
official receptions. He drank only fresh fruit juice and water -- as a strict 
vegetarian and teetotaler Nehru wouldn't touch the hotel's famous baked Alaska 
because it contained eggs and brandy.  
</P>
<P>
 In yet another irony, the Imperial also played a part in the formation of 
another nation. As the Congress haggled and planned for India's future, a 
consumptively thin and dapper Muslim lawyer, Mohammed Ali Jinnah, strolled in 
and out of the Imperial, dreaming about the creation of Pakistan. One meeting 
held by Jinnah's Muslim League in the hotel ballroom erupted in fisticuffs when 
hostile Muslims who wanted to remain part of India brushed by police guards and 
crashed the event. But Jinnah got the country he wanted anyway.  
</P>
<P>
 Today only 5% to 10% of the hotel's guests are Indians. Europeans predominate, 
including plenty of descendants of the old colonial masters. What lures Britons 
to the Imperial is the Raj-era flavor that has been carefully preserved in the 
old wing. Take the narrow six-passenger elevator, said to be Delhi's oldest, up 
to the rooms, and you may feel as if you've been whisked back to the twilight 
of the British Empire. The lofty-ceilinged rooms, each with two narrow single 
beds, have whirring ceiling fans, wooden writing desks and wardrobes and Mogul 
prints decorating the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 The Imperial has added a new wing but, realizing that its history gives the 
building a character no other Delhi hotel can match, room rates have been 
revised so that guests pay more to stay in the old wing, along with the ghosts 
of Nehru and Jinnah.

 Even the famous have to rest their feet sometimes. Five Times correspondents

relaxing haunts of celebrities of an earlier time. RUBENS' ANTWERP, Belgium 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who has spent a few hours in the house in central Antwerp where the 
great Flemish painter-diplomat Peter Paul Rubens (1577-1640) lived and created 
his most famous works, can attest that he lived well. From the Italian 
Renaissance-style central courtyard that connects his grand residence to his 
studio, to the private, marble-floored art gallery filled with ancient Roman 
statues, there are monuments everywhere to Rubens' status as a man of wealth 
and reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 But he had a daily relaxation routine that had little to do with money.  
</P>
<P>
 Every afternoon, between the finish of his workday and dinner time, Rubens 
would go -- usually on horseback -- for a ride along the city's outer walls. 
"It was all free, open countryside when he lived," notes Lief Orlent, an 
Antwerp tourist guide who is a recognized Rubens specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubens' itinerary took him along the Wapper -- once an open canal but now a 
rectangular plaza full of outdoor cafes and fountains -- and then along the 
Meir, a broad avenue leading to one of the city's gates. In Rubens' time, many 
of the buildings along the Meir were empty, their Roman Catholic residents 
having fled attacks by Dutch Protestants. Today, the Meir is one of Belgium's 
preferred shopping streets. (In the Belgian version of Monopoly, the Meir 
stands in for Park Place.) 
</P>
<P>
 The line of the old Antwerp city wall is now a large thoroughfare called the 
Frankrijklei, lined with rows of sycamore trees that shade outlets for Laura 
Ashley, American Express and Chanel. Half a mile south, Frankrijklei runs into 
a street called Blauwtoren. On Sundays, the Blauwtoren is the start of an 
amazing and crowded street market that offers everything from corsets to live 
African mice. The market, which extends virtually back to Rubens' front door, 
probably lures more people in a day than the artist saw in months of rides.

 IT'S NOT MY FAULT, THE ROMAN EMPEROR TIBERIUS (42 BC-37 AD) must have said to 
himself when he began to commit some of his more spectacular atrocities toward 
the end of his reign. It's hard to grow up the son of a ruthless, ambitious 
mother, Livia, and stepson of a celebrated tyrant, the one and only Augustus. 
What's a poor heir to do, if driven nearly mad by their schemes and 
maneuverings? 
</P>
<P>
 Tiberius Claudius Nero Caesar, to give his full name, tried to get away from 
them. At the age of 36, he fled to the Greek island of Rhodes, where he lived 
for seven years and cultivated his artistic side. He had been a brilliant 
soldier and fought a number of successful campaigns to enlarge and consolidate 
Rome's growing empire, but what he really wanted to do was hang around with 
poets, artists and philosophers. 
</P>
<P>
 When Augustus summoned him back to Rome in 4 AD, though, and named him his 
official heir, Tiberius had no choice but to obey, and in 14 AD, upon Augustus' 
death, he became the empire's second autocratic ruler. Livia -- who, it was 
rumored, had poisoned most of her son's rivals and perhaps even his stepfather 
-- was delighted. Not so Tiberius. He spent most of the early years of his 
reign trying to persuade a reluctant Senate to reassume its legislative powers 
and restore some semblance of the vanished Republic. No one was up to the task, 
so Tiberius, forced to become a despot, became increasingly morose and 
embittered -- the misanthropic figure of popular history. 
</P>
<P>
 He fled south toward the island of Capri, in the Bay of Naples, where he spent 
most of the last 10 years of his life, indulging himself in the lubricious 
pursuits and cruelties recorded by ancient historians. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiberius wasn't the first Roman to head south toward Capri for refuge, but he 
did it more often than anybody else. The Romans were great road builders, of 
course, and by the beginning of Tiberius' reign had established a number of 
places along the coast toward Naples for rich patrician families and retired 
soldiers to vacation. The main artery south was the Via Appia, which wound 
through the Alban Hills toward the coast to Terracina, an ancient Spartan and 
Etruscan city that was then an important port. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Terracina is an agricultural and fishing center of about 40,000 people 
-- bustling, but with a characteristically laid-back southern atmosphere. The 
side streets off the main avenues are tight and shadowed; the houses all have 
small, railed balconies and tall, shuttered windows behind which the 
inhabitants take refuge from the midday heat in summer. The harbor itself, with 
its rows of brightly colored fishing boats of all shapes and sizes, never seems 
frantically busy -- and in summer, along the esplanade behind the public 
beaches, strollers walk arm in arm past hordes of sunbathers and swimmers. Much 
remains today to remind visitors of the town's classical and medieval past, 
including its most impressive relic, the Temple of Jupiter Anxur on the crest 
of rocky Mount St. Angelo, a summit that provides spectacular views over city 
and sea. 
</P>
<P>
 FROM TERRACINA, THE VIA APPIA THRUSTS INLAND TOWARD FONDI AND ITRI, bypassing 
the coast until it links up with it again at Formia, about 24 miles to the 
south. In Tiberius' time, there was a main artery along the sea named the Via 
Flacca (after the Roman official Lucius Valerius Flaccus, who built it in 184 
BC). Traces of this road are still visible. It was about 12 feet wide and 
skirted the coastline past the ancient fishing village of Sperlonga and around 
the slopes of the Aurunci Mountains that here descend to the Mediterranean. 
Tiberius himself, of course, never had to do much walking. He traveled by 
trireme along the coast, while the accompanying legions and supply wagons 
marched overland. 
</P>
<P>
 Sperlonga marked the halfway point between Rome and the Bay of Naples. It was 
also home territory for Tiberius. His family on his mother's side were large 
landowners, and they owned villas in the area. The main one, where Tiberius 
always spent some time, was by the beach to the south, below the village. His 
visits were looked forward to both by the locals, because of the prosperity 
they brought to the area, and his soldiers, who were fond of the local white 
wine. 
</P>
<P>
 After the fall of the Roman Empire, for more than 1,000 years, this strip of 
coastal land around Sperlonga was almost entirely cut off from the rest of the 
country. It could only be approached from the sea or by a narrow road, little 
more than a footpath, from Fondi. 
</P>
<P>
 The rediscovery of the region began during the building of a new highway along 
the coast in 1958. Property prices soon began to soar. Outsiders were charmed 
by the sight of Sperlonga -- then little more than a cluster of stone houses, 
stained an off-white by centuries of wind, sun and rain, perched on a rock 
thrust out into the sea above an unspoiled shoreline. Today, Sperlonga has 
become a major tourist resort, with villas, hotels and pensioni sprawled along 
the beach. Newcomers, many of them from Rome, 
</P>
<P>
 have snapped up and remodeled dwellings in the old town itself and to the 
south, where the area is protected from exploitation by Rome's Department of 
Antiquities.  
</P>
<P>
 IN THE SUMMER MONTHS, WHEN ALL OF EUROPE SEEMS TO EMPTY ITSELF out onto one 
piece of seashore or another, the beach here all but vanishes under long 
parallel rows of colored umbrellas and tanned bodies. Nevertheless, the aura of 
old Sperlonga, with its sense of a living past, remains strong. 
</P>
<P>
 This is largely because of the discoveries made below the town during the 
construction of the road. The engineer in charge was a devoted amateur 
archeologist named Erno Bellante, who took it upon himself to begin digging 
unofficially in and around a large cave at the southern end of the mile-long 
beach. The cave was known as the Grotto of Tiberius, and a late 19th-Century 
print shows people walking about in the cave, with Sperlonga visible in the 
background. Bellante knew that earlier archeological discoveries had been made 
in the area -- a bearded stone head of Dionysius, for one -- and he suspected 
that the grotto would quickly yield more treasures. 
</P>
<P>
 He was right. Among his early finds were the thigh, leg and foot of a gigantic 
statue, a beautiful stone head and about 500 other pieces, as well as a section 
of a pool that had once been in the cave. Since then, more than 15,000 relics 
have been uncovered -- and the digging continues. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruins of the villa where Tiberius used to stay can be visited, and a small 
museum has been built on the scene to display the archeological finds. Among 
these are groups of statues, partially restored, depicting mythical events from 
the life of Ulysses -- including the blinding of the giant Polyphemus; splendid 
heads of women and gods; Roman copies of ancient Greek statues and some rare 
Greek ceramics. A wing of the museum contains smaller artifacts, such as 
plates, vases, ornaments, oil lamps, animal sculptures and, most significantly, 
the skeletal head of a crocodile. The latter would seem to confirm the report 
by several historians that the emperor was not above tossing unfortunates to 
the beasts. 
</P>
<P>
 As Sperlonga began to flourish in the 1960s, after centuries of poverty, the 
entire area known as the South Pontine, from Sabaudia in the north to Minturno 
in the south, became an increasingly important resort area. Even in winter 
tourists will show up, guidebooks in hand, for a look at the region's better 
known attractions.  
</P>
<P>
 At Sabaudia, it's a series of four coastal lakes at the edge of a national 
park that also includes the ruins of an ancient Roman villa. At San Felice 
Circeo, a resort where wealthy Roman families have owned villas for 2,000 
years, there are dozens of caves along the rocky shoreline, one of them named 
after Circe, the mythical enchantress who is supposed to have lived in the 
area. At Gaeta, the main lure is a long, picturesque waterfront and a harbor 
full of fishing boats, freighters and warships. Formia, right next door, is a 
busy commercial hub, badly bombed during World War II, but still containing 
notable Roman ruins, including the tomb of Cicero. Minturno features some 
splendid Roman remains, including an amphitheater built by Augustus.  
</P>
<P>
 But it is Sperlonga that attracts the most visitors. They stroll along the 
maze of narrow streets and alleys, impassable to cars, or linger in the main 
piazza to gape at its ancient facades or stare out over the endless blue sea. 
The best days are in September and October, when the summer crowds are gone, 
the beaches are mostly empty and the water is still warm enough to swim in. My 
own fondest memories of the place, where my mother owned an exquisite little 
house for nearly 40 years, are of sitting on her terrace overlooking the 
coastline, or in the town piazza socializing with friends, sipping caffe latte 
or the still-delicious local wine. Then, too, there were the lazy hours on the 
beach, where we munched on fresh mozzarella di bufala and vine-ripened tomatoes 
in between dips. This was truly a way of life fit for an emperor. 
</P>
<P>
 TIBERIUS' FAVORITE SPOT, HOWEVER, REMAINED THE ISLE OF CAPRI, TO which he 
would sail directly from Sperlonga. His stepfather, Augustus, had been fond of 
the place, too, and spent time there -- but Tiberius moved in permanently. 
Between the two of them, the emperors built themselves a dozen sumptuous 
residences on the small island, though the remains of only three survive. The 
best preserved is the Villa Jovis at the very tip of the eastern end, high 
above the town. It can be reached by a road that meanders up among olive 
groves, vineyards and whitewashed houses, with breath-taking views in all 
directions. Just past the entrance gate, with its cylindrical guard tower, is 
the Salto di Tiberio, or Tiberius' Leap, a vantage point at the edge of a cliff 
from which the emperor would arrange to have the people who displeased him 
hurled to their deaths on the rocks below. 
</P>
<P>
 The villa itself, built around four huge cisterns to catch and store 
rainwater, sprawls over 20,000 square feet, but must have been much larger in 
imperial times. It was a perfect refuge for a corrupt, misanthropic old man 
suspicious and fearful of everyone and addicted to the perverse pleasures of 
the flesh. 
</P>
<P>
 Capri, in fact, has always had a reputation for naughty goings-on. In 1917, 
the English writer Norman Douglas wrote "South Wind," a popular novel based on 
the local cavortings of the expatriates who had, like Tiberius, taken refuge 
there to indulge their eccentricities. A decade later, a Swedish doctor named 
Axel Munthe wrote "The Story of San Michele," named for his residence at 
Anacapri, on the western side of the island, recounting many odd and often 
lurid tales of the island's past and present. The social center of the island 
is the Piazza Umberto, where friends meet in the morning to sip espresso at the 
open-air cafes and plan the day's activities. The beaches are pebbly, but the 
swimming everywhere is superb, and various secluded spots can be easily reached 
by boat. By midafternoon the night's activities have been set, and when evening 
comes, excursions are made in groups to favorite restaurants and nightclubs, 
where the dancing goes on till dawn. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who prefer a quieter time, the island provides spectacular natural 
sites, especially its famous shoreline caves, named mostly for the colors of 
the water in them. The Grotta Azzurra, or Blue Grotto, is justly celebrated. 
It's well over 100 yards long, 30 yards high and 15 yards wide, illuminated 
from an underwater passage below so that the walls reflect in daylight the 
azure tints of the sea. The best months to visit such wonders (or to visit the 
island at all) are spring and fall, when the masses of summer vacationers are 
absent.  
</P>
<P>
 AT THE END OF HIS LIFE, Tiberius made one last attempt to see Rome. He 
traveled as far as the walls of the capital, but then refused at the last 
moment to enter the city and -- ignoring his doctor's orders -- started back to 
Capri. Along the way, he stopped at various places along the coast, but was 
prevented by high seas from reaching the island itself. He settled instead into 
a villa at San Felice Circeo that had belonged to Lucullus, a noted patrician 
bon vivant who gave tremendous parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiberius wouldn't admit that he was sick, but he was clearly dying. 
Apparently, he wasn't doing so quite fast enough for his successor, Caligula, 
who reportedly helped him on his way either by smothering him in his bed or by 
cutting off his food and drink. When at last Tiberius expired, the imperial 
ring, with the seal he used to sign his terrible decrees, had to be forced from 
his grasp. GUIDEBOOK: After Tiberius

TRAVELING IN STYLE; PAPA WAS A ROLLING STONE; ERNEST HEMINGWAY ROAMED THE 
WORLD, BUT MADE HIMSELF AT HOME IN FOUR VERY DIFFERENT CORNERS OF NORTH AMERICA 
</P>

 ERNEST HEMINGWAY LIVED AN INTERESTING LIFE. WRITING, he said, is alchemy, a 
blend of observation, experience, travel and imagination. From that, he made 
words into style. He stayed devoted to his craft throughout the whole journey 
-- and his sense of place was as sharp as an ice pick. 
</P>
<P>
 Hemingway is well-traveled territory himself, of course. Every secret that can 
be uncovered about him, every aspect of his life and work that can be 
interpreted, already has been. His trail is old, but it is not so cold as you 
might think. And following his footsteps has this reward: Hemingway favored the 
kinds of places that are easy to enjoy -- the dizzying dark waters of the Gulf 
Stream, the high blue sky of the Rockies, the boisterous corners of good 
saloons. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 UNDER THE STARS IN THE STEAMY AIR AT HEMINGWAY'S 95TH BIRTHDAY party, I dance 
the rumba with my wife on the old man's second-story veranda in Key West, Fla. 
The band plays on the lawn below and the weepy trees are draped with lights. 
Through the window we can see his toilet and the bed he shared with his second 
wife, Pauline, and the clay Picasso sculpture of a cat that is glued to his 
dresser -- and, off in back, the detached studio with the old Royal portable 
where he wrote sentences that even today have the artist's unmistakable brush 
strokes in them. 
</P>
<P>
 The rumba is my wife's idea. "Hemingway was a bastard," she'd said, "but he 
was a romantic, no? Dance with me." Frankly, I don't know that Hemingway ever 
danced. But I know when to say yes in the starlight. And I know how to rumba. 
</P>
<P>
 Hemingway arrived here, in the southernmost city in the continental United 
States, in April, 1928, on the advice of John Dos Passos "to dry out his 
bones." By the time he departed in December, 1939, he had left such an 
indelible mark that his haunts remain the biggest tourist attractions in the 
Florida Keys to this day. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors crowd Hemingway's former house at 907 Whitehead St., now a museum and 
home to about 54 descendants of his swarm of six-toed cats. His favorite 
saloon, Sloppy Joe's, is a rock 'n' roll bar with a Hemingway mural behind the 
stage and pictures of him on the wall. The saloon where wife No. 3, Martha 
Gellhorn, pursued him is now called Capt. Tony's. The marina where he docked 
his boat, the Pilar, still bristles with fishing boats. 
</P>
<P>
 Shopkeepers at local bookstores say they do at least 15% of their business in 
Hemingway publications. "People come down here for lots of reasons," says John 
Boisonault, proprietor of Key West Island Books, "and they seem to get wrapped 
up in Hemingway. Some people cannot name two of his books and end up paying 
$500 for a first edition. Others can tell you the most amazing trivia -- how 
many steps there were on the walkway up to his boyhood cabin at Walloon Lake in 
Michigan -- but they don't know the year Scott Fitzgerald died. One thing I can 
tell you, though: Hemingway sells more books now than when he was alive." 
</P>
<P>
 Once a year for the past 13 years, in the heat of July (when Hemingway himself 
always made sure to be somewhere else), a festival has been convened here in 
his memory. Though the event's organizers have tried to give the festival some 
trappings of seriousness, with writers workshops, storytelling performances and 
a first-novel contest, it remains mostly a campy week that gives Hemingway fans 
a terrific excuse to go on a bender and celebrate his birthday. One tour book 
describes the festival as "a ritual of alcohol indulgence." Indeed, Key West's 
beaches are lousy, its offshore reef is dying, the fishing is not what it used 
to be -- but the bars and Hemingway's memory endure in a boozy, fun-loving 
embrace. 
</P>
<P>
 This year at the festival, more than 80 men have entered the three-day 
Hemingway look-alike contest, and everywhere you turned in Key West you saw a 
burly chap with a pot gut and a silver beard, sly grin, khaki shorts and a 
long-billed fishing hat -- a good many ghosts with cold drinks in their hands. 
</P>
<P>
 If you insist, of course, you can always find someone to talk with, to argue 
the contradictions that make Hemingway so lastingly interesting: He glorified 
the kill, but wouldn't shoot an elephant because it was too majestic. He was a 
macho maniac, but his posthumously published "Garden of Eden" was full of 
androgyny and gender-switching. He was a bigot and an anti-Semite, but he 
sought out, befriended and glorified the working underclass, and his generosity 
is without dispute. He was a poseur. He was a man of deeds. And, excuse me, may 
I have another rum soda, please? 
</P>
<P>
 NINETY MILES AWAY, ON THE OTHER SIDE OF the world, is Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 At night, approached from the air, Havana is a city of few lights. Abandoned 
by its old ally the former Soviet Union, and periodically embroiled in yet 
another bitter showdown with its erstwhile friend the United States, Cuba 
suffers oil shortages and power blackouts, as well as scarcities of food and 
other necessities of life. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than a generation, the United States has sought to restrict travel 
and trade with Cuba. But during quiet periods -- decidedly unlike the recent 
blustery confrontation between Presidents Fidel Castro and Bill Clinton -- 
Americans nonetheless slip in among growing numbers of Canadian and European 
tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 And here the ghost of Papa Hemingway is preserved as nowhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors -- including Americans -- are spared "our present difficulties," as 
the Cubans like to say. What awaits them is not shortages but tourist taxis 
with plenty of gasoline, English-speaking guides, hotels with ample food and 
special tourist-issue soap and shampoo, plenty of rum and cigars and a tourist 
currency based not on the devalued Cuban peso but on the U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 A common route is through Nassau in the Bahamas (see Guidebook). On the flight 
I took last summer were a few returning Cubans and a number of tourists -- from 
Argentina, Canada, Japan, the Bahamas, England and two of us from the States. 
My fellow American is an old DC-3 pilot, who assures me that "Cuban fliers are 
great." I'm glad to hear this since I had earlier witnessed the disconcerting 
sight of a mechanic jabbing a giant screwdriver into the engine on our tired 
Soviet-made AK-24 turboprop, coaxing it to start. 
</P>
<P>
 We arrive at Havana's Jose Marti International Airport with tropical lightning 
flickering around us. Our plane lands so gently the tires don't even squeak. 
Perhaps the pilot is concerned by their lack of tread. (I am.) It is 35 years 
since Hemingway left, 36 years since Castro's revolution. The night air is hot, 
heavy and moist, rich with the damp smell of rotting vegetation buffered by the 
scents of wild tropical flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 The past lives on in many ways here -- ways that are not usually beneficial to 
the Cubans but are certainly a curiosity for visiting Americans. Perhaps 
one-quarter of the cars on the streets, for instance, are spongy, leftover 
1950s Detroit-built Buick roadsters and workaday Chevy coupes and boxy old 
Plymouths. Many are painted brightly. These mix with an assortment of Soviet 
trucks, belching buses and occasional donkey carts -- plus about a zillion 
bicycles and sidecar motorcycles. 
</P>
<P>
 The architecture of Havana dates from 1600 or so until about 1960, when time 
seems to have stopped. I saw many buildings falling apart, but the Plaza Hotel 
was not one of them. Built at the turn of the century on the edge of Old 
Havana, it is a colonial-style structure with arched ceilings, stained glass, a 
grand piano, an indoor fountain, free-flying indoor birds and a 24-hour bar 
that smells of a century's worth of cigars. I have chosen to stay here because 
it is a block from Obispo Street, the pedestrian thoroughfare that stretches 
down to the harbor and also to the site of Hemingway's favorite Havana 
restaurant and bar, the Floridita. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1940s and '50s, the Floridita was among the most glamorous and decadent 
hangouts in the world, and the place was always packed. Twenty years ago, I 
first saw those sharp black-and-white pictures of Hemingway and Spencer Tracy 
and Gary Cooper and the gang at the corner of the restaurant's wooden horseshoe 
bar, and I have wanted to visit the place ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, a distinguished-looking Cuban in a red jacket welcomes me, and there 
are empty seats to choose from. I take a place next to the brass chain that 
enshrines Hemingway's corner stool. Propped on the end of the bar is a rare 
photograph of Hemingway with Castro, taken at a fishing tournament in 1960. 
Overhead is a three-quarter-size bronze bust of the author. 
</P>
<P>
 There is only one cocktail to request at the Floridita: A slushy daiquiri 
ceremoniously prepared with fresh limes and no sugar -- a drink supposedly 
invented by Hemingway's favorite barman here, Constantino Ribailagua. Icy fruit 
and rum drinks have been popular with Havana's elites since 1810, when the 
first shipment of ice arrived at the Floridita from Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 My daiquiri is astringent and it coaxes forth the ghosts of the Lost 
Generation. The decor of the place has changed. The frosted ripple-glass 
windows of an earlier era have been replaced; furniture and murals are 
unrecognizable from the old photographs. But there remains an unmistakable 
nostalgia. Dinner in the circular dining room is elegant, and I will not 
criticize cooking in a country where wood pulp is discreetly added to the flour 
as an extender. The service is fastidious, and every crumb is swept away 
between courses with a polished silver trowel. My red snapper is small, grilled 
well and lavishly covered with enough thick gravy to fill the whole embossed 
china plate. There is no lettuce for the salad -- only onions and tomatoes. 
That's OK. After dinner, you can still light a nine-inch cigar at your table 
with impunity. 
</P>
<P>
 In the morning, along with four Japanese tourists and a Florida 
coconut-grower, I tour Havana, partly by foot and partly in an air-conditioned 
Nissan van. The standard itinerary for the government-operated Havanatur 
includes the ancient forts of the city, the Revolution Museum (where the boat 
Castro used for his invasion of the island is encased in glass), Revolution 
Square (where Castro makes his speeches), a shopping plaza reserved for 
tourists, assorted other museums and city hospitals. Cubans are incredibly 
proud of their universal health-care system, and we are promised free emergency 
medical services should the need arise. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando, our guide, adds a literary side trip: We walk to the Ambos Mundos 
Hotel, where Hemingway lived during his early days here. "A good place to 
write," Hemingway called it. Today, the Ambos Mundos ("Both Worlds") houses 
government functionaries, although Hemingway's unnumbered fifth-floor room is 
maintained as a small museum. 
</P>
<P>
 After the tour, the coconut-grower and I visit the famous/infamous bar and 
restaurant La Bodeguita del Medio. Hemingway was a regular, but this tiny 
stone-block establishment has entertained so many of the world's artists and 
celebrities that the author barely stands out among the yellowed photographs 
and old scrawled signatures covering the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 At La Bodeguita, we meet a Cuban civil engineer named Ricardo and his wife, 
Ellen. (At their request, these are not their real names; paranoia is not 
excessive here, but it exists.) Ricardo is a Cuban army veteran of the war in 
Angola; I am a U.S. Marine veteran of Vietnam. With our black beans and strips 
of barbecued pork, we chew over why the United States has rushed to do business 
with Cold War enemies such as China and North Vietnam but not Cuba. Then, to 
earn a bit of money, the couple agrees to drive us 12 miles to the hilltop 
suburb of San Francisco de Paula, where Hemingway's home, the Finca Vigia, is 
maintained as one of the premier Hemingway museums of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "What car is this that barely runs and sags like an old gourd?" I ask. "A 
Soviet Lada. We say, 'A Lada-trouble,' " puns Ricardo as we lurch through the 
slums, the engine dying, the clutch trembling, with suicidal bicyclists testing 
our screeching brakes at every turn. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want to see how Hemingway lived from 1939 through the 1950s, the Finca 
Vigia is the place. His shoes, books, glasses, hunting trophies, Nobel Prize 
medallion, his boat, the Pilar, all sorts of relics, now belong to the Cubans 
-- and most of them are on casual display at the villa, as if Hemingway were 
merely away on summer safari. Also here is the converted wooden bookcase where 
he wrote standing up and on a good day dulled the points of seven No. 2 
pencils. Here is the pool where he scandalized the neighbors by swimming nude. 
Here is the living room where he romanced young Italian countess Adriana 
Ivancich under the pained glare of Mary, his fourth and last wife. And here are 
the overgrown grounds, on which the author once instructed his gardener: "Your 
job will be not to cut, not to prune." 
</P>
<P>
 Some mysteries are not decipherable by the best of writers, like why Cuba? In 
a magazine article published in 1949, Hemingway said merely this: "You live in 
Cuba because you can plug the bell in the party-line telephone with paper, so 
that you won't have to answer, and you work as well there in the cool early 
morning as you ever have worked anywhere in the world. But these are 
professional secrets." 
</P>
<P>
 ERNEST HEMINGWAY BEGAN LIFE in Oak Park, Ill., a suburb west of Chicago, in 
July, 1899. He finished the journey in Ketchum, Ida., 62 years later to the 
month, in July, 1961. 
</P>
<P>
 His boyhood home, at 339 N. Oak Park Ave., is being slowly turned into a 
museum. Another museum two blocks down, at 200 N. Oak Park Ave., displays some 
of his high school writing and memorabilia. A private home nearby at 600 N. 
Kenilworth Ave., where Hemingway's family moved when he was 6 and and where he 
lived through high school, is marked by a small plaque. 
</P>
<P>
 At Oak Park High School, an ornate classroom modeled after an Oxford 
University reading room bears Hemingway's name. School officials believe it is 
the most photographed classroom in America. "Kids respond when they come visit 
the museum and see Hemingway's letter sweater, and view him as a person for the 
first time," says Jim Walwark, a veteran English teacher at Oak Park High. "But 
as for his writing, they find his style stilted. They don't find it realistic. 
In his day, he offered something new in literature. But to them, it's not new. 
He tried to leave things out to reach the essence of his subject. They feel he 
left out too much." 
</P>
<P>
 Ketchum, appropriately, has no Hemingway museum. 
</P>
<P>
 The author first came here in September, 1939, when a public relations whiz 
handling the Sun Valley Lodge, the original destination ski resort, invited him 
to be a guest, figuring it would boost business. Hemingway accepted and 
rendezvoused at the lodge with Martha Gellhorn, in room 206. (From time to 
time, people still come just to stay in that room.) Over the years, he returned 
frequently, usually to hunt birds, and in 1959 moved permanently to Ketchum, 
the town adjacent to Sun Valley. The Ram Bar at the lodge became one of his 
favorite drinking places, and the resort's Trail Creek Cabin was the scene of 
many wild, happy parties. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 1, 1961, old beyond his years, unable to recover from electric shock 
therapy prescribed for depression and a deteriorating mental condition, 
Hemingway ate his last meal at Ketchum's Christiana Restaurant. At home the 
next morning, he killed himself with a shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
 Plenty of residents still remember the hulking Hemingway. "He was loud and he 
smelled," one woman tells me at the Duchin Lounge, another Hemingway hangout. 
"He smelled of garlic and booze." Later, she recites a Hemingway passage from 
memory and actually breaks into sobs. 
</P>
<P>
 A lode of Hemingway anecdotes can be found in the oral histories of the region 
collected by the Ketchum Library. Transcripts are open to browsers. Hemingway's 
home, situated above the banks of the Big Wood River, on the west side of town, 
is gated and posted with "No Trespassing" signs. The Nature Conservancy owns 
the property, and from time to time discusses opening the house for limited 
visits. But for now it remains harder to get into than Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 Hemingway is buried in the Ketchum cemetery beneath a plain horizontal 
gravestone. A few miles away on the east side of Ketchum above Sun Valley 
Lodge, a tasteful memorial to him has been erected. Here, on Trail Creek, in a 
grove of trees, rests a lonely stone bench facing a monument inscribed with an 
epitaph Hemingway wrote for an old hunting friend: "Best of all he loved the 
fall,/The leaves yellow on the cottonwoods,/Leaves floating on the trout 
streams,/And above the hills/The high blue windless sky./Now he will be a part 
of them forever." GUIDEBOOK: On the Hemingway Trail

 Getting there: Though there is no official U.S. ban on travel to Cuba, there 
is a trade embargo. This means that American tourists may not engage in 
financial transactions -- for instance, buying dinner or paying for a hotel -- 
while in Cuba. The Treasury Department says that it "vigorously" enforces the 
embargo. Those determined to risk prosecution have been known to find their way 
to Cuba, nevertheless, through countries that maintain open-door policies with 
Castro's homeland, such as the Bahamas, Canada and Mexico. Travel agents in 
these countries typically book three-day and one-week tour packages, including 
transportation and choice of hotels. (Cuban immigration officials do not mark 
American passports with incriminating entry stamps.) OAK PARK

TRAVELING IN STYLE; WITH JEFFERSON IN PARIS; HE VISITED MONUMENTS, FELL IN 
LOVE, SPOKE BAD FRENCH -- OUR THIRD PRESIDENT WAS THE ORIGINAL AMERICAN IN 
PARIS

<P>
 IN AUGUST, 1784, THOMAS JEFFERSON ARRIVED IN PARIS ON a two-year special 
mission on behalf of the 13 newly independent American states. He stayed for 
five years. I came for three years in 1969, leaving New York on Richard M. 
Nixon's Inauguration Day. I'm still here. My friend Charlie, on the other hand, 
came for the rest of his life, but only stayed nine months because neither the 
phones nor the plumbing worked. "Either one," he said, "but not both." 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferson succeeded Benjamin Franklin as U.S. minister to France. Franklin, 
Jefferson and John Adams all worked in Paris at about the same time, 
negotiating commercial treaties, their tours of duty overlapping. Their years 
in the city were important for all of them. They took to the place. In those 
days, they called Paris "a pleasure-loving capital."  
</P>
<P>
 Ismail Merchant and James Ivory ("Howards End") are currently shooting a film 
called "Jefferson in Paris," starring Nick Nolte as everybody's favorite 
Founding Father. Visualize the Paris scene in Jefferson's day: swords, silver 
belt buckles and lace ruffles, the wigs and fans and all the dainty shoes worn 
by the aristocratic liberals who formed his circle of friends. He wrote to 
James Madison back in the States about corruption in the French court: "The 
King, long in the habit of drowning his cares in wine, plunges deeper and 
deeper. The Queen cries, but sins on." 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferson came to Paris between revolutions -- after America's, before 
France's. His role in the development of the latter, though, has been 
exaggerated. He simply believed that mankind could be saved by knowledge. He 
had what he called a "zeal to promote the general good by an interchange of 
useful things." Of course, he did say: "I hold it that a little rebellion, now 
and then, is a good thing, and as necessary in the political world as storms in 
the physical." But Jefferson's faith was that of an enlightened liberal rather 
than of a doctrinaire revolutionary.  
</P>
<P>
 He arrived in Paris with his 11-year old daughter, Martha, known as Patsy, and 
his slave James Hemings. (He was an "enlightened" slave master rumored to have 
fathered children with James' sister, Sally Hemings -- but that's another 
story). Franklin stayed on after Jefferson's arrival, living in the quiet 
village of Passy, a former woodcutters hamlet turned spa west of Paris, near 
the Bois de Boulogne. Franklin's home was the Hotel de Valentinois (a hotel in 
those days was a private mansion), which stood on the crest of a hill, with 
terraces and gardens leading down to the Seine. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in his late 70s, Franklin had developed some kind of "stone," which the 
rough carriage ride into Paris had aggravated. So instead of venturing out, he 
received visitors -- and Jefferson paid a call on Franklin after presenting his 
credentials at Versailles. Passy was incorporated into Paris in 1859 and is now 
a Metro stop in the 16th arrondissement . Tourists come to the neighborhood to 
visit French novelist Honore de Balzac's house on the Rue Raynouard and the 
Clemenceau Museum on the Rue Franklin -- perhaps noticing the memorial plaque 
at the corner of Rue Singer and Rue Raynouard (not far from the apartment in 
which Maria Schneider and Marlon Brando shared butter in "Last Tango in Paris") 
marking the site of Franklin's onetime home. 
</P>
<P>
 John Adams got to Paris with his family, including his wife, Abigail, and his 
son John Quincy a week after Jefferson did -- settling "away from the (city's) 
putrid streets" in Auteuil, a wine-producing village then on the outskirts of 
Paris, also now in the 16th. Jefferson liked the people and the places in this 
area, and he visited both Franklin and Adams often. All the people I know who 
live in this arrondissement today, though, complain that they would be happier 
living elsewhere. They mostly occupy inherited or corporate (and thus 
rent-controlled or free) apartments. But there are more banks than cafes, and 
more poodles and politicians than people. 
</P>
<P>
 JEFFERSON EVENTUALLY SETTLED IN ANOTHER neighborhood, one that has come to be 
so famous and emblematic of Paris as to be beyond like or dislike. His spacious 
home, the Hotel de Langeac, stood on the corner of Rue de Berri and the 
Champs-Elysees. That was the exurbs then, but today it's practically Times 
Square. The Hotel Le Warwick, a favorite of rock musicians, occupies what used 
to be Jefferson's land. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by his friend the Marquis de Lafayette, Jefferson's daughter Patsy 
was placed in a classy convent school. She wore a crimson uniform and soon 
spoke effortless French. This rather annoyed her father. Any American who has 
ever tried to learn French and failed can identify with this Renaissance man 
who somehow never felt really comfortable with the French language. 
</P>
<P>
 JOHN TRUMBULL, SON OF A CONNECTICUT GOVERNOR, ARRIVED IN PARIS during the 
summer of 1786. A 30-year-old artist who wanted to paint the events of the 
American Revolution in retrospect, Trumbull carried letters of introduction to 
Jefferson from all sorts of other well-connected people. Hitting it off with 
the tall Virginian, Trumbull soon moved into a guest room in the Hotel de 
Langeac. The two men took long walks together in the Bois de Boulogne. 
Jefferson considered Trumbull to be as good a painter as the highly regarded 
Jacques-Louis David; Trumbull introduced Jefferson to Maria Cosway. 
</P>
<P>
 As Dumas Malone writes in his biography "Jefferson and the Rights of Man": 
"Then began an adventure such as Jefferson had certainly not expected, in a 
late summer which was amazingly like Spring. To put it somewhat differently, a 
generally philosophical gentleman, hungrier for beauty and a woman than he 
realized, was quite swept off his supposedly well-planted feet." 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferson may not have learned the language, but he thought he had a fairly 
good fix on French women. He feared the effects of their voluptuous dress and 
manner on his susceptible young countrymen. He warned against "female 
intrigue." (Every heterosexual male American resident of Paris I know either 
came or remained for the love of a French woman.) 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Cosway, on the other hand, Jefferson found to be talented, modest and 
"soft of disposition" -- although it was said that she could also be "the most 
coquettish of them all." Born in Italy of English descent, Cosway had studied 
art and music and spoke many languages. She played the harp. (Jefferson played 
the violin and harpsichord.) She was 27, slim and graceful, with bountiful 
curly blond hair. Biographer James Boswell addressed her as "Serenissima 
Principessa." She was married. 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferson was a 43-year-old widower with a philosophical bent, particularly 
unsuited to withstand her charms. Her marriage was to some extent "convenient," 
but Jefferson nevertheless always went out of his way to be correct with her 
husband, a society painter. There was something magical, though, about every 
day he spent with Maria. 
</P>
<P>
 He kept a record of their day-trips. They went to the Chateau de Bagatelle, a 
small palace in the Bois de Boulogne built as a rest-stop for the queen on her 
trips between Versailles and Paris. (The building still stands in what is now 
called the Parc de Bagatelle. The park's flower gardens are renowned, 
especially for their irises in May and roses in June. Art exhibitions are held 
in the chateau's outbuildings, the Trianon and Orangerie.) They strolled the 
hills along the Seine and visited the nearby river port of Reuilly. They 
enjoyed the panoramic terraces of the ancient town of St.-Germain-en-Laye just 
west of Paris (whose imposing Renaissance chateau now houses the Museum of 
National Antiquities) and the magnificent marble horse statues at Louis XIV's 
Chateau de Marly not far away (now standing in a park at the foot of the 
recently revamped Champs-Elysees). 
</P>
<P>
 One of their favorite spots was Le Desert de Retz, the country estate of 
Racine de Monville, located near the village of Chambourcy, about four miles 
from St.-Germain-en-Laye. In the heart of Monville's compound was a huge 
column, designed to appear "ruined," with a spiral staircase Jefferson admired. 
The column has been restored and still stands, classified as an historic 
monument. 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferson ended his affair with his famous "Head or Heart" letter. According 
to the Head, Jefferson wrote Cosway, the most effective means of being secure 
against emotional pain was to retire within oneself, as "The art of life is the 
art of avoiding pain!" Meanwhile, the Heart taunted, "Let the gloomy monk, 
sequestered from the world, seek unsocial pleasures in the bottom of his cell." 
In the end, the Head won out, though not by much. 
</P>
<P>
 JEFFERSON CONTINUED TO discover and enjoy Paris on his own. He particularly 
loved the Tuileries Gardens (and who does not?) and witnessed a hot-air balloon 
ascension there. He had been interested in "aerostatics" even before leaving 
the United States, but this was the first time he had seen a balloon lift off 
with people aboard. He also attended many concerts in the gardens, hearing such 
artists as Haydn and the violin virtuoso Rudolphe Kreutzer (to whom Beethoven 
dedicated his "Kreutzer Sonata"). 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomacy and royal amusement, however, were increasingly moved from the 
Louvre and Tuileries palaces to Versailles, away from the city's "putrid 
streets." It was probably just as well. On July 12, 1789, passing through the 
Place Louis XV (now the Place de la Concorde) in his carriage, Jefferson saw 
German cavalry and Swiss Guards confronting an angry crowd. He turned back to 
see the crowd attack the forces of order. Two days later, what was now being 
called "the people" got muskets, freed prisoners and beheaded the mayor. 
Jefferson came to believe that he had in fact witnessed the first act of the 
"Universal Insurrection." 
</P>
<P>
 The American Revolution was a salient role model for the French, thought 
Jefferson. He wrote to James Madison, "Our proceedings have been viewed as a 
model for them on every occasion. . . . (Our revolution) is treated like the 
Bible, open to explanation but not question." He believed a French revolution 
was imminent, and he believed that, by following the American example, this 
revolution would mark the "commencement of a general reformation in the 
government of the world." Optimistic, he wrote to Thomas Paine in England: "I 
think there is no possibility now of anything hindering the final establishment 
of a good constitution" in France. He was wrong.  
</P>
<P>
 Jefferson and his family left Paris in October, 1789, waiting for 10 days -- 
because of bad weather -- at the channel port of Le Havre for a boat to begin 
their voyage home. Finally, shortly after midnight one evening, the Jefferson 
entourage set sail for England on the packet Anna. They arrived at Cowes after 
26 hours of "boisterous navigation and mortal sickness" and had to wait there 
for nearly two weeks before boarding a ship for home. 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferson received special tariff considerations at the English customs house 
by order of Prime Minister William Pitt. And he read in the English newspapers 
that a mob had invaded the Versailles Palace and conveyed the French king to 
Paris. GUIDEBOOK: Jeffersonian Paris 
</P>
<P>
 Telephone numbers and prices: The country code for France is 33; the city code 
for Paris is 1. All prices are approximate and computed at a rate of 5.5 francs 
to the dollar. Hotel prices are for a double room for one night. Restaurant 
prices are for dinner for two, food only. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting there: Air France, United and AOM French Airlines have nonstop flights 
from Los Angeles to Paris. Connecting flights are offered by American, United, 
Northwest and Continental airlines and TWA. 
</P>
<P>
 Where to stay: For a Jeffersonian connection -- and if price is no object -- 
try the Hotel de Crillon, 10 Place de la Concorde, 8th arrondissement , 
telephone 4471-5000, fax 4471-1502; reservations (800) 888-4747. This 
ultra-luxurious hotel occupies part of the 18th-Century building in which the 
Treaty of Friendship and Trade between France and the fledgling United States 
was signed in 1778. It is furnished with Aubusson carpets, inlaid floors and 
antiques, and its service is legendary. The restaurants, Les Ambassadeurs and 
L'Obelisque are highly rated. Rates: $435-$710. Hotel Le Warwick, 5 Rue de 
Berri, 8th arrondissement , tel. 4563-1411, fax 4256-7759. Strictly a 
20th-Century hotel, but it does stand on the site once occupied by Jefferson's 
Parisian home, the Hotel de Langeac. The Warwick offers large, quiet rooms in a 
central location. Rates: $315-$465. 
</P>
<P>
 Where to eat: Le Procope, 13 Rue de l'Ancienne Comedie, 6th arrondissement , 
tel. 4326-9920. Founded in 1686 and often host to Jefferson, Franklin and their 
friends. Today, the interior (though it has been renovated and updated often) 
seems time-worn, and the food is rarely better than acceptable. It is 
undeniably Jeffersonian, though; $36-$135. Le Grand Vefour, 17 Rue de 
Beaujolais, 1st arrondissement , tel. 4296-5627. An elegant place with perfect 
service and excellent food, popular with the Parisian upper-class since the 
1760s. (The original owner, Jean Vefour, was chef to the Duc d'Orleans, who 
helped send Louis XVI to the guillotine. The period interior is a classified 
historical monument; $235-$360.

 IN THE DECADES AFTER WORLD WAR II, THE GLITTERATI CLAIMED Jamaica. Drawn by 
the blazing sun, soft breezes and relatively relaxed moral atmosphere, hordes 
of movie stars, royals and literary lights descended on the island every 
winter. Among the luminaries, none glittered more brightly than two seemingly 
ill-matched British neighbors on the island's scenic northern shore. 
</P>
<P>
 At his mountaintop idyll called Firefly, the openly gay actor, playwright and 
composer Noel Coward, close chum of the Queen Mother and said to be the 
highest-paid writer of his time, held hilarious court over pitchers of dry 
martinis. Meanwhile, about three miles down the coast, in a bungalow he had 
christened Goldeneye, Ian Fleming was busy scuba-diving, polishing his service 
revolver and creating the hetero-macho superspy James Bond. 
</P>
<P>
 This unlikely pair were not only close neighbors but close friends, too. They 
visited back and forth often, and when Fleming was married in the tiny nearby 
town of Port Maria, Coward and his longtime companion, Graham Payne, were the 
witnesses. Typically, Coward tied the shoes onto the back of his own car by 
mistake, and ended the afternoon helping Fleming bury the ghastly green wedding 
cake in the garden at Goldeneye.

honeymoon resorts and Kingston's crime-ridden urban sprawl -- has little 
connection with such careless high-jinks. And Coward-style society, to the 
extent that it still exists, has long since decamped for more exclusive 
Caribbean isles. 
</P>
<P>
 But as I found in recently visiting their haunts, the natural charm that 
seduced the Master and the Commander, as Coward and Fleming were known 
respectively to their friends, is still around. 
</P>
<P>
 When Ian Fleming, then a member of the British naval intelligence service, 
first flew into Kingston in 1944 to attend a spy conference, he arrived smack 
in the middle of a rainy season so intense that toadstools literally sprang up 
in his leather shoes overnight. Unlike the Commander, I arrived in Kingston to 
brilliant sunshine. But in homage to his damp initial sojourn I decided to 
begin my trip by driving across the island's mountainous center about 25 miles 
northeast to Port Antonio, birthplace of the Jamaican tourist industry -- and 
the rainiest spot on the north coast. 
</P>
<P>
 The mountains that cover Jamaica's interior are probably quite beautiful, but 
I can't testify to that since I glimpsed them only out of the corner of my eye. 
My attention was focused instead on the hairpin curves, road-hogging trucks and 
peek-a-boo pavement that elevate driving on the island to the level of a video 
combat game. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until I dead-ended at the Caribbean and turned right toward Port 
Antonio that I began to enjoy the scenery, a curious and compelling mix of 
beauty and chaos. As the road wove from jungle to coastline, it passed stands 
of coconut palms, banana plantations with the still-growing fruit wrapped in 
blue plastic bags, giant breadfruit trees encased in thick vines. The brilliant 
red-orange flowers of flame trees splashed vivid color everywhere, and food 
stands appeared seemingly at random, each displaying a neat row of soft drinks 
or Red Stripe beer, with hand-painted signs advertising jerk chicken, jerk pork 
and jerk sausage. 
</P>
<P>
 There were people everywhere -- walking on the road, bicycling on the road, 
standing beside the road, sitting in groups by the road. It quickly became 
clear that in the "country" outside Kingston, the road functions not only as a 
medium for travel, but also as a kind of communal gathering place. I also began 
to understand that, in a country with unemployment running as high as 30% to 
40%, young Jamaicans have developed hanging out into an art form. 
</P>
<P>
 After a short stop to view one of the many waterfalls that plunge 
spectacularly down to the coast, I drove on and soon pulled into the central 
square of Port Antonio. In the late 19th Century this square was the center of 
the world banana trade. Then, around the beginning of this century, canny 
Yankee sea captains, anxious to fill their empty boats on the trips to the 
island to pick up bananas, lured winter-weary Americans with pictures of sunny 
Port Antonio, thus launching Jamaica's tourist trade. 
</P>
<P>
 These days , the epicenter of tourism has relocated farther down the coast to 
Montego Bay, and Port Antonio is rather sleepy. The square itself is home to a 
row of small, cement-walled shops painted coral, sky blue, peach or light 
green, and the large adjacent covered market offers the full range of Caribbean 
roots, fruits and sundries. Along the dusty side streets, bougainvillea and 
hibiscus spill haphazardly over fences enclosing tiny yards, and rows of stucco 
buildings are regularly interrupted with gingerbread Victorians built during 
the banana boom days. 
</P>
<P>
 As I wandered about, I was slightly puzzled by the repeated offer to "Go 
rafting, Mon." Inquiring, I learned that this refers to an activity popularized 
by Errol Flynn when he was the celebrity-in-residence around here -- raft trips 
down the nearby Rio Grande river. Coward and Fleming regularly took the trip, 
too. In fact, the villain in Fleming's novel "From Russia with Love" is named 
after his favorite raftsman, Red Grant. 
</P>
<P>
 It is still possible to take a trip down the Rio Grande in long, curious 
bamboo rafts. The guide stands up front and poles, while one or two passengers 
relax in seats at the back. Time passes quickly, particularly since every time 
you pull over for a rest, vendors selling Red Stripe immediately appear. 
</P>
<P>
 A FEW DAYS LATER, I DROVE 30 MILES NORTH TO THE TOWN OF ORACABESSA. It was 
near here, in 1948, that Fleming located a 14-acre strip of land that met his 
three absolute requirements for a Jamaican hideaway: a cliff, a hidden cove 
with beach and complete privacy from the road. Here, then, the Commander built 
Goldeneye, named after a covert operation he had directed during the war. The 
house was basically one giant room, its glassless windows open to the air, with 
a couple of small bedrooms appended. Eschewing such luxuries as bathtubs, 
Fleming installed only cold showers. 
</P>
<P>
 Every year until his death in 1964, Fleming came here for two months -- 
January and February. And every year during his stay he banged out another 
James Bond thriller on the typewriter at the triangular desk in his tiny 
bedroom. These books sold more than 40 million copies even before his death, 
and Spartan Goldeneye became one of the best-known vacation retreats in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Today all that is visible of Goldeneye to the public is several hundred yards 
of high, wire fence punctuated by stone gateposts along the coast highway. The 
property is owned and used as a personal residence by Chris Blackwell, 
proprietor of Island Records, promoter of reggae artist Bob Marley, and one of 
Jamaica's richest men. Blackwell, whose mother, Blanche, was a close friend of 
both Fleming and Coward, provides a continuing link between the two 
celebrities: Last year, her son also took over management of Coward's nearby 
house, Firefly, which had badly deteriorated since Graham Payne donated the 
property to the Jamaica National Heritage Trust in 1976, three years after 
Coward died. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-mile road between Goldeneye and Firefly has probably changed little 
since that afternoon decades ago when Coward and Payne, scouting about for a 
good spot to paint, followed a whim and turned onto the road. The two came here 
in the spring of 1948 as part of a vacation Coward had taken to recuperate from 
the bad reviews the American production of his play "Tonight at 8:30" had 
gotten. Having rented Goldeneye from his friend Fleming, Coward proceeded to 
complain volubly about the cook's "inedible" food, the "barbaric" furniture and 
the "hideous" design. Ever afterward, he called the place "Goldeneye, Nose and 
Throat" because, he said, he thought it bore a remarkable resemblance to a 
suburban health clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, though, Coward was enchanted by Goldeneye and by Jamaica, and 
built his own retreat in 1956. When I reached the driveway marked "Firefly," 
the pavement smoothed out and the ever-present bougainvillea and hibiscus at 
the side of the road began to show signs of careful pruning. I rounded the last 
curve to find myself beholding a view that even Coward, despite his legendary 
ability to turn a phrase, confessed himself unable to do justice to in words. A 
smoothly manicured lawn drops suddenly away to reveal the Caribbean, stretching 
to the horizon; to the left and right, the coastline curves gracefully away for 
about 30 miles in each direction; as a backdrop, ranks of green-clad mountains 
undulate gently toward Kingston and the higher peaks of the distant Blue 
Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 When Coward and Payne reached this four-acre plateau, they got out of their 
car and spent the afternoon painting. At dusk, they broke out a flask of 
powerful martinis, and as they toasted the view, thousands of fireflies 
appeared to light up the night like magic. This moment provided the name for 
the house, which Coward built here as a refuge from his growing fame.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, after extensive renovations by Blackwell, the house has reopened for 
public tours and is just as it was on the day in 1965 when the Queen Mother 
dropped by for a celebrated luncheon. Really just a simple white stucco 
bungalow, it nevertheless approaches the Platonic ideal of a vacation hideaway. 
</P>
<P>
 I wandered through the ground-floor studio, out onto a terrace with a 
spectacular view of the northernmost point of Jamaica ("A favorite place to 
gather for cocktails," pointed out Firefly general manager Toni Allen, though 
that seemed to be true of all three of the house's terraces) and then back to 
the open-sided dining room. Up a short flight of stairs is the "music room," 
with its two grand pianos situated for duets and its windows facing the ocean. 
On one side of the room, down a few steps, is a galley kitchen; on the other 
side, stairs ascend to the study, inspiration for Coward's song "A Room With a 
View." 
</P>
<P>
 A view it definitely has. The entire front side of the room is open to the 
air, with a green awning overhead and a wide bench serving as a kind of 
informal window seat. Directly outside, that incomparable vista unfolds -- the 
azure and turquoise sea traced with the small white lines of waves and, plunked 
down right in the center is a small round island (where the real James Bond, an 
ornithologist, wrote "Birds of the Western Caribbean"). 
</P>
<P>
 As I sat here and gazed out, chatting with Allen and sipping the inevitable 
Red Stripe, it was easy to imagine that I was back in the swim of high society 
that eddied around the place during the '50s and '60s. Allen's chat was 
peppered with the names of famous people who have more recently strolled the 
grounds or appeared for the midnight concerts that occur on nights with a full 
moon all year round (an eclectic and glamorous mix, from Bono to Grace Jones to 
"a high chieftain of the Arawak tribe from Venezuela," as well as the cream of 
Jamaica society). 
</P>
<P>
 Not far from where we sat, a simple marble slab marks Coward's grave. I 
couldn't help feeling that his spirit would be happy to hear the easy, animated 
talk of celebrities, of comings and goings, of plans for cocktail parties, 
concerts and weddings. And then, from a tape recorder hidden somewhere nearby, 
came the Master's voice, crooning the song inspired by this very corner of the 
house: "A room with a view and you/And no one to worry us./No one to hurry us 
through/This dream we've found. . . ." GUIDEBOOK: Jamaica Hello

TRAVELING IN STYLE; NIGHTHAWKS & BROWNSTONES; NEW YORK HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY 
SINCE PAINTER EDWARD HOPPER PORTRAYED IT, BUT TRACES OF A HOPPER-ESQUE PAST 
ENDURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gail Levin, Levin, who lives in New York, is author of numerous books on 
Edward Hopper, including Hopper's Places, and a forthcoming biography (both 
from Knopf). 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 EDWARD HOPPER -- THE QUINTESSENTIAL REALIST PAINTER OF 20th-Century America 
and an artist who has been extremely influential in many areas of American 
popular culture -- began his long acquaintance with New York City in 1899, when 
he first arrived there at age 17 from his home just up the Hudson in Nyack. He 
spent seven years in New York art schools, then made three trips to Europe 
before settling down in 1910 back in New York, where he lived until his death 
in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 New York in 1899 was in transition from a 19th-Century city to a modern 
metropolis with the new skyscrapers that became its trademark. The growing city 
bustled with palpable excitement. Hopper preferred the smaller row houses and 
other remnants of an older, more familiar way of life, but he was also 
attracted to the lively theaters on Broadway, the rowdy burlesque shows and 
inexpensive luncheonettes and second-floor Chinese restaurants. And he painted 
the city's automats, movie palaces, theaters, offices, apartments and cheap 
hotels with such austerity and conviction that his views of them seem to embody 
the very character of modern cities. Most of the sites that inspired him have 
vanished, the city's last remaining automat closing only a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 One painting more than any other has caught the world's imagination and 
symbolizes Hopper's New York: "Nighthawks," his masterpiece of 1942 (which now 
hangs in the Art Institute of Chicago). The all-night diner with its four 
lonely figures has long since attained the status of an icon of 20th-Century 
urban life. Contemporary artists, designers and cinematographers regularly 
appropriate the painting. "Nighthawks," Hopper once noted, "was suggested by a 
restaurant on Greenwich Avenue where two streets meet." The vintage eatery he 
painted has not survived, but an unusual triangular spit of land in Greenwich 
Village, where Greenwich and Seventh avenues meet Eleventh Street, suggests the 
original site. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Hopper, another of his best-known paintings, "Early Sunday 
Morning" (1930), depicted a scene nearby, in the same neighborhood. With its 
prominent barber pole standing in front of heavily corniced row houses with 
shop windows on the ground floors, the site was reportedly found on lower 
Seventh Avenue. But many a Brooklynite thinks he has spotted a similar street 
in Park Slope or Brooklyn Heights.  
</P>
<P>
 Hopper moved to Greenwich Village in 1913 and made it his home base. He came 
to know the area especially well and found many of his subjects there. Yet he 
branched out tirelessly throughout the city, finding sites to portray all the 
way from Manhattan Bridge on the Lower East Side up to 155th Street in Harlem, 
where he sketched Macomb's Dam Bridge on the Harlem River for a 1935 painting. 
</P>
<P>
 For 54 years, until he died, Hopper lived on the top floor of 3 Washington 
Square North. The building was once a haven for artists and writers, from John 
Dos Passos to Rockwell Kent to William Glackens. Today, it is the offices of 
New York University's School of Social Work. Had Hopper lived in Europe, his 
house would surely be a museum, but in this diffident and blase American 
metropolis, there's not even a plaque on the building's exterior. 
</P>
<P>
 AWARENESS OF HOPPER IS GREATER WHERE THE ARTIST GREW UP, 40 MILES UP the 
Hudson River in Nyack. Some citizens of this once-sleepy town raised funds to 
restore Hopper's boyhood home, which had been built by the artist's grandfather 
in the mid-19th Century (see Guidebook). Hopper continued to visit the house 
all his life, since his sister lived there until she died. Although there are 
no original Hoppers on view, the house is quite evocative of his painting. His 
canvas "Summer Evening" (1947) presents a once-romantic couple squabbling on a 
porch that has a layout quite like that of his boyhood home. And in 1949, he 
painted a view he had cherished all his life, looking down the house's central 
staircase and out the doorway toward the Hudson River. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after Hopper left Nyack, he never lost his love of rivers and nautical 
life. Some of his first paintings of New York depict scenes along the East 
River -- "Blackwell's Island," "Queensborough Bridge" and "East River." If 
Blackwell's Island, now called Roosevelt Island and much changed by modern 
housing, is unrecognizable today, the Queensborough Bridge at 59th Street, then 
a new engineering marvel, looks much the same as it did in 1913 when Hopper 
painted it. On an overcast day, the East River still turns the same soft 
blue-gray that the artist caught in his canvas. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1925 and 1926, Hopper depicted New York in watercolors. He made several 
views of the Manhattan Bridge, including one of the triumphal arch that defines 
its elaborate entranceway. At home, "Skyline Near Washington Square," 
"Skylights" and "Roofs of Washington Square" all focused on sights seen from 
the roof of his own studio. New York's characteristic chimney pots, skylights 
and rooftop water towers can still be seen throughout the city today, and the 
visitor in search of Hopper's New York need only look up to find shapes like 
those that fill these views out windows in such paintings as "Morning Sun" 
(1952).  
</P>
<P>
 His success in painting New York in watercolor soon led Hopper to treat 
similar subjects in oil. In "The City" (1927), he portrayed a corner of 
Washington Square, where his beloved row houses appear to be fending off 
encroaching skyscrapers. In 1932, he painted "November," "Washington Square" 
(the view south from his studio) and "City Roofs" (looking east from his own 
roof). Most of the architecture then visible from Hopper's studio window has 
changed. Today, besides the Washington Square Park itself, all that recalls 
what he painted is the Judson Memorial Baptist Church, with its amber-colored 
square tower topped by a cross. 
</P>
<P>
 HOPPER WAS DISMAYED AT the new construction taking place around the square. In 
the more than five decades that he lived adjacent to it, New York University 
moved in and replaced many of the old row houses with tall new buildings. Other 
urban development soon filled up the skyline beyond. Nonetheless, as late as 
1960, Hopper, who often sat in the park to soak up some sun, was inspired there 
to paint "People in the Sun," a canvas he then set in an imaginary Western 
landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 The observant pilgrim in search of Hopper's New York will delight in the 
massive city stoops with their heavy masonry and hefty cornices that figure in 
paintings such as "New York Pavements" (1924) and "Sunlight on Brownstones" 
(1956), which the artist based on the well-preserved brownstones in the west 
80s near Central Park. Always interested in architecture, Hopper once claimed 
the magazine editors wanted him to illustrate people "grimacing and gesturing" 
while "what I wanted to do was to paint sunlight on the side of a house." 
</P>
<P>
 Across town in the east 80s, some colorful remnants of Hopper's era remain. 
Though not the same establishment that suggested "Drug Store" (1927), Lascoff's 
Pharmacy is of the same genre and has been at the corner of Lexington Avenue 
and 82nd Street since 1931. Just one block north, across the avenue on the 
corner of 83rd Street, the Lexington Luncheonette is so evocative of the period 
that it is frequently chosen as a location for period films. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the theaters Hopper frequented so enthusiastically, only the now-shuttered 
Republic Theater on West 42nd Street, where he watched burlesque performances 
in preparation for his canvas "Girlie Show" (1941), still stands. Hopper 
sketched what he wanted of the architecture here, then came home and had his 
58-year-old wife, the artist Josephine Nivison Hopper, pose for the striptease 
dancer. (The Republic is being restored and is scheduled to reopen next year as 
the New Victory Theater.) 
</P>
<P>
 Central Park, which also provided Hopper with material, looks much the same as 
it did when he represented it. In 1935, he painted "Shakespeare at Dusk," 
featuring a monument to the bard, located on the Mall just north of the 
Children's Zoo at 66th Street, against the backdrop of a menacing skyline. The 
mood of melancholy at sunset that Hopper captured endures. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years later, another Central Park scene inspired Hopper's "Bridle Path." 
Three equestrians are about to pass through the dark foreboding space beneath a 
bridge (near 72nd Street on the park's western edge). Today, riders continue to 
enjoy the park's six miles of bridle paths: Claremont Riding Academy, a stable 
at 175 West 89th St., still has horses available for riding through the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopper especially enjoyed searching for subjects from the "El" (elevated 
train). He eagerly peeped into apartments and lofts along the route, finding 
inspiration for such paintings as "Night Windows" (1928), "Office at Night" 
(1940) and "Conference at Night" (1949). The last El trains were demolished 
during the 1950s, but anyone wanting to experience the "Hopper effect" can take 
Metro North trains from Grand Central Station north. After leaving the tunnel 
at 96th Street, one can peer into buildings along the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 The point where the trains go underground between 96th and 97th streets on 
Park Avenue inspired Hopper's 1946 canvas "Approaching a City." Hopper claimed 
that he wanted to convey "interest, curiosity, fear -- the emotions one has 
arriving by train into a strange city." The tracks bordered by high-rise 
buildings along upper Park Avenue through Harlem attracted the painter, who had 
adored railroads since boyhood and had often made trains a theme of his 
pictures. "To me," he once remarked, "the most important thing is the sense of 
going on." GUIDEBOOK: Hopper's New York

 Seeing Hopper's paintings: Excellent examples of the artist's work, including 
scenes of New York, are usually on view in Manhattan at the Metropolitan Museum 
of Art, 5th Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 879-5500; the Museum of Modern Art, 11 
West 53rd St., (212) 708-9400; the Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison 
Ave., (212) 570-3676 and The Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, 
(718) 638-5000. The Whitney received a huge bequest of Hopper's works from the 
artist's widow in 1968. Although Hopper enthusiasts will be disappointed to 
find that the Whitney only occasionally puts a small selection of this bequest 
on view, the museum has scheduled a major Hopper show for next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopper's Home: The Hopper House Landmark Preservation Foundation, 82 N. 
Broadway, Nyack, (914) 358-0774, offers art classes and exhibitions by artists. 
The center is open 1 to 5 p.m., weekends only; admission is free, but a

TRAVELING IN STYLE; LAST STOP; A WALK IN THE WOODS TO WALDEN POND; THOREAU 
DIDN'T INVENT THIS CELEBRATED BODY OF WATER. YEARS BEFORE HE MOVED THERE, 
ANOTHER NOTED WRITER ENJOYED ITS CHARMS.

 Sometimes the footsteps of the famous overlap. When Henry David Thoreau built 
his cabin in 1845 at Walden Pond, near Concord, Mass., the pond itself and the 
surrounding woods were already well-known to his contemporaries. Ralph Waldo 
Emerson owned the land on which the pond stood, and Emerson, Nathaniel 
Hawthorne, the writer and editor Margaret Fuller and other literary lights of 
the time frequented the area. In the edited excerpt below, Hawthorne 
(1804-1864) -- who had not yet written "The Scarlet Letter," "The House of the 
Seven Gables," "The Marble Faun" and the other books by which he is remembered 
-- describes a stroll through the autumn-bright woods and a visit to the pond 
in the early 1840s. The most surprising aspect of the account , which was 
written in 1843, is the author's discovery of a small settlement of 
environmentally sensitive Irish railroad workers living at the edge of the 
pond.  
</P>

<P>
 Yesterday afternoon . . . I took a solitary walk to Walden Pond. It was a 
cool, north-west windy day, with heavy clouds rolling and tumbling about the 
sky, but still a prevalence of genial autumn sunshine. The fields are still 
green, and the great masses of the woods have not yet assumed their 
many-colored garments; but here and there, are solitary oaks of a deep, 
substantial red, or maples of a more brilliant hue, or chestnuts, either yellow 
or of a tenderer green than in summer. Some trees seem to return to their hue 
of May or early July, before they put on the brighter autumnal tints. In some 
places, along the borders of low and moist land, a whole range of trees were 
clothed in the perfect gorgeousness of autumn, of all shades of brilliant 
color, looking like the palette on which Nature was arranging the tints 
wherewith to paint a picture. These hues appeared to be thrown together without 
design; and yet there was perfect harmony among them, and a softness and 
delicacy made up of a thousand different brightnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Walden Pond was clear and beautiful, as usual. In a small and secluded dell, 
that opens upon the most beautiful cove of the whole lake, there is a little 
hamlet of huts or shanties, inhabited by the Irish people who are at work upon 
the rail-road. There are three or four of these habitations, the very rudest, I 
should imagine, that civilized men ever made for themselves, constructed of 
rough boards, with protruding ends. Against some of them the earth is heaped up 
to the roof, or nearly so; and when the grass has had time to sprout upon them, 
they will look like small natural hillocks, or a species of ant-hill, or 
something in which Nature has a larger share than man. These huts are placed 
beneath the trees (oaks, walnuts and white pines), wherever the trunks give 
them space to stand; and by thus adapting themselves to the natural interstices 
instead of making new ones, they do not break or disturb the solitude and 
seclusion of the place. Voices are heard, and the shouts and laughter of 
children, who play about like sunbeams that come down through the branches. 
Women are washing beneath the trees, and long lines of whitened clothes are 
extended from tree to tree, fluttering and gambolling in the breeze. A pig, in 
a stye even more extemporary than the shanties, is grunting, and poking his 
snout through the clefts of his habitation. The household pots and kettles are 
seen at the doors, and a glance within shows the rough benches that serve for 
chairs, and the bed upon the floor. The visiter's nose takes notice of the 
fragrance of a pipe. And yet, with all these homely items, the repose and 
sanctity of the old wood do not seem to be destroyed or prophaned; she 
overshadows these poor people, and assimilates them, somehow or other, to the 
character of her natural inhabitants. Their presence did not shock me, any more 
than if I had merely discovered a squirrel's nest in a tree. 
</P>
<P>
 I have seldom seen anything more beautiful than the cove, on the border of 
which the huts are situated; and the more I looked, the lovelier it grew. The 
trees overshadowed it deeply; but on one side there was some brilliant 
shrubbery which seemed to light up the whole picture with the effect of a sweet 
and melancholy smile. I felt as if the spirits were there -- or as if these 
shrubs had a spiritual life -- in short, the impression was undefinable; and 
after gazing and musing a good while, I retraced my steps through the Irish 
hamlet, and plodded on along a wood-path. 
</P>
<P>
 According to my invariable custom, I mistook my way, and emerging upon a road, 
I turned my back, instead of my face, toward Concord, and walked on very 
diligently, till a guide-board informed me of my mistake. I then turned about, 
and was shortly overtaken by an old yeoman in a chaise, who kindly offered me a 
ride, and shortly set me down in the village.

MOLESTATION ALLEGATIONS DIM STAR OF O.C. PRIEST; DIOCESE: POPULAR SANTA 
MARGARITA PRINCIPAL DENIES ABUSES AT MATER DEI. HE QUIT AMID CHURCH 
INVESTIGATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Nine months after one of Orange County's best-known priests abruptly quit as 
the founding principal of Santa Margarita High School, allegations have 
surfaced that Msgr. Michael Harris sexually molested students in his office 
when he held the same job at Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
 In a lawsuit filed last month in Orange County Superior Court, David A. Price, 
now 29, claims that the priest regularly abused him during school hours over 
the four years he attended Mater Dei. Price has contended the priest would 
summon him to his office with special hall passes delivered to his classes, and 
would then force him to engage in sex acts. 
</P>
<P>
 Through his attorney, Harris "flatly and completely" denied the lawsuit's 
allegations last week. His attorney also said there was no connection between 
Harris' sudden departure from Santa Margarita earlier this year and allegations 
of sexual misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange, which is also a target of 
Price's lawsuit, said they had not been formally served and could not comment. 
</P>
<P>
 But diocesan officials on Friday disclosed for the first time that Harris had 
been asked to take a leave of absence in January while an investigation into 
similar allegations was underway. 
</P>
<P>
 They also revealed that Harris' right "to function as a priest" was revoked 
when he refused to abide by orders given him by Bishop Norman McFarland after 
the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The diocese investigated the matter and as a result he was told to seek 
spiritual and medical treatment," said Msgr. Lawrence Baird, the diocese 
spokesman. Baird said Harris is presently studying for a graduate degree in 
education at Pepperdine University. 
</P>
<P>
 With the filing of the latest suit, Harris becomes the eighth Orange County 
priest or brother known to have been charged or sued over the past six years 
for allegedly committing sexual improprieties with minors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 According to court documents and interviews with Price, family members of 
other alleged victims and church officials, the undoing of Father Harris began 
when the mother of another former Mater Dei student quietly approached diocesan 
officials last December. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenora Colice told church officials that she had asked Harris to pay special 
attention to her troubled teen-age son. Instead, she said, her son related his 
allegations that the priest had molested him during his junior and senior 
years. And she had in hand what she thought was an apology. 
</P>
<P>
 After her son died of AIDS last year, Colice wrote Harris to confront him with 
her son's allegations, and to say she could never forgive him. In his Dec. 9 
response, Harris wrote: "Through counseling and other resources I have 
endeavored to work through many things. . . . It may not be any consolation, 
but I am very sorry." 
</P>
<P>
 John Barnett, Harris' personal attorney, said the letter that Harris wrote to 
Lenora Colice is not "an admission of any misconduct whatsoever. . . . A person 
with less sensitivity would have said, 'Your son is a liar.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Father Harris counseled thousands of students and he flatly denies the 
allegations that have been lodged against him," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnett, a prominent criminal defense attorney, said Harris stepped down 
because of his "desire to have a change in his life" after two decades of 
service. There was no connection between Harris' decision to leave Santa 
Margarita High and the allegations of sexual abuse, Barnett said. 
</P>
<P>
 In January -- only weeks after Colice's talk with the diocese -- Harris 
unexpectedly took an indefinite leave of absence from his high-profile job at 
Santa Margarita High School, the state-of-the-art, $26-million gem of the 
Catholic school system in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris told students and friends that he needed a break from the stress of his 
job. There was no mention of any allegation of sexual misdeeds, or of any 
pressure from his superiors to take a leave of absence. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until March, two months after Harris quit, that diocesan officials 
publicly disclosed that he had been accused of "sexual improprieties." Church 
officials said then that Harris denied the charges, and they had been unable to 
locate "anyone who has any allegation to make of sexual misconduct with him or 
her by Msgr. Harris." 
</P>
<P>
 In June, yet another Mater Dei student from the same era came forward -- David 
Price. Long before he approached church authorities, Price had been seeing a 
therapist. Last December, about the same time that Colice was complaining to 
the diocese, Price's therapist filed a report with the Orange County Social 
Services Agency accusing Harris of child molestation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the lawsuit he filed in mid-September, Price alleged that he had repressed 
all memory of the incidents until August, 1993, when it gradually came back to 
him, and he started seeing a psychotherapist. 
</P>
<P>
 Price said his contact with Harris began when his stepmother turned to the 
church and the priest for help. His father had died five years earlier, and his 
stepmother thought he needed counseling and a strong, stable man to guide him. 
David Price was the 10th of her 14 stepchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Harris was the principal of Mater Dei, where the boy was a 
freshman. Harris was a star of the Catholic school system, heading one of its 
best-loved institutions. When Harris paid special attention to her son -- and 
to her -- the boy's mother felt flattered. 
</P>
<P>
 But behind the closed door of his office at Mater Dei, Harris' special 
attention turned abusive, the lawsuit charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Price said the priest "told me it was our secret; that it was part of 
counseling. I saw that my mother adored him, how other people looked up to him. 
Here I was a special kid. 
</P>
<P>
 "There'd be 5,000 people at a football game and he'd spot me in the crowd and 
mouth, 'Hi, David,' " said Price, who is targeting both Harris and the diocese 
in his lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Confused and unsure, Price said, he never told anyone -- until he sought 
psychological help in late 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 In June of this year, Price and his therapist told diocesan officials of 
Price's molestation allegations. Price said church officials repeatedly assured 
them that Harris' record was spotless. They dismissed Colice's allegations as 
"hearsay," Price said. Soon after, Price decided to sue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time everyone realized there is a dark side we have to deal with and the 
Catholic Church is no exception," said Theodore S. Wentworth, Price's 
Irvine-based attorney. "What we have here is a major, major betrayal." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For Price, the alleged betrayal started at home. Price's birth mother died of 
pancreatic cancer when he was 5, leaving 14 children. His father remarried a 
quadriplegic woman three years later. Six weeks after their marriage, his 
father died of a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
 His stepmother, the 14 children now hers to raise, turned to the church for 
help. Priests were regular dinner guests and Price spent much of his childhood 
serving as an altar boy and working in the local parish rectory. Price's 
stepmother became friends with Father Harris, the young principal of Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris was in his early 30s then. A hometown boy, he grew up in Brea. His 
mother was Catholic and his father was Jewish. He followed his mother's faith, 
attending Mater Dei, then St. John's Seminary in Camarillo. He was ordained as 
a priest in 1972. He served first as a religion teacher at Bishop Amat High 
School and associate pastor at Immaculate Conception Church in Monrovia, where 
he is remembered for sermons that were captivating and reverent beyond his 
young years. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in 1978, he became the principal of the county's premier high school. A 
decade later, he became the first principal of Santa Margarita, after helping 
to raise nearly half the $26 million spent building the school. 
</P>
<P>
 When Price entered Mater Dei as a freshman in 1979, his mother turned to 
Harris to help Price cope with the lingering loss of his father. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after, Price said, he received the first of what became monthly hall 
passes from Harris' office. Harris started out talking from behind his desk, 
Price alleged, but soon sat on the couch next to Price, putting his arm around 
him and rubbing his chest. Price contends that such activity soon escalated 
into what the lawsuit contends was sexual molestation. 
</P>
<P>
 The next month, Price received another specially colored hall pass from 
Harris. This time Harris was more aggressive, Price alleged. After that the 
passes came about once a month. Sometimes Harris would pull the boy from class 
to go to the principal's diocese-owned home in Orange, according to Price and 
court documents. Once, Price said, he left class during a midterm exam that he 
never had to complete. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Price said he wrestled with feeling special because of the attention. Harris 
would single him out from a crowd of wealthier, more popular students for a hug 
and a chat. He wrote a glowing message in Price's freshman yearbook, thanking 
him for "being a great part of it all." 
</P>
<P>
 A devoted film buff, Harris would invite Price and his friends over to watch 
movies. Price said Harris had a projector set up in the wet bar of his home and 
he'd pull back curtains on his living room wall to screen favorite films. 
</P>
<P>
 "The man knew how to make you feel special," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 Price said he could never tell his stepmother, who died when he was 16. 
"Father Harris would take me to dinner, then he'd come in and kiss her before I 
even could. How in the world could I tell her? She adored him." 
</P>
<P>
 For Lenora Colice's boy, Vincent, it was almost the same story, she said. 
Colice said she had turned to Harris to counsel her four boys after a neighbor, 
a parish lay minister, molested them. The neighbor served five years in a state 
hospital, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris became almost like a member of the family, the shoulder Colice leaned 
on when her husband died of cancer, she said. He helped get Vincent, a mediocre 
student, into Mater Dei his junior year. The family was flattered by his 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "At a party you'd talk about him, it was like prestigious," Lenora Colice 
remembered. "People would say, 'You know Father Harris? You've actually had him 
in your home?' " 
</P>
<P>
 There was never a whisper of a problem. But after high school, Vincent Colice 
refused to go to church and began to lead a promiscuous gay life, his mother 
said. Then in 1992, shortly after his condition was diagnosed as AIDS, his 
mother suggested he return to the church and seek counseling with Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll never forget. He blurted it out to me. Blurted it out in such an angry 
way, 'Father Harris molested me when I was young,' " Colice remembered. "He 
(Vincent) swore me to secrecy." 
</P>
<P>
 Then after he died, Colice couldn't hold it in any longer and complained to 
the diocese. 
</P>
<P>
 Price said he began to come to terms with the alleged abuse after a traumatic 
life event sent him into therapy last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can live in denial a long, long time about this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He and Colice said they know they are facing an angry public assault for 
making their allegations about the widely popular and respected priest -- a man 
they still find it hard to hate. 
</P>
<P>
 Also named in Price's suit is Father Gary Pacheco, a Franciscan who worked at 
Saints Simon and Jude Roman Catholic Church in Huntington Beach in the late 
1970s. Pacheco allegedly molested Price at a friend's home, according to the 
suit. Pacheco has since left the order and could not be reached for comment. 
Diocesan officials said Pacheco was never under their direct supervision, and 
they had no comment about the allegations against him.

 EARLY VOTERS: Voters go to the polls Nov. 8, but a lot of people don't want to 
wait that long to cast their vote. In Orange County, the number of people who 
voted by absentee ballot has tripled over the last four general elections -- 
151,000 in 1992 -- and a record number is expected again this year. . . . 
Reason: Rules have changed so that anybody can use them, and political 
committees target the absentee vote. County registrar officials say that about 
83% of those returned are filled out properly and are acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 FOX HOUSE: When Fox TV wanted a coffeehouse as the hangout for its new show 
"Party of Five," they taped at some of the eight Diedrich Coffee houses in 
Orange County. If you see the show -- (Monday nights at 9 on KTTV Channel 11) 
-- the huge bean roaster is the one from Diedrich's in Tustin. Diedrich's from 
Newport Beach and Trabuco Canyon were use too. Says Diedrich spokeswoman 
Melinda Morgan: "They wanted a comfortable, relaxed, homey atmosphere. We've 
got it." 
</P>
<P>
 ICE BUDDIES: If you're not happy about having tickets to those Mighty Ducks or 
Kings games that went unplayed because of the lockout, Olympic skating champion 
Dorothy Hamill wants to give you a break. Just bring any of those tickets to 
her Ice Capades show -- Wednesday through Sunday at The Pond -- and she'll give 
you $4 off. Hamill, who owns the Ice Capades, skates in the show herself. She 
calls it "Hansel, Gretel, the Witch and the Cat."

 A retired sumo wrestler, known for his insatiable appetite, was arrested for 
grabbing a handbag from an elderly woman in downtown Tokyo because he needed 
money for food, police said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomohisa Fujino, 22, was arrested after he snatched a handbag containing 6,000 
yen ($60) from the 73-year-old woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Fujino, fighting under the ring name Hoshiryuma, climbed to the third-highest 
division in the sport but retired in 1990 because of back injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "I eat twice as much as the average person, and I couldn't keep it up," police 
quoted him as saying. 
</P>
<P>
 Fujino, who weighs more than 220 pounds, had been trying to make ends meet by 
doing odd jobs.

MIKE PENNER: CHARGERS TAKE RIGHT TURN; RAMS SEEK DIRECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Today, the San Diego Chargers are the toast of professional football, 5-0 for 
the first time since 1961, on the cover of Sports Illustrated for the first 
time since, when, Jack Kemp-to-Lance Alworth? 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, 80 miles up the freeway, the Rams are burnt toast again, 2-4 for 
the first time since 1993 . . . and before that, 1992 . . . and before that, 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
 (In 1991, the Rams went wild, threw caution to the wind and opened 3-4. They 
finished 3-13.) 
</P>
<P>
 Starring in their own twisted rendition of "Groundhog Day," in which every 
football season is exactly the same as the one before it, the Rams can't even 
get on the cover of RamPages anymore. RamPages, the official house organ of the 
Anaheim Ram franchise, folded in September, killed off by a stampede of 
backpedaling advertisers who were spooked by the sound of all those Baltimore 
Ram and St. Louis Ram rumors. 
</P>
<P>
 How does this happen? 
</P>
<P>
 How do the Chargers and Rams -- essentially mirror images of one another, all 
the way down to the uniform colors -- wind up as north and south poles of the 
NFL world? 
</P>
<P>
 What do the Chargers have that the Rams don't? 
</P>
<P>
 Compare and contrast: 
</P>
<P>
 Rams: Quarterbacked by Chris Miller, who is paid $3 million a year, can throw 
deep and had his 1993 season ruined by a bum knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Chargers: Quarterbacked by Stan Humphries, who earns $3 million a year, can 
throw deep and had his 1993 season ruined by a bum shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Rams: Rely heavily on a second-year running back, Jerome Bettis, who was taken 
in the first round of the 1993 draft and rushed for 1,429 yards as a rookie. 
</P>
<P>
 Chargers: Rely heavily on a second-year running back, Natrone Means, who was 
taken in the second round of the 1993 draft and rushed for 645 yards as a 
rookie. 
</P>
<P>
 Rams: Top two wide receivers are Flipper Anderson, a seven-year veteran who 
holds the NFL record for most pass-receiving yards (336) in a single game, and 
Jesse Hester, a nine-year veteran who has caught at least once pass in 68 
consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
 Chargers: Top two wide receivers are Mark Seay, a 1993 practice-squad player 
who was claimed on waivers from San Francisco, and Shawn Jefferson, a career 
underachiever bumped up into the starting lineup only after Anthony Miller and 
Nate Lewis became free agents and left. 
</P>
<P>
 Rams: Tight end Troy Drayton, considered one of the best raw talents in the 
1993 draft, averages a touchdown every 5.4 catches. 
</P>
<P>
 Chargers: Tight end is Alfred Pupunu. 
</P>
<P>
 Rams: Patchwork offensive line includes a Pro Bowl candidate at center, Bern 
Brostek; an aging right tackle, Jackie Slater; an ex-Charger at right guard, 
Leo Goeas. 
</P>
<P>
 Chargers: Patchwork offensive line includes a Pro Bowl candidate at center, 
Courtney Hall; an aging right tackle, Stan Brock; and an ex-Ram at right guard, 
Joe Milinichik. 
</P>
<P>
 Rams: Defense features a Pro Bowl-caliber pass rusher, Sean Gilbert; an 
outstanding young linebacker, Roman Phifer; and a bunch of off-season 
free-agent acquisitions assigned to plug gaping holes. 
</P>
<P>
 Chargers: Have the Pro Bowl pass rusher in Leslie O'Neal, have the young 
All-Pro linebacker in Junior Seau, are plugging elsewhere on defense with free 
agents Reuben Davis, Dennis Gibson, David Griggs and Dwayne Harper. 
</P>
<P>
 Rams: Coached by Chuck Knox, who was hired before the start of the 1992 
season, inheriting a 3-13 team but bringing 20 years of NFL head-coaching 
experience with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Chargers: Coach is Bobby Ross, who came to the Chargers before the 1992 season 
with not a down's worth of NFL head-coaching experience, taking on a team that 
finished 4-12 in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Repeat: One of these teams is 5-0 and the other is 2-4. 
</P>
<P>
 On the proverbial paper, it is hard to figure, especially when the next sheet 
features stats such as these: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Chargers are already 4-0 in their division, including road victories at 
Denver, Seattle and Los Angeles. The Rams are 0-3 in their division, having 
been outscored in those games, 72-37, and swept by Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Chargers are 24-13 under Ross. The Rams under Knox are virtually the 
reverse, 13-25. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Chargers beat Seattle in Seattle by 14 points. The Rams are averaging 
14 points per game. And they have yet to score more than 19. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Chargers rallied in the second half to beat the Broncos and the 
Raiders. The past two weeks, the Rams have blown second-half leads of five and 
14 points in losses to the Falcons and the Packers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Chargers-Chiefs game at Jack Murphy last Sunday drew 62,923. The 
Rams-Cardinals and Rams-Falcons games at Anaheim Stadium drew 67,568 combined. 
</P>
<P>
 In what was supposed to be a must-win year for Knox, Knox isn't, a predicament 
compounded tenfold by the excitement to the south. 
</P>
<P>
 While Knox winces and repeats, on cue, that he knew coming in that this thing 
wouldn't be turned around overnight, Ross continues to provide evidence to the 
contrary. In less than 2 1/2 seasons, Ross has turned the Chargers around twice 
-- first from 4-12 to 11-5 and now from 8-8 last season to 5-0. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a right way and a wrong way to rebuild football teams, and the wrong 
way is to run the ball up the middle three times from the one-yard line and 
then botch a field goal, as Knox did in the first Atlanta game . . . or fail to 
properly prepare your backup quarterback in practice before throwing him to the 
wolves, as Knox did in the second Atlanta game . . . or climbing into a 
second-half shell and calling goal-line plays so predictable that the defense 
is shouting "Pitch! Pitch!" before the ball is pitched, as Knox did in the 
Green Bay game. 
</P>
<P>
 These Rams should be 4-2, would be 4-2 were it not for such muddled pregame 
and midgame decision-making. Instead, they are 2-4, same old same old, staring 
up from the bottom of that hole again, back to 
maybe-with-some-luck-we-can-salvage-the-season time, just like clockwork. 
</P>
<P>
 How do you rebuild a football team in shorter time than a presidential term? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, you can gamble on fourth down in the fourth quarter against the Raiders, 
and send your hobbled quarterback in there for one last inspirational stand, 
and send a dramatic message to your players that the idea is to play to win -- 
rather than not to lose. Or you can plow Jerome Bettis into the line 32 times a 
game. The choice is yours. 
</P>
<P>
 The choice is yours.

RAMS BELIEVE THAT THIRD TIME'S THE HARM; PRO FOOTBALL: THEY HOPE TO BEAT GIANTS 
TODAY AND AVOID REPEAT OF LAST SEASON'S THREE-GAME LOSING STREAK.

<P>
 It might take some imagination, but view today's game against the New York 
Giants in Anaheim Stadium as the Rams (2-4) do. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jim Erkenbeck, Ram offensive line coach: "The approach Chuck Knox and 
everybody on this team is taking is that this is like a playoff game. We are 
overly committed to winning this one." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Joe Vitt, Ram assistant head coach: "No question, this game is critical 
for us. We've talked about it all week long -- this is like a playoff game for 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Wayne Sevier, Ram special teams coach: "That's the way we're talking, and 
I hope the players are listening. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hoping that I'm right, that this is a good football team that is just not 
quite getting it done, as opposed to a team that could be 2-5 or 2-6 at the 
break." 
</P>
<P>
 Two more victories before their bye and the Rams would be at .500 for the 
first time so late in the season since 1989, when they opened 5-3 on their way 
to an 11-5 finish and a playoff appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Two victories in a row, however, have not been accomplished by this team since 
1991, when the Rams defeated Green Bay at home, took a week off for a bye and 
then beat San Diego at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last two games were important, but not critical," Erkenbeck said. "This 
is different." 
</P>
<P>
 A loss today to the Giants (3-2), and the Rams will have lost three in a row 
in dropping to 2-5 -- as they did a year ago after opening 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "And even though five losses doesn't keep you out of the playoffs, your team 
psyche at 2-5 is a whole new deal and then you have to go on the road to play," 
Sevier said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants, stung by a loss to Minnesota on Monday night and forced to make 
the cross-country trek to California, have also lost two games in a row and 
have never had much success against the Rams. The Rams hold a 21-10 series 
advantage, including five victories in their last seven meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox has a 5-0 record at home against the Giants, but he has never had to play 
New York with Wayne Gandy and Chuck Belin starting on the offensive line. 
Jackie Slater is sidelined because of an arm injury and Gandy will make his 
first NFL start. Center Bern Brostek is on crutches because of a broken bone in 
his leg, and guard Tom Newberry is now playing center, requiring Belin to make 
his first NFL start. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put that in our calculations of what we want to do," said Chick Harris, 
Ram offensive coordinator. "But these people know they have to step up, play a 
hell of a game so there's no drop-off from what we've been getting." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams will try to run against the Giants, who are giving up only 2.9 yards 
per rush. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are very difficult to run against," Knox said. "People have been 
throwing the ball a lot against the Giants because they gave up trying to run 
against them." 
</P>
<P>
 Teams have also been passing against the Giants because their secondary has 
played poorly. Before this season, in their last 49 regular-season games the 
Giants saw only one opposing quarterback -- Steve DeBerg -- pass for more than 
300 yards against them. In five games this year, Randall Cunningham and John 
Friesz have surpassed that mark, and Warren Moon had 299 yards in Monday 
night's victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams will start Chris Miller at quarterback. He has recovered from a 
shoulder injury suffered on Sept. 18 against San Francisco. Miller has 
struggled this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants will counter at quarterback with Dave Brown, who has thrown five 
interceptions in the last two games, two of which were returned for touchdowns. 
Running back Rodney Hampton, who ran 41 times for 134 yards in the Giants' 
20-10 victory over the Rams in Giants Stadium last season and who is supposed 
to take the heat off Brown, has suffered from a kidney injury. Hampton returned 
last week and ran 13 times for 27 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must give Brown more support in the running game," Giant Coach Dan Reeves 
said. "Our passing is not at the stage now where it can carry us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ram defense, although effective recently, ranks last in the NFL in 
stopping the opposition on third down. The Giants' offense, meanwhile, has 
given up an NFC-high 19 sacks, while ranking 27th in the league in first downs 
and total yards gained per game.

CROSS-COUNTRY / ORANGE COUNTY CHAMPIONSHIPS; MATER DEI, IRVINE PROVE THE VALUE 
OF LEARNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT FARMER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mater Dei boys' and Irvine girls' cross-country teams proved something 
while winning the Orange County Championship sweepstakes races Saturday at 
Irvine Regional Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs learned to be patient. The Vaqueros got a strong understanding of 
how to handle the pressure of being the favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei, ranked second in The Times preseason county poll, had slipped out 
of the top 10 and appeared headed downward because of injuries. The Monarchs 
(99 points) outlasted Orange (105) for top honors on the three-mile course. 
</P>
<P>
 Katella, the county's top-ranked cross-country team, was third with 125 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine, ranked third in the State large-school coaches poll, turned back Sea 
View League-rival El Toro, 103-109. Edison, the defending champion, was third 
with 118 points. 
</P>
<P>
 In the boys' race, Adalberto Sanchez of Capistrano Valley put aside any 
questions about the individual title within the race's first 400 meters. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is how I always start," said Sanchez, runner-up in this race last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did start out a little bit faster than usual today," said Sanchez of his 
eagerness for his first county title. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez won the race in 15 minutes 13 seconds. He was followed by Orange 
senior Glen Busch (15:28), Woodbridge junior Ross Venook (15:36) and Mission 
Viejo senior Andy Morgan (15:38). 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the tight pack of Matt Wickersham, Daniel Gonzalez and Brian 
Mitzel, who crossed the line in 18th, 19th and 20th place, that secured the 
team title for the Monarchs. 
</P>
<P>
 "You would have every reason to," said third-year Coach Rick Martinez when 
asked if he doubted his team's chances. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the beginning of the season, we were taking it on the chin real badly with 
all the injuries." 
</P>
<P>
 The return of Dan Kozak from a stress fracture in his shin and Gonzalez from a 
groin strain proved to be the right combination for Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last two weeks we have just been focusing in on this day," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls' race unfolded much differently, as Esperanza's Courtney Pugmire and 
Buena Park's Heather Garritson led the pack through the first two miles. Corona 
del Mar senior Tracy Clark slowly edged to the front, moving past Pugmire with 
a half-mile left before pulling away to victory in 17:36. 
</P>
<P>
 "You never know what people are going to do, so I just ran my own race and 
played it by ear," said Clark, who has won invitational races at Laguna Hills, 
Woodbridge, Dana Hills and Stanford in addition to the county title this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know I had it won until the end," said Clark, who held off one of 
the state's finest 800 meter runners in Pugmire. 
</P>
<P>
 Pugmire (17:44) held off Garritson (17:54) for second place. Santa Ana Valley 
senior Eliaser Estrada (18:01) and Irvine junior Jessica Corbin (18:08) rounded 
out the top five. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vaqueros were the only team to place three runners among the top 20 
individual finishers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very pleased with the way they responded to the pressure and ran 
aggressively," Irvine Coach Randy Rossi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine's Erin Livermore (18:53) and Anna Kaisa-Niemi (18:57) finished 12th and 
13th. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were all very nervous before the race, but you could see the intensity 
was there," said Rossi, whose team is the defending State Division I champion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vaqueros avenged an eighth-place team finish in last season's county race 
as well as shaking off a 23-32 league loss to Corona del Mar last week with the 
victory.

ROUNDUP; SEA KINGS FALL TO WILSON IN WATER POLO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Long Beach Wilson took a 5-1 lead in the first half and held on to beat Corona 
del Mar, 11-6, in the final of the Southern California Invitational water polo 
tournament Saturday at Long Beach State. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson converted on six of its 10 man-advantage opportunities, including five 
of the first seven. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins (14-2) led, 3-0, at the end of the first quarter. Pat Cochran 
scored two minutes into the game and Adam Wright scored two goals about a 
minute apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Micah Miller scored on an assist from Wright for a 4-0 advantage before the 
Sea Kings (14-4) scored. Kevin Tucker beat Wilson goalie Nick Hill with five 
minutes 30 seconds left in the second quarter to cut the deficit to 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Armato and Peter Joseph added two more goals for Wilson late in the 
quarter with a man-advantage before Tucker scored his second goal to pull the 
Sea Kings as close as 6-2 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams played swarming defense throughout most of the third quarter. But 
with two minutes left, Armato scored his second goal, followed by two more by 
Wright within the last minute and a half to give Wilson a 9-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar battled back in the fourth quarter, scoring four of the first 
five goals. James Palda scored on an assist from Adam McFarland less than one 
minute into the quarter and Neil Hueston scored on an assist from Tucker with 
about five minutes left to pull the Sea Kings to within 9-4. 
</P>
<P>
 After Wilson's Rick Westberg scored with four minutes left, McFarland scored, 
followed by Hueston's penalty shot goal, which cut the lead to 10-6 with 2:45 
left. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Wilson) played well," Corona del Mar Coach John Vargas said. "We just didn't 
play as well as they did." 
</P>
<P>
 In the third-place game: 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente 15, San Diego Coronado 8 -- Andy Bailey had five goals and Jim 
Farley had three to lead San Clemente.

death to lead Foothill to a fifth-place finish. Brown had seven goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar 7, San Clemente 5 -- Neil Hueston and Mike Bise each scored in 
the fourth quarter for Corona del Mar (11-3) in a semifinal. Hueston had two 
goals in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 In the championship pool of the North Orange County tournament: 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa 7, Newport Harbor 6 -- Ryan Dandy scored two goals as Costa Mesa, 
2-0 in the championship pool, won the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor 9, Tustin 6 -- Mike Peetz scored three goals and Scott Stickler 
and Gabe Wyatt added two each for Newport Harbor (8-8), which finished second. 
</P>
<P>
 In other games at the North Orange County tournament: 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda 9, Laguna Beach 5 -- Tad Murphy scored four goals for Brea-Olinda 
(17-3), ranked sixth. Mike Marriner had 12 saves for Laguna Beach (13-7). 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach 6, Whittier La Serna 5 -- Jason Geiger scored the winning goal 
late in the fourth quarter for Laguna Beach (13-5). 
</P>
<P>
 In nonleague volleyball: 
</P>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel 3, Marina 0 -- Courtney Owens had 14 kills to lead Calvary

COMMUNITY COLLEGE ROUNDUP; FULLERTON'S VICTORY OVER SADDLEBACK ISN'T THING OF 
BEAUTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a night when neither coach was happy with the way his team played, 
Fullerton's Gene Murphy found the most important aspect -- the final score. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton beat Saddleback, 35-19, in a Mission Conference Central Division 
game Saturday at Fullerton District Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was thing of beauty," Murphy said, sarcastically. "But the true thing of 
beauty is the scoreboard. It's a roller-coaster ride each. I know I feel a lot 
better than I did last week at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton lost to Cerritos, 34-19, last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hornets (2-2-1, 1-0) opened a 17-0 lead Saturday with the help of 
quarterback Marc O'Brien, who scored on runs of 41 and one yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback narrowed the lead to 17-10 early in the third and had a chance to 
score again. The Gauchos reached the Fullerton five with about four minutes 
left in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 But an illegal procedure penalty moved the Gauchos back to the 10. Quarterback 
Pat Wood threw two passes that fell incomplete, and on third down, Wood 
scrambled three yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback tried some chicanery on fourth down with a halfback pass from Greg 
Payne back to quarterback Wood, but Wood was covered and the ball fell 
incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback reached the Fullerton 25 on its next possession but its field-goal 
try was blocked. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the real defense shows up and played their butts off," Murphy said, 
"they did a great job." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton then put the game away with three four-quarter touchdowns. Jeff 
Willis scored on a one-yard run with 11:58 left and Elphamous Malbrue scored on 
four-yard run with 2:28 left. 
</P>
<P>
 James Hartford added a 45-yard kickoff return for a touchdown off a botched 
onside kick try with 1:16 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Joshua Payseno scored on two one-yard runs for Saddleback (0-4-1, 0-1-1). 
</P>
<P>
 In another Mission Conference game: 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego Mesa 28, Orange Coast 21 -- Shon King caught touchdown passes of six 
and 62 yards from Aaron Buckner in the last six minutes to lift host Mesa. Jeff 
Clayton rushed for 115 yards and two touchdowns, and became OCC's all-time 
leading rusher with 1,983, breaking Tony Accomando's record of 1,873 set in 
1974-75. 
</P>
<P>
 King caught 12 passes for 292 yards for Mesa (3-2, 3-1). 
</P>
<P>
 At the Santa Barbara Community College Cross-Country Invitational: 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Coast women finish first -- Erin Remy finished third with a time of 
19:32 at Shoreline Park to lead Orange Coast, which finished first with 111 
points. Ventura finished second with 118 points and Rancho Santiago (147) 
placed fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Pelay finished 11th and Carrie Appell was 14th for the Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago (115) finished third in the men's division behind champion 
Glendale (24). Orange Coast finished in eight place. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Hancock was the highest finisher for the Pirates. He finished 26th with a 
time of 22:51. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Cuesta water polo tournament: 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West takes championship -- Golden West (18-1) swept three pool-play 
games to win the Cuesta tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryk Wormgoor had eight goals in the Golden West's victories over Cuesta, 14-6, 
West Valley, 15-6, and Diablo Valley, 11-9. STEVE KRESAL

CHAPMAN COMES BACK, BUT NOT FAR ENOUGH IN 30-20 LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once again, Chapman fell behind against one of the better football teams in 
the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, the Panthers rallied to tie the score with spectacular plays. But 
this time, the opponent, Occidental, had the time and the ability to respond. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, Occidental took control in the fourth quarter, winning, 30-20, in 
front of 2,100 at Patterson Field. 
</P>
<P>
 Occidental (5-0) became the first team to beat Chapman (3-1-1) in the 
Panthers' first football season since 1932, and although it was a nonconference 
victory, the Tigers celebrated as if they had beaten USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Occidental quarterback Davin Lundquist, who passed for 194 yards and a 
touchdown and rushed for 105 yards and two more scores, admitted beating 
Chapman was extra special. 
</P>
<P>
 "We might not celebrate this much usually," Lundquist said. "But it's 5-0; it 
feels good." 
</P>
<P>
 For Chapman, the feeling was as unpleasant as it was unfamiliar. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers, who rallied to tie Redlands, 14-14, two weeks ago, couldn't 
overcome their own mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made too many critical mistakes against too good a team," Chapman Coach 
Ken Visser said. 
</P>
<P>
 Occidental scored 14 first-half points after Chapman errors -- a muffed punt 
and a fumble -- and took leads of 13-0 and 20-6 in the first half, before the 
Panthers got back into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers rallied with the kind of big plays that would make highlight 
films if there were such a thing in Division III football. 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar Ford ran 83 yards for a touchdown with 10 minutes 30 seconds left in the 
first quarter to make it 13-6. Ford ran untouched the first 33 yards of the run 
and then slowed near midfield to shake a defender and seemingly shifted into 
another gear as he pulled away for the end zone.  
</P>
<P>
 Occidental took a 20-6 lead when it scored on a one-play, 27-yard drive, after 
Panther quarterback Curtis Robinson fumbled a snap. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman's Darnell Rubin almost returned the kickoff for a touchdown. He was 
tripped up at the Tiger 16-yard line after breaking a tackle in which Todd 
Adamson had pulled him nearly to the ground by the back of the jersey.  
</P>
<P>
 Darnell Morgan soon scored on a one-yard run to make it 20-13. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman had a chance to tie the score late in the half when Rubin wrestled a 
long pass from Occidental defensive backs in the end zone. The play was 
nullified by a holding penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the second half, however, Chapman's Michael Simmons recovered a 
fumbled snap at the Occidental 34 and the Panthers scored on a one-yard run by 
Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chapman couldn't move the ball after that. Robinson might have struggled 
because of lingering effects from a shoulder separation he suffered in the 
season opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson under threw his receivers all night and completed only three of 12 
passes for 42 yards with one interception. He was sacked five times and rushed 
for minus nine yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in the fourth quarter, he was knocked out of the game with another 
injury. Visser said he didn't know what the injury was.

RANCHO SANTIAGO GOES ON OFFENSIVE, TOPS GOLDEN WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago, unable to move the ball much on the ground, turned to its 
big-play offense Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 That and a punishing effort by the Dons' defense resulted in a 35-14 victory 
over Golden West in a Mission Conference game at Santa Ana Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago held Golden West to 281 yards total offense, but only 99 
rushing. Things were made somewhat easier when Mark Crowley, the Rustlers' top 
rusher, severely sprained his left ankle on his first carry. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons were especially tough on Golden West quarterback Brian Schneider, who 
was sacked six times for minus-45 yards. Schneider was 12 of 27 for 121 yards, 
but only four of 16 for 13 yards in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago experienced similar frustrations moving the ball. The Dons 
rushed for 157 yards, 80 less than their average. 
</P>
<P>
 But quarterback Simon Fuentes had three touchdown passes, including ones for 
68 and 64 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The 68-yarder was to tight end Chad Flick. The Dons had a second and eight and 
were in a two-tight end set. Fuentes looked at tight end Casey Shine on the 
right, then threw to his left to Flick, who was open about 15 yards down field. 
Flick outran the Golden West defenders the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chad was my second look," Fuentes said. "The safety just bit when I looked at 
Casey." 
</P>
<P>
 The play put Rancho Santiago ahead, 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons went ahead, 28-7, thanks to some fine moves by Fuentes and Ace 
Riggins. Fuentes got away from the Golden West rush and threw about 10 yards up 
field to Riggins, who then broke a tackle along the left sideline. Riggins cut 
back to the middle and beat two Golden West defenders into the end zone for a 
64-yard pass play with 4:33 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuentes' 16-yard touchdown pass to Jon Daniels with 2:54 left in the half gave 
the Dons a 21-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuentes was seven of 12 for 222 yards and no interceptions.

WHEN THE PARKS GO DARK; NIGHT-SHIFT WORKERS TOIL AT THE MUNDANE BEHIND THE 
MAGIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's been more than an hour since Disneyland's public address system announced 
that the park had closed, but visitors are still strolling slowly past the 
shops on Main Street toward the park's nearly deserted parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's time to put the happiest place on Earth to bed, but there's little time 
for sweet dreams. And, as security guards gently guide stragglers from the 
park, a small army of employees emerges from well-hidden maintenance depots 
scattered throughout the Anaheim tourist attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 Two scuba divers slip from a worn rowboat into the cool, dark waters of the 
submarine attraction to perform underwater surgery on a worn O-ring in a 
pneumatically powered lobster's right claw. Huge pumps buried in the bowels of 
Splash Mountain quickly suck 475,000 gallons of water from the attraction as 
maintenance men don hip waders to start a nightly inspection of the ride's 
mechanical innards. 
</P>
<P>
 Two employees armed with metal cleaner and rags begin the mind-numbing task of 
polishing away fingerprints from 40 brass poles on Fantasyland's carousel. 
Under the lights at Autopia, mechanics pop the hoods and yank the starter cords 
on 40 pint-sized cars as a prelude to a marathon oil change. 
</P>
<P>
 After hours, the magic and mystery that fuel a youngster's dreams give way to 
the mundane but necessary task of keeping amusement parks clean and functional. 
Theatrical lighting is replaced by harsh but practical fluorescent lights, and 
main streets become thoroughfares for maintenance vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parks are weird places when they're not open," Bob Ochsner, manager of public 
relations at Knott's Berry Farm, says during an early morning stroll through 
the deserted Buena Park attraction. "They're built to have noise and crowds of 
people in them. It's eerie when they're empty." 
</P>
<P>
 During the peak summer months, Knott's daytime employee work force rises to 
about 1,000. But after the midnight hour, only about 100 janitorial, custodial 
and security employees are on hand.  
</P>
<P>
 And, there's a decidedly different pace at night in Southern California's 
tourist attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 During daylight hours, employees waltz to carefully choreographed show music. 
Knott's Berry Farm alone has six different soundtracks to set the musical mood. 
</P>
<P>
 But at night, the graveyard shift grooves to music of its own choice, 
delivered through boomboxes and Walkmans. Inside Knott's log ride on one recent 
morning it was Howard Stern pontificating on the radio. Over on Main Street in 
Disneyland, it was the Beach Boys on an oldies station. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Parks offer a handful of perks to help ease the hard fact that night-shift 
workers are out of sync with work-a-day world rhythms. Disneyland offers free 
coffee in the Westside Cafe, an employee eatery beneath the Haunted House. 
</P>
<P>
 Disneyland employees also are allowed to smoke outdoors at night. "It's one of 
the bows we make to the fact that the night shift is different," one Disneyland 
manager says recently as he lit a cigarette and exhaled into the cool night 
air. 
</P>
<P>
 At 3 a.m., Main Street is deserted, save for the Wonder Bread truck driver 
making dead-of-the-night deliveries to Disneyland's Plaza Pavilion and the 
solitary custodian who's hosing away the unwanted remainders of another busy 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 A sprinkle of theatrical lights shine atop Sleeping Beauty's castle, but most 
of the park is shrouded in darkness, interrupted only by harsher but practical 
spotlights. Portable electric generators sputter into action throughout the 
park, powering banks of work lights that shine on painters, electricians, 
welders and gardeners. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Johnson, who's worked the night shift at Disneyland for 23 years, says 
nighttime is the right time to work. "It's easier to get the work done because 
there's less bosses, less supervision," says Johnson, who dons a wet suit and 
scuba gear each night to repair underwater attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the night because it's cool," says Willie Lewis, 63, who's been 
cleaning up after Knott's visitors for 23 years. "I've done Ghost Town, Fiesta 
Village, been a janitor in the Chicken Restaurant and the Steakhouse. There 
ain't nothing in this place I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the best shift here," says Marcus Puente, 31, who's been hosing down 
Disneyland's Main Street for three years. "It's quieter and there are no 
disturbances." 
</P>
<P>
 With music blaring from a co-worker's boombox, Puente methodically makes his 
nightly five-hour trip from one end of Main Street to the other. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy to put water down," Puente says. "But you have to spend a lot of 
time pushing it around. By the time the park opens, there can't be a puddle 
left in the place." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many theme park veterans talk about a special bond that develops between 
employees and theme parks. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's still a lot of boyhood in us," says Fullerton resident Paul Anderson, 
a seven-year Disneyland employee who helps maintain the mechanical innards of 
attractions. "When I'm lubing rides, I'll sometimes climb inside the 
attractions and explore." 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Harper, a Navy veteran and former boxer, has spent the past five years 
supervising maintenance at Disneyland's Splash Mountain. "Most of us get pixie 
dust and never lose it," says Harper, 59. 
</P>
<P>
 But theme park employees aren't immune to on-the-job and off-the-job concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 One Disneyland employee says he prefers the nighttime hours because it frees 
him to work on union affairs during the day. Another Disneyland employee fears 
that the company will eliminate full-time jobs by contracting janitorial and 
custodial work to third-party companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, 47, who works underwater, described his two-decade tenure at the park 
as "a job. . . . It could be anyplace, not just Disneyland. In the wintertime, 
it can be a major chore. You're in 46-degree water and you're freezing to 
death." 
</P>
<P>
 And that's just the clean, filtered water in the submarine ride. Divers face a 
much tougher task when it's time to maintain attractions hidden beneath murky 
water flowing around Tom Sawyer's Island. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's one of the lowest parts of the park, so all the trash and mud 
accumulates there," says maintenance diver Craig Whelen, 32. "You sort of have 
to feel your way around." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Hart, 38, knows that the nightly race to "bring (Disneyland) back up to 
show quality" is drawing to a close when crows roosting in the trees at the 
front gate begin to chatter. 
</P>
<P>
 As opening hour approaches, the nighttime calm gives way to a more frenetic 
pace. 
</P>
<P>
 By 5 a.m. on most days, Tim Davey, a 33-year-old mechanic's helper on the 
Calico Railroad at Knott's Berry Farm, is starting the four-hour process of 
readying the park's authentic locomotive for another day's service. 
</P>
<P>
 After the train's boilers heat up, Davey inspects the mechanical workings and 
tops off the train's fuel tanks -- because of environmental regulations it 
burns natural gas and oil rather than coal -- and blows sediment from the 
boiler. 
</P>
<P>
 Landscape crews also keep a wary eye on the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've only got a couple of hours to turn the park around each night," says 
Marty Keithley, operations manager on the night shift at Knott's Berry Farm. 
"When a tree dies, you have to pull it out at 5 o'clock in the morning and put 
in another one exactly like it so no one notices." 
</P>
<P>
 An hour before Knott's opens, the night operations manager meets with key 
department personnel to hear status reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Clustered in the deserted Calico Square, a dozen department managers report 
that the Tampico Tumbler will remain out of action for several weeks until 
crews finish a maintenance project. The Boomerang coaster also is down for 
maintenance, but crews say it will be ready when the gates open. 
</P>
<P>
 As a small crowd gathers outside Knott's main gate, the park's calm is 
shattered as employees conduct a safety check by setting the Montezooma's 
Revenge coaster in action. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before opening, Keithley's portable radio crackles with news that the 
freshly painted gates at the XK-1 flight simulator ride were drenched when 
crews forgot to shut off nearby sprinklers. Keithley orders crews to wipe off 
the wet paint, open the ride on time and repaint the gates at a later date. 
</P>
<P>
 With five minutes to spare, Knott's Berry Farm is ready for business. A guard 
opens the front gate, a three-man bluegrass band serenades visitors and a 
costumed Snoopy character snuggles up to younger guests. 
</P>
<P>
 Keithley, who's stood behind the gates on countless summer mornings, finds 
comfort in the clicking turnstiles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The families will go left to (the kids-oriented) Camp Snoopy, the teens will 
go left to the action rides, and the first-timers will wander around," Keithley 
says as the turnstiles swing. "It's all very predictable."

THE SUNDAY PROFILE; PARTING THE WATERS; ON MONDAY, LYNNE COX OF LOS ALAMITOS 
WILL ATTEMPT A SYMBOLIC 'PEACE SWIM' IN THE MIDDLE EAST'S GULF OF AQABA. IN 
SOME WAYS, IT'S A GOAL SHE'S BEEN BUILDING TO FOR 22 YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN HOWLETT, Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lynne Cox begins her final miles of training in U.S. waters by facing the 
shore and crashing backward into the surf. She is going against the current 
again, and she does it with a childlike grin you can see from the across the 
sand. 
</P>
<P>
 The regulars watching her from the pier wave at the Los Alamitos swimmer who, 
during 22 years of setting international endurance records, has become 
something of a hometown hero. 
</P>
<P>
 It started at the tender age of 15, when she shattered the women's and men's 
world records for swimming the English Channel. She went on to become the only 
person to brave 40-degree water and swim Russia's Bering Strait and has made 
history by crossing the Beagle Channel between Argentina and Chile, the Spree 
River between former East and West Berlin, the shark-infested waters of the 
Cape of Good Hope and Siberia's Lake Baikal, the world's deepest and coldest 
freshwater lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Cox and her half-dozen crew members are in Israel, where Monday she will 
mark a six-year quest by attempting a 14-mile swim across the Gulf of Aqaba -- 
a symbolic "peace swim" in waters that link Israel, Egypt and Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what it's going to take to get into Jordanian waters," she says 
after ripping off her blue goggles following the three-mile training swim. "It 
always comes down to the last minute. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "But after all of the work, it's always great to finally get into the water. 
It's like being an artist. You've put out all the paint, and you've gotten 
everything ready, and you can finally pick up the brush." 
</P>
<P>
 Quietly articulate, the 37-year-old brunette seems an interesting blend of 
political intellect and athletic ability. 
</P>
<P>
 She has thrown out the many medals and trophies collected over years of 
competitive swimming. She still lives with her parents, teaches swimming, 
lectures, does some writing. She makes it clear that she is not the kind of 
American athlete who shills for running shoes or breakfast cereal. All she 
wants, she says with a bashful smile, is a world without war. 
</P>
<P>
 For this swim, she finds a special irony in the fact that she will be stroking 
all 14 miles of the two-day effort against the current. 
</P>
<P>
 "They asked me if I wanted to change my course and swim the other way," says 
Cox, who scheduled the event to celebrate the Camp David accords and the 
ongoing peace process between Jordan and Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "But against the current really describes the whole thing," she says, "and the 
whole peace process." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Just three years after Albert Cox, a radiologist, and his wife, Estelle, an 
artist, moved Lynne and her swimming siblings to Southern California from New 
Hampshire in 1970, Lynne made her mark by swimming the English Channel. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents were a stable influence of encouragement," says Cox, whose brother 
David, 39, runs a recreation department. Sister Laura, 35, is a geneticist who 
coaches swimming, and sister Ruth, 32, coaches water polo and teaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember that they used to give us swimming lessons in the bathtub when we 
were really little," she says. "We started competing (in New Hampshire), but 
all of the good coaches were in California, so they moved us out here." 
</P>
<P>
 It was after the English Channel swim when Cox became intensely interested in 
the world around her. By her late teens, she was already focusing on global 
peace efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't a tangible decision, she says, that lead her to meld her athletic 
ability with her visions of joining countries at odds. Now, the days when she 
swam for trophies and medals seem like a lifetime ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't even remember exactly why I threw (the trophies) out," she says. "We 
used to have them displayed all over the place, but I was done with that. They 
went into a box, and then in the trash. I don't swim for that anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 There was not one particular event that made Cox the altruistic person she is 
today, but there came a time when the swimming for records just didn't cut it. 
She majored in history at UC Santa Barbara and learned about the give-and-take 
involved with attaining peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the idea that a little compromise on both sides can build a bridge, and 
by allowing me to swim, they're all doing that," she says. "It takes a good 
many years to build a bridge and just seconds to blow it up." 
</P>
<P>
 Her parents, retired, say they find it difficult to understand their 
daughter's drive and motivation, yet they watch in awe as she pieces together 
each history-making swim. 
</P>
<P>
 They say the Gulf of Aqaba event is of special concern in the wake of Saddam 
Hussein's current threats and the sudden mobilization of U.S. forces to Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 "We worry about her safety because it's a very volatile part of the world 
today, with a lot of out-of-control people. But we just keep our fingers 
crossed and hope everything goes smoothly," her father says. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynne's parents have other concerns, including the their daughter's personal 
and financial future. Although she works once a week at Beach Physical Therapy 
in Seal Beach, travels the corporate lecture circuit, teaches summer swimming 
lessons and picks up some free-lance writing assignments, her income is modest. 
She says marriage and children will come "maybe some day." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard for us to understand why she does this and why she keeps doing 
this," says Albert Cox. "Lynne is going to do what she feels she has to do. We 
don't push her; we just assist her." 
</P>
<P>
 Cox is undecided about her future and says that she hasn't had time to settle 
into long-term relationships. And when asked how long she intends to pursue her 
historic swims, she gets mildly defensive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that anyone's ever said that I'm too old to be doing this. 
You're old when you're old," she says. "Why should you be limited by someone 
else's expectations?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Symbolic as they may seem, the efforts of Lynne Cox have indeed led to 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 When the borders were closed in 1948, Eskimo families from America's Little 
Diomede Island and the Soviet Union's Big Diomede Island were restricted from 
seeing one another. 
</P>
<P>
 But three months after Cox crossed the 2.7-mile Bering Strait in 1987, the 
gates were lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 "The borders were open to them, and they were allowed to move and talk to each 
other, and to see what had happened to their families after (so many) years," 
Cox says. "That makes me feel good." 
</P>
<P>
 She was toasted at the White House by President Reagan and former Soviet 
President Mikhail Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the opening paragraph of Gorbachev's speech, he referred to Lynne by 
name," recalls friend and longtime supporter Barry Binder. "That was something 
extraordinary." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the day he met her at one of her speaking functions six years ago, 
Binder and his wife, Betty, have backed Lynne's idealistic efforts. From his 
Los Alamitos Boulevard real estate office, she makes calls and sends facsimile 
correspondence to the countries where she needs approval for her latest 
mission.

 "What I first noticed was her enthusiasm, her spark and her willingness to do 
something different," Binder, 53, says. "She's very focused on what she does 
and has an air of innocence about her. When she's around, it helps people to 
keep things in perspective." 
</P>
<P>
 Binder joined Cox and her support team two years ago when she swam across Lake 
Titicaca, the world's highest navigable lake in the Andes between the border of 
Bolivia and Peru. After that swim, she was covered all over with mysterious, 
quarter-size welts -- bites from "some sort of organism" in the chilly water. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still don't know what bit me, but they sure itched," she says. "I never saw 
anything in the water; that's what was so perplexing." 
</P>
<P>
 People seem to be drawn to Cox, not necessarily because of her record in the 
water. Surfers, beachcombers, parking attendants -- even the real estate agents 
in Binder's office -- all act as if they are longtime friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Her crew consists of Binder, a Newport Beach physician, a pilot, a Los Angeles 
dress-designer friend and a shipbuilding couple from Northern California who 
will maintain the tracking boat. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a good friend, and I believe in what she's doing," Binder says, adding 
that all of his contributions to her cause are strictly "out of pocket." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think Lynne sees a limit to what she's doing in the next five or 10 
years. She sure has the ability to do other swims," he says. "It helps Lynne to 
have someone to talk to, someone who supports what she's doing." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Nicely dressed in a blouse, earrings and skirt, Cox is packing meat tenderizer 
to treat possible jellyfish stings, drafting a letter to the mayor of Eilat in 
Israel and cheerfully talking about the bright-colored swimsuit she plans to 
wear. 
</P>
<P>
 An hour before, she was slicing through the 65-degree ocean off Seal Beach, 
relieved that the rain from the previous night didn't leave the water too 
dirty. Swimmers worry about such conditions, she says, for they can cause 
horrible ear and sinus infections. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds funny because of what I'm about to do," says Cox, who adds that the 
water temperatures in the Gulf of Aqaba will be in the mid to high 80s, with 
100-degree sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I want to swim. I don't want to get sick." 
</P>
<P>
 She's had her typhoid and gamma globulin shots and is packing "major amounts 
of sunscreen." She's not sure if she will wear a swim cap, afraid it might 
retain too much heat. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, you just keep going," says Cox, who contends that what she's 
about to do is much more than swimming against the elements -- and much more 
than soaking up the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 She says she's worked for six years to bring this swim together, and it hasn't 
been easy, but she seems to thrive on the difficulty of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone involved in the peace swim -- which goes from Taba, Egypt to Eliat, 
Israel, and then on to Aqaba, Jordan -- says that getting the American swimmer 
into Jordanian waters had become a furious, fax-driven endeavor.  
</P>
<P>
 The day before she left with her crew last weekend, all the clearances were in 
place: a blessing from Jordan's Queen Noor, approval from Reuma Weizman, wife 
of Israeli President Ezer Weizman, and the nod from Ahmed Maher El Sayed, 
Egyptian ambassador to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a difficult process, and you have to make sure you do everything right, 
down to the wording in each letter. One wrong word could cancel the whole 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Cox rubs her eyes and muses a moment, never putting down her all-important 
address book. She changes the subject to the climate of the Middle Eastern gulf 
and how it has been described to her, talking as if she was leaving for a 
holiday resort. 
</P>
<P>
 "On hot, sweltering days, the heat creates this sort of distorted haze over 
the water, and on a clear day, you can see both countries from both sides. It's 
supposed to be spectacular." Back to business. Cox looks at the time, 
apologizes, and places a call to friend Thomas Pickering, U.S. ambassador to 
Russia and an ardent supporter of her peace swims. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to call him by a certain time, and it's so hard to get these time 
differences straight," she says with a childlike giggle. "You would think I 
would know by now." Lynne Elaine Cox

DANA PARSONS: WHEN IT COMES TO POLITICAL JOKES, IT'S HARD TO BEAT BOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA PARSONS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Why is it that no matter how seriously anyone tries to treat Bob Dornan and 
his various political ordeals, inevitably it verges on the comic? Bob Hope has 
been in show business for what, 70 years, and trust me, he's got nothing on 
Dornan. At some point, you just have to shake your head and ask how this guy 
keeps coming up with new material. 
</P>
<P>
 As Dornan heads into the homestretch of what he says will be his last 
congressional election campaign, it's clear his legacy will not be as a 
legislator but as a performer. He's essentially harmless in Congress, so maybe 
even his opponents should just sit back and try and enjoy the act. We may not 
see his like for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest flap surrounding the eight-term congressman is vintage Dornan. That 
is, it began as pseudo-legitimate political drama and ended up with cream pies 
and seltzer bottles. As usual, Dornan did the tossing and squirting. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue was Dornan's occasional assertion that he had been involved in the 
civil rights movement in the South and even attended the historic 1963 march in 
Washington, D.C. Given Dornan's record for conservatism, his Democratic 
opponent, Mike Farber, was highly skeptical and planned a trap the next time 
Dornan mentioned it. 
</P>
<P>
 Predictably, Dornan did so, and Farber sprung the trap. He produced a 
disclaiming letter from civil rights leaders who, in addition to saying they 
doubted Dornan had been involved in the movement, also condemned his voting 
record on civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 They no doubt assumed they were on safe ground in questioning Dornan's 
appearance at the march. After all, it was 31 years ago. It's not like Dornan 
could actually prove he was there, among the hundreds of thousands. 
</P>
<P>
 A trifling matter to the bearded one. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, Dornan's staff found a photograph in the Library of Congress that 
shows part of the crowd of thousands facing the Lincoln Memorial on that August 
day in 1963. Three rows deep in the audience is a man wearing an Air Force hat 
and dark aviator glasses. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan says it's he in the picture, although to be honest, I think it looks 
more like Van Heflin. 
</P>
<P>
 Whaddya gonna do? Either Dornan has seen "Forrest Gump" one too many times, or 
he's come up with the perfect squelch. 
</P>
<P>
 What's next, Bob Dornan at Woodstock? 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, with Bob Dornan you always get a punch line. 
</P>
<P>
 This is all faintly reminiscent of a scene several years ago when Dornan and 
his wife, Sallie, got into it with gay-rights activists. At one point, Sallie 
stunned the crowd by saying her brother had AIDS. Dornan was stunned too, 
saying later he didn't know about it. Neither, as it turned out, did Sallie's 
brother, who said he didn't have AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to mention Dornan's suggestion that refugees from Southeast Asia be sent 
to Kuwait to help rebuild the country after the Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to mention his hint that Bill Clinton may have contacted the KGB while a 
college student visiting Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to mention the "family secret" that he had physically abused his wife many 
years ago. The allegations were mentioned in divorce papers his wife filed, 
then withdrew. But when the Dornans publicly addressed the matter in 1993, 
Sallie Dornan said her allegations were untrue and that she made them while 
dependent on alcohol and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 The point is, you can't embarrass this guy. He'll call an opponent every name 
in the book, but when someone lobs a verbal grenade at him, he's mortally 
offended at their dastardliness. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Democrats led us to believe they were going hard after Dornan 
this time around. They envisioned a campaign and even attached a name to it 
("BeatBob"), as if they were boxing promoter Don King hyping a "Rumble in the 
Jungle" fights. 
</P>
<P>
 When I wrote a column earlier this year about how the Democrats were really 
going to take the gloves off this year, Dornan phoned and said, "It'll never 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Turns out he was right. The Democrats should have named their campaign "Shhh." 
</P>
<P>
 The show is about over, though. Dornan has said he won't run for Congress in 
1996. He'll probably be just outrageous enough over the next couple years to 
make sure he gets a talk show somewhere, leaving Orange County behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats will say they'll rejoice when that happens, but they haven't come to 
grips with this question: With Dornan gone, what'll they do for comedy around 
here?

THE NAME GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With due respect to the individuals "honored," why all this self-accolade by 
our county politicians who name or rename public properties after each other? 
It seems to me that Bolsa Chica and Wagon Wheel are more appropriate names for 
public parks than Harriett M. Wieder or Gen. Thomas F. Riley. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering the present trend, it wouldn't surprise me if our county becomes 
William G. Steiner County, California. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently Mr. Steiner is next in line.

CAFE REALITY CHECK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rosemary Krabbe's maudlin letter (Oct. 2) regarding the closing of the Pali 
Cafe in Silverado Canyon needs a reality check. 
</P>
<P>
 Sept. 18 was a "sad day" for the hard-working employees of Pali Cafe who now 
find themselves in the unemployment line! Will their "leisurely breakfast" now 
come from food stamps? 
</P>
<P>
 Notwithstanding the convenience and camaraderie lost by the closing, it is not 
the end of western civilization as we know it.

RECALLS COMMITTEE WASTED TAX FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If nothing else, the Fullerton Recalls Committee has taught Fullerton voters 
an important lesson -- vigilance: You cannot take good government for granted. 
This committee, while claiming frugality in government, has wasted over 
$100,000 (a conservative estimate) for Fullerton taxpayers by winning a battle 
in the courts (under a law that is up for change in the coming elections) to 
force a special election whose effect will last only two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The incumbents they targeted offered to resign rather than run up a costly 
bill. No, the committee would not put the interests of Fullerton citizens over 
their own vendetta. This has not only confused many voters, it has given some 
people the opportunity to run for this office (and stay for only two weeks) for 
no other reason than to get their names known. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a lesson here to be learned by all citizens: We cannot lean back and 
take good government for granted. Vote, or our system can be manipulated by 
people of ill will!

 Long ago I went to traffic school in the Newport area and it was all

 The first session was marked by nail-bitters, knuckle-crackers and 
smart-alecks.

 I thought I was in junior high.

 At the second session I moved to the other side of the room. Same thing.

SENIORS AT RISK TOO IN 6TH STREET AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the articles about the (Santa Ana) police sweep on 3rd Street, one fact has 
been overlooked: There is within the 6th Street territory a senior apartment 
complex just south of Flower Park. About two blocks away, at 1st and Ross 
streets, there are two more senior complexes.All of these complexes have had 
break-ins and, within the last two weeks, the complexes on Ross have each had a 
violent break-in that resulted in the resident being sent to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 In all the years I have lived here, I have always made it a point to not get 
off the bus, even just across the street, after dark, which means I must be 
home by 5 p.m. in the winter. How about remembering the seniors who are in 
danger as well as showing concern for the families who live in the area?

GET RID OF GUNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We all can agree that in order to prevent the violence that is so prevalent in 
our society today, it is imperative to "enable the family to fulfill its 
function as the source of emotional, financial and material support essential 
for the well-being of its members" ("U.N. Year of the Family an Occasion to 
Re-Examine Priorities," Oct. 2). 
</P>
<P>
 If we started a program today -- how long would it take to see any results? 10 
years? 20 years? 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, many citizens will not be here to see the results. Not 
because they died of old age, but because they were murdered by guns. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's get rid of the guns while we are endeavoring to educate families.

SCHOOL BOARD SHOULD REFLECT ELECTORATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re: "Ideology Looms Over School Board Races in S. County" (Oct. 10). 
</P>
<P>
 So, the "activists" (the media's word for liberals) are sounding the alarm 
that some "extremists" (the media's word for conservatives) could take majority 
control in two South County school districts.One such activist says: "It's a 
question of whether people of a particular religious persuasion should have a 
right to control" the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, if this is still America, I'd say the group who gets the most votes has 
every right to control it. Everyone knows that south Orange County is dominated 
by conservative Christians, so what's wrong with a school board of similar 
demographics and values? Given the ever-increasing problems of illiteracy, 
gangs, drugs and sex in our schools, it seems that nothing could be worse than 
what we have now.

BREWER DESERVES ENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORT; 70TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT NEEDS 
REPRESENTATION BASED ON WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH OTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marilyn C. Brewer's primary victory in the 70th Assembly District earlier this 
year made it a strong likelihood that she would go on to win the general 
election in November. This is one of the most Republican districts in 
California, and the question of succession for outgoing incumbent Gil Ferguson 
was largely about what kind of Republican would take the seat after him, not 
whether the district would send a Republican or Democrat to Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory of Brewer in June has rankled some of the more conservative 
members of her party, and opponents in the GOP already are poised to watch her 
every move in the Legislature in anticipation of a future campaign. But the 
standard of who can be the most conservative Republican is not the standard by 
which to judge the fitness and the performance of the area's representative. 
Voters should keep that in mind and enthusiastically give their support to 
Brewer when they go to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the people of the 70th District are not, as a group, politically 
extreme. Moreover, they and Orange County need representation that is based on 
a willingness to work with others in Sacramento and not simply behave in the 
manner of the "cavemen" who were opposed to almost everything and accomplished 
very little. 
</P>
<P>
 Brewer can provide the district with pragmatic and energetic representation. 
She will provide a refreshing change for her constituents. As an aide to 
Supervisor Thomas F. Riley in Orange County, she earned a reputation for hard 
work, reliability and fairness. At a time when taxpayers are especially 
concerned about government spending, she brings a record of concern for 
reducing waste. She has been Riley's criminal justice adviser, working with law 
enforcement agencies and on the first anti-gang effort in South County. She 
brings her extensive business experience as founder and co-owner of a 
manufacturing company to the task of reducing the burden on business. Those are 
all very good credentials. 
</P>
<P>
 Brewer, mindful of the carping of some detractors, has said, "I am not going 
to spend my time looking over my shoulder." We like her spirit and her outlook. 
And for voters in the 70th District, she offers the promise of real leadership 
in Sacramento during the next two years.

A RUSH TO JUDGMENT ON EL TORO AIRPORT; MEASURE A DOESN'T ALLOW TIME TO WEIGH 
ALL OPTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The future of the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station represents what very likely 
is the last chance to plan for any really large piece of open space in Orange 
County. An assignment that important has to be approached with a certain 
respect for the size and importance of the undertaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, what the county has going for it, or at least what it ought to 
have, is the luxury of some time to plan. Yet, remarkably, some influential 
movers and shakers are trying to get the county to forfeit this advantage and 
to force the issue before there has been proper time to consider all the 
alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 If passed, Measure A would require an airport at the El Toro Marine Corps Air 
Station. That would close the book on all the other options even before they 
had been examined. The initiative is premature and should be rejected soundly. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents say they are convinced that the process now in place to study 
possible uses for the base is rigged against an airport and cannot be trusted 
to work fairly. They want the voters to adopt a similarly cynical view, to 
dispense with the deliberative process. What they are really doing is asking 
Orange County residents to suspend belief in representative government. 
</P>
<P>
 It is true that there is deep division in Orange County over the airport idea. 
However, no official study for the future of the base will be credible or 
complete if it does not examine fully the idea of an airport along with 
whatever else may be feasible. The airport idea will have its day, and it does 
not need the initiative to make that happen. 
</P>
<P>
 What this unnecessary measure does is force the airport issue onto the front 
burner, when the very nature of the base-closing process encourages communities 
to examine alternatives carefully and completely before making decisions. 
Indeed, it is even possible that the planning process now in place might come 
up eventually with an even stronger case for an airport once all the studies 
have played out. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative proponents are succumbing to nervousness. They want to 
fast-track this issue and preclude alternatives lest any one of them prove to 
have too much merit. By passing Measure A, the public would be cheated out of 
having due consideration given to using the base for any number of job-creating 
ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 An airport is one possible use for the base, to be sure. But it is another 
matter to take the argument to the lengths of the initiative proponents. They 
have said that there are no other available sites, and that the opportunity of 
El Toro is an opportunity not to be missed. The public must understand that the 
defeat of the initiative does not preclude El Toro from becoming an airport. If 
the public later decides that it doesn't like the proposals that the people 
studying that base have come up with, there is always time for an airport 
referendum. 
</P>
<P>
 To do justice to the airport idea, like other possible options for El Toro, a 
much more thorough discussion is needed than the current hasty campaign allows. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents are trying to create a false sense of urgency by suggesting that if 
we don't act now, the opportunity will be lost forever. That is not the case. 
This is only the beginning of the planning process. There is plenty of time. 
Voters must reject this false sense of deadline. There is no need to heed the 
alarm of these Paul Reveres of the runways. 
</P>
<P>
 There may be a strong case to be made down the road for an airport, but the 
case for the initiative at this particular time is very weak. Don't succumb to 
planning by ballot box. Reject the initiative in favor of a careful and 
deliberative process.

LAGUNA CANYON BIKE TRAIL BEST OPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city has received several letters from bicycle enthusiasts questioning why 
the (Laguna Beach) City Council is not supporting on-road bicycle lanes for the 
portion of Laguna Canyon Road, which is proposed to be widened to four lanes by 
Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
 The original project report calls for eight-foot-wide shoulders on each side 
of the roadway.Those shoulders would provide a bicycle lane. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is interested in reducing the amount of paving to the extent 
possible to reduce the cost of the project and to preserve the ambience that 
millions of residents and visitors have enjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
 In lieu of an on-road bicycle path, the City Council has supported an off-road 
bicycle trail that would connect the same two points. It is the council's 
position that the bike trail should be away from the main road although 
parallel to the main highway. 
</P>
<P>
 In that manner, bicyclists would have a safer, more pleasant trip -- with less 
traffic and air pollution -- between Laguna Beach and Irvine. The trail could 
accommodate bicyclists in concert with the Laguna Coast Wilderness Park. 
</P>
<P>
 We believe that option is much preferable to having bicycle lanes on the road, 
but in any case, the City Council is very supportive of having access for 
bicycles parallel to Laguna Canyon Road.

STATION PARKING RULES SENSELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What kind of mentality came up with the brilliant idea of three-hour parking 
at the Fullerton Amtrak station? One cannot even take the train to Santa Ana 
and back to Fullerton in three hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The multilevel parking structure also has three-hour spaces and 72-hour 
parking on the uppermost levels and is always filled with commuters' cars from 
every adjacent city.What on earth does 72 hours relate to? 
</P>
<P>
 As a Fullerton citizen I resent the fact that I can't even park and take the 
train to help alleviate the congestion on the freeways and help to keep the air 
clean. Aren't these two issues that environmentalists are always blathering 
about? 
</P>
<P>
 I have a solution: Completely restructure the entire Transportation Center 
parking by using some common sense and getting rid of all the three-hour 
parking inside the structure. It relates to nothing.

DRUG SEARCHES AT SCHOOL UNNECESSARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Recently the (Newport-Mesa Unified School District) board for Corona del Mar 
High School and the Newport Beach Police Department came to an agreement on a 
very controversial issue. They have decided to allow police dogs to sniff 
students' lockers and vehicles at random times during the year.Being a 
sophomore at CDMHS, I think this is a bad idea. 
</P>
<P>
 I have attended CDMHS since eighth grade and have never seen or heard of 
students bringing drugs on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 A week ago my journalism class interviewed our principal, whose opinion was 
that our school has never had a problem with drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 So, if it's not broken, why fix it? 
</P>
<P>
 The principal's response was that the dogs provided a further deterrent to 
drug use. 
</P>
<P>
 I feel this program is unwarranted. It gives CDMHS a undeserved bad 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite being one of the smallest schools in Southern California we are among 
the highest ranking scholastically and in sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Although this program will cost the school district nothing, it will tarnish 
our school's image.

KEEPING WATCH OVER TOLLWAY AGENCIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your Sunday editorial, "Agencies Must Clear Air Over Toll Roads" (Oct. 9) was 
a breath of fresh air to us who have labored against the San Joaquin toll road 
and the Orange County Transportation Corridor Agencies for its malevolences, 
half-truths and gross misrepresentations over the years since the days of the 
environmental impact reviews. Your article correctly states "the intention to 
collect tolls on the Newport Coast Drive, while there in fine print, was never 
fully or satisfactorily aired." 
</P>
<P>
 More than once the tollway agency misused the environmental review process by 
bypassing the need to include all mitigations on sensitive issues. 
</P>
<P>
 From the beginning the agency misled the taxpayers as to whom would fund the 
toll roads. "The taxpayers will never pick up the tab" assertion continued for 
many months until the acknowledgment that the developers' fees and future tolls 
would not complete the jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The ensuing lawsuits against the agency would not have been as prolific if the 
agency had been aboveboard in its commitments. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact the federal government stepped in with financial help, not to mention 
the diversion of money from a Mello-Roos District by supervisors to help defray 
the debt by the Transportation Corridor Agencies, convinces many that they must 
watchdog government giveaways to the powerful Transportation Corridor Agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Make no mistake, the toll roads are for future, unrestricted growth.

THE EL TORO AIRPORT INITIATIVE; DON'T SQUANDER THE CHANCE TO USE EXISTING 
AVIATION SITE; FOUR RUNWAYS AT MARINE FACILITY ARE THERE FOR US -- AT NO COST 
TO TAXPAYERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EUGENE MORIARTY, Eugene H. Moriarty is chairman of the Committee for El Toro 
Airport Tomorrow. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A major concern of many Orange County residents is the economic future of 
growing Orange County and of the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. What happens 
to that existing multimillion-dollar airport can have a significant economic 
impact on the county, and indeed, the entire region. 
</P>
<P>
 We know that even with a new terminal, John Wayne Airport cannot meet our 
long-range needs, with one 5,700-foot runway on just 500 acres and a passenger 
limit of 8.4 million passengers per year. The growth this year is 11.2% over a 
record 6,141,981 passengers in 1993 -- and this is in a weak economy! 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, a number of possible airport sites have been studied at 
various locations, including offshore, Santiago Canyon, Los Alamitos, 
Cristianitos Canyon, south Camp Pendleton, George Air Force Base, March Field 
and Norton Air Force Base. All were rejected for excessive cost, technical 
flaws and being in an out-of-county market. 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro is an airport now and offers two 10,000-foot and two 8,000-foot 
runways. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 2,000 acres of the 4,700-acre base would be needed for a commercial 
airport, leaving 2,700 acres for other community uses. There are 16,000 acres 
in a "no-homes zone" making an effective noise buffer for quieter commercial 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Federal Aviation Administration, 90% of the cost of 
conversion would be paid by the "Airport and Airways Trust Fund" and 10% by 
revenue bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Trust fund monies are accrued from the current 10% tax on all airline tickets, 
while revenue bonds are paid with income from landing fees, airport parking, 
concessions and leases. No general taxpayers' funds are involved, and there 
would be no tax increases.  
</P>
<P>
 Taxpayers have already invested hundreds of millions of dollars in Department 
of Defense funds to build El Toro. Conversion to commercial use is the only 
prudent decision for Orange County voters. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the negative points raised by airport opponents can be managed, and we 
must not lose this opportunity to improve our job base and air transportation 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
 A "yes" vote on Measure A is a vote for the continued economic growth of 
Orange County.

THE EL TORO AIRPORT INITIATIVE; ECONOMIC SECURITY IS AT STAKE NOW; 
INTERNATIONAL TRADE, HIGH-TECH MANUFACTURING AND TOURISM ALL WILL FLOURISH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK LEYES, Mark Leyes chairs the Orange County Regional Airport Authority 
and is a city councilman in Garden Grove. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A "yes" vote on Measure A is a yes vote for Orange County's economic future. 
The end of the Cold War has proved traumatic for Southern California. Federal 
defense cuts and the recession has resulted in a loss of more than 135,000 
high-paying jobs and hurt families throughout Orange County. With the recently 
announced closing of the Hughes plant in Fullerton, we need new jobs more than 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Measure A will convert the El Toro base from a military airport to a 
commercial airport to allow the successful sectors of our local economy to 
flourish and replace lost jobs. Our economy must be rebuilt on the growth 
industries of international trade, high-tech manufacturing and tourism. All 
three depend on reliable air transport of goods and people. John Wayne Airport 
is physically incapable of meeting Orange County's future airport demands. 
</P>
<P>
 Officially known as the Orange County/El Toro Economic Stimulus Initiative, 
Measure A will utilize the 2,000-acre airport portion of El Toro to serve the 
growth industries in the region. The remaining 2,700 acres will be 
master-planned for airport-compatible uses. El Toro is also surrounded by a 
16,000-acre noise and safety buffer zone where no homes exist, minimizing 
environmental impacts of an airport. 
</P>
<P>
 It makes no sense to destroy the four massive runways at El Toro -- twice the 
length of John Wayne Airport's -- that can serve our air travel and air cargo 
needs for the foreseeable future. The airport will be paid for the way all 
airports are financed -- by revenue from the airlines that use them, not by 
taxpayers. Without El Toro, we would either be forced to re-create this 
infrastructure at huge expense, or continue to lose income and the estimated 
21,000 new jobs to other regions. 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro is owned by all taxpayers. It must benefit all taxpayers by becoming 
the second airport that the Orange County economy desperately needs. El Toro 
Marine Corps Air Station has provided for our military security for a 
generation. 
</P>
<P>
 Passage of Measure A will ensure economic security and help restore Orange 
County's quality of life for ourselves and future generations.

OPTIMAL SOLUTION FOUND IN OPTIMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 OPTIMA, Orange County's pioneering health care program for Medi-Cal 
recipients, has reached an important milestone. 
</P>
<P>
 Its new structure for the delivery of care combines the best attributes of 
this region's traditional providers and our experienced managed care plans. 
</P>
<P>
 By including both in a competitive arrangement, OPTIMA will bring out their 
best in terms of costs and quality of care. 
</P>
<P>
 This is good news for Medi-Cal recipients, who can look forward to better 
access to quality care. 
</P>
<P>
 This is good news for the private sector, which through cost shifting 
ultimately pays for shortfalls due to government underfunding. 
</P>
<P>
 OPTIMA will oversee 5% of the $10-billion Orange County health care system. 
</P>
<P>
 It's very refreshing to note that in the absence of reform at either the 
federal and state level, Orange County is forging ahead in a most enlightened 
manner. 
</P>
<P>
 Very serious challenges to success remain (e.g., a fair distribution of 
patients among plans), but OPTIMA's progress and direction establishes a high 
level of confidence that will help achieve it.

 Measure A appears to be headed for victory on the Nov. 8 ballot. Placed on the 
ballot by Buck Johns, George Argyros and those other radical ballot-box 
planners at the Lincoln Club, Measure A would require construction of a 
commercial airport at the El Toro Marine base. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankly, I have yet to arrive at a conclusion about the merits of building a 
commercial airport at El Toro and am rather amazed that so many others have. 
</P>
<P>
 How does anyone know, with an appropriate degree of certitude, that a 
commercial airport is technologically practical, economically viable or the 
best use, given the need to balance economic growth and revenue enhancement 
against other equally significant considerations? 
</P>
<P>
 How could they know when these issues have not been sufficiently studied or 
analyzed? 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the many promises contained in the initiative have not been verified 
by disinterested parties and therefore lack credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, there are good arguments on both sides of the El Toro debate. 
</P>
<P>
 But at this point, there are only arguments, not hard data about the costs and 
benefits of a commercial airport. Neither is there sufficient evidence to 
systematically compare the pluses and minuses of a commercial airport with any 
other alternative land use. 
</P>
<P>
 What we're given instead are speculations deduced from unsubstantiated 
assumptions advanced by wishful thinkers. This is no way to make the county 
decision of the decade, although in political terms it is the best way for 
Johns, Argyros, et al., to have their way (again). 
</P>
<P>
 Measure A requires the rational voter to judge the merits of a commercial 
airport without sufficient empirical evidence and without comparison to any 
other land-use option. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with such uncertainty, the only logical recourse is to vote "no" on 
Measure A and let the assessment process continue until evaluative and 
comparative analyses are completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, and only then, will it be possible to render a rational judgment on the 
merits of an El Toro airport.

THE EL TORO AIRPORT INITIATIVE; MEASURE A INVOLVES UNKNOWN FACTORS THAT MAKE IT 
TOO DANGEROUS; NOBODY KNOWS HOW A COMMERCIAL FACILITY COULD BE FINANCED.

 Do the citizens of Orange County want the opportunity to explore all land use 
alternatives for El Toro Marine Corps Air Station using a rational, intelligent 
approach that will create a strong reuse plan? Or do the voters wish to mandate 
that the 4,700 acres be converted to an international/cargo airport absent any 
economic analysis or feasibility studies? 
</P>
<P>
 Aborting a methodical, comprehensive planning process already established 
under defense base closure law in favor of appeasing the city of Newport Beach 
and a couple of powerful developers through the approval of Measure A portends 
a disastrous result for the following reasons: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Guarantees an uncertain financial future. A $4-billion, LAX-style airport 
with no identified major capital subsidies may saddle Orange County taxpayers 
with a county junk bond rating and decades of debt. Should FAA fund 15% of the 
cost of a new airport ($200 million) and $170 million in revenue bonds be sold, 
taxpayers will still be holding the bag with a $600-million shortfall. Will 
airport proponents ask taxpayers to support a $600-million general obligation 
bond? The defeat of Measure A will be a victory for every taxpayer in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Jeopardizes air safety. El Toro is part of the LAX airspace. Potential 
conflicts with approach and departure operations among John Wayne, Ontario, LAX 
and Long Beach already exist. Fifteen different aviation studies indicate 
commercial flights out of El Toro would carry the highest potential for 
civilian casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Eliminates visionary possibilities. To predetermine El Toro's use as an 
airport is to slam the door shut on the future: advanced biomedical industrial 
development, clean technology R&D centers, higher education facilities, CAL 
STARTS' electric car manufacturing program and a Native American cultural 
center are all potential uses that deserve study. The airport proposal creates 
fewer jobs than many other uses. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Creates another airport we may not need. Long Beach, Ontario, LAX and John 
Wayne are all underutilized. John Wayne (currently serving 6 million) has the 
capacity for 14 million air passengers annually. Cargo carriers have stated 
that two daily flights out of John Wayne Airport would satisfy their cargo 
demands to 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes Measure A so dangerous is the unknown. Simply put, nobody knows how 
much it will cost to convert El Toro to a commercial airport, nobody knows 
where the money will come from, nobody can guarantee that a second airport 
won't have serious, negative impacts throughout the county.

NATURAL SELECTION STRIKES CREATIONISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Natural selection strikes again! In nullifying its previous ruling, the U.S. 
9th Circuit Court of Appeals has found John Peloza's suit (to avoid mandatory 
teaching of evolution) unfit for survival. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who uses religious dogma to explain the workings of the natural world 
has no business teaching science.Students must learn that scientific truth is 
not based on faith, but on observation, hypothesis, challenge and 
re-evaluation. Old explanations are discarded when they are insufficient or 
unnecessarily complex. 
</P>
<P>
 As The Times has previously noted, evolution is a fact. It is supported by 
massive empirical evidence for which no other explanation seems possible. The 
theory in Darwin's theory of evolution is the process by which evolution 
occurs, natural selection. Should a better mechanism be discovered to explain 
evolutionary events, Darwin's theory, but not evolution, will be abandoned. 
Unlike faith and dogma, science is self-critical and self-correcting. 
</P>
<P>
 As for John Peloza teaching biology, how many of us want our children to 
receive a good medieval education?

 The solution to the teaching creationism debate is very simple: equal 
treatment.

 First let the teacher teach the students everything they need to know about

 Then have the teacher teach the students everything they need to know about

BLOODY DEEDS CLOAKED BY FALL FOLIAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's autumn and soon our forests and wilderness areas will resemble 
Impressionist paintings, brilliant with color. This magnificent fairyland 
setting will again hide the bloody deeds that take place there -- it's called 
hunting season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brave" men and some women, who fancy themselves as Diana, Goddess of the 
Hunt, will be going forth armed with precision-made binoculars and 
state-of-the-art semiautomatic shotguns. 
</P>
<P>
 And then, to bolster the nerve of these daring individuals, a booster shot of 
booze, as they set out on their daring hunt -- to explode the three-pound body 
of an exquisite bird in flight, or to shatter a gentle, graceful fleeing deer. 
These innocent creatures who never harm anybody have nothing more than their 
God-given instincts to protect them from the well-armed killers who "harvest" 
them. What great sport! 
</P>
<P>
 Those of us who are squeamish about drawing blood are always being reminded 
that the hunters are indeed acting in the interests of the animals, keeping 
their populations down so that they won't starve. 
</P>
<P>
 These gun-toting self-proclaimed "preservationists" no doubt feel they are 
playing the same role as the plagues and wars that control human 
overpopulation. Are we supposed to welcome and accept these disasters as 
necessary remedies to ensure our existence on this planet? What a hideous 
premise!

CURLEES DRAW ATTENTION TO OTHER KIDNEY PATIENTS AWAITING 'SUPREME GIFT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE MARQUIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The story of Mission Viejo newlyweds Victoria Ingram-Curlee and Randall 
Curlee, though it might not have a fairy-tale ending, dramatizes the risks and 
sacrifices hundreds of live donors undertake each year to improve and even save 
the lives of loved ones suffering kidney failure. 
</P>
<P>
 National attention has focused on the Orange County couple as the gap between 
supply and demand for donated kidneys widens, and as relatives, spouses and 
even friends of ailing patients increasingly step forward to provide what one 
recipient called "this supreme gift." 
</P>
<P>
 Ingram-Curlee, 45, still hopes to come through for her new husband, gravely 
ill with diabetes, even after a radiologist nicked one of her arteries during a 
routine test last week. Still, the injury could cause the transplant to be 
canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a small but growing number of other Americans, she volunteered an organ 
rather than watch a loved one wait on a national list -- perhaps for years -- 
for a fortuitous gift from strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of donations from living people in the United States jumped 52% 
from 1,812 in 1988 to 2,760 in 1993 -- most of them from parents and siblings 
of recipients, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing, the nonprofit 
organization in Richmond, Va., that administers the national data bank and 
waiting list.  
</P>
<P>
 Cadaver donations, though much greater in number, rose only 13% in the same 
period. The two sources of donated kidneys do not come close to meeting the 
demand: More than 26,000 people await kidney transplants across the country on 
any given day and fewer than 11,000 such procedures were performed in all of 
1993. The wait for a cadaver organ already averages about two years, and the 
list of hopeful recipients is only getting longer.  
</P>
<P>
 In this bleak context, local and national organ donation agencies welcome the 
publicity Ingram-Curley has brought to their cause. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (the Curlee case) can only encourage family members to step forward 
and offer to donate," said Esther Benenson, spokeswoman for the organ sharing 
network. "It's a wonderful love story. It can't help but influence people in a 
positive way." 
</P>
<P>
 Some physicians aren't so sure, saying the media overplayed the storybook 
aspect of the case and ignored the science. "I feel a little annoyed at the 
hype about this case," said Dr. Garo M. Tertzakian, director of the renal 
transplantation program at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 The public's expectations were raised and dashed, he said, as though this were 
"theater" and not medicine, with all its attendant risks. "There should have 
been some disclaimers. This is, after all, not bringing the car to the garage 
and changing a tire." 
</P>
<P>
 It is, in fact, major surgery that involves entering the body through an 
incision under the ribs and dissecting the kidney from surrounding tissues. For 
the donor alone, it typically takes 1 1/2 to two hours to perform and five days 
of recovery in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Tertzakian and others stressed that the risk of complications from the 
procedure -- such as infection -- are remote. Dr. Ervin Ruzics, director of 
kidney transplantation at UCI Medical Center in Orange, estimated the 
complication risk at "a fraction of a percent" and the mortality risk as almost 
negligible. 
</P>
<P>
 Healthy donors continue to function well on one kidney, which increases its 
function and may even increase its size to the point that it's almost working 
at the capacity of two, Ruzics said. 
</P>
<P>
 A pre-transplant nick in the artery, such as the one that delayed -- and 
perhaps derailed -- the donation from Ingram-Curlee, is considered extremely 
rare. But the case raises an ethical issue that transplant surgeons say they 
always must keep in mind: A donors's health should never be sacrificed to 
improve the recipient's outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 The screening process for live kidney donors in U.S. transplantation programs 
is rigorous, doctors said. Teams of evaluators seek to determine not only 
whether they make a good match for recipients, but whether the operation could 
compromise donors physically or psychologically. Evaluators are trained to look 
for signs, for example, that candidates are being pressured, against their 
will, by family members to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 For recipients, from a medical standpoint, live donations generally are better 
than those from cadavers. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives -- particularly siblings -- tend to provide the best matches for 
blood and tissue types. But beyond that, Benenson said, the kidneys of living 
donors do not undergo the damage that may occur during the shipping of cadaver 
organs. 
</P>
<P>
 Organs from living donors fail in less than 10% of the cases in the first 
year, but in slightly more than 20% of cadaver grafts, Benenson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Recipients say the gift of a kidney from a relative or friend is a meaningful 
sacrifice. When things go well, the donation can act as a powerful bond. But if 
the organ fails, guilt and disappointment on both sides can strain even the 
strongest relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Gull, 38, said his mother, Jeanette, of Anaheim, donated her kidney to 
him about a dozen years ago. It failed within 72 hours because of clotting 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were really close to begin with," said Gull, who suffers severe diabetes. 
"We're kind of distant now. We don't talk as much as we used to. . . . I think 
it's just because we're afraid of what to say to each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Gull later received a cadaver transplant that lasted years before failing. Now 
he is back on the national waiting list, hoping for another cadaver organ. 
Kidney dialysis is keeping him alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Another patient says a donation from his sister saved his life. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Mike Ballantyne of Mission Viejo was declining fast. At 45, he was 
going blind and was almost completely disabled by diabetes.  
</P>
<P>
 He "didn't feel right to ask" his two brothers and a sister if they would 
consider donation, he said. But the three of them discussed it among themselves 
and offered to be screened. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was unbelievable, just unbelievable," Ballantyne said, still marveling 
over his family's offer. As it turned out, he said, his 46-year-old sister, 
Connie Lockwood of Hesperia, was a perfect match.  
</P>
<P>
 "Of course I (weighed the risks)," she said. "I was a perfectly healthy woman. 
. . . I was concerned about my health and my children and my husband . . . . I 
don't mean to sound pious but I'd matched so well, I knew I would be the one to 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the procedure had to be postponed a few times because Ballantyne's 
health was so poor, it ultimately was successful. Now he is taking a modest 
amount of medication -- including the anti-rejection drug cyclosporine -- but 
has recovered much of his sight and, perhaps as important to him, his sense of 
humor. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't believe how big a deal this is," he said. More Donor Kidneys

WHO'LL GAIN FROM INFORMANT'S ACTIONS?; CRIMINAL JUSTICE: SOME LEGAL EXPERTS SAY 
THE PROSECUTION'S OPERATION ROUNDUP CASES COULD BE UNDERMINED BY FELON'S 
ALLEGED MISDEEDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Detectives knew they were dealing with a career crook when they enlisted Henry 
Gomez to help bust open one of Orange County's most treacherous gangs.  
</P>
<P>
 The police put Gomez on their payroll, gave him a beat-up Buick Riviera and 
sent him out to the streets of Santa Ana to buy drugs in what was to become the 
city's largest gang sweep ever. Along the way, authorities say, Gomez stole 
from police and lied about it and helped misidentify six people who were later 
exonerated.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, the convicted felon's alleged misdeeds are providing fodder for defense 
attorneys trying to fight the Operation Roundup indictments and have raised 
questions about the use of informants in the street war against drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys and some legal experts contend the cases are undermined by 
Gomez's credibility and the fact that FBI documents indicate that part of his 
compensation was linked to his performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy's as dirty as you can get," said Deputy Public Defender Brian 
Ducker. 
</P>
<P>
 But to the FBI, police and prosecutors, the unscrupulous tendencies of 
informants such as Gomez are a small price to pay for the risks they take to 
assist undercover investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite problems with Gomez, one source close to the investigation said, 
$21,000 and title to an 11-year-old car that often wouldn't start is a scant 
price to pay for what Gomez did -- put his life on the line each of he 209 
times he forayed into gang territory. 
</P>
<P>
 "He could have been killed any one of those times. Would you do that for 
$21,000?" said the source, who spoke on the condition that his name be 
withheld. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say they believe they can successfully prosecute the more than 100 
Operation Roundup cases, which are under review in light of the 
misidentifications. 
</P>
<P>
 "A good prosecutor can explain to a jury that, 'Hey, you can't reach into the 
gutter and pull up a swan,' " said Deputy District Atty. Carl Armbrust, head of 
the narcotics enforcement team. 
</P>
<P>
 "As it relates to Henry, we were disappointed when we found out he was 
stealing, and we shut the program down when we found that out, but I don't 
think it's going to affect the credibility of the case. Henry freely admits 
that he steals money. It takes a thief to catch a thief.  
</P>
<P>
 "I observed him on the witness stand, and I thought he was an excellent 
witness. He comes off very sincere. The grand jury loved him." 
</P>
<P>
 This week, the first of the Operation Roundup cases is set for trial, and 
Gomez may take the witness stand to talk about his exploits. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Lawrence Gomez Jr., 38, has a rap sheet dating back to the 1970s that 
includes battery, assault, kidnaping, forged prescriptions, residential 
burglary, embezzlement, vehicle theft and possession of hypodermic syringes. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, authorities said they dismissed cases against six people in part 
because Gomez helped finger the wrong suspects when he sat down with police to 
figure out who sold drugs to him. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep Gomez honest and gather evidence, investigators had videotaped and 
tape recorded each drug deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators would take Gomez to a safehouse and search him before he hit the 
streets. A video camera hidden in the door of his Buick Riviera ran from the 
time he left, and Gomez was instructed to return to the house before the 
two-hour tape ran out, Ducker said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gomez managed to pilfer at least $115 from police during drug deals 
between January and March, stuffing bills through the torn lining of his jacket 
pocket and jamming them deep into a sock, according to investigative reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, the reports show, he covered the camera with his arm when he gave 
dealers money, or lied out loud on tape about drug prices to cover up his 
thefts. 
</P>
<P>
 When police caught him stealing in March, he lied about it at first and later 
confessed, returning the money, authorities said. Santa Ana police officers and 
FBI agents then devised a scheme to block further thefts, taking away Gomez's 
jacket and stepping up searches. 
</P>
<P>
 When prosecutors found out about the thefts in late May, concerns about 
Gomez's reliability prompted all three agencies to halt the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We stopped it because we don't think we should be using people who are lying 
to us and stealing from us as informants," Armbrust said. "But now that it's 
over, I don't think it's going to affect the case, because the jury is going to 
be sitting there looking at the videotape. Henry might have lied, but the video 
doesn't lie."  
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have declined to reveal Gomez's whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Ducker, who is overseeing his office's handling of many of the Operation 
Roundup defendants, said the fact that Gomez still managed to deceive his 
handlers despite monitoring efforts will work in the defense's favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez's thefts can be used to throw the videotapes into question, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is obviously defrauding the camera, purposely. So if that's true, first of 
all, was there a buy? Did he give the guy any money? We're really talking about 
sophisticated deception, and sophisticated deception doesn't sound to me like 
credible," Ducker said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to an FBI memo, Gomez was paid based on "performance/hours worked" 
and a "discretionary bonus payment" promised after the operation concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts say the arrangement can help the defense show Gomez had good 
reason to lie. "That's very offensive. Talk about a motive there," said 
attorney James Riddet. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last month, a published U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decision said 
such payment schemes create "too great an incentive to fabricate evidence and 
distort the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 James N. Donckels, a veteran FBI man who runs the bureau's Orange County 
office and supervised agents involved in Operation Roundup, declined to talk 
about Gomez. But Donckels spoke in general terms about his office's use of 
informants. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are extremely crucial to us in many investigations," he said. "I'm not 
saying that without cooperative witnesses we can never solve a crime, but in a 
lot of cases they can be very critical. Who is the best person in a position to 
give you information about a very dangerous felon? Another dangerous felon." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the FBI does not normally tie monetary return or payments to the type 
of "bounty" described in the 9th Circuit ruling. " 'Performance' can mean, 'How 
much work did he do. How much time did he invest?' Is that a bounty?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his 26 years with the FBI, Donckels said, he has never seen a jury base a 
verdict strictly on information supplied by an informant, but rather by the 
evidence that corroborates what the informant said or did. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jurors have a tremendous ability to cut through the smoke and find the fire," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys and legal experts say that what Gomez was doing when he was 
not on camera also is crucial. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened the night before? What happened the day before? What was this 
informant doing and saying to make these deals go down? Nothing? Or something?" 
said David Biggs, an associate professor at Western State University College of 
Law. "Now that we know he's a thief, who's to say that he's not a liar?" 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez did more than just buy drugs. He was sent out to build a rapport with 
members of the Sixth Street gang who have had a stranglehold on Santa Ana's 3rd 
Street neighborhood for years. He hung out in "party rooms" as gang members 
smoked heroin, and checked out guns and Rolex watches they had for sale, 
according to FBI reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators spotted Gomez with a gang member known as "Shorty" in the 
neighborhood on Aug. 1, long after he was called off the streets, an FBI report 
shows. According to the report, Gomez told an agent he had not engaged in 
illegal activities. 
</P>
<P>
 But defense attorneys challenge those assertions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know there are many situations when the defendants say (Gomez) was smoking 
dope with them. That was alleged by two or three clients that I'm aware of, and 
also that they saw him shoot up (inject drugs)," Ducker said. Another defendant 
alleged Gomez set up him, providing the drugs that the defendant was later 
arrested with.  
</P>
<P>
 Some legal experts said they think that jurors on Operation Roundup cases may 
be able to look past Gomez and focus on the larger picture of gang crime in a 
troubled neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "It comes down to how much the jury is willing to swallow to accomplish the 
goal," Biggs said. "When you've got a war on drugs, you've got a lot of 
citizens who are willing to look the other way considerably." 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at the bigger picture, crime in that area has gone down," said 
Gregory Chris Brown, associate professor of criminal justice at Chapman 
University. "They are instituting programs to keep the community in better 
standing. I think overall it has had a positive impact on the community and the 
ends will justify the means. 
</P>
<P>
 "Plus, the general public has a very short memory. They would much rather have 
law enforcement make a few minor mistakes, and they think of them as minor, 
than to allow a criminal entity like this to fester in their community."

INJURED TODDLER DIES; MOTHER'S BOYFRIEND HELD; ARREST: CELERINO ALARRAN OCHOA, 
18, IS JAILED ON SUSPICION OF MURDER AFTER POLICE LEARN THAT HE IS NOT A MINOR. 
CHILD MIGHT HAVE SUFFERED A BROKEN NECK.

<P>
 An 18-month-old girl, critically injured Friday at her home, died Saturday 
morning and police have arrested her mother's boyfriend on suspicion of murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Celerino Alarran Ochoa, 18, had been held in Orange County Juvenile Hall since 
Friday on suspicion of child endangerment, but he was booked into the Santa Ana 
Jail on Saturday when police learned that he had lied about his age, Sgt. John 
Dettus said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ochoa originally told police he was 17, possibly making him eligible for 
treatment as a juvenile, Dettus said. Bail has not been set in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, the girl's mother, Maria Delgado, said she would stand by her 
boyfriend even though she was not sure how her daughter was injured. Delgado, 
22, said that authorities told her her daughter possibly suffered a broken 
neck. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities declined to comment on the injuries suffered by Carina Ramirez, 
who was removed from life-support systems about 10:20 a.m. and died a short 
time later at Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if he hurt the baby," the mother said, resting on the living 
room sofa. "I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Delgado said she has been living with Ochoa in the 200 block of North Figueroa 
Street for the past month and has known him for three months. The child's 
father, Jesus Ramirez, is living in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities were called to the home at 12:23 p.m. after receiving a report 
that a child had stopped breathing. Shortly before the call, Delgado said, she 
had been in the kitchen cooking while Ochoa, her daughter and 4-year-old son, 
Alberto, were in the living room. 
</P>
<P>
 Delgado said her daughter and son apparently were playing together when the 
girl fell and hit her head. She said her daughter was apparently knocked 
unconscious but was not bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
 She rushed to the child, picked her up and "called out to Celerino," Delgado 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt sick when I saw the baby. I was confused," she said, adding that she 
tried to comfort the child and then called the Fire Department. She said the 
back of her daughter's head appeared to be swollen. 
</P>
<P>
 Liz Zazueta, who lives behind Delgado, said her father owns the house that 
Delgado and her children share with three other people. On Friday, Zazueta 
said, she was on her way to work before the police arrived when she saw a man 
outside the Delgado house holding a child in his arms. She said there were 
other people outside with the man and they all appeared concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 Zazueta, however, said she did not know what had happened to the child. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Luis, who shares the house with Delgado, said he was not at home when the 
incident occurred and was not very familiar with the suspect's background. 
</P>
<P>
 Ochoa was taken into custody at the scene and questioned throughout the day by 
investigators of the Police Department's child abuse unit. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not until Saturday, Dettus said, that investigators learned that Ochoa 
had lied about his age. Following that discovery, police transferred Ochoa to 
the Santa Ana Jail. The charges were upgraded to suspicion of murder when the 
child died Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County coroner's officials said an autopsy on the child could be 
performed today. However, both police and coroner's officials declined to 
discuss the nature of the girl's injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral arrangements have not been made, Delgado said.

FESTIVAL-GOERS GET GOOD TASTE OF KOREA TRADITIONS

 Jennifer Robles never had kimchi, the spicy Korean cabbage, that was quite as 
spicy as the ones sold at the 12th annual Orange County Korean Festival. But 
then again, she never knew that Kia cars were a Korean line or that a karaoke 
machine plays laser disks. 
</P>
<P>
 "My grandmother is Korean and my mother's half Korean and half Russian," said 
the 17-year-old from La Puente, one of the thousands of people at the festival. 
"I've never tasted so much Korean food." 
</P>
<P>
 Under cloudy skies, festival-goers feasted on Korean barbecue, noodles, sushi 
and rice cakes simmered in kochijang, a red spicy sauce. People chatted in 
Korean while browsing through the 60 booths brimming with books, clothes and 
Korean art on both sides of the quad at K.D. Plaza, where the festival 
continues today. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the Korean Chamber of Commerce and the city of Garden Grove, the 
event was held to educate those who don't know much about the Korean culture, 
said Byung Pak, festival chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 "The second-generation Korean Americans don't know much about Korea," Pak 
said. "They have to learn. American people come here and see that we are one. 
Koreans, people from other countries, we're here together." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the fun-seekers brought their children, parents and in-laws to the 
festival just for a day out of the house. Others such as Robles went to the 
festival to learn more about themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy Lee, a 14-year-old Garden Grove High School student clad in traditional 
Korean dress, said she has seen many Koreans stick to their same groups. Having 
friends from other cultures has made her life better and she hopes the festival 
will do the same for others. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is kind of like community service," she said with a smile. "It's really 
nice that the American culture can see the Korean culture." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunny Hoang, 42, was preparing for the 1 p.m. Turtle Marathon, a walk of unity 
along Garden Grove Boulevard between Magnolia Avenue and Brookhurst Street. For 
the past few years, the Mission Viejo resident has been pushing her U.S.-born 
teen-age daughters to go to the festival so they can see Korean style and 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're coming at night," Hoang said. "At first, I had to push them to come, 
but now they really like it. They learn a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,000 people gathered across the street for the marathon. All 
participants received a free T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 The highlight of the day came at 3 p.m. with a parade along Garden Grove 
Boulevard. Hundreds lined up to see traditional dancers, marching bands and 
colorfully decorated floats. Young people demonstrated tae kwon do. This year's 
grand marshal was Norm Doerges, the executive vice president of Disneyland, who 
brought along his famous pal, Mickey Mouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Cries of "There's Mickey Mouse!" were heard from several children sitting on 
the curb waving little plastic U.S. and Korea flags provided by festival 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival, held at the shopping plaza at 9590 Garden Grove Blvd., began 
Oct. 6 and is scheduled to end at 10 p.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
 Though she was tired by the time the parade started, Jennifer Robles said it 
was a day well spent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got to see dances and learn what Korea is all about," she said. "It's a 
very good learning experience if you don't know much about your past."

POLITICS '94 / A BEHIND-THE-SCENES LOOK AT ORANGE COUNTY'S POLITICAL LIFE: 
ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF WHERE ROSS JOHNSON REALLY CALLS HIS HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Home is where the tax exemption is: The "mystery" of where Assemblyman Ross 
Johnson (R-Placentia) really lives--Sacramento, Fullerton, Placentia, perhaps 
even Newport Beach--seems to get deeper by the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrat Allan L. Dollison, a law clerk who is challenging Johnson for his 
72nd District seat, claims to have documents that show Johnson filed for a 
one-time-only $7,000 exemption for his home in Sacramento on his property tax 
bill in 1988. Dollison suggests the tax exemption means Johnson really lives in 
Sacramento, not North County, where his district is. 
</P>
<P>
 "This document has the legal effect of establishing Sacramento as Johnson's 
principal residence," Dollison said last week, adding that Johnson is 
registered to vote in Placentia. 
</P>
<P>
 Dollison hoped to spring the document on Johnson on Friday at a debate on KOCE 
Channel 50, but Johnson was a no-show. Debate moderator Jim Cooper said 
Johnson's office said he had jury duty, but Johnson's spokeswoman said he had 
never agreed to the debate due to a scheduling conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's place of residence has become an issue because he is said to be 
shopping for a home in Newport Beach, where he plans to run next year for state 
Sen. Marian Bergeson's soon-to-be-vacated seat. Assemblyman Gil Ferguson 
(R-Newport Beach) who already has announced his candidacy for Bergeson's post, 
also has criticized Johnson for seeking reelection to the Assembly seat while 
campaigning in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who usually avoids the news media, was unavailable for comment.

 EEE-AYE-EEE-AYE-OH!: The "barnyard" edition of the campaign mailers for the 
fall season has hit mailboxes, and it's a hoot. Democrat Donna L. Chessen, who 
is trying to unseat state Sen. Rob Hurtt (R-Garden Grove), sent out a 
mailer--filled with pictures of barnyard animals--that asserts Hurtt is too 
"chicken" to take a stand, "ducks" a lot of votes, "horses" around with 
politics. The mailer urges voters to send back a message: "bull." Chessen has, 
it concludes, "Less bull. More brains." But a Hurtt campaign spokesman cried 
foul, noting that Chessen claimed Hurtt had ducked some votes that were taken 
before he took office in March, 1993. "It's a blatant lie, and I expect a full 
apology," spokesman Doug Swardstrom said.

 It would've been easier to change jobs: When Lorraine Flores Williams signed 
up as a candidate for the Fullerton School District Board of Trustees, she was 
told by the county elections office that her job title--"drop-out prevention 
specialist"--could not be listed on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "They gave me a list of titles to choose from, but none of them were what I 
do," the candidate said. "I'm not a counselor, I'm not a truancy officer, but I 
had to choose the closest one. Why should they prevent you from calling 
yourself whatever you want? Why can't I? That's my point." 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Because her real job title is four words long--one too many for the 
allotted space. She tried to fight the issue but lost and had to settle for 
"student truancy aide." UPCOMING EVENTS

CAMPAIGN '94: ISSUES AND ANSWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three candidates are running in the Nov. 8 election to represent the 72nd 
Assembly District. They are Democrat Allan L. Dollison of Brea; Libertarian 
Geoffrey Braun of Placentia; and Republican Ross Johnson, the incumbent, of 
Placentia. Here's how they stand on four issues. "Three Strikes" Crime Law 
</P>
<P>
 Dollison: "I favor and endorse the 'three strikes' initiative. We must do all 
we can to protect society from dangerous and violent repeat felons. However, 
those politicians who say that 'three strikes' is all that is needed are living 
in denial. We must do something about the unlimited and free access to killing 
machines (guns) that have endangered society rather than protect it. We must 
also reform the juvenile justice system, and require boot camps for all young 
offenders. These camps would concentrate on military-style discipline and 
education." 
</P>
<P>
 Braun: "No one can deny that crime is a serious problem in America. But rather 
than protecting us and keeping our streets safe, current government policies 
are the primary reason that the crime problem is growing worse, and 'three 
strikes' crime laws are bandages, not cures. The Libertarian alternative to 
'three strikes' would apply a victim-centered approach to all aspects of the 
criminal justice system: shifting resources away from victimless crimes and 
toward violent crimes with real victims; protecting the rights of victims 
throughout the criminal justice process; and preventing new victims by ensuring 
the right of self-defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson: "I co-authored the 'three strikes' anti-crime law in the Legislature. 
Fifty-eight percent of those released from California's prisons are convicted 
of a new crime within two years of release. It's time to shut this revolving 
door. Some repeat offenders have, quite simply, forfeited their right to live 
free in a civilized society. Incarceration is costly, but it's far more 
expensive to pay for police, courts, prosecutors, probation officers and public 
defenders processing the same career criminals over and over again." Initiative 
to Curtail Benefits to Illegal Immigrants 
</P>
<P>
 Dollison: "I am opposed to Proposition 187. It is contrary to the U.S. 
Constitution. I am proposing that we re-prioritize the mission of the 
California National Guard and send a force of 10,000 to 15,000 soldiers to 
protect the border. A massive recruitment drive would need to be undertaken as 
the Guard does not have the manpower to keep a force like that full-time. 
Secondly, I propose that we analyze where the holes in the border are and that 
a 'Berlin-style' wall be built to keep the illegal aliens from coming. Kicking 
children out of school will only worsen our crime problem, and not affect our 
immigration problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Braun: " 'Save Our State' is a racially motivated proposition that tries to 
pin California's financial troubles on undocumented Latino immigrants rather 
than admit that government programs are inherently unmanageable. It presupposes 
that undocumented aliens cross our borders for the sole purpose of obtaining 
government handouts. In reality, the majority of our immigrants, documented and 
undocumented alike, are drawn by our higher wage base. Any problem with 
California's taxpayer-financed programs comes primarily from the way government 
does business, not from those who utilize the flawed programs." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson: "More than half the illegal immigrants in the United States reside in 
California, including 23,200 state prison inmates whose upkeep costs taxpayers 
$200 million annually. The state Department of Finance estimates that another 
100,000 undocumented immigrants move here every year. California's diversity is 
a great asset, but footing the bill for a wide range of services to illegal 
immigrants imposes a burden on taxpayers that is unaffordable and unfair. The 
'SOS' initiative will end the benefits that draw people here illegally, and 
send a message to Washington that the federal government must control our 
borders." Single-Payer Health Initiative 
</P>
<P>
 Dollison: "Universal coverage should be guaranteed for all, but provided by 
government, employer and employee contributions into 'health-care accounts.' 
Then, individuals would negotiate with doctors to keep their prices down. The 
days of the $18 Tylenol pill need to come to an end. We also need to increase 
the number of doctors produced in this country. Basic economics tells us that 
by increasing supply, prices will fall. Lastly, something needs to be done 
about the fact that the average person spends a third of his entire health-care 
budget in the final year of life. This issue would present very difficult moral 
dilemmas." 
</P>
<P>
 Braun: "A single-payer health-care plan would increase costs, crush jobs, 
impose broad new taxes on Californians, destroy consumer choice and lead to 
rationing of health care. Instead, health-care reforms should draw on the 
strengths of the free market. I support the following reforms: establishing 
tax-exempt medical savings accounts similar to IRAs; restructuring tax policy 
to make all health-care expenditures 100% tax deductible; deregulating the 
health-care industry; replacing the Food and Drug Administration with voluntary 
certification by a private-sector organization; privatizing Medicare and 
Medicaid." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson: "This measure would impose the largest tax increase in California's 
history -- an estimated $40 billion to $53 billion in increased income and 
payroll taxes -- to fund a state-run bureaucracy that could easily double the 
size of state government. Under Canada's single-payer system, 177,000 people 
are currently on a waiting list for surgery, and waits of eight months for 
tests such as mammograms are not uncommon. We need reform, but this initiative 
is not the answer. I support insurance coverage reforms to ensure wider access 
to health-care coverage, and consumer-oriented reforms to help bring medical 
costs down." Future Uses For El Toro Marine Corps Air Station 
</P>
<P>
 Dollison: "I support converting El Toro into a commercial airport, where only 
small aircraft land. This is very similar to the airport that exists in 
Fullerton. Currently, John Wayne Airport has both type of aircraft land, and 
Federal Aviation officials consider this a dangerous situation, and is inviting 
an accident. If you only allow small aircraft to land, it will appease the 
neighbors in the community, as it will actually be a reduction in noise from 
the F-16s they grew used to." 
</P>
<P>
 Braun: "The Department of the Navy should sell MCAS El Toro to the highest 
bidder, and the new owner should be free to develop the site into a commercial 
airport if he feels that is the highest and best use of the property." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson: "Orange County voters will have the opportunity to express themselves 
on this issue on Nov. 8. This much is clear: If Orange County is to realize its 
full potential as an economic power on the Pacific Rim, a truly international 
airport is an important step. El Toro is one option, but legitimate 
environmental and other concerns of area residents and local governments would 
certainly have to be addressed."

MORE CANDIDATES THAN ISSUES IN LOS ALAMITOS RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four years ago, the City Council election here was canceled because no one ran 
against the three incumbents. In 1992, there were two challengers, one of whom 
died two months before the election. The incumbents were returned to office. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Nov. 8 election will be different for the 6,000 registered voters in 
this city of about 12,000 residents. Seven candidates -- five of them 
challengers -- are vying for the three open seats on the council. 
</P>
<P>
 One likely reason for the crowded field is that the five-member council will 
have at least one new face. After 12 years on the council, Mayor Anthony R. 
Selvaggi has decided not to seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's encouraging to see more people challenge for the seats," said Selvaggi, 
69, who also served nine years on the Planning Commission. "The more people 
involved, the healthier is the political arena." 
</P>
<P>
 Local elections here are often friendly contests among well-intentioned 
neighbors seeking to keep the community the way it is. Residents disdain 
growth, as shown two years ago when they voted to disband the city's 
Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent city surveys have indicated general contentment among residents, due to 
a low crime rate, excellent police and fire services, good schools and plenty 
of youth and seniors programs. 
</P>
<P>
 City operations are run in a frugal manner. This fiscal year's $6.4-million 
operating budget includes more than $1.4 million in reserves, and was balanced 
without imposing new taxes or laying off employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no burning issues," Selvaggi said. "There's voter satisfaction." 
</P>
<P>
 That seems apparent. 
</P>
<P>
 Even a 6% utility tax, imposed in April, 1991, has generated little conflict 
among the candidates. Only one candidate, Marilyn M. Poe, a tax consultant, 
wants the tax repealed. The others, aware that the utility tax generates about 
$1.5 million a year, say that it is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe it can be eliminated," said fellow candidate Frank Varnum, a 
business owner. "It can be reduced though." 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no other alternative," accountant Kevin McKinney said. "But it has 
to be spent wisely." 
</P>
<P>
 Another council hopeful, Timothy A. Harris, said the utility tax cannot be 
eliminated without cutting services, and the two incumbents -- Alice Jempsa and 
Robert P. Wahlstrom -- said that police, fire and other basic services cannot 
be maintained properly without the utility tax. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the fairest tax in Los Alamitos," said challenger Victor D'Agostino, an 
auditor. He said that banks and hospitals, which do not generate sales taxes, 
provide about $1.2 million of the utility tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will take a minor miracle to eliminate it," said Jempsa, who is seeking 
her third term on the council. "It has become one way of paying our bills." 
</P>
<P>
 Wahlstrom, purchasing director of a restaurant chain, said that the city must 
increase its sales tax base, retain and attract businesses, and make city 
government more business friendly. All other candidates agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Poe suggested that a panel of merchants and business people formed a few years 
ago be reconvened to study ways to improve the business climate. 
</P>
<P>
 All candidates label themselves as pro-business, underscoring the quest for 
new sources of revenue in the face of what they call "raids" on cities' 
finances by the state government to balance its own budget. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city's plan to separate from the Los Alamitos County Water District, 
which provides sewer services to residents here and other communities, has 
generated mixed reactions from the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Although all seven candidates say the city should wait until the state and the 
county finish their studies on special districts, eventually the city has to 
decide whether to take over sewer services within city limits. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Alamitos County Water District operates sewer lines that have linked 
households here and in Rossmoor, Seal Beach and Cypress to a county sewer 
treatment plant for the past 42 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Jempsa, Wahlstrom and D'Agostino said that the city should eventually take 
over. McKinney and Varnum said that the city should leave it alone. Poe said 
the state or the Local Agency Formation Commission should make the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris said that if taking over sewer services helps build the reserves to 
maintain the sewer lines, he will support it.

NEIGHBORS OFFER INFORMATION IN WOMAN'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Neighbors of a 50-year-old woman who was found bludgeoned to death in her 
bathrobe Friday in her hillside townhouse said the woman might have been killed 
late Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Police would only say Saturday that Marie Evans Powell had died of "blunt 
force trauma" to the upper body. She was discovered on the lower level of her 
two-bedroom townhouse in 22400 block of Caminito Tecate just before noon Friday 
by relatives alerted by her boss. 
</P>
<P>
 But Alice Bean, whose townhouse shares a wall with Powell's, said she heard a 
loud thump against the wall shortly after 10 p.m. Wednesday. A few moments 
later she heard the rustling of footsteps through the ivy outside the 
sliding-glass doors at the back of her home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a big thump," Bean said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bean said she didn't think much of it because Powell was still in the 
process of fixing up her new place. "I thought maybe she was just moving stuff 
in." 
</P>
<P>
 Powell, who was not known by any of her neighbors, had lived in the townhouse 
for about a month, neighbors said. But even in that short time, she had 
established a pattern that alerted neighbors to the fact that something was not 
right. 
</P>
<P>
 Bean said Powell, like others in the 914-unit complex, put her garbage cans 
out Wednesday night, then brought them back in Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Bean's husband said hello to Powell about 7:30 p.m. Wednesday as she was 
putting the cans out. But when the couple left for work Thursday morning, the 
cans were still there, as they were that night and Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually she brings them in Thursday morning," said Rob Sullivan, who lived 
two houses away. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorie Fisher said she last saw Powell sitting in her brightly lit living room 
about 8:30 p.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw her through my living room window. She was sitting in a chair," Fisher 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, Fisher too wondered about the garbage cans and why Powell had 
left her garage door open Thursday and Friday, with her brown Mercedes parked 
inside. On Saturday, sheriff's investigators were still sifting through the 
crime scene and were arranging to tow away the Mercedes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little shaken up," said Fisher, who lived on the other side of Powell 
from Bean. "I leave my garage door open. I leave this other door open. I won't 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Standing on her porch Saturday, Bean said she was a little nervous, especially 
after seeing a large, jagged rip in the screen on the sliding glass doors 
leading to Powell's bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a quiet neighborhood -- you don't hear of many break-ins," she said. 
"It's strange." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Powell's neighbors said Saturday that they felt sorry they had not 
known the small, red-haired woman who died in their midst. Most had seldom said 
little more than hello. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't even know her name," Bean said, standing on her porch. "We feel 
awful about that now."

 Rookie Officer Daniel Binyon was on a routine shoplifting call at the Lucky 
supermarket Saturday night when the shouts started: A BB-gun-toting man 
claiming to be a woman was outside ramming a shopping cart into his police 
cruiser. 
</P>
<P>
 Binyon, just three months on the job, sprinted outside to find someone 
slamming a cart into his car and yelling that he/she "didn't like Democrats or 
Republicans," according to Buena Park Lt. Michael Schwartz.While a small crowd 
looked on, Binyon grabbed the culprit, yanking a gun from his/her waistband in 
the parking lot of the supermarket at 6931 La Palma Ave., he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess he had to wrestle her to the ground to get the cuffs on her," said 
Schwartz, deciding to refer to the person as a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's kinda hefty. She looks like that character on 'Saturday Night Live.' 
You know, she looks like Pat," he said, referring to the mannish, but 
gender-ambiguous character on the TV show. 
</P>
<P>
 Binyon sheepishly hustled the person, whose driver's license identifies her as 
a him, to the Buena Park Police Station in his scratched-up cruiser. But at the 
station, a new dilemma arose. 
</P>
<P>
 "She says she's a she," Schwartz said. "The big conflict we have now is: 
'Should I put her with the men or the women?' Right now we've got her off by 
herself." 
</P>
<P>
 The individual's name was not available late Saturday.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Police are seeking a man who smashed a window in his girlfriend's home and 
possibly abducted her. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove Police Sgt. Scott Watson said Cynthia Jane Melson, 24, has called 
family members three times to tell them she is OK, but that police are 
continuing to investigate it as a possible kidnaping after receiving reports 
that her boyfriend, identified as Joseph Ray McBath, dragged her to his car. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not located her to confirm" that she is safe, Watson said.
