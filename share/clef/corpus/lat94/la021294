BOSNIA'S SERBS START TO COMPLY WITH ULTIMATUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Bosnian Serb forces near Sarajevo held their fire Friday and finally began 
complying with a Western ultimatum to pull their heavy weapons outside the 
city's 12-mile exclusion zone, as U.N. and NATO forces began moving to enforce 
a cease-fire there. 
</P>
<P>
 After a slow start Thursday, punctuated by at least one violation of the 
truce, Bosnian Serb militia units were reported slowly moving their artillery 
away from the outskirts of Bosnia-Herzegovina's besieged capital, while Muslims 
inside Sarajevo turned their heavy weapons over to U.N. peacekeeping forces. 
</P>
<P>
 The developments came as the Clinton Administration, after months of 
hesitation, began pressing Bosnia's Muslim-led government to accept a 
compromise settlement of the war in the former Yugoslav republic, promising 
that it will meet the Muslims' "reasonable requirements." 
</P>
<P>
 To help the negotiations succeed, officials warned that they may use military 
action against the Bosnian Serbs if they do not cooperate and affirmed that the 
United States is willing to send as many as 15,000 troops to help carry out any 
new agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials denied that their new approach is designed to pressure the 
Muslims into accepting a three-way partition of Bosnia. In fact, the Muslims 
had already agreed to such a division during earlier rounds of negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 The pullout by the Bosnian Serb units followed an incident late Thursday in 
which the first day of the cease-fire was broken by the firing of two artillery 
shells into the city, accompanied by a barrage of machine-gun fire that 
witnesses said lasted 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 However, U.S. officials said Friday that North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
commanders had decided to treat the incident as an aberration. The shelling on 
Thursday was brief and was believed to be the result of renegade units on both 
sides seeking to sabotage the truce. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the United States and its NATO partners began deploying 24 
additional fighter-bombers and other aircraft to bases in Italy to help enforce 
the NATO ultimatum. The NATO council on Wednesday threatened the Bosnian Serbs 
with air strikes unless they withdraw their heavy weapons from the hills around 
Sarajevo or put them under U.N. control by Feb. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon said that it was dispatching eight more F-15Es to join the air 
armada. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian officials welcomed the U.S. negotiating initiative, even though they 
acknowledged that any settlement that resulted would mean the division of 
Bosnia into three religious-ethnic areas, something that they long had sought 
to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say we are relieved to see the United States more involved," said Muhamed 
Sacirbey, Bosnia's U.N. ambassador. "We understand the limitations on our 
ability to maneuver. . . . At this point, all we are seeking is minimal justice 
and a viable Bosnian state." 
</P>
<P>
 Undersecretary of State Peter Tarnoff said that the new diplomatic initiative 
includes a threat of further action against the Bosnian Serbs if they do not 
cooperate and a U.S. pledge to provide thousands of peacekeeping troops to help 
implement the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, however, officials said that the Administration, obviously 
worried about the adverse public reaction it has received over the peacekeeping 
mission in Somalia, has pared back the number of U.S. troops that it is willing 
to deploy in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Defense Secretary Les Aspin had told U.S. NATO partners last year that 
the United States was willing to provide about half of the 50,000-man force 
initially estimated. But officials said that President Clinton has now cut that 
to one-third, calling it "more realistic." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the longer-range F-15E Strike Eagles, the additional air package 
includes two U.S. AC-130 gunships and two EC-130 electronic surveillance 
planes. Officials said that the fighters are equipped with special 
night-capability radar. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. aircraft will be joined by four F-16 fighters from the Netherlands, 
eight F-16s from Turkey and four Jaguar fighters from Britain. Most had been 
sent to enforce the "no-fly" zone over Bosnia but had returned to their bases 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Navy Adm. Jeremy M. Boorda, commander of the NATO military operation, 
said Friday that the deployments will bring the total number of allied 
fighter-bombers available to enforce the ultimatum to 160, up from 136. 
</P>
<P>
 As the transfer of weapons to the United Nations began, U.N. commanders 
deployed their peacekeeping forces throughout the city to serve as buffers 
between Bosnian Serb troops and Muslim residents. Strategists hope that their 
presence will deter further Serbian attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Clinton and Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin finally spoke by 
telephone about Bosnia, after being foiled for two days by what officials said 
Friday were line problems between Moscow and Yeltsin's vacation home. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton told reporters after the 30-minute call that "we agreed we had the 
same long-term objective, which was achieving a just peace agreement, and the 
same short-term objective, to relieve the shelling of Sarajevo." 
</P>
<P>
 But the two men apparently remained far apart on whether further action by the 
United Nations is needed before the NATO ultimatum can take effect. The 
Security Council had been scheduled to meet Friday to discuss a companion 
Russian plan but did not do so because of poor weather in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 In a briefing at the State Department, officials told reporters thatthe United 
States hopes to press the Bosnians to come up with a negotiating proposal 
focusing on their bottom-line needs -- a process Clinton has called "getting to 
the bedrock," one aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, they said, the United States and the European Union will endorse the 
plan and try to persuade the Bosnian Serbs and Croats to agree to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Other senior officials said that they expect the Bosnians to come forward soon 
with a proposal based on the plan already negotiated by European Union mediator 
Lord Owen and U.N. envoy Thorvald Stoltenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 That plan would turn Bosnia into a loose confederation of three areas -- 
predominantly Serbian, Croatian and Muslim -- and give the Muslims one-third of 
the republic's territory, the Croats 17.5% and the Serbs 49.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 The Muslim-led government has already accepted both of those principles. The 
Bosnian government -- and the Clinton Administration -- once hoped to avoid the 
country's partition, but by last fall both had accepted it as inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Two territorial issues remain to be negotiated. One is the Bosnian 
government's demand for an outlet to the Adriatic Sea at the Croatian port of 
Neum and access to the Sava River, an important inland shipping route. A senior 
State Department official said several proposals have been made to meet that 
request. 
</P>
<P>
 A second issue is the fate of three largely Muslim towns surrounded by Bosnian 
Serb forces in the eastern part of the country, Srebrenica, Zepa and Gorazde. 
The Serbs have suggested that the Muslims abandon the towns and trade them for 
land near Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian government, pointing out that Muslims have lived in the towns for 
centuries, wants to keep them as safe havens and connect them with road 
corridors to the rest of their territory.  
</P>
<P>
 "This has been the hardest issue of all . . . and it may continue to be," the 
senior official said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that the Administration expects the Bosnians to come up with a 
workable proposal soon. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that U.S. officials have told the Bosnian government in strong terms 
that it should not hold out in the belief that it can win more on the 
battlefield. 
</P>
<P>
 "The notion of a spring offensive that would roll up big gains against the 
Serbs is a chimera," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Bosnian Serbs refuse to accept a reasonable proposal, on the other 
hand, the United States will go to its allies and propose both military and 
non-military pressure to bring them around. 
</P>
<P>
 Such actions could include air strikes against Serbian supply lines and 
weapons concentrations, one official said, adding that the Administration has 
not yet decided to seek such action. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarnoff and other officials said the Administration would still require that 
several conditions be met before deploying any American troops in Bosnia -- 
chief among them that a peace agreement be in place and the first steps already 
be taken to implement it and that the warring factions agree that they want the 
peacekeepers to come.

SNOW, SLEET POUND EAST; AIR TRAFFIC DISRUPTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN J. GOLDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sheets of snow and sleet swept through the eastern United States on Friday, 
burying two of New York's airports under five-foot drifts and forcing the 
federal government to virtually close in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 18 inches of snow fell in the New York metropolitan area as the city 
struggled to dig out from the 10th snowstorm of the season and its worst winter 
in 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Stock Exchange shut early because of the weather. Ground 
transportation along much of the East Coast, including commuter trains, was 
crippled and millions were trapped in collective cabin fever. 
</P>
<P>
 Many municipalities declared states of emergency as supplies of salt ran low 
and the snow clogged roads. Accidents were common. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of New York's three airports were completely inoperable while only a 
trickle of outgoing flights was allowed to take off from the one runway open at 
La Guardia. The result: Flights were canceled all over the world.  
</P>
<P>
 "People are stuck" everywhere, said Clifford Koch, chairman of the Beekman 
Travel Service, a Manhattan firm with a large international clientele. 
</P>
<P>
 The Concorde from London was forced to land in Bangor, Me. In Los Angeles, 
direct flights to Newark and JFK airports were canceled, stranding hundreds of 
passengers and prompting others to devise indirect routes to East Coast 
destinations.  
</P>
<P>
 "Passengers are being put on the next available flight, which will probably be 
tomorrow," a reservation clerk at United Airlines said Friday. "All flights are 
canceled for today." 
</P>
<P>
 Flights that required connections in hub cities -- such as Phoenix, Dallas, 
Denver and Chicago -- en route to the East Coast were largely unaffected, but 
many passengers found themselves stranded once they arrived in those cities, 
airport officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole winter has been a killer," said John Kampfe, a spokesman for the 
Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the airports. "You 
have the wind. You have intense snow coming down. . . . It's a whiteout 
condition. The snow removal crews can't go out and can't see in front of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing for the safety of nonessential federal employees, the U.S. government 
basically closed for the second time this winter in Washington. It was only the 
second time the government was forced to shut twice in the same winter since 
the Office of Personnel Management began keeping track of closures. The last 
time the government shut twice in the same winter was 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "These decisions are very difficult to make," said OPM Director of 
Communications Janice Lachance. " . . . It's a matter of people being able to 
get to work safely without putting themselves and others in danger." 
</P>
<P>
 In Philadelphia, snowy streets were almost deserted. The foul weather 
stretched as far south as Florida, where thick clouds and high winds for a time 
delayed the landing of the space shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
 In communities all along the East Coast, the weather strained municipal 
budgets. Extra snow removal workers were hired in New York. In Kentucky, 12 
counties declared states of emergency after a storm coated the state with three 
inches of ice. Supplies of salt to melt snow and ice on sidewalks and roads 
were short. Officials in Pennsylvania said the state was almost out of salt and 
a 180-truck convoy was sent to mines in Upstate New York. Virginia sent 45 
trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Some areas of New England, already buried under two feet of snow, braced for 
further accumulations. 
</P>
<P>
 The deep snow in New Hampshire forced owls, bobcats and other predators to 
search for food in populated areas as their normal prey remained safely 
burrowed under snowbanks.  
</P>
<P>
 The mere act of walking in New York, where snow drifts reached to the roofs of 
cars, became an adventure. 
</P>
<P>
 At Grand Central Station, Earl MacKenzie, a commuter hurrying home to 
Connecticut, slipped on the slushy floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh God, I landed right on my keester," he exclaimed as two homeless men 
collecting coins in paper cups hurried to help him up. After saying thanks, he 
headed toward his train. "Cheapskate! I hope you fall again," one of the 
homeless muttered. 
</P>
<P>
 The massive storm, which followed almost a foot of snow earlier in the week, 
also brought acts of kindness toward the homeless. In a shoe repair shop on 
Manhattan's residential upper West Side, a good Samaritan purchased a pair of 
overshoes for a homeless man and struggled to help him put them on over his 
battered shoes. A block away on Broadway, two young girls bought discount 
socks, gloves and hats and handed them out to homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
 At its peak, snow fell in parts of New York City at the rate of two inches an 
hour. Newark, N.J., reported 18 inches of snow as the storm continued on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Island Rail Road, the nation's largest commuter rail system, was 
forced to halt service on part of its network, including all service to New 
York's Pennsylvania Station.  
</P>
<P>
 By early afternoon the train station in Jamaica, Queens, had become "a 
commuter refugee camp," in the words of one of the thousands of cold, angry 
people who huddled at gates, waiting for a train. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's overcrowded to the point of being dangerous," said Gary Lewi, one of the 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm even affected the crisis in Bosnia as the U.N. Security Council 
postponed its debate on the war-torn nation until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Wyllie, a metoerologist at the National Weather Service, said New York 
was experiencing its snowiest winter since 1976-77, when more than 50 inches 
fell. So far this winter, the meteorologists said, the city has received almost 
40 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 "It started to get cold just around Christmas time, and it hasn't let up that 
much," Wyllie said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under snow emergency regulations, only cars with chains or radial tires can 
use major New York roads. But it largely is an honor system -- and in many 
cases it was ignored Friday. As he drove down the East Side Drive, a major 
highway which was only partially plowed, a cab driver, turned toward his 
passenger with some disquieting news. The driver said he was being extra 
careful because his tires were partially bald. 
</P>
<P>
 After only slight skidding, the cab arrived safely at its destination. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm, which mixed cold Arctic air with moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, 
especially hit plane travelers, some of whom were trying to get to Lillehammer, 
Norway, for the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the longest duration storms we can remember," said Bill Berry, 
a spokesman at Delta Air Lines headquarters in Atlanta. " . . . This storm has 
impacted all the transatlantic operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Flights that were on their way will be diverted to other airports and then we 
will try to accommodate passengers as best we can around New York. There's not 
much hope for those who have to get into the New York area. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's bad timing for many of those people who are headed for Norway and the 
Olympics," he added. "Our Norway service cannot get out of Kennedy." 
</P>
<P>
 Like other airlines using Kennedy as a hub for European travel, Delta 
scrambled to find other routes for passengers to reach Lillehammer in time for 
the opening ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout parts of the East battered by the storm, cabin fever was a common 
malady. As schools closed, many parents worried that spring vacations would 
have to be shortened to make up for lost class time and plans for family 
getaways would have to be modified or even abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuck behind snowdrifts at home, parents fought to keep their youngsters busy, 
served snacks, mopped up spills and wiped noses runny from the cold. Snowmen 
sprouted on normally busy blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 With snow falling so rapidly, clearing a path on sidewalks seemed at times 
almost a Herculean task, but some would-be strongmen ignored the storm. A 
mailman complained about his difficult trek through the snow outside a nearby 
gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
 "All these tough guys were working out, lifting weights," the mailman 
lamented. "You think one of them could lift a shovel."

NEWS ANALYSIS; CLINTON SHIFTS JAPAN FOCUS FROM SECURITY TO ECONOMY; RELATIONS: 
IN A BREAK WITH PAST, THE PRESIDENT REFUSES TO RETREAT FROM HIS BLUNT 
INSISTENCE ON CHANGE IN TOKYO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid the snow and ice of a bad Washington winter, Japan and the United States 
served notice Friday that the Cold War alliance between them really has come to 
an end. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, the United States is concentrating more on the economic 
disagreements than on the security ties between Washington and Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 1950s, the United States has repeatedly given security ties greater 
weight than economics in its relationship with Japan. Although President 
Clinton took office pledging to reorder these priorities, Japanese officials 
had hoped he would end up behaving like his predecessors in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever there is a new Administration (in Washington), they always blow a 
lot of hot air, but after several months it quiets down," former Japanese Prime 
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa quipped last year. 
</P>
<P>
 For a time, it seemed Japan's hopes might be realized. Clinton avoided 
confrontation with Japan both at July's economic summit in Tokyo and during 
Japan's first six months under the leadership of new Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa. 
</P>
<P>
 But the President made it plain Friday that even in the midst of security 
crises like North Korea's nuclear program, he does not intend to retreat from 
his blunt insistence on fundamental economic change in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to develop a more open economy and society," he admonished one 
Japanese reporter at Friday's press conference as a solemn-faced delegation of 
Japanese officials looked on behind Hosokawa. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's own top advisers -- far more unified in their approach to Japan than 
past Administrations -- are, if anything, even tougher than the President in 
insisting that the relationship between the two countries undergo a dramatic 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 "For 45 or 50 years, the main item in U.S.-Japanese relations was security. 
Japan was the bulwark against Soviet expansion eastward," Deputy Treasury 
Secretary Roger Altman said this week. "Well, the Cold War is over and the 
President of the United States is a person centered around economics. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 " 'It's the economy, stupid,' " Altman declared, echoing a now-famous Clinton 
campaign slogan. "The traditional American approach of subordinating economic 
interests to security is over. This economic relationship (with Japan) has been 
unbalanced for some time. It's time to bring Japan into step. . . . The world 
has changed." 
</P>
<P>
 One leading U.S. critic of Japan's economic policies, UC San Diego Prof. 
Chalmers Johnson, praised the Administration for its stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really scared to death we were going to have some sort of Gergenism, 
claiming there was a breakthrough," Johnson told The Times on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 (He was referring to senior White House adviser David Gergen, who in July 
extravagantly hailed Clinton's first effort at a trade accord in Tokyo.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Japan will change only when the circumstances are forced upon it. It profits 
from free-market economics without opening up to a free market." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said, however, that he believes it has taken Clinton and his aides too 
long to try to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with Japan, which was close to $60 
billion last year. "The sole result of this on-the-job education by the Clinton 
Administration is that we are now $60 billion poorer," he said. "That (sum of 
money) is what Mrs. Clinton needs to make health care work." 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Douglas Paal, a former George Bush Administration specialist on 
Asia, accused Clinton and his aides of "pushing too fast, too soon for change 
with Hosokawa, when he clearly has limits on his ability to act." 
</P>
<P>
 What was striking after Friday's Clinton-Hosokawa summit was the extent to 
which senior U.S. officials were willing, indeed eager, to talk about starting 
entirely fresh in the American relationship with Japan. One top U.S. official 
said the meeting and its aftermath mark "a clear break with the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Will intense economic frictions erode the close security ties between the 
United States and Japan? Both governments took pains Friday to insist that 
nothing has changed in that area. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rest of our relationship is in good shape," Clinton said at the news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa, too, sought to cordon off and minimize the economic differences. He 
described the ties between the United States and Japan as "the relationship 
between grown-ups." The use of that metaphor, however, seemed to suggest a 
degree of acrimony and to raise questions about whether the United States had 
until now been treating Japan like a child -- or whether both countries had 
lost the happiness of childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Until negotiations finally broke down in the early hours Friday morning, it 
appeared that the Japanese officials were still unsure of the strength of the 
Clinton Administration's commitment to its economic objectives with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 They had some reason for uncertainty. The President had sent some conflicting 
signals last year. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as Clinton was inaugurated, then-Prime Minister Miyazawa sought to 
visit him in Washington. The new Administration put him off, with senior U.S. 
officials saying that there was no point in an early meeting between the two 
leaders because Japan needed to take steps to ease the trade imbalance between 
the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
 When Miyazawa finally came to the White House last April, he had an icy and 
confrontational session with Clinton, who insisted that his Administration 
would focus less on initiatives than on results. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's not paper this over," he told the Japanese leader at one point, setting 
a theme that he echoed several times Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 But these early tough signals could be dismissed as mere rhetoric. And in 
fact, the Administration's policies toward Japan were moderated in late June 
and early summer. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Clinton was much lower in the polls than he is now. And U.S. 
officials now acknowledge that they decided on a policy of restraint last 
summer after they saw that Miyazawa's Liberal Democratic Party, which had ruled 
Japan for nearly four decades, was about to fall. They maintained this low-key 
approach for several months after Hosokawa's coalition government took office. 
</P>
<P>
 At the economic summit in Tokyo last July, when Miyazawa stood up at a news 
conference and rehashed Japan's opposition to numerical targets for reducing 
Japan's trade surplus, Clinton replied: "We have a slight difference of view on 
that. But . . . there's no point in bringing (it) up again." 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's patience began to run out by late fall, when it saw that 
the U.S. trade deficit with Japan was continuing to mount and that efforts at 
negotiations between the two countries were going nowhere. Some Administration 
officials privately urged Clinton to come down hard on Hosokawa last November 
when the two men met with other Asian leaders in Seattle. But Clinton held off 
once again. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, there was no holding back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, if Japan has further proposals, our door remains open," the 
President said. "But ultimately, Japan's market must be open."

HOSOKAWA, CLINTON FAIL TO REACH PACT; TRADE: THE TWO LEADERS ARE UNABLE TO 
RESOLVE DIFFERENCES IN WASHINGTON TALKS. U.S. OFFICIALS CONSIDER RETALIATORY

 President Clinton and Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa failed Friday 
to resolve their deep differences on key trade issues, and U.S. officials began 
considering specific retaliatory and punitive measures intended to force Japan 
to open its markets to American products. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reality is, we'll take some action," a senior Administration official 
said, holding out little hope that -- barring a Japanese concession -- a trade 
clash could be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
 After three hours of what were described as "direct, intense" meetings with 
Hosokawa, Clinton said that, while the overall U.S.-Japanese relationship 
remains solid, six months of negotiations have failed to reconcile widely 
differing views on the crucial issue of opening Japanese markets to U.S. goods. 
</P>
<P>
 With the failure to reach an agreement by a deadline set last July in Tokyo, 
the President rejected Hosokawa's call for more talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a need for a little bit of cooling off," Hosokawa acknowledged, with 
Clinton at his side in the White House East Room, at a news conference. "We'll 
just cool our heads for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 "The President feels it would be pointless" to continue the negotiations 
"until there is a change in attitude" by the Japanese, a senior Administration 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The current dispute between the two major trading partners is over how to 
reduce Japan's towering trade surplus in four economic sectors -- autos and 
auto parts, medical equipment, telecommunications equipment and insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and Hosokawa's predecessor, Kiichi Miyazawa, agreed in Tokyo last July 
that they would establish a framework for setting "objective criteria" by which 
progress in reducing the trade surplus could be measured. 
</P>
<P>
 But Japan has insisted since shortly after that agreement was reached that, 
however such criteria are set, it will not agree to numerical targets -- for 
example, specific sales goals of U.S. automobiles in Japan. It was the hurdle 
of numerical targets in the four economic sectors that the two leaders could 
not clear on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, we have not been able to reach agreement in any of the four 
areas we identified last July," Clinton said. "Japan's offers made in these 
negotiations simply did not meet the standards agreed to in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today we could have disguised our differences with cosmetic agreements, but 
the issues between us are so important for our own nations and for the rest of 
the world that it is better to have reached no agreement than to have reached 
an empty agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Japan has further proposals, our door remains open. But ultimately, 
Japan's market must be open," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the July agreement is intended to bring down Japan's global trade 
surplus, which in 1993 was about $132 billion, nearly half of which was with 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the closed nature of the Japanese market, Clinton said that U.S. 
medical technology firms have 40% of the European market but only 15% of the 
Japanese market. Foreign telecommunications companies' sales amount to 5% of 
the Japanese market but a 25% share of the market in other major industrial 
nations, an Administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa, who took office in August, said his administration has been trying 
to remove regulations from the Japanese economy, mired in a rare recession, and 
that numerical targets would run counter to such a course. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not what we're asking for," Clinton said, insisting on "a way of 
measuring by objective standards whether progress is being made in opening 
markets." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Administration officials said the White House would focus during the 
next two weeks on measures that would pressure Japan to take the steps it has 
resisted, not just during the last six months, but over more than a decade in 
multiple negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be reviewing all of our available options to open the markets, and 
there need be no delay in the review," a senior official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why the Administration was unprepared to take action immediately, the 
senior aide said: "The Japanese over the last several days have been giving us 
reasons to think that they might be, at the last minute, meeting our criteria." 
</P>
<P>
 Another official, speaking, as did the others, on the condition of anonymity, 
said that the following measures were being considered: 
</P>
<P>
 * Beginning a number of high-priority, high-profile trade actions against 
Japan that could result in retaliation against specific industries if 
violations of existing trade agreements are discovered. This could lead to the 
exclusion of certain Japanese products from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 * Using the "harassment tools" used by Japan, in which individual imported 
automobiles are inspected at dockside, a process that can delay their 
distribution by as much as six months. The United States inspects imported 
vehicles by class, not individually, to make sure they meet U.S. standards. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cracking down on Japanese cellular telephone sales in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 * Scaling back the tax benefits given to Japanese auto makers in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stepping up the use of U.S. laws that prohibit "dumping" on U.S. markets of 
products sold at prices below their production costs to undercut U.S. 
manufacturers. Japanese tape recorders and other electronic gadgets routinely 
cost more in Tokyo than they do in the United States, and the difference is not 
entirely attributed to fluctuations in the exchange rates of the dollar and 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior officials met until 4 a.m. Friday in an attempt to find enough common 
ground to call the meeting a success. 
</P>
<P>
 But the U.S. team called the talks off at that point, having perceived no sign 
of movement on the part of the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw panic on the faces of the Japanese negotiators. They did not believe 
this would happen," one participant said. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the formal White House talks nearly 11 hours later, Clinton and 
Hosokawa demonstrated disappointment, but not anger. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans and Democrats in Congress applauded Clinton's course. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) said he was "disappointed" that the 
talks failed. But he added: "The last thing we need is an ineffective trade 
agreement that fails to address the real problems foreign firms have in 
penetrating the Japanese market." 
</P>
<P>
 House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) accused the Japanese of 
failing to negotiate in good faith. He said they demonstrated that they thought 
they could walk away from the agreement reached last July, "just as they have 
walked away from virtually every other trade agreement they've signed in the 
past." 
</P>
<P>
 Calling for retaliatory measures, Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) said: "The only 
way to pry open Japan's markets after decades of jawboning is to place 
equivalent restrictions on their goods." 
</P>
<P>
 The trade discussions took up a majority of the Clinton-Hosokawa meeting, but 
the two sides announced afterward Japan's decision to contribute $3 billion 
over seven years to international population control programs and efforts to 
fight AIDS. The Japanese will also join a U.S. program on cleaning up 
environmental pollution in central and eastern Europe, contributing more than 
$1 billion in loans and credits.

QUAKE FORCES RENEWED SCHOOL SAFETY PLANNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Los Angeles Unified School District admitted on Friday that it is not 
fully prepared for a large earthquake with students on campus and said that 
officials will revamp disaster plans that left many schools without basic 
emergency provisions Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Supt. Francis Nakano called the earthquake a blessing in disguise 
that will force the huge district to pay more attention to emergency plans. He 
said more money will be sought to stock schools with supplies such as water, 
blankets and bandages that could be needed if many students were injured or 
stranded on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, schools with staff members or parents who made disaster preparation 
a high priority are the most likely to have adequate provisions. Schools where 
it was of less concern tend to lack many of the basics, in part because the 
Board of Education never set side money for earthquake preparations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be better off for it," Nakano said of the Jan. 17 quake. "In the next 
few weeks or months, everyone will be ready (to handle a disaster) and be 
adequately prepared." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the top priorities will be to bolster the district's Office of Emergency 
Services, which for years has been a one-person operation with no budget, 
Nakano said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we are going to have to redirect some funds or reprioritize and we will 
put together an office," he said, adding that the district will still have to 
seek donations for emergency supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake damaged at least 1,500 classrooms at nearly 200 schools, and left 
some of those campuses heavily damaged and without power or communications. All 
schools were closed that day for the Martin Luther King holiday and remained 
closed for the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Although schools were ordered as recently as last year to obtain supplies and 
store enough water and food to supply students for 72 hours after a quake, no 
money was provided by the Board of Education to acquire provisions.  
</P>
<P>
 "We told the schools the district could not afford to buy all that stuff," 
Supt. Sid Thompson said. "Remember, we are talking about a time when there was 
a question on our budget as to whether we were going to be solvent. . . . We 
talked to the state about giving us some money to buy equipment. We didn't get 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the late 1980s, the district has been able to offer formal disaster 
training to only about 200 administrators in a giant system that includes 645 
schools and about 30,000 teachers and principals. Some schools have 
independently obtained training for their staffs. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, the district provided basic first aid kits for every school, which 
even now constitute the bulk of disaster supplies on some campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think all schools have some kind of supplies, but I am not at all impressed 
with the universality of having water, for example," Thompson said. "Does every 
school have sufficient water? I don't think so." 
</P>
<P>
 Left to fend for themselves, most schools have relied on parents, or local 
businesses to obtain supplies. Some PTA chapters were formed solely to raise 
money for earthquake supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools with the most active parents or with staffs motivated to prepare for 
earthquakes have written sophisticated emergency plans and amassed caches of 
supplies, complete with stretchers, wheelchairs and large quantities of food 
and water. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, have the bare minimum, with scant first aid and water 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), author of a state law requiring schools 
to have detailed disaster plans, sharply criticized the Los Angeles district 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would imagine if this had happened during school hours and there had been a 
significant loss of life or injuries, they would have a real hard time avoiding 
the liability simply by saying we did not have enough money to make 
(preparedness) a priority," Katz said. "In my mind, safety should have the 
first call on funds." 
</P>
<P>
 The spottiness of quake preparations was attacked this week by Helen Fallon, 
the chairwoman of a Parent Teacher Student Assn. disaster/earthquake 
preparedness committee, who testified at a hearing of the state Seismic Safety 
Commission in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 "How much longer do we parents have to put our children at risk every day that 
they attend a school that has not bothered to prepare for earthquakes?" said 
Fallon, who charged that first aid kits have been emptied, medicines are out 
date and equipment such as hard hats and crowbars is scarce. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, how much longer do parents in this district have to listen to 
employees argue that preparedness does not need to be a priority at their 
school and that it is not their responsibility or obligation to prepare?" 
</P>
<P>
 State law requires that school disaster plans "maintain the safety and care of 
students and staffs." Safety drills and staff training are also required. 
</P>
<P>
 Although state law does not require schools to be equipped with emergency 
supplies, Los Angeles district policy calls for schools to be able to care for 
at least some of their students for 72 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 To comply with the state law, the district requires every school to complete 
an eight-page, fill-in-the-blank form each year in which principals identify 
teams to handle first aid, search and rescue and fires. 
</P>
<P>
 Another district bulletin lists the emergency supplies that campuses should 
stockpile and offers a list of vendors that sell survival products, including 
tents, radios and body bags. 
</P>
<P>
 The district, however, does not certify the plans or check on supplies, citing 
a shortage of staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "After all the years we had in budget cuts we are squeezed down," Nakano said. 
"We have a skeleton crew for everything." 
</P>
<P>
 A survey will be conducted to determine the status of earthquake supplies and 
disaster plans at all schools, Nakano said. The district expects to complete 
the review in about a month. 
</P>
<P>
 The state law does not carry any punitive measures if schools are not in 
compliance. Katz said Friday that he is considering amending the law to take 
state funds away from school districts that are not adequately prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 Harriet Sculley, the president of the 31st District Parent Teacher Student 
Assn., which covers the San Fernando Valley, said she does not believe the 
organization should be the only provider of earthquake supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does not seem appropriate that parents should be responsible for 
earthquake supplies in a public school system," Sculley said. "If it's needed, 
we'll help out, of course, but we shouldn't be solely responsible." 
</P>
<P>
 Balboa Boulevard Gifted/High Ability Magnet's parent committee stocked the 
school with walkie-talkies, stretchers, a wheelchair, search-and-rescue 
equipment, basic medical supplies, water and blankets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say that every school needs about $5,000 worth of equipment to be fully 
prepared for three days," said Gail Lang, a Balboa parent who is active in the 
preparedness program. "Unless there's a real gung-ho mother demanding 
earthquake preparedness, it's probably not going to be a priority." 
</P>
<P>
 At Langdon Avenue Elementary in North Hills, the school has basic supplies -- 
such as bandages and tape -- but no storage container for tools or enough 
blankets for all students. Jacqueline Howard, the assistant principal, said she 
believes the school could ensure student safety in a quake but not keep 
students on campus for an extended time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really depends on the emphasis put on it by the principal, the staff and 
the teachers," Howard said. "There isn't any district standard. If some schools 
opt not to do it, then there's nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Board of Education President Leticia Quezada said she has found a worrisome 
disparity of quake supplies in her district, which stretches from the Eastside 
to the East Valley. Quezada said she will encourage the school board to fund 
earthquake preparedness during this spring's budget deliberations, when school 
reform and restoration of the 10% pay cut imposed on teachers, among other 
things, will be competing for district dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Quezada said she is concerned that schools in poor communities are not as well 
equipped as those in more affluent neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's uneven and I'd like it to be even," she said. "One way or another we 
have to have these provisions available for all our schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Principal John Chernow of Paul Revere Middle School in Brentwood 
said the school is fortunate in having fund-raising events that have enabled it 
to buy a three-day supply of protein bars and water for every student. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have to make choices between school supplies and quake supplies," 
Chernow said. 
</P>
<P>
 But at Hollywood High, Assistant Principal Dick Rippey said the school is 
somewhat prepared, but not fully equipped. Supplies include flashlights, 
district-provided first aid kits and search equipment held in a cargo 
container. 
</P>
<P>
 The water supply for the 2,400 students, kept in two 55-gallon drums, is 
enough for 110 students for one day. 
</P>
<P>
 Principals and other staff members said that with severely limited funding, it 
is sometimes difficult to make earthquake preparedness a priority. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a low priority, Rippey said. "Naturally, improving test scores and 
improving your instructional curriculum is obviously No. 1 on your list and 
should be. You get down to other things, safety on campus . . . graffiti 
cleanup, campus beautification, where are you going to spend the money you 
have? (Preparedness) does get shoved down to the bottom." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pasadena Unified School District spent about $160,000 on cargo containers 
of about 70 items, ranging from search and rescue equipment to whistles and 
dust masks. Employees are trained in disaster preparedness and the district 
currently is buying portable radios and batteries. 
</P>
<P>
 "My philosophy is the more you prepare, the better you can handle any 
emergency," said Geraldyne Fillhart, Pasadena's administrator for disaster 
preparedness. "You want it to be an automatic response."

LAST CHARGES ARE DROPPED BY NAVY IN TAILHOOK PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Navy wrapped up its Tailhook sex scandal investigation Friday with a 
decision not to revive charges against the last aviators facing misconduct 
trials. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice Adm. J. Paul Reason, who handled Tailhook discipline, said "no further 
judicial action" will be taken, although he said he plans to write letters to 
three officers who had charges against them dismissed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Reason acknowledged that some guilty aviators probably went unpunished. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm almost certain of it," he said at a news conference. "But what would you 
have me do about that? Evidence is a requirement." 
</P>
<P>
 Several investigations implicated 140 officers in the scandal over a 1991 
convention of Navy and Marine Corps aviators. Dozens of women said they were 
assaulted at the Las Vegas gathering of the Tailhook Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 officers received administrative discipline, but none went on trial. 
Adm. Frank B. Kelso Jr., the chief of naval operations, attended the convention 
and received a letter of caution. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference Friday, Kelso again denied a Navy judge's accusation that 
he witnessed some of the lewd conduct and interfered with the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been accused of lying, I've been accused of manipulating the system to 
protect myself and others, and I categorically deny that," a visibly angry 
Kelso said at the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not happy about this," he added. "I am an honest man. I did not lie or 
manipulate any investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 The 60-year-old Kelso said he intends to remain in office as the Navy's top 
admiral until his scheduled retirement at the end of June. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said from the beginning I didn't see anything untoward at Tailhook and I 
stick by that. I did nothing to influence the process," Kelso said in an 
interview. "I'm going to continue to serve in my job." 
</P>
<P>
 Reason said no one tried to influence his handling of any cases. 
</P>
<P>
 A statement issued Friday by Secretary of the Navy John H. Dalton said he 
intends to complete his review of the case next week and then will make a 
decision "as to how to proceed with respect to Adm. Kelso." 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy judge, Capt. William T. Vest Jr., dismissed charges against Cmdrs. 
Thomas R. Miller and Gregory Tritt and Lt. David Samples, saying that Kelso's 
appointment of the person handling Tailhook discipline was inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 Reason could have appealed Vest's ruling to the U.S. Court of Military Appeals 
or sent the cases to Dalton for review on whether to revive the prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller and Tritt were accused of witnessing misconduct by junior officers at 
Tailhook and failing to stop it. Samples had been charged with participating in 
an indecent assault on a woman who was stripped while being passed over the 
heads of men in a gantlet on the third floor of the Las Vegas Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
 All three men said they were innocent. They can now return to duty. 
</P>
<P>
 In another development, Lt. Paula Coughlin, who blew the whistle on the 
scandal, has announced that she is resigning from the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd hoped that she'd be able to stay in the Navy and make it a career," Kelso 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Coughlin said in a letter to Dalton that the assault "and the covert and overt 
attacks on me that followed have stripped me of my ability to serve." 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement released through her attorney, Coughlin said she has no 
specific plans, other than concentrating "on regaining my physical, emotional 
and mental health." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no regrets about the course of action I chose in reporting the 
assault," she said. "This is simply a personal decision forced by my own 
current needs." 
</P>
<P>
 Coughlin is expected to remain at the helicopter combat support unit in 
Norfolk where she is assigned for the couple of months it will take to process 
her resignation.

MIDEAST; TOUGH STAND ON IRAQ SANCTIONS MAY MAKE U.S. ODD MAN OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STANLEY MEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the time comes every two months to review sanctions on Iraq, American 
diplomats scurry about here and abroad to make sure that U.N. ambassadors and 
their foreign ministries support the tough, unyielding stand of the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Americans tell us that it is a matter of national security that they take 
very seriously," an ambassador on the Security Council said. "That is a hard 
argument to oppose." 
</P>
<P>
 So the Security Council dutifully keeps the sanctions on. 
</P>
<P>
 But the argument may be easier to oppose if and when the U.N. Special 
Commission on Iraq rules that the Saddam Hussein regime has complied with the 
U.N. resolutions demanding both the destruction of all weapons of mass 
destruction and perpetual inspections to ensure that these weapons are not 
amassed again. 
</P>
<P>
 Rolf Ekeus of Sweden, who heads the commission, believes Iraq, after several 
years of deceit and ornery resistance, is finally on the right track toward 
compliance. He said recently he hoped to be able to report Iraq's full 
compliance before the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 After extensive talks in Baghdad a week ago, Ekeus and Iraqi Deputy Prime 
Minister Tarik Aziz signed a joint statement that described Iraq as ready "to 
expedite the process of establishing ongoing monitoring and verification in a 
spirit of goodwill."  
</P>
<P>
 A literal reading of the resolutions suggests that the Security Council should 
lift the embargo on Iraqi sales of oil once the Special Commission issues its 
report. But U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright insists Hussein must first 
establish a record of trustworthiness. 
</P>
<P>
 There are signs that France, the nonaligned countries on the Security Council 
such as Nigeria and Djibouti, and some senior U.N. officials are losing 
patience with this position. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here is what is going to happen," said a European ambassador on the Security 
Council. "In six months or so, the Special Commission will issue a report 
saying that the Iraqis have been wonderful boys, have agreed to everything, are 
in full compliance, have told us everything we need to know, and so on. Then 
some countries will say the Iraqis have fulfilled the letter of the law. But 
the United States will insist on keeping sanctions because the Iraqis have not 
shown the proper trustworthy attitude. Then there will be a confrontation." 
</P>
<P>
 The issue began soon after the 1991 Persian Gulf War. The George Bush 
Administration announced that, no matter what the U.N. resolutions said, it 
would never vote to lift sanctions as long as Hussein was still in power. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has never gone that far. But, in practice, with the 
Iraqi leader still around, Baghdad will have difficulty passing the American 
test of trustworthiness. 
</P>
<P>
 A confrontation could present serious problems for the Administration. The 
United States could prevent a majority of the Security Council from lifting 
sanctions by using its veto. But that is something it has not done since the 
end of the Cold War, and the Administration would probably be reluctant to use 
this power. 
</P>
<P>
 The complex issue of Iraqi sanctions involves several resolutions and types of 
sanctions. The Security Council has ordered all countries to refuse to sell 
anything to Baghdad but food and medicine, and it has ordered them to refrain 
from buying oil and all other exports from Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 The Special Commission, headed by Ekeus since it was set up by the Security 
Council in April, 1991, is charged with overseeing the destruction of all 
nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons and all long-range missiles; it also 
must set up the ongoing inspection system. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the key resolution on sanctions, once the Security Council agrees 
that Iraq has complied with the provisions about these weapons, the embargo on 
oil and other exports "shall have no further force or effect." 
</P>
<P>
 But other resolutions require Iraq to recognize Kuwait as a separate country, 
refrain from persecuting the Kurds and other minorities, and compensate those 
injured in the war. Critics maintain that Iraq's record on these is worse than 
its record on weapons destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration insists that the two sets of issues must be viewed as a 
whole -- so long as Hussein is persecuting Kurds, he can't be trusted to 
cooperate with perpetual inspections. But some diplomats and U.N. officials 
believe the American approach offers Iraq no incentive to comply with Security 
Council resolutions, and they are beginning to be troubled by it.

LATIN AMERICA; METALS TRADER'S GAMBLING SPREE HAS CHILE RILED; HIS EFFORT TO 
RECOUP LOSSES COST THE COUNTRY $206 MILLION. SOME CALL IT COPPERGATE.

 Juan Pablo Davila's secret gambling spree in international metals markets cost 
his country $206 million in public funds. The losses have triggered an 
avalanche of national outrage, shaken the political stage and raised doubts 
about the Chilean government's ability to manage Codelco, the biggest copper 
company in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Some call it Coppergate, and the scandal is casting a shadow over the 
administration of President Patricio Aylwin as he prepares to turn the 
government over to his elected successor, Eduardo Frei, in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Davila, who was Codelco's chief trader of copper futures, says a series of 
erroneous entries in his personal computer for transactions last September led 
to $30 million in losses. Instead of reporting his mistake, he tried to recover 
by speculating in copper, gold and silver futures. But he only went deeper and 
deeper into the red, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe I've committed any crime," Davila, 34, told reporters 
recently. "I made a mistake and I am going to assume the responsibility that 
falls on me." 
</P>
<P>
 From September to Jan. 20, Davila made more than 5,000 futures transactions 
with 23 brokers in London and New York. 
</P>
<P>
 According to one account, he gambled on futures worth a total of up to $1.8 
billion, far surpassing his authorized daily limit of $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators are looking for possible criminal conduct. They are trying to 
figure out how Davila obtained multimillion-dollar credit lines with brokers, 
why Codelco's supervisors and internal auditing system did not detect his 
losses and whether anyone profited from his mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyer Fernando Molina, a member of the Codelco board of directors, said it 
was hard to believe that one person could carry out "this enormous operation" 
without anyone else knowing. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would have to be a genius," Molina said. 
</P>
<P>
 Davila, an accountant, had worked for Codelco since 1986. He apparently had 
won the trust of superiors by earning the company $30 million on copper futures 
last year before his troubles began in September. Colleagues sometimes called 
him "J.P.," as in J.P. Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
 President Aylwin has been credited with solid leadership in consolidating 
Chile's democracy since he took office at the end of a 16-year military regime 
headed by Gen. Augusto Pinochet. 
</P>
<P>
 The Codelco scandal, however, has embarrassed his administration with a storm 
of bleak headlines that has not let up since it broke Jan. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservative opposition is threatening congressional action to impeach 
Finance Minister Alejandro Foxley Riesco and Mining Minister Alejandro Hales, 
who are Codelco directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Aylwin's center-left coalition could easily block an impeachment motion, but 
the wrangling could poison the atmosphere for the March 11 inauguration of 
Frei, who belongs to the same coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservatives and business groups are also seizing on the scandal to push for 
the privatization of Codelco, which operates huge mines once owned by the 
U.S.-based Anaconda and Kennecott copper companies. Their interests in Chile 
were nationalized in the early 1970s under the late Socialist President 
Salvador Allende. 
</P>
<P>
 The current governing coalition, which includes Allende's Socialist Party, 
opposes privatization of Codelco. 
</P>
<P>
 Mining and refining more than 1 million tons of copper a year, Codelco 
accounts for about 10% of world copper production and earns about 20% of total 
Chilean export revenue. The $206 million lost by Davila represents 44% of 
Codelco's reported profit of $466 million for 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Codelco's president and seven other executives were forced to resign this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 One of them, Gonzalo Trivelli, is a nephew of Aylwin's wife. Trivelli was vice 
president for marketing and one of Davila's bosses. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivelli and former sales manager Owen Guerrini had previously been partners 
in Chilean firms that represented futures brokers on the London metals market, 
where Davila did most of his futures trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition politicians have called attention to those links, implying that 
they might be related to Davila's bad decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 But Trivelli and Guerrini deny they had any links to metals brokers after 
taking their Codelco positions, or any knowledge of Davila's monumental losses 
until he reported them Jan. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 The lower house of Congress is scheduled to hold a special session Sunday to 
decide whether to form a special investigative commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigations by a specially appointed judge, the national comptroller 
general and the police have already begun.

EX-REP. SWINDALL BEGINS SERVING 1-YEAR SENTENCE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Former U.S. Rep. Pat Swindall started serving a one-year prison term Friday 
for lying to a federal grand jury about his involvement in a money-laundering 
scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 Swindall, 43, reported to the minimum-security federal prison camp in 
Atlanta.He was accused of lying to a federal grand jury in February, 1988, 
about his dealings with convicted money launderer Charles LeChasney and an 
undercover federal agent running a money-laundering sting. 
</P>
<P>
 The Georgia Republican was seeking $850,000 to build a home. He accepted a 
$150,000 check from LeChasney in September, 1987, but returned it uncashed. 
</P>
<P>
 Swindall was convicted of nine counts of perjury in June, 1989, but remained 
free on bond for nearly five years while appealing. His convictions on three 
counts were overturned, but the U.S. Supreme Court in January refused to 
overturn the other six. 
</P>
<P>
 Swindall asked an appeals court to let him stay out of prison while pursuing a 
new appeal, but the court refused.

QUEBEC SEPARATIST TO VISIT WASHINGTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Quebec separatist leader Lucien Bouchard is scheduled to visit Washington on 
March 2 to meet legislators and discuss the implications for the United States 
of an independent Quebec, his spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be Bouchard's first visit to Washington since his Bloc Quebecois party 
swept up most seats in Quebec in November's election and became Canada's main 
opposition party. 
</P>
<P>
 Bouchard, a lawyer and former Canadian ambassador to France, says he expects 
separatists to gain a mandate in a referendum in 1995 to negotiate independence 
from Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
 Quebec is a major supplier of hydroelectric power to the East Coast. The Bloc 
Quebecois is anxious to ensure that an autonomous Quebec remains within the 
North American Free Trade Agreement.

SEOUL WOULD SUPPORT N. KOREA SANCTIONS; ASIA: FOREIGN MINISTER SAYS SOUTH KOREA 
WOULD BACK U.N. ACTION TO FORCE NUCLEAR INSPECTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After meeting with top U.S. officials, the South Korean foreign minister said 
Friday that his country will support tough international sanctions against 
North Korea if the U.N. Security Council decides to take such measures. 
</P>
<P>
 The Security Council is expected to rule soon -- after a meeting Feb. 20 of 
the board of governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency -- on whether 
to impose sanctions against North Korea for barring international inspections 
of its nuclear installations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vienna-based agency is likely to declare that it cannot guarantee North 
Korea is not diverting nuclear fuel for weapons purposes and thus is in 
violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 The CIA has said it believes that North Korea already has developed the 
technology to assemble a nuclear bomb and may have built one or two. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, the South Korean government has been cautious about appearing 
hostile toward its northern neighbor and has avoided openly condoning sanctions 
against North Korea for failing to comply with the international agency's 
requests. The dispute is over inspections of seven nuclear installations, which 
North Korea says are being used for peaceful purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Friday, in answer to a question about how the Seoul government would 
respond if the Security Council chose to take punitive measures, Foreign 
Minister Han Sung Joo said, "We will support and respect the decision and 
measures the United Nations will take." 
</P>
<P>
 He suggested, however, that some milder measures might be possible initially. 
</P>
<P>
 "The choice may not be between doing nothing and imposing very harsh sanctions 
from the beginning," Han said. 
</P>
<P>
 His remarks seemed to hint that South Korea might support proposals for the 
imposition of gradual sanctions against North Korea that would be less formal 
and less severe than U.N. sanctions. These gradual sanctions could include a 
reduction of oil supplies to North Korea and steps by Japan to hamper the 
ability of North Koreans to send home money that they earn in Tokyo and other 
Japanese cities. 
</P>
<P>
 In an apparent effort to calm the concerns in his country and in North Korea 
over recent publications about the Pentagon's readiness to do battle with the 
Asian nation, Han said that "the war scares are not warranted by the existing 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has been increasing the diplomatic pressure on North Korea 
in an effort to force it to comply with the inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, the Clinton Administration gave preliminary approval to a 
plan to send Patriot antimissile batteries to South Korea to strengthen U.S. 
forces there and help discourage any possible attacks by North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Han said that consultations between the United States and South Korea on the 
Patriots are ongoing and declined to comment on whether his government would 
support their deployment. 
</P>
<P>
 The crisis over the North Korean nuclear program began a year ago, when the 
IAEA told Pyongyang that it wanted to inspect two waste sites where it believes 
North Korea has hidden waste materials produced when it secretly reprocessed 
plutonium for weapons purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea responded by announcing its intention to withdraw from the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty.

MUSLIMS THRONG MOSQUES, SHOPS AS RAMADAN BEGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Muslims throughout the Middle East thronged mosques and shops Friday on the 
first day of Ramadan, Islam's holy month of fasting from sunrise to sunset. 
</P>
<P>
 Muslims shun food, drink and sex during the fast, which begins when the 
crescent of the new moon is sighted. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Muslims are expected to temper their eating at night as well, food 
consumption after dark reportedly triples in some parts of the region. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is feasting and not fasting, O Muslims," complained Sheik Ibrahim Awad, 
prayer leader of the Manama al Fateh, or Conqueror, mosque in Bahrain. "You 
have to endure the fast and, when you break the fast, think of your hungry 
neighbors. Do not gorge." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramadan, one of the Five Pillars of Islam, is named after the 28-day month in 
the lunar Muslim calendar. Its start this year coincided with the Friday 
Sabbath. 
</P>
<P>
 Tens of thousands of Jordanians crowded mosques, and shoppers jammed downtown 
Amman to prepare for the special meal, called Iftar, that ends each day's fast. 
</P>
<P>
 In Lebanon the long-silent powder cannon traditionally used to signal dawn and 
dusk boomed out for the first time since the 1975 outbreak of the 15-year 
Lebanese civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 The state-run Saudi Press Agency, monitored in Bahrain, distributed sermons by 
preachers at the Grand mosque in Mecca and the Prophet Mohammed mosque in 
Medina, which urged the faithful to piety and charity during Ramadan. 
</P>
<P>
 Revelry prevailed elsewhere in the Persian Gulf, with merchants selling Arab 
delicacies and minarets ringing with prayers. Veiled women shopped for nuts, 
sugar, rose water and other items, and sidewalks were festooned with colored 
lanterns and neon lights. 
</P>
<P>
 In Jerusalem, tens of thousands of worshipers crowded the Al Aqsa mosque, the 
third-holiest shrine in Islam after Mecca and Medina. Militants spoke out 
against the Israel-PLO agreement on Palestinian autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
 "This state of Israel will be crushed and Islam will win the holy fight 
against the Great Satan in Washington and its ally in Tel Aviv," shouted an 
Islamic Jihad activist, calling on worshipers to wage holy war against the 
Jewish state.

AVIATION CENTER'S UNPAID BILLS LEFT RUSSIA CHIEF UP IN THE AIR 
</P>

<P>
 Angry over unpaid bills, a state-owned electric company cut off power to a 
Russian aviation control center while dozens of planes were in the air -- 
including President Boris N. Yeltsin's, Izvestia reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The daily newspaper said Yeltsin was unaware of the danger when the Strela 
Control Center, one of the country's main civil aviation tracking facilities, 
was forced to shut down Dec. 7.It was not immediately known how long the system 
was down. 
</P>
<P>
 No planes crashed, and Yeltsin's Il-86 presidential jet completed its flight 
to Moscow from the Caucasus Mountains of southern Russia. But the incident 
highlights the impact of economic disarray on public safety in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 The control center, in the city of Rostov-on-Don, was given only one hour's 
warning before its electricity was cut off, Izvestia said in its front-page 
article. It was the first public disclosure of the incident two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Izvestia said Russian air traffic controllers recently caused a near-collision 
of two British and Japanese Boeing 747s carrying a total of about 800 
passengers through the busy Khabarovsk air corridor in the Russian Far East.

U.N. CHIEF DELEGATES AIR STRIKE AUTHORITY; BOSNIA: SECRETARY GENERAL'S 
REPRESENTATIVE ON THE SCENE HAS AUTHORITY TO CALL UP WARPLANES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a move that appeared to intensify the threat against the Serbs in the hills 
around Sarajevo, U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali on Friday 
delegated his authority to order NATO air strikes in Bosnia-Herzegovina to the 
ranking U.N. official on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The delegation of authority to Yasushi Akashi of Japan, the secretary 
general's special representative in the former Yugoslav federation, was clearly 
designed to speed up the process for reaching any decision to send U.S. and 
European planes against Bosnian Serb artillery batteries. 
</P>
<P>
 In his announcement, made in a letter to the Security Council, Boutros-Ghali 
also said he had instructed Akashi to meet with U.N. and NATO military 
commanders "to finalize . . . detailed procedures for the initiation and 
conduct of air strikes." 
</P>
<P>
 This made clear that a decision by Akashi to order the strikes would be 
heavily influenced by Adm. Jeremy M. Boorda of the United States, the commander 
of North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces in southern Europe, and by Gen. 
Jean Cot of France, the commander of the U.N. peacekeeping forces in the former 
Yugoslav federation. 
</P>
<P>
 Cot has complained often that it would take too long for the use of NATO air 
power to be approved if the decision had to come from New York. 
</P>
<P>
 This complaint prompted Britain and France to persuade Boutros-Ghali a few 
weeks ago to delegate authority to Akashi for the calling of close air support 
to protect U.N. peacekeepers if attacked at the Bosnian towns of Srebrenica and 
Tuzla. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said they did not anticipate that Akashi would act any 
differently than Boutros-Ghali if the need came to call for air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are fully confident that if the Serbs start shelling Sarajevo from the 
hills around the city, the secretary general or his representative will order 
air strikes," a U.S. official said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a special meeting Wednesday, the NATO council gave the Serbs 10 days to 
either withdraw their heavy weapons from the hills around Sarajevo or put them 
under U.N. control. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO warned that it would, at the request of the secretary general, send 
planes against any artillery or mortar positions firing on Sarajevo even before 
the deadline expired and against any such position still in place after the 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter to the Security Council, Boutros-Ghali, still hopeful for a 
peaceful settlement, also said he had instructed Akashi and the U.N. military 
commanders to try to negotiate an agreement for a cease-fire in Sarajevo, a 
withdrawal of Bosnian Serb weapons from the area or their transfer to U.N. 
control, and a transfer of Bosnian Muslim weapons to U.N. control. 
</P>
<P>
 Such an agreement had already been worked out by Lt. Gen. Michael Rose of 
Britain, the commander of U.N. forces in Sarajevo, but it is still uncertain 
whether it will hold. 
</P>
<P>
 The 63-year-old Akashi, a veteran Japanese diplomat and U.N. bureaucrat, 
headed the U.N. peacekeeping operation in Cambodia that led to successful 
elections last year. He took over the operation in the former Yugoslav 
federation Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 He is one of the few longtime U.N. officials who have won the trust of 
Boutros-Ghali.

STAKES ARE HIGH FOR CLINTON ON JAPAN STRATEGY; TRADE: ANGER OVER TOKYO'S 
SURPLUSES FUELS PRESIDENT'S RISKY DECISION TO REJECT ACCORD. BUT HE IS 
VULNERABLE TO ATTACK IN ISSUES OF FOREIGN POLICY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In refusing to sign what he said would be a cosmetic agreement with Japanese 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, President Clinton has embarked on a 
potentially lucrative but nonetheless risky political course. 
</P>
<P>
 At first blush, a strategy of confronting Japan directly over trade issues -- 
something Clinton advisers believe is good economic policy -- might also seem 
to be almost risk-free politically because of widespread anger, particularly in 
key Democratic constituencies, over Japanese trade surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, White House officials seemed at times this week almost eager for a 
confrontation and worried that the Japanese might offer just enough to force 
Clinton to accept an agreement that would be difficult to sell at home. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the President, almost no foreign policy issue comes risk-free -- a 
reality of which his advisers have become acutely aware over the last year. 
Because a large segment of the public remains uncertain about Clinton's ability 
to handle foreign policy, he is almost always vulnerable to attack on the 
subject, his aides fear. 
</P>
<P>
 Initial congressional responses to Clinton's move were positive, including a 
statement by Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.). Nonetheless, White House 
advisers worried that over the next few weeks Clinton will be attacked by at 
least some Republicans for letting trade disputes jeopardize the U.S.-Japanese 
security relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 That criticism could bite particularly hard if the war of nerves over North 
Korea's nuclear program continues to escalate. Already, several former George 
Bush Administration officials have taken Clinton to task for stressing 
economics too heavily at the expense of security concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Clinton will face strong pressure in Congress to prove that 
he is willing to back up his tough talk about forcing open Japanese markets now 
that trade diplomacy has failed. Within hours of the end of Clinton's news 
conference with Hosokawa, leading Democratic trade hawks, such as Sen. Carl 
Levin of Michigan, were urging the White House to impose strong new trade 
sanctions against the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way to pry open Japan's markets after decades of jawboning is to 
place equivalent restrictions on their goods," Levin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The need to thread a path between those two potential criticisms shaped 
Clinton's words Friday. The President "had to speak to several audiences 
today," a senior aide said, noting that Clinton wanted to strike a tough note 
while still not embarrassing Hosokawa, whom Administration officials continue 
to view as a genuine reformer. "We didn't want to shove a stick in his eye," 
the aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the aide said, Clinton wants to "cogitate a little bit" over what 
steps to take next before precipitously plunging into a potentially costly 
trade war with the Japanese. Nonetheless, over the next couple of weeks, 
Clinton will have to back up his words or face the political charge of being 
"empty," the official conceded. 
</P>
<P>
 As a practical matter, Clinton probably has about 10 days before he has to act 
because Congress left town Friday for a weeklong recess. White House aides 
signaled Friday that they expect to have a package of sanctions ready for 
Clinton to announce when Congress returns. 
</P>
<P>
 If Clinton sticks to that timetable, White House strategists said they believe 
that he could reap substantial benefits. As Clinton said at his news conference 
-- in response to a Japanese reporter who asked about the unpopularity in Japan 
of American insistence on numerical measurements of progress in trade -- 
"America's trade deficit with Japan is not very popular among the American 
people or the American government." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, polls taken during the last election indicated that the failure of 
Republican administrations to end the trade deficit with Japan was one of the 
strongest grievances that prompted many so-called Reagan Democrats to abandon 
the GOP in 1992.

SENATE PASSES FEDERAL $25,000 BUYOUT BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Senate passed legislation Friday offering $25,000 incentives for federal 
employees to quit. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislation aimed at accelerating a quarter-million-employee cut in the 
federal work force passed the Senate by voice vote.It is slightly different 
from the version passed Thursday by the House, and unless the House accepts the 
changes the differences will have to be worked out in conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, any federal worker who has worked continuously for 12 months 
can receive severance pay or $25,000, whichever is less. The Federal Workforce 
Restructuring Act also allows agencies to retrain workers for different jobs 
within the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 To prevent workers from taking the money and then returning to the federal 
payroll, the lawmakers passed an amendment saying that any person rehired 
within five years of accepting a buyout would have to return the funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the buyouts will cost the 
government $2.1 billion this fiscal year. But the Senate measure estimates 
savings over five years of more than $22 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Senate version, the savings would go into a trust fund to be used to 
finance anti-crime legislation passed last year by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration, under a plan outlined by Vice President Al Gore, 
hopes to cut 252,000 federal jobs -- reducing the work force to 1.88 million -- 
by the end of fiscal 1999.

'ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE' FOR U.S. MINORITIES IS ORDERED; POLLUTION: CLINTON 
TELLS ALL AGENCIES TO EASE THE BURDEN ON DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. IMPACT OF 
HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS IN AREAS TO BE DOCUMENTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton on Friday ordered all federal agencies to take steps to 
lighten what officials called a disproportionate burden on minority communities 
of pollutants and other environmental hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton signed an executive order requiring federal agencies to "make 
environmental justice a part of all they do." Under the order, fair treatment 
of minority communities would become a factor in decisions ranging from the 
regulation of pesticides to the prosecution of polluters. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative also sets in motion an unprecedented data-gathering effort 
across the federal government to document the impact of pollution on 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every community must be included in making decisions about their health and 
environment," said Vice President Al Gore, who has pressed for the initiative. 
Under the President's directive, he added, "we will ensure that disadvantaged 
populations have an opportunity to participate fully in making health and 
environmental decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative, which stems from an earlier promise by the President, has been 
hailed by groups struggling to counter what they view as a pattern of 
environmental racism that has befouled minority communities and left them 
vulnerable to the arrival of new sources of industrial pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 But a group of environmental activists meeting in Washington on Friday called 
on the Administration to do more to rid their communities of pollution. 
Specifically, they called for a ban on chemicals such as lead and benzene. All 
have been linked to a variety of illnesses ranging from cancer to nervous 
disorders to birth defects. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration is the first to address the issue at such a high 
level after years of appeals from minority organizations. Benjamin F. Chavis 
Jr., director of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, has 
made environmental justice a priority for his organization. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1987 study by Chavis, titled "Toxic Wastes and Race," established for the 
first time that communities with large minority populations -- even relatively 
prosperous ones -- were far more likely to have hazardous waste facilities and 
other pollution-producing industries in their midst than were other 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 A more recent study published by the National Law Journal in 1992 concluded 
that polluters based in minority areas were treated less severely than those in 
largely white communities. It also found that toxic cleanup programs under the 
federal Superfund law took longer and were less complete in minority 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the initiative, the EPA is expected to gather new data and issue new 
regulations designed to stem the concentration of heavy industry in areas 
largely populated by minorities. Last week, the Administration proposed a 
series of reforms to the Superfund program that would give minority communities 
a greater voice in cleaning-up Superfund sites in their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA Administrator Carol Browner added that the EPA also will reconsider many 
of the standards by which exposure to potentially harmful chemicals would be 
considered safe. Current standards for EPA's fish advisories, for instance, 
assume the consumption habits of a middle-class white male. Browner said that 
new standards would be explored to consider the exposure of minority groups 
that rely on fishing to subsist and as a result eat large amounts of fish, 
which can accumulate harmful toxins. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Friday, Atty. Gen. Janet Reno said that the Justice Department will 
supplement the EPA's regulatory efforts to ensure that minority communities 
receive equal protection from polluters. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we want to do is to make sure we look at the people most at risk and to 
make sure that our environmental laws and our civil rights laws are used as 
vigorously as possible to correct injustice," said Reno. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, the Administration quietly handed minority communities a 
potentially powerful new tool to fight the introduction of hazardous materials 
sites in their neighborhoods. The Administration agreed to investigate two 
separate civil rights complaints from minority communities in Louisiana and 
Mississippi, which charged that the proposed siting of new plants in their 
midst was racially biased.  
</P>
<P>
 The decision marks the first time that the federal government has encouraged 
the use of the 1964 Civil Rights Act in community environmental battles, 
although the nation's courts traditionally have been wary of such efforts. 
Clinton Administration officials said that the move is a measure of their 
commitment to rectify environmental injustices.

FOSTER SAW SELF AS A FAILURE, WIDOW IS QUOTED AS SAYING 
</P>

<P>
 Vincent Foster's widow told investigators that before her husband committed 
suicide he felt "he had personally failed" and talked about quitting as deputy 
White House counsel, it was reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Foster, in an interview with Park Police nine days after Foster's death, 
said her husband "took it all personally" and she recalled his saying, "How did 
I get myself into this?" the New York Daily News reported, quoting what it said 
were secret police files. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of his death, friends said Foster had been upset by critical 
editorials in the Wall Street Journal and felt that he was at fault for some 
failed nominations by President Clinton. The Park Service ruled his July 20 
death a suicide, and a Virginia medical examiner said it was consistent with a 
self-inflicted gunshot wound. 
</P>
<P>
 "He felt he had personally failed and talked to Lisa about quitting, however 
(he) would not return to Arkansas (because of the personal humiliation he 
felt)," the police notes record Mrs. Foster as saying, the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lisa Foster felt that something physical came over (him) very quickly," the 
newspaper quoted from the police report. She said he was unable to sleep, "was 
not feeling well and was experiencing high blood pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 Foster, 48, was a boyhood friend of Bill Clinton's and was a partner in the 
Rose Law Firm with Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper said the police files did not mention the controversy over the 
Clintons' investment in a failed Arkansas real estate development company. The 
files are being reviewed by special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. as part of his 
investigation into the Whitewater Development Corp. The autopsy report will not 
be released until Fiske has examined the police and medical files, authorities 
say.

SENATOR ACQUITTED OF MISUSING OLD OFFICE; LAW: HUTCHISON WAS CHARGED WITH 
TELLING STATE WORKERS TO USE STATE EQUIPMENT TO AID HER CAMPAIGN. JUDGE 
DIRECTED THE NOT-GUILTY VERDICT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With her trial just minutes under way, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Tex.) was 
found not guilty Friday of criminal charges that she had misused her former 
state office for personal benefit -- and then had tried to destroy the 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "They thought the lady would crack," Hutchison said later at a jubilant press 
conference. "Well, the lady wouldn't crack. The lady stood up and fought. The 
lady showed she could take the worst that a corruption of the political system 
could give." 
</P>
<P>
 The 50-year-old lawmaker has long maintained that the charges against her were 
politically motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only crime I committed," she said, "was doing a great job as state 
treasurer and winning an election by a landslide." 
</P>
<P>
 The trial came to an abrupt end Friday after Travis County Dist. Atty. Ronnie 
Earle told the court that he could not proceed without knowing whether key 
records seized from Hutchison's state treasury office in Austin last June would 
be allowed into evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 District Judge John F. Onion Jr. then ordered the just-seated jury to return a 
verdict of not guilty on charges that Hutchison had directed state workers to 
use state equipment and phones to further her 1993 Senate campaign. If 
convicted on all counts, she could have been sentenced to as much as 20 years 
in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Hutchison won 67% of the vote in the special election June 5 for the Senate 
seat once held by Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appeared to us that to proceed to trial in this matter, without all of the 
evidence, with the apparent indications from the judge that he was going to not 
allow the introduction of that evidence, would not have been in the public's 
interest," Earle said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hutchison's attorney, Dick DeGuerin, said: "The plain fact is that there 
was no evidence of any nature that Kay did anything wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 In bringing the indictment against Hutchison, Earle, a Democrat, had said he 
hoped to clearly define the code of conduct for state officeholders. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hutchison has said all of Earle's actions were politically motivated. "The 
case was not there and the district attorney knew that," she said. "I'm not 
sure the district attorney intended to win. He intended to keep me from winning 
the election" this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Five days after Hutchison's Senate victory, state investigators seized 
computer records and other evidence in a raid of her treasury office. 
</P>
<P>
 Her lawyers maintained that the records were illegally obtained and that a 
search warrant should have been executed. But Earle contended that he did not 
need a search warrant because the documents were public records. 
</P>
<P>
 In pretrial proceedings earlier this week -- while prospective jurors were 
being questioned -- Earle had asked Onion to rule on the admissibility of the 
records. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge declined to rule until a jury was impaneled, ensuring that Hutchison 
could not be indicted again if the charges were dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 Hutchison said Friday that her office has requested that all records seized 
during the raid be released to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "The case was not there," she said. "They turned around and ran because they 
knew the longer they went, the more embarrassing it was going to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Earle, appearing grim-faced on the steps of the Tarrant County Justice Center 
after the aborted trial, said he was "shocked by the speed with which the judge 
proceeded in the case, and in general we feel that justice has been denied. The 
prosecutor accused Onion of running a "rocket docket." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Tigar, a University of Texas law professor and one of Hutchison's 
attorneys, called Earle's reaction "unprofessional. I hope he will stop it 
right now and take it like a man." 
</P>
<P>
 The case had been troubled from the start. An earlier indictment was thrown 
out when it was discovered that an ineligible member was serving on the grand 
jury. The case was moved to Ft. Worth after a defense motion citing an 
atmosphere in Austin too politically charged to guarantee a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Onion, former presiding judge of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals -- the 
state's highest court for criminal matters -- was appointed to the case after 
the original judge recused himself because he had contributed to the Senate 
campaign of Hutchison's opponent, Robert Krueger. 
</P>
<P>
 Hutchison faces a tough general election campaign this fall against one of 
three prominent Democrats, including former Texas Atty. Gen. Jim Mattox and 
Rep. Michael A. Andrews (D-Tex.).

TEEN-AGER GETS LIFE IN ARIZONA TEMPLE MURDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A teen-ager was sentenced Friday to spend the rest of his life in prison for 
the 1991 murders of six monks and three other people at a Buddhist temple. 
</P>
<P>
 A judge spared Johnathan Doody the death penalty, saying he could not 
determine without a doubt if Doody actually pulled the trigger in the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
 Doody, 19, was convicted last July 12 of murder, armed robbery and other 
charges. He was sentenced to nine life terms, and must serve at least 25 years 
on each one. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Gregory Martin ordered the life terms to be served 
consecutively with sentences for the other charges for a total sentence of at 
least 281 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The slayings at the Wat Promkunaram temple west of Phoenix in August, 1991, 
stunned the area's large Buddhist community. 
</P>
<P>
 According to testimony, Doody and Alessandro Garcia, 18, ransacked the monks' 
quarters and took cameras, electronic equipment and $2,790 in cash. Prosecutors 
said Doody ordered the monks, an elderly nun and two male followers onto the 
floor and shot them in the head because he feared they might identify him. 
</P>
<P>
 Doody's brother had studied at the temple. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in exchange for avoiding the 
death penalty. Martin will sentence Garcia at a later date. 
</P>
<P>
 According to trial testimony, Doody and Garcia planned to rob the temple as 
early as June, 1991. They allegedly visited the temple to learn the layout and 
made extensive preparations for their assault. 
</P>
<P>
 They bought military camouflage clothing, gloves and combat boots. They also 
borrowed a .22-caliber rifle and a 20-gauge shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
 Doody ignored reporters' questions as he was led away Friday. His lawyer, 
Peter Balkan, said an appeal was planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Three robed monks attended the sentencing and left without comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're all relieved," said Barbara Heller, a temple member and spokeswoman. 
"They just wanted it to be over."

NEWS ANALYSIS; MEDIA FOCUS ON INSIDERS MISSES BIG PICTURE; POLITICS: BLAMING 
CLINTON'S UPS AND DOWNS ON GERGEN AND OTHER IMAGE-MAKERS IGNORES THE EFFECT OF 
THE PRESIDENT'S POLICIES ON THE PUBLIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 By mid-January, old Washington hands could sense a little blood. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House was mishandling questions about President Clinton's part in 
the Whitewater land deal, the press said. He also was said to be losing steam 
on health care. The magic aura of momentum was ebbing again. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon some senior aides had unsheathed their long knives; many pointed at the 
President's communications guru. "Clinton aides observe with some irritation 
that David Gergen was slow to defend his boss last month as the Whitewater 
story" and others gathered force, Time magazine said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in late January, the President's approval rating with the public rose to 
its highest point ever. Had the White House communications team shrewdly and 
suddenly turned matters around? Had the President's handlers managed to stage 
the right photo opportunities and craft the right sound bites just in time? 
</P>
<P>
 Not quite. The sometimes fine, sometimes fumbling course of White House 
communications more likely reveals another truth about politics: Handlers, spin 
doctors and message meisters usually make only a marginal difference. The 
perceived strengths and weaknesses of Clinton's White House have almost 
everything to do with Clinton, his policies and the economy and much less to do 
with the subtle strengths and weaknesses of Gergen and other White House 
image-makers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The same thing happened with (Ronald) Reagan and (George) Bush," said media 
and political analyst Michael Robinson. Particularly once a President has 
established a relationship with the public, Robinson said, "the variables of 
war and economics matter. 'Insiderism' doesn't, and the idea that (Clinton) is 
losing momentum because of health care or Whitewater is the kind of politically 
immature thing you should expect from the Washington press corps." 
</P>
<P>
 Implicit in much of the coverage of what goes on behind the scenes at the 
White House is the cynical perspective that what politicians actually do is not 
very important and what matters more is the image they project, their use of 
the media, the skills of their communications team. 
</P>
<P>
 It is government as a game of virtual reality, with the public seen as a 
passive group more sensitive to how the President looks on television than how 
government policies affect their lives. And Gergen, the New York Times Magazine 
declared in a cover story in late October, is the "perfect flower" and "high 
priest" of "the sacred faith" in image. 
</P>
<P>
 This fascination with political insiders is not new -- "The Selling of the 
President, 1968" became a bestseller a quarter of a century ago -- but the idea 
has reached a new apogee. 
</P>
<P>
 In Clinton's first 100 days, for instance, much of the press criticism of the 
new President concerned whether he was managing the press well enough. And the 
month after Gergen joined the White House, the communications veteran of three 
Republican administrations was the focus of scores of stories in the country's 
major papers, wire services and weekly news magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 Do the image-makers really matter this much? Consider the press' three major 
mood swings toward Clinton, spring, fall and winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Through June, the Center for Media and Public Affairs reported, only a third 
of the evaluations of Clinton on the three TV networks' nightly news shows were 
positive, compared with 55% positive for George Bush's first year. Public 
approval of Clinton fell in most polls from nearly 60% in March to 37% in June. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when Gergen was hired and evidence suggests that communications 
strategy became important. Reporters soon found the White House more responsive 
to their questions and that helped the Administration get its story out. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next month, coverage grew more favorable -- network coverage became 40% 
positive in July -- and by August the President's approval rating began rising. 
</P>
<P>
 Gergen was also part of the reason. "Gergen had credibility with the older, 
senior journalists in town, and there was no one else in this White House who 
did," said a senior Administration official who generally does not like Gergen. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton also had a series of policy successes during this period. He made 
a well-received choice for the Supreme Court, handled himself competently on a 
trip to Tokyo and secured passage of his budget by Congress. In September he 
delivered a half-improvised, widely acclaimed speech on health care to 
Congress, and afterward his approval rating rose above 50% for the first time 
in months. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in late fall and winter, came another turn in fortune. The media 
perceived that the White House was losing momentum on health care. Network 
coverage in October slipped again to just 30% positive. By November, the 
President's approval rating began to slip again. 
</P>
<P>
 Was this a communications problem, a failure to set out a carefully planned 
media assault to sell the program? 
</P>
<P>
 In part, yes. Clinton delivered his well-received speech too soon, weeks 
before the Administration was able to send a health care bill to Congress, 
three months before Harold Ickes, hired to head up the issue on the White House 
staff, was able to begin work. 
</P>
<P>
 But more than that, losing momentum was inevitable as Americans began to 
debate the President's proposal and find elements they did not like. 
</P>
<P>
 "Health care was a struggle for definition," said Democratic strategist Robert 
Shrum. "The debate went from what the middle class gets to what the middle 
class loses. It has to play itself out." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in December and January came allegations concerning Clinton's role in 
the controversial Whitewater resort development deal. The press began asking 
why the White House hesitated in agreeing to hand over all of the First 
Family's Whitewater documents, then in accepting the appointment of a special 
counsel to investigate the affair. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, there were various theories -- that the First Family has something to 
hide, that the President was distracted by the death of his mother, that First 
Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and several senior officials resisted full 
disclosure because no allegations of actual wrongdoing had been leveled at the 
President. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House response to press inquiries -- that the questions were in bad 
taste, were partisan or even represented, as Gergen put it, a kind of political 
"cannibalism" -- struck many in Washington as evasive nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
 "There ain't going to be no health care campaign if they don't get Whitewater 
out of the way," said former Clinton gubernatorial chief of staff and 
occasional damage-control adviser Betsey Wright. "Right now it is very 
difficult for the White House to be heard on policy." 
</P>
<P>
 How then, to account for the new opinion polls that came out within the next 
few days? Through December and mid-January, the President's approval rating 
surged as high as 60%. 
</P>
<P>
 A close look suggests that Clinton's rise now, as his dips earlier, have to do 
with what the public cares about. 
</P>
<P>
 Gergen, for one, argued that communications strategy is most important for a 
President or candidate in the beginning, "when an individual is just being 
introduced to the American public and they do not have the basis of making any 
judgments yet." 
</P>
<P>
 The early press coverage of Clinton's White House -- his problems with 
appointments, his $200 haircut, the bungling of the way a scandal at the White 
House travel office was handled, his compromises over the budget -- hurt 
because the public still did not know if Clinton was up to the job. Gays in the 
military, the first divisive policy issue to arise after Clinton's 
inauguration, hurt because the public had no other sense of his real 
priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the press coverage, Clinton's stock is rising now, Gergen argued, 
because people have developed a clearer sense of his capacity for the job and 
of where he wants to take the country. That in turn has enabled Clinton to gain 
credit for the economy's recent strong performance, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are saying: 'At least he's trying to line up the country's problems 
and do something about them. I may not agree on a lot of what he is trying to 
do, but he is not in denial about the country's problems,' " Gergen said. 
</P>
<P>
 History bears Gergen out. In the mid-1980s, for instance, Robinson and the 
Media Analysis Project at George Washington University found that network 
coverage of Ronald Reagan was overwhelmingly negative. During the first 100 
days of 1983, when the economy was emerging from recession, network television 
coverage was negative by a ratio of 22 to 1. Yet Reagan's popularity during 
that period continued to rise. 
</P>
<P>
 The public, in short, took its cue from the GDP rather than from CBS or ABC. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once the economy picked up and people knew Reagan, it didn't make a 
difference if he fell asleep, if he goofed a line, or if he told stories that 
drove people nuts or even took positions they didn't agree with," Gergen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Media strategist Mandy Grunwald, a key outside adviser to the President, said 
she believes that the concerns of the press and the public are often 
fundamentally different and coincide only occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think most Americans want to know now whether Clinton is taking action in 
the right direction: Is he working on the people's business and getting 
somewhere?" she said. The press, by contrast, focuses on how this White House 
compares with its recent predecessors, particularly in its internal workings. 
</P>
<P>
 Even many Republican media experts said they think that Clinton's swings in 
momentum have mostly to do with policy, not style. "Their problem on health 
care is that they made the issue one of providing care for everyone rather than 
of reducing cost," said a senior official in the Reagan and Bush 
administrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Robinson said he is skeptical that the public cares much about the 
ideological theories behind policies, some analysts say they believe that 
Clinton's stock is rising now because he is emphasizing issues -- such as crime 
and welfare reform -- on which his posture is less liberal than the Democratic 
mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 And some analysts say they believe that managing the imagery in the media has 
become much more difficult now than it was during Reagan's presidency in the 
early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 With the proliferation of cable television outlets and radio talk shows, the 
interpretations of the networks or the New York Times matter less. No longer 
can the President manage the media by massaging the three networks and a few 
newspapers. In Clinton's White House, unlike Reagan's, Gergen said, work does 
not stop when the network news shows begin. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the keys to the Republican communications strategy, for instance, was 
sending out surrogates -- party members from around the country -- to flood 
radio and TV stations with the White House message. 
</P>
<P>
 That may no longer work, said Robert M. Teeter, the veteran Republican 
pollster and Bush's campaign chairman in 1992. In the age of talk shows and 
cable, he said, "the candidates are going to have to carry the message for 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Especially in this environment, people have to sense their lives are 
improving. "You can sell snake oil," Gergen said, "only for so long."

SHUTTLE FINISHES FIRST MISSION WITH COSMONAUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The space shuttle Discovery and its crew swooped through high clouds and 
landed safely Friday, ending the first U.S. spaceflight with a Russian 
cosmonaut aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "You paved the way for a new era of cooperation in human spaceflight," Mission 
Control told the five astronauts and one cosmonaut. 
</P>
<P>
 Sergei Krikalev became the first Russian to fly on a U.S. shuttle when 
Discovery left on the science mission Feb. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 The crew's homecoming Friday was delayed 1 1/2 hours, or one orbit, because of 
thick, low clouds and high winds at the space center. 
</P>
<P>
 National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials considered sending the 
shuttle to Edwards Air Force Base in California, but the sky cleared enough in 
Florida to allow the midafternoon landing. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the unprecedented partnership, the Discovery crew failed to accomplish 
one of the primary objectives of the mission -- releasing a research satellite. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wake Shield Facility, a steel disc, was supposed to fly free of Discovery 
for two days and develop high-grade semiconductor film in its pure-vacuum wake. 
</P>
<P>
 It was hoped that the film eventually could lead to faster computers. 
</P>
<P>
 But transmission troubles and a bad guidance system prevented crew members 
from deploying the satellite. Instead, it developed the film while dangling on 
the end of Discovery's robot arm. 
</P>
<P>
 In other experiments, a small German science satellite was successfully 
released Wednesday, as were six metal balls ejected from a cargo bay canister 
so space debris experts could track them from Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Discovery also carried a small commercial laboratory called Spacehab. Most of 
the 12 Spacehab experiments involved biotechnology: splitting cells, for 
instance, and growing protein crystals. 
</P>
<P>
 Within minutes of the shuttle's touchdown, officials at the Russian control 
center for the Mir space station were on the phone to Mission Control, 
congratulating their American counterparts on Discovery's return. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight-day shuttle trip boosted Krikalev's time in space to 471 days, 
almost all of it aboard Mir. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans and Russians flew together during the 1975 Apollo-Soyuz docking 
mission, but never before had a Russian been launched on a U.S. spacecraft or 
landed in one. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Russian cosmonaut is due to fly on a shuttle early next year, and two 
Americans head to Russia next week to train for a 1995 stint on Mir. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to 10 shuttle-Mir dockings are planned beginning in 1995, with the goal 
being a joint space station by 2001.

AIR BOARD REJECTS SCALED-BACK ANTI-TOXICS PLAN; ENVIRONMENT: A MAJORITY FAVORS 
AN EVEN LESS STRINGENT APPROACH TO REGULATING INDUSTRIAL AIR POLLUTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLA CONE, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Polarized by an emotionally charged battle that has been waged since last 
summer, the Southland's air quality board Friday rejected a proposal that would 
have protected more than one million residents from industrial air pollution 
linked to cancer and other deadly diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 The South Coast Air Quality Management District board will try again next 
month to reach a decision on how far to go in forcing industries in the Los 
Angeles Basin to protect communities from toxic fumes. Most board members are 
leaning toward a dramatically scaled-back plan that has drawn an outraged 
reaction from environmentalists and an endorsement from the area's biggest 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal is designed to protect people who live in toxic "hot spots" that 
are scattered throughout Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino 
counties. The primary areas include southeast Los Angeles, the 
Wilmington-Carson area and the Burbank area, which have large concentrations of 
industrial plants close to residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 The board, which heard six hours of heated testimony from the public Friday 
and five hours last July, has now postponed action on the anti-toxics proposal 
on three occasions. The proposal rejected by the board Friday had been scaled 
back considerably from the one that was first recommended by the AQMD staff 
last July. Thousands of small businesses would have been exempted while 330 
companies that pose the most health risk to residential neighborhoods would 
have been regulated had the board adopted Friday's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, a majority of the board thought the plan remained too onerous and 
wanted it scaled down even further to eliminate about 100 additional companies 
and ease the cost to big businesses. Such a proposal would cut exposure to 
toxic fumes for only 70,000 people, instead of more than one million as 
originally proposed in July, and expose the communities to a risk of 100 cancer 
cases per million people instead of 10 per million. 
</P>
<P>
 The board members are torn between powerful businesses, led by a coalition of 
aerospace and oil firms that say the cancer risk from toxic emissions is 
inflated, and activists and environmentalists who accused the board of "toxic 
racism" and turning some urban communities into "sacrifice zones." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Mathis of a community-rights group in Los Angeles County accused the 
board of selling out to big business. He said if the board adopts a scaled-down 
version of the rule, future generations of mainly low-income and minority 
residents will be "virtually guaranteed" to experience more leukemia, lung 
cancer, liver damage, birth defects and other serious health problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are violating the civil rights of this whole community," said Mathis, of 
Labor/Community Watchdog, an environmental group that focuses on the 
Wilmington-San Pedro area. Gail Feuer, a senior attorney with the Natural 
Resources Defense Council, appealed to the board to strengthen the proposal, 
not weaken it. "It's the board's role to protect public health. They can't 
ignore their mission," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Stan Zwicker, representing the Small Business Coalition, 
said the proposal would have great cost to the economy "with no real 
significant health benefits." He called the risk of cancer "overblown." 
</P>
<P>
 Most AQMD board members said they rejected the proposal because of the 
$10-million-a-year price tag for business and because they also believe that 
the risk of cancer and disease in the Los Angeles Basin is not as great as 
toxicologists and risk assessment scientists say. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 200 cancer cases a year in the four-county Los Angeles region are 
believed to be caused by airborne toxic chemicals from all sources, including 
industry, cars, pesticides and consumer products, according to the state Air 
Resources Board. The Los Angeles Basin's air has the highest concentrations of 
toxic chemicals in California, and some of the worst in the nation, the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency says. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the various versions of proposals, a variety of industries would have to 
find ways to cut their toxic emissions, such as switching to less dangerous 
chemicals or adding filters to their plants. 
</P>
<P>
 In the original version in July, the AQMD envisioned that 7,000 businesses 
would have to cut back the volume of potentially cancer-causing chemicals they 
routinely release into the air. But under the latest version rejected by the 
board, 330 companies -- those considered the worst offenders -- would have had 
to comply. Several thousand dry cleaners, service stations, furniture 
refinishers and metal-plating shops would have been exempted. 
</P>
<P>
 But business leaders mounted an intense campaign to scale back the rule even 
further. The strongest push came from Robert Wyman, an attorney representing 
the Los Angeles-area oil industry and Northrop, Lockheed, McDonnell Douglas and 
Hughes Aircraft, who suggested an alternate proposal that apparently stands a 
good chance of being approved by the board next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the version of the rule rejected by the board, a company would have to 
reduce its toxic emissions within five years if a risk assessment shows that 
more than 10 of every million people exposed to the fumes for a 70-year 
lifetime would contract cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those companies, the ones that pose a "significant risk" -- more than 100 
cancer cases per one million people exposed -- would be granted no extensions 
of that five-year period. Those with a lower risk, between 10 and 100 cancer 
cases per one million people, could be eligible for four-year extensions if it 
would cost more than $6 million to eliminate each individual case of cancer.  
</P>
<P>
 That proposal was shot down on a 4-4 vote that came late Friday afternoon, 
after several board members had left. 
</P>
<P>
 Business groups, led by the oil and aerospace companies, urged the board to 
regulate only those companies that fall into the greater risk category. That 
also failed on a 4-4 vote, but some board members who had already left the 
meeting said they would probably vote for such a proposal next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The cancer estimates are an inexact science. Actual cancer cases are not 
counted since the calculations only reflect the odds of people getting cancer 
from a lifetime exposure to toxic fumes. 
</P>
<P>
 Several board members said they voted against the rule because they have 
serious qualms about the reliability of such risk assessments, even though they 
are accepted by scientists worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve other states have anti-toxics rules. Many, including those in New York 
and New Jersey, are more stringent than the proposal rejected Friday by the Los 
Angeles region board.

WIDOW CULTIST STARS IN DAVIDIANS' TRIAL; JUSTICE: WOMAN WHOSE HUSBAND WAS 
KILLED IN SHOOTOUT WITH ATF AGENTS TESTIFIES TO GET REDUCED CHARGES. DEFENSE 
LAWYERS ATTACK HER CREDIBILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kathryn Schroeder, frequently brushing back strands of long brown hair and 
weeping, has been the government's chief witness against 11 Branch Davidian 
cultists charged with conspiring to murder four federal agents last February -- 
an episode that culminated 51 days later in a conflagration that left more than 
80 dead. 
</P>
<P>
 During the last month, Schroeder and more than 100 other witnesses for the 
prosecution have described in court for the first time events inside the 
compound: cult leader David Koresh's erratic behavior, his insistence on 
building up a cache of fearsome weapons -- such as hand grenades and assault 
rifles -- and his preachings that cult members must be willing to "kill for 
God" in any showdown with the government. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the prosecution's case has been built largely on eyewitness 
testimony, it has left some gaps for the jury to ponder, even as defense 
attorneys prepare to begin their presentation. 
</P>
<P>
 Schroeder, for example, testified that she saw eight of the 11 defendants on 
trial holding guns during the standoff. But she did not see any of them fire a 
weapon, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Bernadette Griffin, an agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco 
and Firearms, which raided the compound, said she saw defendant Jaime Castillo 
aim a rifle at her but never saw him fire at anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 But the witness who has drawn the most attention is the 31-year-old Schroeder. 
Widowed when her husband, Michael, was killed in the Feb. 28 shootout, she 
subsequently agreed to testify for the government in return for a reduction of 
the charges against her. 
</P>
<P>
 Her credibility has been attacked during cross-examination by defense lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Dan Cogdell asked Schroeder if she had told a cellmate before 
reaching her plea bargain: "I'm going to tell them (the prosecutors) whatever 
they want to hear. I've got to get out of prison to be with my children." 
</P>
<P>
 Schroeder's reply: "I don't remember." 
</P>
<P>
 Under questioning by Jeff Kearney, another defense lawyer, Schroeder 
acknowledged that she already has received an initial sum of money as part of a 
movie deal. Although not mentioning amounts, she said most of the money will 
come later. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to gain the sympathy of jurors, the defendants have been pictured 
by their lawyers as Bible-toting victims of Koresh who are nonviolent by 
nature. Schroeder partly contributed to this image. She tearfully told of being 
forced to serve as one of Koresh's wives in the compound and portrayed him as 
dominating his followers. 
</P>
<P>
 She quoted Koresh as telling the cult members: "If you can't kill for God, you 
can't die for God." She said many followed his orders. 
</P>
<P>
 Wounded in the initial shootout, Koresh predicted that he would die and 
developed a suicide plot for his group, Schroeder and other cultists said. 
</P>
<P>
 Former cult member Victorine Hollingsworth, 59, told jurors: "Everyone was 
happy that this was going to be the end . . . and we would go to our heavenly 
mother and our heavenly father." But Koresh recovered from his wounds and 
called off the plan, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cult members also testified that at least two of their wounded members were 
"finished off" by Koresh's close aides. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Rodriguez, an undercover agent for the ATF, confirmed a key finding in 
a federal investigative report last fall by testifying that Koresh was tipped 
off to the raid and thus had his followers armed and ready. 
</P>
<P>
 "Neither the ATF nor the National Guard will get me," he quoted Koresh as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez said he immediately told his superiors that Koresh knew of their 
plan. But the raid took place anyway. Defense lawyers want jurors to doubt the 
credibility of ATF officials, five of whom later were reprimanded for lying in 
claiming that they thought they had preserved the element of surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 The Waco defendants, if convicted in the federal courthouse named for Wood, 
face up to life imprisonment. Under federal conspiracy law, anyone who 
contributes in any way to a group's criminal activity -- in this case murder -- 
may be found guilty.

HOUSE LEADERS TO PROBE ROSTENKOWSKI PAYMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leaders of both political parties in the House agreed Friday night to 
investigate Rep. Dan Rostenkowski's reimbursement to the government of $82,000 
for previously purchased office equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The repayment by the Illinois Democrat, who is chairman of the House Ways and 
Means Committee, "raises some serious questions regarding the House's procedure 
and integrity," said Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.). 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich said that initially leaders would conduct a "low-key" inquiry and 
would determine later whether a more formal probe is required. 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski's office and campaign accounts and his stamp purchases are under 
investigation by a federal grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
 A subpoena issued Thursday asked for any Rostenkowski records of reimbursement 
to the House's office-supply store, including recent payments totaling $82,095. 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski issued a statement Thursday night saying he reimbursed the 
government for the equipment because questions were raised about the purchases. 
He said he "erred on the side of reimbursing the government." 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich and House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) said they 
agreed that leadership staff members would review the propriety of the 
reimbursements while Congress is in recess next week. The leadership will meet 
on the subject in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 House rules require that official office equipment, purchased at a discount, 
can only be for official use. If it is found that the equipment was used 
improperly, the member must reimburse the House for the purchase amount plus 
10% to cover the discount. 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski, who faces a primary election next month, said in his statement 
Thursday that he was aware of some purchases but not others. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the ambiguity and flexibility surrounding many of the House rules, 
which have changed over time, and because of the passage of time and the 
absence of documentation, it was impossible to reconstruct each purchase and 
its purpose," Rostenkowski said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Accordingly, I erred on the side of reimbursing the government for any item 
which even my fiercest political adversary could question." 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski paid back the money from campaign and personal funds. He said he 
was willing to make the reimbursements "since my integrity is a lot more 
important than the money."

EX-ARKANSAS STATE WORKER SAYS CLINTON HARASSED HER; POLITICS: WHITE HOUSE 
DENIES THAT THEN-GOVERNOR MADE SEXUAL ADVANCES TO HER IN 1991. TROOPER SAYS THE 
TWO MET BUT THAT SHE WAS WILLING TO MEET AGAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Arkansas state employee, saying she wanted to restore her "good 
reputation," charged Friday that then-Gov. Bill Clinton made sexual advances 
toward her in his hotel room during a 1991 conference in Little Rock. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges by Paula Jones at a press conference here are the latest in a 
series of allegations of sexual misconduct that have plagued Clinton since he 
began his drive for the presidency in 1992. Her account offers support for 
allegations last fall by several Arkansas state troopers that Clinton used them 
to arrange extramarital encounters. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to the President, Jones' lawyer, Daniel M. Traylor, asked for a 
public apology and warned of a possible lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said of Jones' account: "It's just 
not true." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, a slim, dark-haired woman in her late 20s, now lives in California but 
declined to say precisely where. 
</P>
<P>
 She said in an affidavit and in response to reporters' questions that she went 
to Clinton's hotel room because an Arkansas state trooper told her that the 
governor wanted to talk to her. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Jones had never met Clinton, she said she believed that she could 
trust him because he was the governor. At the time, Jones was employed by the 
Arkansas Industrial Development Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 But she asserted that after the trooper, whom she identified as Danny 
Ferguson, escorted her to the room and left her alone with Clinton, the 
governor became aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
 "He took my hand," she said, and loosened his tie. "You have nice curves," 
Jones said he told her. "I love the way your hair goes down your body." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said Clinton pulled her to him, slid his hand up her leg and asked her 
for "a type of sex." 
</P>
<P>
 When she protested that she needed to return to her assignment at the 
conference registration desk in the lobby, she said Clinton told her: "Don't 
worry about that." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said she rebuffed the governor's advances and left in 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was wrong that a woman could work in the workplace and be harassed by a 
figure that high," she said. "It was just humiliating what he did to me." Jones 
was accompanied Friday by her husband, Steven, who said: "What happened in that 
room was a disgrace to Paula. I have bad feelings toward Mr. Clinton." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones's account of the episode was supported by affidavits from a co-worker, 
Pamela Blackard, and a friend, Debra Ballentine, both of whom said Jones told 
them about the incident on the day Jones said it occurred, May 8, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview last fall with The Times, Ferguson also confirmed an account 
of the meeting, saying Clinton pointed out the woman at the conference. Clinton 
reportedly directed Ferguson to approach her on his behalf, saying, "She has 
that come-hither look." Ferguson said Clinton directed him to temporarily 
obtain a room at the hotel, which Ferguson did by telling the hotel manager 
that Clinton was expecting an important call from the White House and needed 
privacy. Ferguson confirmed that he told the woman that the governor was in the 
room and wanted to see her. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones did not pursue her harassment allegation at the time, Traylor said, 
because she felt she had no recourse. "The police were the people who had 
escorted her up," the lawyer said. Moreover, he said, Clinton had said he was 
friends with Jones' boss. 
</P>
<P>
 She subsequently married and moved to California, where her husband was 
transferred. The couple has one child. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones came forward, Traylor said, because of a report of the episode in the 
January issue of the American Spectator. 
</P>
<P>
 The story, which identified her only as "Paula," reported that she had spent 
an hour in Clinton's room and had told Ferguson that she was willing to become 
the governor's "regular girlfriend," if Clinton "so desired." 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to clear her name, she called Traylor, who asked a friend who 
purportedly had access to the President to "make an overture" to him, asking 
for an apology. Word came back, Traylor said, that "there is no common ground; 
you all go do what you got to do." 
</P>
<P>
 In his interview with The Times, Ferguson said the woman had stayed with the 
governor for about 30 minutes and told Ferguson that she would be willing to 
meet with Clinton again. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' press conference was held jointly with one arranged by Cliff Jackson, 
the lawyer for two state troopers, Larry Patterson and Roger Perry, who alleged 
in articles in the Los Angeles Times and the Spectator that they helped Clinton 
arrange extramarital assignations with women while he was governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson told reporters here Friday that he also had been asked by Clinton to 
approach young women who the governor thought had "a come-hither look." Of 
these women, Patterson, said, "there were never any that refused to meet him 
(Clinton) or give her name or telephone number." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's part of the press conference was intended to raise money for a 
"whistle-blower" fund to help pay legal expenses and provide other kinds of 
financial assistance to people willing to corroborate Patterson's and Perry's 
accounts of Clinton's behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 The press conference was held at the Omni Shoreham hotel, which is also 
housing the annual Conservative Political Action Conference. Jackson is 
scheduled to participate in a conference panel discussion of Clinton and the 
media today.

BROWN URGES 17-MONTH SALES TAX HIKE FOR REBUILDING; POLITICS: STATE TREASURER 
PROPOSES A QUARTER-CENT TEMPORARY INCREASE. SHE CRITICIZES WILSON PLAN, WHICH 
RELIES HEAVILY ON LOANS, BECAUSE IT INCURS LONG-TERM DEBT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 State Treasurer Kathleen Brown on Friday proposed a quarter-cent temporary 
sales tax increase to raise $1 billion toward the cost of rebuilding from the 
Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, a Democratic candidate for governor, criticized Republican Gov. Pete 
Wilson's proposal for the state's part of the earthquake recovery effort, which 
would rely heavily on new borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Reese, Brown's campaign spokesman, said the treasurer opposes a 
$1.05-billion bond measure that is the centerpiece of Wilson's plan because it 
would take too long to enact and would saddle taxpayers with costs that should 
be paid now. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always been her belief that bonds should be for long-term investments," 
Reese said. "This is an immediate crisis, not a long-term investment." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's proposal would increase the sales tax for 17 months, which would raise 
about $1 billion. The state's first-year share of the recovery cost is expected 
to be $1.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 She said $387 million could be raised by selling bonds that voters have 
authorized but which the Wilson Administration has not spent. This includes 
more than $200 million that has been available since 1990 to strengthen state 
buildings against earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 To cover the remaining amount, Brown endorsed Wilson's idea of asking the 
federal government to lend California $334 million. That is the amount the 
state will be required to pay in matching funds as a condition of receiving 
more than $9 billion in federal aid. 
</P>
<P>
 The sales tax varies by county. It ranges from a low of 7.25% in 37 counties 
to 8.5% in San Francisco. The rate in Los Angeles County and six others is 
8.25%. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature approved a quarter-cent, 13-month sales tax after the 1989 
Loma Prieta earthquake. Another temporary increase, of a half-cent for general 
purposes, was enacted at Wilson's urging in 1991 and extended by voters in 
November, with the money going to local government. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson contended Thursday that the state's fragile economy cannot withstand 
another tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
 He proposed a $1.05-billion bond measure to pay for reconstruction of public 
buildings and loans to homeowners to help them rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also called for about $300 million in unspecified cuts in the state 
budget, along with the $334-million federal loan that Brown endorsed. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's bond proposal would cost taxpayers more than $600 million in interest 
over a 20-year period. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor's campaign spokesman criticized Brown's plan even before she 
released it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not courage for Kathleen Brown to call for new taxes -- it's reflex," 
said Dan Schnur, communications director for the Wilson campaign. Noting that 
the two other Democratic candidates -- Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi 
and state Sen. Tom Hayden -- also proposed raising taxes, Schnur referred to 
the Democratic primary campaign as "the battle of the taxers." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the earthquake, Garamendi proposed a half-cent sales tax 
increase and a 2-cent gasoline tax increase, each to run for one year. Hayden 
has also proposed a temporary, quarter-cent sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kathleen Brown has finally acknowledged publicly what John Garamendi has been 
saying since Day 1," said Darry Sragow, Garamendi's campaign director. "From 
the get-go, John Garamendi has been telling everyone that we're going to need a 
tax increase." 
</P>
<P>
 But Sragow said Brown's proposal is incomplete because there is no guarantee 
that the federal government will allow the state to delay payment of its 
matching funds. Even if Washington goes along, he said, the scheme will add to 
the state's budget problems when the bill comes due in the years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's trying to do this with half a loaf," Sragow said. "She's trying to play 
both sides." 
</P>
<P>
 But Reese said Brown's plan makes sense because it minimizes the taxes needed 
by using the proposed federal loan and authorized bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Although legislative leaders have given at least lukewarm support to Wilson's 
plan, and no tax increase seems likely without his backing, Reese said Brown 
believes the solution is still open to debate in the Legislature.

REP. HUFFINGTON LAUNCHES ADVERTISING BLITZ IN QUEST FOR SENATE SEAT; CAMPAIGN: 
SANTA BARBARA REPUBLICAN WILL AGAIN TAP HIS FORTUNE FOR TV ADS. HE HOPES TO 
OPPOSE FEINSTEIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Get ready, California, to meet Rep. Michael Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the Santa Barbara Republican, who spent $5 million of his own money 
to win a Central Coast congressional seat two years ago, broadcast the first of 
many television ads to come in his bid to unseat Democratic Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask the folks who live in his district about him. He's the face that seemed to 
never leave their television screens when he first ran for office in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just seemed like they were on all of the time," recalled Lowell Winter, a 
hotel administrator at the Cambria Pines Lodge. "He must know that it pays off, 
but you sure get a lot of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody in U.S. history had spent as much money on television commercials for a 
congressional campaign. Now Huffington (R-Santa Barbara), a former banker and 
the son of a Texas oilman, is planning something similar for the rest of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Largely through television, his advisers expect that two out of three 
Californians will know Huffington by the time he faces former Republican Rep. 
William E. Dannemeyer on the June 7 primary ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first step of introducing Michael Huffington to the voters," said 
Bruce Blakeman, an adviser to the campaign. "We are running against a 
professional politician (Feinstein) who has been running for public office for 
years and we have a long way to make up." 
</P>
<P>
 There is nothing fancy about this 30-second commercial -- the first this year 
from a statewide candidate. It simply pictures the 46-year-old congressman 
talking to the camera about the personal values and limited government that he 
supports. 
</P>
<P>
 The ad begins with the freshman lawmaker recommending a new book by William J. 
Bennett, President Ronald Reagan's former education secretary, "The Book of 
Virtues." It is an anthology of poems, fables and essays ranging from 
Shakespeare to Martin Luther King that is targeted to children. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a collection of wonderful classic stories to help teach our children 
values -- such as responsibility, courage, compassion, perseverance, hard work 
and faith," Huffington says in the ad. "This book is also a great reminder that 
solving problems in our country depends on strong individuals and strong 
families, not on government." 
</P>
<P>
 The ad never mentions that Huffington is a Republican or a congressman. And it 
refers to the Senate race only in a closing caption. 
</P>
<P>
 Kam Kuwata, who will be Feinstein's California campaign director, was critical 
of the commercial's attack on government problem-solving -- especially with all 
of the state's problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are times when government can respond to basic needs like crime 
prevention, earthquake relief and fire relief," he said. "Sometimes when you're 
so wealthy, you're out of touch with the needs of average working people." 
</P>
<P>
 Larry McCarthy, Huffington's media adviser, declined to say how much the 
campaign will spend to broadcast the ad. But he said the commercial will be 
shown statewide and with enough frequency that most Californians should see it 
at least a few times in the next several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the campaign is planning to release more introductory commercials in 
the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 February is traditionally considered a bit early for candidates to start 
television commercials. Most think the money is better saved until later in the 
campaign. Strategists also wonder whether enough voters are paying attention to 
politics to make an ad effective. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a perfect world you wouldn't start until later," McCarthy conceded. "But 
Congressman Huffington is not well known statewide." 
</P>
<P>
 Money is also not expected to be a major problem for Huffington. His opponents 
are wondering how bottomless his wallet will prove to be in the campaign since 
the candidate has promised to spend some of his considerable wealth. But he has 
also said he won't pay for everything and he expects much of the campaign to be 
financed with contributions.

HAL SMITH; PLAYED OTIS ON GRIFFITH SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hal Smith, who played the chunky, cheerful, affable inebriate Otis Campbell in 
Andy Griffith's mythical hometown of Mayberry, N.C., has died, apparently of a 
heart attack. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Pitts, his longtime agent, said the TV, film and radio veteran died at his 
Santa Monica home Jan. 28 while listening to a nightly drama hour on radio. 
</P>
<P>
 Known nationally for his face and staggering presence on "The Andy Griffith 
Show" in the 1960s, Smith also had a hidden career with his voice. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of his professional life he was the voice of cartoon characters, 
hawked products in hundreds of commercials and was heard off-screen in several 
feature films. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his more enduring voice-overs was as Winnie the Pooh in the Walt Disney 
short subjects and cartoons. He took over after Sterling Holloway, Winnie's 
original voice, fell ill and died in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitts said Smith came to films and television after singing with big bands in 
the 1930s. He worked as a staff announcer on Los Angeles radio station KFI in 
the 1940s and then launched an acting career. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, Smith and much of the regular Mayberry crew returned to national TV 
for a well-received reunion. Smith's character was one of the few that had 
changed -- he had sobered up. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the Griffith show, still seen by millions around the world in 
syndication, Smith also was a featured guest on "Pat Paulsen's Half a Comedy 
Hour" in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors include his son, Terry, and a brother.

WILLIAM CONRAD; STAR OF 'CANNON,' 'FATMAN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MILES CORWIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 William Conrad, who starred as the portly district attorney in television's 
"Jake and the Fatman" and played the title role in the earlier detective series 
"Cannon," died of a heart attack Friday. He was 73. 
</P>
<P>
 Conrad became ill at his home and died at the Medical Center of North 
Hollywood, hospital spokeswoman Tricia Spellman said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was best known for his role as J.L. (Fatman) McCabe, an irascible, 
hard-nosed district attorney and former police officer. The CBS-TV series "Jake 
and the Fatman" ran from 1987 to 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In the show "Cannon," which ran from 1971 to 1976 on CBS, he played a 
detective who was balding, middle-aged and fat -- a departure from the macho, 
leading man types starring in many police shows during that era. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Conrad's acting cronies were surprised to learn that during World War 
II, the rotund actor had been a fighter pilot in the Army Air Corps. 
</P>
<P>
 After he left the service, he made his film debut in a 1946 thriller, "The 
Killers." His rapidly expanding waistline soon limited his parts principally to 
villains, and his credits included "Body and Soul," "Sorry, Wrong Number," 
"East Side, West Side," and "The Naked Jungle." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of his deep and distinctive voice, he also was able to obtain many 
roles on radio. Conrad was the original Marshal Matt Dillon in the "Gunsmoke" 
radio network drama, which ran for 11 years on CBS. He later provided 
background narration for many TV programs, including "The Fugitive," "The 
Invaders" and "Rocky and His Friends," a cult favorite also called "The 
Bullwinkle Show." 
</P>
<P>
 Because Conrad found limited television and movie roles during the 1950s, he 
turned to producing and directing. His first major series was "Bat Masterson," 
from 1957-59. He later produced "Klondike" and directed the Jack Webb show, 
"General Electric True." He also produced or directed shows such as "Naked 
City," "77 Sunset Strip," and "Gunsmoke." 
</P>
<P>
 Conrad picked up occasional acting roles in the 1960s in Westerns and crime 
shows, but it was not until 1971 that he obtained his big break in television. 
He was cast as detective Frank Cannon, and both the show and Conrad were a hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Cannon was a cop who never chased the bad guys and rarely fired his gun. He 
favored cruising about Los Angeles in his Cadillac convertible and he spent a 
lot of time drinking fine wines and eating gourmet meals. Staying fat was 
something he seemed to work at.  
</P>
<P>
 Conrad also played an unlikely television hero in "Jake and the Fatman." He 
soon became disillusioned with the show because of what he called poor scripts, 
but he opted to keep his contract commitment through 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanna get out," he said at the time. "When I say what I think, I get in 
trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Conrad was known on the set as a man with strong opinions who was never 
reluctant to speak his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of television is crap," Conrad said in a 1976 Times interview. " 
'Cannon' was crap. I was delighted to see it canceled." 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Hargrove, executive producer of "Jake and the Fatman," said Conrad "could 
be irascible and very blunt and direct in his opinions, but underneath it all 
he was a very decent, thoughtful and considerate gentleman." 
</P>
<P>
 He is survived by his wife, Tippy, and a son, Christopher, who lives in 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 A private memorial service will be held at Forest Lawn Hollywood Hills 
cemetery.

HOWARD TEMIN; WON NOBEL PRIZE FOR RESEARCH ON GENETICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nobel Prize winner Howard Temin, a cancer researcher who helped change the way 
scientists look at genetics and became a tireless opponent of smoking, has died 
of lung cancer at age 59. 
</P>
<P>
 Temin, a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor who specialized in cancer 
and AIDS research, made a brief public announcement in 1992 to discuss his 
illness and to note that he had never been a cigarette smoker. Temin, who spent 
many of his final years campaigning against smoking, died Wednesday of 
adenocarcinoma, a form of cancer that is not caused by smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 He won the Nobel Prize for physiology in 1975 when he was honored with his 
Caltech professor, Renato Dulbecco, and David Baltimore of the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology for their research on possible links between viruses 
and cancer. Temin also received the National Medal of Science in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Temin's work in helping discover the enzyme reverse transcriptase led to 
acceptance of his theory that some genetic reproduction is the reverse of what 
scientists had thought. 
</P>
<P>
 Temin said some viruses carry their genetic information in ribonucleic acid, 
or RNA, which is then copied into the viruses' deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA. 
The theory challenged the belief that DNA always passed information to RNA, 
rather than the other way around. 
</P>
<P>
 But the discovery of the reverse transcriptase enzyme proved his theory was 
right. 
</P>
<P>
 The enzyme also played a key role in identifying the AIDS virus and has been 
crucial to genetic engineering, which has produced such drugs as human insulin 
and tpa, a clot-dissolving substance that can stop heart attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Temin joined the University of Wisconsin-Madison staff in 1960.  
</P>
<P>
 The Philadelphia native began his career with the study of chickens and how 
viruses affect them. From those studies, he learned that some genetic 
reproduction is the reverse of what scientists had thought normal.

ELLEN SHAFFER; AUTHORITY ON ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON, BEATRIX POTTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ellen Shaffer, 89, rare books expert and internationally known authority on 
Robert Louis Stevenson. A native of Leadville, Colo., who was educated at the 
University of Colorado and UCLA, Miss Shaffer taught briefly and then began her 
career in rare books at Los Angeles' Dawson's Book Shop.During her 
quarter-century at the shop, she established herself as an expert, assisting 
collectors and speaking and writing widely about specific volumes. One of her 
most popular publications was her 1950 "The Nuremberg Chronicle: A Monograph" 
about the development of the 15th-Century volume "The Book of Chronicles." Miss 
Shaffer left Los Angeles in 1954 to serve as rare books librarian of the Free 
Library of Philadelphia. In 1970, she became the first curator of the Silverado 
Museum, which is devoted to the life and works of Stevenson, in St. Helena, 
Calif. Consulted on Stevenson by researchers from several nations, Miss Shaffer 
remained in that post until her retirement in 1992. She was also regarded as an 
expert on the life and work of the English writer Beatrix Potter. Last year, 
Miss Shaffer completed an oral history, "Self-Portrait of a Bookwoman," for 
UC's Bancroft Library. On Jan. 30 in St. Helena, Calif.

 An engineer's and architect's report released Friday on earthquake damage at 
the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum is filled with qualifications and said 
further structural examinations would be necessary to ascertain the total 
damage to the historic facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere in six pages of written comment did structural engineer Nabih Youssef 
and architect Terry K. Miller state unequivocally that the Coliseum is 
repairable. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they said: "We are confident that within the parameters established 
in this report that repairs will provide a facility that meets applicable 
seismic and life safety requirements to once again operate as a public assembly 
facility." 
</P>
<P>
 The key phrase is "within the parameters," meaning that completion of repairs 
would be dependent on exposure of vital stadium components for further 
inspection as well as monitoring of continuing aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before receiving the report, Coliseum Commission President Yvonne 
Brathwaite Burke had called the Coliseum Commission into a special session 
Monday afternoon to consider the next steps. Burke, chairwoman of the Los 
Angeles County Board of Supervisors, had no immediate comment on the report. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission's vice president, City Council President John Ferraro, said 
Youssef and Miller will be invited Monday to explain matters further. "I can 
see why they want to be a bit evasive because they're not positive of some of 
the interior (stadium) elements deep down," Ferraro said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coliseum official Don C. Webb said the possibility of reopening the stadium in 
time for the fall football season by the Coliseum's main tenants, the Raiders 
and USC, will have to be evaluated after further engineering and architectural 
reports. He added that the time is short and the commission must act quickly to 
begin repair work. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the Los Angeles City Council voted to allocate an initial $10.9 
million in federal disaster funds received by the city to start work at the 
Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 In their concluding paragraph, Youssef and Miller said it was "impossible to 
accurately determine the total costs associated with rehabilitation of the 
Coliseum without the full inspection and testing results as described above." 
</P>
<P>
 "However, our review of the preliminary estimate (of repair costs) as 
developed (by Webb) supports the possible cost of $33 million for repairs," 
they added. 
</P>
<P>
 "Refinement of the costs will occur as solutions are developed for 
rehabilitation. A detailed work plan must be created in order to determine the 
priorities of the work effort." 
</P>
<P>
 Youssef and Miller cautioned that the Coliseum "continues to receive 
aftershocks and subsequent damage can be anticipated." 
</P>
<P>
 "This report is preliminary in the determination of rehabilitation efforts 
required to stabilize the existing structural components and facility systems," 
they said. "Continued analysis will identify necessary repairs to ensure the 
facility meets code requirements for operation as a public assembly facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "The initial tasks of stabilizing the structural frame is necessary in order 
to conduct further visual and dynamic inspection of the affected areas," 
Youssef and Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In addition, the suspect areas of the stadium as described above must be 
uncovered in order to fully assess damages in areas not visually accessible," 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
 They also recommended these immediate steps or policies: 
</P>
<P>
 * "The building should not be occupied for normal uses until repairs are 
completed. Inspectors and workmen should take precautions to avoid (areas that) 
have been serious damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 * Columns, beams and arches with major damage should be shored immediately to 
prevent additional damage. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The exterior . . . should be exposed to identify areas of structural 
damage. In areas where movement of the building has loosened concrete and is 
susceptible to falling, the concrete should be removed immediately to mitigate 
potential falling hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 * "In order to monitor damage levels and safety of the facility during 
continuing aftershocks, we recommend that some instrumentation be provided to 
measure earthquake movements. . . . This is especially critical for seriously 
damaged structural columns and beams." 
</P>
<P>
 As for damage in specific parts of the 71-year-old stadium, Youssef and Miller 
said: 
</P>
<P>
 "The concrete slab of the upper concourse appears to have incurred significant 
cracks and displacement around the entire length of the stadium.  
</P>
<P>
 "The upper seating bowl has been displaced four to five inches above the lower 
seating bowl on the north side . . . and to a lesser degree on the south side. 
</P>
<P>
 "The structural integrity of the peristyle is the primary concern in our 
observation of cracking that occurred at the top and center of the arches 
supporting the scoreboards as well as the vertical and horizontal cracks 
observed in the main arch." Destructive Forces 
</P>
<P>
 The Jan. 17 earthquake caused severe damage to the Los Angeles Coliseum, 
raising questions about whether the historic stadium could be repaired or would 
have to be demolished. A structural engineer's assessment Friday repoeted that 
the Coliseum is possible repairable, but said more testing is needed to 
determine exact repair costs. The Coliseum Commission will meet Monday to 
consider the report. 
</P>
<P>
 1. Seating separation and uplift 
</P>
<P>
 Significant cracking and upheaval ranging from one to five inches occurred 
between rows 50 and 58 throughout much of the lower bowl. The majority of the 
access tunnels also suffered cracking. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Cracked and subsided slabs 
</P>
<P>
 Significant cracks and displacement of the concrete slab occurred on the upper 
concourse from one to three inches around the entire length of the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Cracked Columns 
</P>
<P>
 About five concrete columns (A) experienced major shear damage and many more 
(A and B) experienced flexural cracking. 
</P>
<P>
 Exterior (B) columns appear to have pulled away from the bowl and tilted 
slightly outward. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Fractured beams 
</P>
<P>
 Several steel-reinforced concrete beams were seriously damaged with vertical 
cracking the full depth of the beam. 
</P>
<P>
 Stadium utility systems 
</P>
<P>
 Although testing has not ben done, many utilities including power and gas rate 
suspect. It is highly probable that more testing will find that the systems 
must be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 Damaged peristyle: Significant damage has occurred with cracks appearing to 
penetrate the full depth of the structure near the scoreboards.

CENTER UPGRADES QUAKE MAGNITUDE TO 6.8 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The National Earthquake Information Center at Golden, Colo., on Friday 
officially upgraded the magnitude of the Northridge earthquake to 6.8, although 
it noted that Caltech and the U.S. Geological Survey, using another magnitude 
measurement, are sticking with 6.7. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jan. 17 earthquake was initially listed at magnitude 6.6 by all three 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Geophysicist Willis Jacobs, a spokesman for the center, said it customarily 
determines magnitude through measuring surface waves from the earthquake as 
received by seismographic stations throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "When asked for a single figure, we are now giving 6.8," Jacobs said.

HOSPITALS LAX ON QUAKE READINESS, BOARD SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Members of the California Seismic Safety Commission said Friday that hospitals 
in the state were not meeting their responsibility in maintaining earthquake 
safety standards. 
</P>
<P>
 L. Thomas Tobin, executive director of the commission, said that hospitals 
were trying to shed "their responsibility" for making older hospitals, built to 
outdated safety standards, safer for patients and health care workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody has to stand up and take responsibility," Tobin said after listening 
to a hospital spokesman say that California hospitals believed in upgrading 
their safety standards but did not have enough money to accomplish it. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of hospitals' preparedness for an earthquake surfaced during the 
second day of a two-day commission hearing in Van Nuys at which there was 
testimony about issues concerning the need to upgrade building codes, building 
methods and the design and engineering process.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite earthquake damage that forced the closure of several hospitals and the 
evacuation of nearly 1,000 patients, Roger Richter, senior vice president of 
the California Assn. of Hospitals and Health Systems, told the commission that 
hospital officials were "satisfied" with their performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Richter told the commission: "We are proud of the way our hospitals functioned 
both during and after the earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 M. Neal Hardman, with the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development, 
backed him up, agreeing that hospitals held up as well as could be expected. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the earthquake, six hospitals and medical buildings suffered 
such major structural damage that they were shut down. In those hospitals, 
ceilings collapsed, walls buckled and floors gave way. In addition, more than a 
dozen hospitals faced serious problems when mechanical systems failed. Gas 
mains blew, oxygen systems failed, sewage backed up, water supplies were lost, 
and emergency generators failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Iwan, chairman of the Seismic Safety Commission, said that considering 
those results, "I was disappointed in the response of the hospitals. I 
personally do not consider the performance of the hospitals in this earthquake 
to be acceptable. We just cannot have a large number of hospitals become 
non-functional during an earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 Most problems developed in facilities built before 1973, the year tougher 
earthquake standards were placed on hospitals. About 70% of California's 
hospitals were built before 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital association, which represents about 500 hospitals, estimates that 
it would cost $20 billion to retrofit all those facilities so that they meet 
current regulations. Hospital officials said that hospitals are replaced every 
30 to 40 years, and that ultimately all hospitals will be upgraded. 
</P>
<P>
 But commission members said that time frame was not acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the day, Warren O'Brien, general manager of the Los Angeles Building 
and Safety Department, said he has urged the City Council to require buildings 
similar to the Northridge Meadows apartments -- where 16 people died when it 
collapsed -- to be repaired to 1989 standards if they are to be reoccupied. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is inconceivable to me to allow them to go back and rebuild to a 1976 
code," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1989 code would require all supporting walls to be reinforced with sheets 
of plywood, making them more resistant to lateral displacement.

ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS COST FLORIDA MORE THAN $1 BILLION A YEAR, GOVERNOR SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Illegal immigrants are costing Florida more than $1 billion a year and forcing 
the state to shortchange legal residents, Gov. Lawton Chiles told the federal 
Commission on Immigration Reform on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida, along with other border states such as Texas and California, have 
become increasingly aggressive in pressing the federal government to pick up 
more of the costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal law requires states to educate and provide health care for illegal 
immigrants. But the federal government has inadequately funded programs that 
were supposed to reimburse states for those costs, forcing Floridians to pick 
up the difference, Chiles told the nine-member commission, which will recommend 
changes in immigration law to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service estimates that 345,000 
immigrants are living illegally in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor's remarks, and his recent threat to sue the federal government, 
are at the forefront of a rebellion among states that feel they can no longer 
pay the costs of illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the state went to court Friday to defend its policy of refusing 
foster care to children of illegal immigrants. Florida contends those children 
are the responsibility of the INS.

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; QUAKE DUST LINKED TO INFANTS' ILLS; HEALTH: 
DOCTORS SUSPECT THAT BACTERIA-RICH PARTICLES KICKED UP BY THE TEMBLOR ARE THE 
REASON THREE L.A.-AREA BABIES HAVE CONTRACTED A RARE, LIFE-THREATENING ILLNESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an unusual side effect of the Northridge earthquake, three Los Angeles-area 
babies have contracted infant botulism, a rare, life-threatening illness that 
health officials believe may have been caused by bacteria-rich dust kicked up 
by the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Two children remain in intensive care units with the malady, which results 
from swallowing bacterial spores that live in soil throughout California. The 
third child was recently discharged from a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Infant botulism differs from adult botulism, which is caused by eating tainted 
food, because a baby can develop the illness by ingesting spores contained in 
particles of soil. State health officials said most cases of infant botulism 
seem to stem from construction, farming, earthquake or landslides, which create 
dust in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 The botulism toxin causes muscle paralysis, breathing problems and other 
disturbances to the nervous system. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no deaths from infant botulism have been reported in California in a 
decade, the malady can leave babies so sick that they must be kept alive on 
mechanical ventilators for weeks or months. There is no known antidote. 
</P>
<P>
 Health authorities said dust thrown into the air by the Jan. 17 temblor is the 
most likely cause of the outbreak because all the infants live in areas that 
were violently shaken and showed symptoms only after the quake. The babies are 
from Santa Monica, Granada Hills and Canyon Country. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was pretty far-fetched at first, but now I'm convinced after we 
thought back to the day of the earthquake," said Andy Orescanin, 29, a heavy 
equipment mechanic from Canyon Country whose 3-month-old son is in intensive 
care at a Kaiser hospital in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "When there was that big aftershock, we saw the dust just rolling over the 
hills. Just clouds and clouds of dust," said Orescanin, who spent the day 
sitting in the family van with the doors open after his home was damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Jin Yoon, a Granada Hills homemaker whose 6-week-old daughter is on a 
ventilator in the pediatrics intensive care unit of Childrens Hospital in Los 
Angeles, said her home, too, was damaged in the quake. She and her baby spent 
the day in a car as thick dust settled over their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw the dust falling down from the roof," said Yoon, 24. "We were outside 
the whole day." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of its large land mass and high birthrate, California has about half 
of the 75 to 100 cases of infant botulism diagnosed annually in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 The symptoms of the disease, which only strikes infants less than a year old, 
include constipation, poor eating, weak cry, poor head control and general 
listlessness. 
</P>
<P>
 The botulism poison, produced in the large intestine, slowly damages nerve 
endings and often leads to partial or complete paralysis and serious 
respiratory problems. 
</P>
<P>
 In mild cases, hospitalized babies are fitted with feeding tubes because they 
cannot swallow properly. In one-third to one-half of all cases, babies must be 
put on ventilators so they can breathe. 
</P>
<P>
 If such treatments are not administered, the poison can fatally injure the 
nervous system. But most children recover after they begin to develop some 
immunity to the toxin and their nerve endings regenerate spontaneously. 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors usually recover full nerve and muscle function, said Dr. Robert 
Schechter, an infant botulism expert with the state Department of Health 
Services in Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 Yoon and Orescanin said their babies got sick 10 days to two weeks after the 
quake. Orescanin said the first sign was that his son, Thomas, was not eating 
well. At first, he and his wife thought the baby had the flu. But he got 
progressively weaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "We noticed that when we held him . . . he felt like a wet noodle," Orescanin 
said. Later, the child became dehydrated, had difficulty breathing and "his 
face got real long, like he was losing his facial muscles." 
</P>
<P>
 The third victim, a 3 1/2-month-old Santa Monica girl, was discharged after a 
short stay at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The overall U.S. fatality rate for infant botulism is unknown, partly because 
some mild cases are never diagnosed and because the disease is sometimes 
mistaken for other maladies. A 1977 study indicated that nine of 211 deaths 
attributed to sudden infant death syndrome in California may actually have been 
caused by unrecognized infant botulism. 
</P>
<P>
 But Schechter said that among babies that reach the hospital, the death rate 
is less than 1%. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Wendy Mitchell, a professor of neurology and pediatrics at USC School of 
Medicine, said infant botulism is often misdiagnosed, especially in sparsely 
populated areas where few cases surface. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't know what it looks like, it looks like everything else that goes 
wrong with a little infant -- infections, metabolic problems," Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orescanin said doctors initially misdiagnosed the problem in his son. One 
physician said the baby had the flu, another said it had "a genetic defect," 
Orescanin said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that "after a lot of praying," his son was seen by a doctor at the 
Kaiser hospital in Panorama City who recognized the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had never seen it before, but she had heard of it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yoon said she went to five different doctors before the malady was finally 
recognized at Childrens Hospital. Her baby had turned white and briefly stopped 
breathing before being admitted. 
</P>
<P>
 "She can't breathe, so she's breathing by machine," said Yoon. "But she's 
doing fine. She's doing great right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Stephen Arnon, head of the state health department's infant botulism 
program, said doctors are not certain that airborne spores in dust caused the 
outbreak, but that is the most likely explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 "California is just very generously endowed with spores. They're everywhere," 
he said. "There was a quake and that kicked up dust clouds. We know that's 
where the bacteria live. So there is a suspicion that the quake kind of 
triggered" the outbreak. 
</P>
<P>
 State researchers are checking records to see if earlier quakes prompted 
outbreaks of infant botulism. Schechter said two cases were reported in the Bay 
Area after the 1989 Loma Prieta quake, but they are within the expected number 
of cases for the region and it is not clear if they were related to the 
temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnon said each of the three sick infants in Los Angeles County has been 
enrolled in a clinical trial of a drug called botulism immune globulin, 
originally developed by the Army as an antidote for germ warfare. Researchers 
hope the drug, also known as BIG, will prove effective in arresting the malady, 
although it is not expected to be an antidote. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial, supervised by the state health department, began two years ago. 
More than 50 infants are being studied, but only half have been injected with 
the substance. The other half receive a placebo. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers believe the drug may work by preventing botulism toxin from 
attaching itself to nerve endings. 
</P>
<P>
 While it is hoped the drug can stop the illness from getting worse, "it is not 
a dramatic antidote to existing illness," Arnon said.

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; COMPUTER BUGS HAMSTRING INSPECTORS HIRED BY 
FEMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Dozens of field inspectors assigned to survey quake-damaged homes and assess 
the need for disaster aid have been stranded in the field with nothing to do 
because of glitches in the computerized inspection process. 
</P>
<P>
 A Florida-based firm hired by the Federal Emergency Management Agency to 
conduct inspections has been bedeviled by a variety of software and programming 
problems that are delaying damage assessments at hundreds of homes and 
buildings, said David Goldsmith, an official with the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA officials said Friday that they were unaware of the delays, which slow 
the delivery of aid to victims, but are looking into problems being experienced 
by Vulcan Disaster Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Polny, FEMA's deputy coordinating officer, said the computer system was 
shut down for a 48-hour period last week to expand its capacity, idling about 
half the 1,300 inspectors hired to assess damage. Since then, there have been 
no problems as serious as those reported by Vulcan, Polny said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 52,000 homes have been inspected since the Jan. 17 quake, with 19,000 
inspections completed in the last two days, Polny said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rate of production is increasing daily," said Polny. 
</P>
<P>
 The inspectors use hand-held computer terminals to enter damage information 
while touring disaster sites. With a push of a button, the information is fed 
into a central computer bank in Redwood City, where it is processed and checks 
are dispatched to disaster victims. 
</P>
<P>
 The system was widely used for the first time during the last year's Southland 
firestorms. Even those inspectors who are critical of the quake effort concede 
that when working properly the system can save paperwork and time. 
</P>
<P>
 However, inspectors say many computers are not receiving data -- names and 
addresses of quake victims -- that would direct them to their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldsmith said about 50 of Vulcan's 750 inspectors have been experiencing 
problems but that technicians were working to solve difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some people we are still having problems with, whether it be with 
computer software or the transfer of information, but by and large the system 
is up and running now," Goldsmith said. "Hopefully, we didn't delay in any 
significant way the response to this disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 One inspector contended that the problem is far more widespread than Vulcan 
acknowledges. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a group meeting Thursday and that is when I really realized the extent 
of the problem," said the inspector, who asked that his name not be used. "We 
have 700 people in this company and maybe 300 of that number have never 
received any appointments to go out and inspect because of the problems. Just 
seeing this happen is frustrating and, as a taxpayer, makes me mad. People that 
are supposed to be getting the help are not getting it." 
</P>
<P>
 The frustration was evident among the scores of inspectors who gathered Friday 
morning at Vulcan's makeshift headquarters, a small motel on a busy strip of 
Sepulveda Boulevard in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 The inspectors queued up to have computers checked by technicians and to 
receive instructions. They represented a wide spectrum of professions -- city 
and county building inspectors, architects, insurance adjusters and general 
contractors, many with extensive experience in construction and damage 
assessment. They said they are being reimbursed for living expenses but their 
pay is based on the number of inspections they complete. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's crazy, mixed up," said one inspector, a contractor from San Diego. "I 
have a family back home to get to and can't be hanging around here for too 
long."

 The kids were fidgeting -- until the fiddling started. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what happened Friday when hundreds of children who live in hotels and 
crowded apartments in Downtown Los Angeles gathered to listen to classical 
music.

 World-famed violinist Itzhak Perlman had come to a converted Kohler Street 
auto body shop to play for youngsters more familiar with boombox ballads than 
Beethoven and Brahms. The occasion was the dedication of a new headquarters for 
the nonprofit Inner-City Arts program. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesse Acarrasco, 8, was busily counting the bagful of valentines he received 
earlier in the day as he waited for the music to begin. Kizay Perez, also 8, 
was tying and retying her shoes as youngsters around her squirmed and whispered 
to each other while they waited. 
</P>
<P>
 But everyone snapped to attention when eight of their classmates stood up, 
tucked pint-size violins under their chins and welcomed Perlman by playing 
their own 90-second piece called "The Metronome." 
</P>
<P>
 And a hush fell across the room when Perlman pulled out a 280-year-old 
Stradivarius and played a portion of "La Vida Breve" and "Tambourin Chinois" by 
Kriesler and "Allegro" by Fiocco. 
</P>
<P>
 Perlman was invited to Downtown Los Angeles two years ago when Inner-City Arts 
Chairman Irwin Jaeger met him at a New York "business in the arts" awards 
ceremony. "He was very approachable. So I just asked him if he'd come play for 
the children," said Jaeger, a commercial real estate developer. 
</P>
<P>
 Perlman stayed to chat with youngsters after his brief concert. He drew gasps 
when he told them he started taking music lessons at the age of 5 and was 
practicing two hours a day by age 7. He drew laughter when 11-year-old Raquel 
Zepeda -- one of those who had serenaded him with their own music -- asked him 
if there was an easier way to hold the violin. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," replied Perlman, demonstrating how silly it would look to try to play by 
holding it in front of his face or behind his head. 
</P>
<P>
 Before leaving, he helped Raquel tune her small violin. And he accepted 
drawings and a small sculpture from Roger Mendoza, 10, and Jessica Ortega, 9, 
on behalf of youngsters from San Pedro Street, Utah Street, 28th Street and 9th 
Street schools who use the arts center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Exposure to music is very important for the kids in this part of town," 
Perlman said. "Music is an international language." 
</P>
<P>
 Perlman's music -- and his friendliness -- earned rave reviews from 
youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 "On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give him a 10," said Hilda Perez, 11, of San Pedro 
Street School. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel Perez, 9, of Utah Street School said: "I liked his music. I like English 
music, all of it."

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; CONGRESS OKS RECORD $8.6-BILLION RELIEF BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Climaxing a day of intense negotiations, Congress approved a record 
$8.6-billion earthquake relief package for Southern California on Friday and 
sent it to President Clinton for his signature. 
</P>
<P>
 "With a little luck, I'll be able to sign this legislation tomorrow," Clinton 
told the California Newspaper Publishers' Assn. convention in a broadcast from 
the White House. "While short-term relief is absolutely necessary, I want to 
assure that we'll be there over the long run as well." 
</P>
<P>
 The House passed the final version of the emergency aid bill Friday evening in 
a 245-65 vote; 124 members missed the roll call on the eve of Congress' 
midwinter break. The Senate had agreed in advance to accept the compromise 
measure worked out earlier in the day by Senate-House negotiators in a 
three-hour conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The final bill retains a Senate-proposed ban on anything more than temporary 
humanitarian aid for illegal immigrants. In a bow to those concerned about 
allowing illegal immigrants to benefit from the aid, the provision will permit 
them to receive only emergency food, medical and shelter assistance for up to 
90 days. 
</P>
<P>
 At the urging of the House, which expressed concern about mistreatment of 
minorities, the bill also contains a provision that reaffirms laws forbidding 
discrimination against residents on the basis of race, ethnic background or 
citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the Senate provision that he sponsored, Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.), said: 
"There are scarce resources available for disaster victims and providing 
long-term housing to someone here illegally is neither fair nor fiscally 
responsible." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Reid's proposal, federal agencies would be required to take reasonable 
steps to determine whether applicants for assistance were lawfully in the 
United States before granting them long-term benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate and House negotiators worked rapidly Friday to reconcile more than 125 
differences in two versions of the bill, finishing early in the afternoon 
despite a winter storm that was severe enough to shut down most of the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Los Angeles) was the only member of the California 
delegation to vote against the bill. Afterward, his staff said that he was 
unavailable for comment. Eight House members from California did not vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast action on the bill was necessary to keep federal disaster funds flowing 
to victims of the Jan. 17 earthquake, which killed at least 57 people and left 
damage estimated as high as $20 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which will receive another $4.7 
billion under the legislation, had been expected to run out of funds next week, 
when Congress is in recess. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill allocates $1.265 billion to the Department of Transportation for 
highway and bridge repairs; $500 million for community development block 
grants, $225 million for housing assistance and $80 million for grants to 
college students whose income and assets were reduced by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill also would permit the federal government to subsidize Small Business 
Administration loans totaling $1.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the measure would give the President a $550-million contingency 
fund for unanticipated disaster relief needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides earthquake aid, the emergency measure provides $1.2 billion for 
Pentagon peacekeeping expenses in Bosnia, Somalia and elsewhere; $685,000 
earmarked for last year's Midwest floods and $315 million to repair a San 
Francisco freeway damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta quake in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The final version of the bill contained spending cuts of $3.25 billion. The 
House had approved cuts of $2.5 billion and the Senate had approved $3.4 
billion. Despite the overwhelming vote in favor of the measure, critics charged 
that it contained unjustified spending. Rep. Donald A. Manzullo (R-Ill.) 
objected to the $10 million for renovation of New York City's Penn Station that 
was tucked away in the measure, along with $1.4 million to fight potato blight 
fungus. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislators also earmarked $300 million in previously approved funds for 
low-income home heating assistance to be spent in parts of the country hardest 
hit by cold weather this winter.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; AGENCY 
WILL WAIVE FEES FOR PETS ADOPTED TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city Department of Animal Regulation will waive fees today for pets 
adopted from its shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 The department is holding Adopt-a-Pet Day to find homes for the large number 
of animals that were captured after running away during the Jan. 17 Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager Gary Olsen reassured owners of pets that were lost after the 
quake and later impounded at the West Valley shelter in Chatsworth. He said the 
animals will be held until they are adopted or their owners claim them. 
Residents adopting pets today will be asked to pay only the $28 state-mandated 
spay-and-neuter deposit and a portion of the dog license fee for city 
residents, Olsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 All unaltered adult dogs and cats adopted by city residents will be spayed or 
neutered Monday by local veterinarians participating in the city's program. The 
pets will be released to their new owners the next day.

 Why the quake was no mere 6.6: Jim White of Los Osos sent along some shocking 
new evidence of how much the earth shifted Jan. 17. It's a map from a Bay Area 
newspaper, which relocated L.A. in Northern California (call it the Northland, 
for short). 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine the delight of disgruntled L.A. residents who had been planning to 
move up there, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt it was this map that prompted the upgrading of the quake to 6.7 by 
seismic experts at Caltech and 6.8 by their counterparts in Golden, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 The temblor's fault line seems to have run through the middle of Death Valley 
and Paso Robles, splitting both. The new town of Death is now a beach resort as 
is Las Vegas, whose golf courses will have some major new sand traps. 
</P>
<P>
 You won't be hearing any more bragging by San Diegans about their climate, 
inasmuch as they now inhabit north-central California. And San Francisco seems 
to have left the state altogether. When L.A. moved in, it must have been too 
much to bear. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Oh, Pahrump! We weren't surprised to receive a copy of Eden Seeker's Catalogue 
in the mail after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper is put out by Greener Pastures Institute, whose founder -- Bill 
Seavey -- lives in Pahrump, Nev. Seavey, whose phone number says it all -- 
1-800-OUT OF LA -- is one of many entrepreneurs seeking to capitalize on the 
disenchantment of Southern Californians. He frequently holds $75-per-person 
seminars in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, Seavey hadn't heard about L.A.'s move into Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 He won't be the only disappointed merchant in what the New Republic's Susan 
Ellicott called the "country-dreamer genre." Others include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Bill Kaysing of Soquel (near Santa Cruz), a former Canoga Park-ite, who puts 
out an "Escape the Rat Race" newsletter that costs $25 per issue. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tom Evons of Bend, Ore., who holds "Escape from L.A." seminars for $29 per 
dreamer. 
</P>
<P>
 * Real estate agent David T. Paul, who recorded the cassette ($7), "How to 
Sell Your Southern California Property When No One's Biting." 
</P>
<P>
 * And Constance See, a psychic on an island off the state of Washington, whose 
business, "City Seekers," can find the ideal town for your aura for $45. Just 
not on her island, which she won't identify.

 A rum fate: A newsletter called The Beam recalls that San Pedro suffered 
little damage in the 1971 Sylmar quake, with the exception of a liquor store 
that went up in flames. The fire was apparently fueled by several broken 
151-proof rum bottles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Which all goes to show," The Beam said, "when either you -- or Mother Nature 
-- messes around with that high proof stuff, there's bound to be trouble." Oh, 
yes -- The Beam is the newsletter for San Pedro's Beacon Hill alcohol 
rehabilitation facility.

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; RIORDAN SEEKS TO USE CITY WORKERS TO RAZE 
QUAKE-DAMAGED BUILDINGS; DEMOLITION: MAYOR AND SOME COUNCIL MEMBERS SAY PRIVATE 
PROGRAM TO CLEAN UP AFTER RIOTS WAS TOO COSTLY AND TOO SLOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles officials may drop plans to pay up to $15 million to private firms 
to oversee the demolition of hundreds of buildings damaged in the earthquake, 
saying that city workers may be able to do the job for less. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan called Friday for public employees to manage the work, 
putting a damper on what one official called a "feeding frenzy" by firms that 
are bidding for the work. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan Administration officials and City Council members said they want to 
reconsider the use of private firms in part because a similar program after the 
riots was too slow and too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to give the city employees the chance to do it," Riordan said in an 
interview. "They did a great job immediately following the earthquake and I met 
with them several times and they convinced me they can do it." 
</P>
<P>
 But the use of private firms is still supported by some City Council members. 
And the Riordan plan could hit a snag because federal regulations might prevent 
the city from getting reimbursement of its expenses from the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency. Riordan aides said they are confident they can get FEMA to 
pay for the work once federal officials see that public employees can do it for 
less. 
</P>
<P>
 In preliminary estimates late Friday, an official in the Department of Public 
Works said the city could oversee demolition for about $6 million, compared to 
the $9 million it would cost to hire private firms. 
</P>
<P>
 In either case, other companies would be hired to do the actual demolition and 
they may have to be paid as much as $60 million more, said Andres Santamaria, 
manager of the program for the Public Works Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of private firms are expected to be hired to handle that work. The 
structures will be torn down, at no cost to owners, to promote the fastest 
possible reconstruction of neighborhoods damaged in the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Debate has grown intense, though, over how to accomplish the job quickly at 
the least cost. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council had been scheduled Friday to award the demolition oversight 
contracts to three partnerships that had been recommended by the Board of 
Public Works. 
</P>
<P>
 But Riordan and his appointees on the board proposed that city staff do the 
work, and the City Council voted to wait a week to get more details on its 
alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said the city should avoid unnecessary expense. "We 
don't want this to become the Full Employment Act for everyone who wants to 
learn to demolish a few buildings," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Board of Public Works President Charles Dickerson said the reconsideration of 
the use of private firms came about partly because of a significant reduction 
in the scope of the work. The board had previously thought that as many as 
10,000 buildings might need to be torn down, but that number has been reduced 
to 1,000. And of those, officials say up to 60% may be razed by their owners, 
leaving only about 400 for the city to remove. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in the mayor's office, which appoints the members of Board of Public 
Works, also said they were concerned about the performance of a private 
partnership that managed demolitions after the 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 A Times investigation last year found that more money, about $6.3 million, had 
been paid to the Los Angeles Community Partnership for management of the riot 
cleanup than to all the firms that had actually demolished buildings and 
recycled rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 The work was supposed to last six months but took twice as long, even though 
less than half the number of buildings projected had to be torn down. 
</P>
<P>
 Firms in the partnership said the delays were mainly caused by building owners 
who took months to decide whether to raze their structures. They said the high 
cost of the work was in large part because they had to plan for demolition of 
many more buildings than actually were torn down. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the companies involved in the Los Angeles Community Partnership 
have joined again to oversee some of the earthquake demolition. The group was 
one of the three recommended by the public works board. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilmen Richard Alatorre, Richard Alarcon and Mike Hernandez argued Friday 
for going ahead with the private contracts to speed up demolition. They 
questioned whether the city's Department of Public Works can handle the job 
without neglecting its normal duties. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to get these things cleared up," Alatorre said. "I think the (city 
employees') regular work would suffer. Something has got to give." 
</P>
<P>
 Alatorre also doubted that FEMA will change its regulations to reimburse the 
city for the cost of the work. The councilman said he backs three partnerships 
recommended by the Board of Public Works. 
</P>
<P>
 Alatorre has ties to several of the firms involved in the partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
 The community partnership group, recommended to oversee cleanup in most of the 
San Fernando Valley, includes the Cordoba Corp. The company once employed the 
councilman's son and is owned by Alatorre's longtime political ally, George 
Pla. 
</P>
<P>
 The partnership recommended to oversee work south of Mulholland Drive includes 
Pacifica Services Inc., owned by Ernest Camacho, Alatorre's onetime campaign 
manager, and The East Los Angeles Community Union (TELACU), which has been a 
financial supporter and ally of the councilman. 
</P>
<P>
 Alatorre said those connections had nothing to do with his support of the 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan Adminstration officials said the question of FEMA reimbursement was 
raised because the agency has already rejected $50 million or more in city 
claims for salaries of employees working on earthquake-related matters.

 A 22-year-old Los Angeles man surrendered to police Friday after he allegedly 
fatally wounded the mother of his 2-month-old son in a dispute over the boy, 
investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Najeeullah turned himself in to homicide detectives after shooting 
Tywanna Davis, 18, Thursday afternoon, said Los Angeles Police Detective Frank 
Bolan.Davis had gone to Najeeullah's apartment in the 1500 block of South St. 
Andrews Place to pick up the child's birth certificate and Social Security 
card, the detective said. 
</P>
<P>
 An argument developed and escalated into a fight and the shooting at 3 p.m., 
Bolan said. Davis was taken to County-USC Medical Center, where she died in 
surgery of a gunshot wound to the chest, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The child, who is now in the custody of Davis' family, was not at the 
apartment when his mother was shot, Bolan said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; PLAN 
UNVEILED TO COUNTER ANTI-IMMIGRANT SENTIMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Latino groups unveiled a wide-ranging plan Friday designed to counter what 
activists call "immigrant-bashing" on the state and national levels. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a call to mobilization," said Armando Navarro, a UC Riverside 
political science professor who helped draft the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't respond, the anti-immigrant hysteria will only get worse," 
Navarro said during a news conference and rally at Olvera Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Activists also made the plan public in cities throughout California, Arizona, 
New Mexico and Texas, as well as in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative is called the "Riverside plan," because it was drafted last 
month during a conference there. The more than 50 participating groups included 
both well-known organizations such as the League of United Latin American 
Citizens and the G.I. Forum and smaller groups such as the Rainbow Coalition of 
New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 The 16-page plan calls on Latino lawmakers and advocacy groups to launch a 
concerted election-year lobbying, education and media campaign against 
"xenophobic attacks" by elected officials, private organizations and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Among their specific goals, the organizers oppose efforts to "militarize" the 
U.S.-Mexico border and strip illegal immigrants of the right to education and 
other social services, while backing initiatives encouraging foreign nationals 
to become U.S. citizens.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: INGLEWOOD; BASKETBALL 
GAME CANCELED BECAUSE OF ROBBERY PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A basketball game between ninth-graders from Inglewood and Santa Monica high 
schools was canceled Friday, two weeks after a pair of Santa Monica High 
basketball players reported being robbed of their Walkman radios in Inglewood 
High's gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys basketball game, scheduled to be held in the Inglewood High gym, was 
canceled because an investigation of the alleged robbery had not been 
completed, said Sandor Rosenfield, an assistant principal at Santa Monica 
High.Rosenfield said the school plans to take part in all its future athletic 
events at Inglewood, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was an isolated incident that could have happened anywhere," Rosenfield 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The robbery occurred Jan. 26 when Santa Monica's junior varsity basketball 
squad played Inglewood High's team in Inglewood. Two Santa Monica high players 
reported that three people followed them into a gymnasium restroom and forced 
them at gunpoint to hand over their radios. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident is being investigated by Inglewood High campus police, who 
declined to comment Friday. Though Santa Monica High's ninth-grade basketball 
game at Inglewood was canceled, varsity and junior varsity games that the two 
schools were scheduled to play at Santa Monica High on Friday were set to go 
ahead as planned.

<P>
 Los Angeles County sheriff's officials said Friday that the gunman fired at a 
22-year-old woman as she and her 25-year-old boyfriend sat in the parking lot 
of El Rancho High School on Feb. 4.The woman was wounded in the right cheek and 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the woman nor her boyfriend, both of whom are deaf, is a gang member, 
and a motive for the shooting has not been determined, Sheriff's Sgt. Pat 
Fallis said. But American Sign Language hand gestures have occasionally been 
misconstrued as gang signs. 
</P>
<P>
 For safety reasons, authorities have not released the identities of the 
couple. 
</P>
<P>
 Fallis said the gunman was one of seven youths who was riding in a pickup 
truck that followed the couple's car into the high school parking lot on the 
night of the shooting. The youth jumped out of the truck and fired several 
rounds at the car's windshield.

L.A. POLICE DENOUNCE ARTICLE ON FATAL SHOOTING; VIOLENCE: STORY CLAIMING 
BULLETS WERE FOUND BENEATH BODY OF WOMAN KILLED ON ROOFTOP IS CALLED 
'REPREHENSIBLE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department on Friday denounced reporting by a local 
newspaper chain as "reckless and reprehensible" and said the publication had 
printed incorrect information about the Dec. 16 shooting of a woman by LAPD 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Gabriel Valley Newspapers, based in West Covina, reported this week 
that investigators had discovered "as many as four 9 mm bullets" beneath the 
fallen body of Sonji Danese Taylor, a 27-year-old woman shot on a hospital 
rooftop. 
</P>
<P>
 In the article, the papers reported that Cyril Wecht, a renowned forensic 
pathologist from Pittsburgh, had said that "four bullets under Taylor's body 
would indicate she was shot while lying down." 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD, which generally refrains from commenting about ongoing 
investigations, issued a press release denying the reports. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been reported that four mushroomed bullets were discovered beneath 
Taylor's body, suggesting that she had been shot in the back four times while 
lying on the ground," the LAPD press release stated. "That report is factually 
incorrect, as no such evidence exists. It should be noted that (the) reporters 
chose to proceed with this report despite being advised by members of the Los 
Angeles Police Department that their speculation was factually incorrect." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources told the Los Angeles Times that although one slug was found in 
Taylor's clothing, none was found on the ground beneath her. Wecht, when 
interviewed by The Times, stressed that his conclusion that Taylor was shot 
while lying on the ground was based on information supplied to him by a 
reporter from the Valley Newspapers, not on official investigative documents. 
The documents do not indicate what position Taylor was in when she was shot, 
Wecht said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hope Frazier, editor of the three San Gabriel Valley newspapers, defended the 
story. "I stand by every word we wrote," she said. "The context in the story is 
more than careful and more than accurate." 
</P>
<P>
 Frazier said the article was the product of painstaking work by reporters and 
editors. "I think we've done a hell of a good job," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the unusually public fracas indicated, the Taylor case is an enormously 
sensitive subject for the LAPD, in part because it has reminded many observers 
of the 1979 shooting of Eulia Love, who was fatally wounded by LAPD officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD, Los Angeles County district attorney's office and the FBI are 
probing the Taylor shooting. Among other things, their inquiries are attempting 
to determine why two officers fired so many shots -- nine in all -- and why 
seven struck Taylor in the back. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the shots fired by Sgt. Michael Long and Officer Craig Liedahl, four were 
recovered from Taylor's body, according to the coroner's report. 
</P>
<P>
 Another was found in her clothing, the report said. The report makes no 
mention of any bullets found on the ground beneath her, nor does it explain 
what happened to the other four slugs. Sources close to the case say 
investigators have focused most of their attention on a shot to the back of 
Taylor's left shoulder. That bullet was "mushroomed," or flattened out. 
Mushrooming could have been caused by that bullet hitting a bone, but it also 
could indicate that Taylor was shot while on the ground, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference Friday, Taylor's mother, Geri Dixon, said she believes 
that police officers killed her daughter without justification. "I think she 
was just killed because she was a black woman," Dixon said.

A PICTURE OF FREEDOM; LINCOLN POSTCARD THAT KEPT A CHILD'S HOPE ALIVE INSPIRES 
PRIZE ESSAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Michelle Caswell has grown up on stories of her mother's dreary childhood in 
postwar communist Bulgaria. But it was not until last fall that the high school 
senior heard the tale about the Lincoln postcard. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle, a 17-year-old from Orem, Utah, had decided to enter an essay contest 
with a $2,500 scholarship prize. The subject was that tried and true one, 
assigned to legions of students of every generation: What Abraham Lincoln meant 
to her and America. 
</P>
<P>
 It turns out that in the Caswell family, Lincoln is considerably more than 
just a faded face on a penny. Instead of groaning at the thought of helping her 
daughter with a patriotic essay, Julia Caswell exclaimed: "Oh my God! I need to 
talk to you," and sat Michelle down for a two-hour tete-a-tete. By the time it 
was over, Michelle was in tears, but she knew what she was going to write 
about. 
</P>
<P>
 "Julia's first-grade teacher had visited the United States," Michelle wrote in 
the four-paragraph essay. "He gave each child a picture (postcard) of the 
Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C. This teacher was arrested the next day; but 
Julia kept her picture of Mr. Lincoln and carried it with her always." 
</P>
<P>
 For a little girl straining for a freedom denied her homeland, the Lincoln 
image became a consolation and inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Julia's head would throb with pain from studying, or fear from 
worshiping in a Greek Orthodox church, Julia would pull out her small picture 
and cry. She told Mr. Lincoln of all her troubles, and promised to come to him 
one day. Many nights Julia fell asleep in her tears, clutching the small 
photograph." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Julia Caswell flashed a proud smile as she and her husband, Tom, 
listened to their daughter read her winning essay at the Huntington Library in 
San Marino, standing at the entrance of one of the largest exhibitions ever 
devoted to the life and achievements of Lincoln. The Caswells had indeed come 
to Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
 The contest judges said that as soon as they read Michelle's essay, none of 
the other 5,000 entries stood a chance. They gave her praise, a $2,500 check 
and a private tour of the exhibit of letters, documents and personal 
possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager speaks with the fervor of a first-generation American, brimming 
with disdain for a communism that no longer exists. "Anytime I hear anything 
about communism I get upset and mad," Michelle said shortly after receiving her 
check, awarded by the Farmers Insurance Group of Companies, which sponsored the 
contest in conjunction with the Huntington exhibit. She will spend the money on 
her first year at Brigham Young University. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Julia Caswell has written an unpublished book about growing up in 
Bulgaria and had recounted countless episodes of her childhood, she had not 
talked about the Lincoln postcard. It was, she explained Friday, very personal, 
and only when the essay contest arose did she feel it was time to speak of it. 
</P>
<P>
 She remembers that her mother told her to give the postcard back to her 
teachers. "She said, 'We will get in trouble.' I kept it under my pillow," said 
Caswell, who teaches Bulgarian at a training center for Mormon missionaries. 
"There were a lot of things I needed to share and the little Lincoln card was 
what I shared them with." 
</P>
<P>
 She fantasized that the long-dead President would emancipate her country and 
whispered things to him that she dared tell no one. 
</P>
<P>
 She managed to escape Bulgaria with her family when she was 16 and came to the 
United States in 1966 on a scholarship to Brigham Young. 
</P>
<P>
 She left the Lincoln postcard in Bulgaria.

AL MARTINEZ: TRYING TO GET THE KIDS BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Carlos Morrison is a homeless poet who wanders the streets of Beverly 
Hills in a purple suit, pushing a shopping cart loaded with his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything he owns is in that cart, including a lot of his poetry, much of 
which hangs over the side in letters large enough for everyone to read. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Drive is his beat. Morrison sleeps in the basement of a building not 
far from Larry Parker's 24 Hour Diner and the Mocha Cave coffeehouse, where he 
receives telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 He knows most of the merchants on the street by their first names and spends 
time talking to them about things in general, like God and nature. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, that purple outfit he wears with such flair, complete with a purple 
Zoro hat, was sold to him by a clothing store called the Underground that let 
him pay it off a little at a time. That's how much they trust him. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the time Morrison is out on the street in front of these places 
reciting bits of his poetry. 
</P>
<P>
 One of my favorites is, "I'm living in the street/Trying to be very 
discreet/Trying to be clean and neat/Trying to smell exceedingly sweet/Trying 
to get ice cream to eat." 
</P>
<P>
 Not exactly "Sonnets from the Portuguese," but . . . well . . . honest. And 
short. 
</P>
<P>
 About $40 a day is dropped into the plastic cup attached to his cart, which he 
uses to live on. Another $600 a month that he gets from the state goes to 
helping out his five kids in foster homes. That's what I want to talk about 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Morrison has two passions: writing poetry and trying to get his kids back. 
They've been in foster homes for about six years now, ever since their mother 
abandoned them and he hit the streets. They range in ages from 7 to 15. 
</P>
<P>
 He's been trying almost ever since to convince the courts that he's decent and 
reliable enough to raise his own children. They've told him over and over 
again, get a place to live and you'll get them back. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is, Morrison can't rent a place on what he makes reciting poetry, 
and he's loathe to abandon the muse. Even if he managed to sell some poems, he 
still probably couldn't afford to raise five children. 
</P>
<P>
 I know published poets who've lived on gruel most of their careers because 
they can't afford pork chops. You almost never see fat poets. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrison's lawyer, an understanding guy named Benjamin Campos, has leveled 
with his client by telling him he's got to give up the street before any court 
in the land is going to award him custody of the kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a bright man you can talk to," Campos said the other day. "He sure 
impressed the judge he was dealing with for two or three years. When she 
retired, he went to her retirement party and brought her a dozen roses." 
</P>
<P>
 The court has waived parenting classes and other requirements for Morrison, 
Campos says. It all boils down to that one issue: give up the street life, get 
a job and get a home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a place once," Morrison said the other day at the Mocha Cave, "but they 
still wouldn't give me the kids. They said it didn't have a heater." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Morrison is an ex-fighter and ex-steelworker. I wrote about him two years ago 
when he hung out in front of Nat 'n Al's Deli. He moved when other homeless 
people began crowding in. Poets like to work alone. They're funny that way. 
</P>
<P>
 I figured he was just jiving me about wanting his kids, but then he'd call 
from time to time and his message was always the same: Help me get my children. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrison sees them often and loves to buy them things. When I was with him the 
other day he was wearing four watches he's going to give them next time they're 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 He had them for a long weekend once and spent half his monthly state income 
feeding and housing them and taking them to Universal Studios. "It was a swell 
time," he says, standing on a corner near Charleville and South Beverly, 
watching the Lincolns roll by. 
</P>
<P>
 The guy isn't perfect. He's done County Jail time for battery against a woman, 
but claims she hit him first. He wouldn't've touched her otherwise. On the plus 
side, he doesn't drink, smoke or use drugs . . . and he loves those kids of his 
with a passion. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know that he'll ever get them back, but at least it's good to see 
someone who finally wants to accept responsibility for his children, even 
though his own life has gone halfway to hell. 
</P>
<P>
 There are about 100,000 homeless in L.A. County and most of them will die on 
the streets. I like to think the Poet of the Pavement won't be one of them. 
Another bard once said hope waits just around the corner. It's up to Morrison 
to turn that corner. He's got his kids to think about.

ABORTION ACTIVISTS PUT ASIDE RIVALRY; PROTESTS: ALLIES AND FOES ARE TRYING TO 
TURN CIVIL WAR INTO CIVIL DISCOURSE. THEY HAVE FORMED A NATIONAL ORGANIZATION 
CALLED THE COMMON GROUND NETWORK FOR LIFE AND CHOICE.

 Loretto Wagner remembered the lines of angry people on both sides of the 
street confronting her as she turned the corner onto Constitution Avenue during 
a March for Life in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just got to thinking, I don't want this to turn into a civil war. We're all 
human beings," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Peggy Green, an activist for abortion rights, the "stereotypes fell to 
pieces" when she heard a woman who was a victim of incest and child abuse speak 
of abortion as another instance of violence against a women's body. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't just look at this woman and degrade this woman's experience," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Wagner and Green are among a growing number of staunch advocates on the 
abortion issue around the country who are putting aside old hatreds to find a 
shared faith in humanity. 
</P>
<P>
 Buoyed by dialogues in cities such as Buffalo, N.Y., Cleveland, Milwaukee, San 
Francisco and Denver, advocates for turning the abortion debate from civil war 
into civil discourse have formed a national organization called the Common 
Ground Network for Life and Choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Away from the often angry rhetoric of abortion politics, many Common Ground 
participants have turned to the spiritual realm for a way to talk to one 
another as human beings. 
</P>
<P>
 The co-directors of the Washington headquarters of the network are Mary 
Jacksteit, a Presbyterian laywoman, and Sister Adrienne Kaufmann, a Benedictine 
nun. 
</P>
<P>
 If you believe in the biblical principle to love one's neighbor as oneself, 
Jacksteit said, "You have sort of a responsibility to respect the humanness of 
individuals, and not dehumanize the individual." 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufmann said her participation is based on her belief that every person is 
created in God's image. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we treat another person as if they were a reflection of the devil almost 
. . . theologically, I think, we are denying part of God's creation." 
</P>
<P>
 High ideals come at a price. A willingness to engage in dialogue makes 
participants traitors to the cause in the eyes of some hardened allies. And 
though a 1993 Gallup Poll showed a majority of Americans characterize abortion 
activists on both sides as intolerant, the peacemakers are criticized for 
deflating stereotypes of their opponents as "baby killers" or people who have 
no concern for children after they are born. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somehow, I became the great credibility giver in the sky," said Wagner, 
former president of Missouri Citizens for Life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of my friends were outraged and appalled. It was very, very painful for 
me," said B.J. Isaacson-Jones, head of one of the nation's largest abortion 
clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most common thing I heard is, 'You're painting these people as reasonable 
people, B.J.' I would say, 'Yes, they are reasonable people."' 
</P>
<P>
 Like others in the dialogue, Isaacson-Jones, who four years ago added an 
adoption agency to her St. Louis clinic, said she believes the two sides "can 
concentrate on the real enemies" such as ignorance, violence and 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you sit down and talk with people from the other side, you can no longer 
look at yourself in the mirror and hate that other person, said Green, a member 
of San Francisco Common Ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the tools that you have for furthering your ideals out of hatred go 
away," Green said. "I have to be willing to see the love in the other people." 
</P>
<P>
 In Missouri, when legislation to aid crack-addicted mothers was held hostage 
by people on both sides of the abortion debate who feared additional riders, 
she and Andrew Puzder, the attorney who wrote Missouri's restrictive abortion 
law that was upheld by the Supreme Court, helped work through such fears and 
lobbied for its passage. 
</P>
<P>
 In Buffalo, where a dialogue was started in response to two weeks of mass 
demonstrations last spring, the Rev. Stan Bratton discovered both sides shared 
a concern for reducing unwanted pregnancies. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I have come to see is that we set up these immense conflicts that we get 
into and focus on each other and ignore the problem," said Bratton, executive 
director of the Buffalo Council of Churches. "For many of the activists, 90% of 
the things people can work on together." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, Bratton said, is "Right in the middle, we have this kind of huge 
mountain." 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to combine our resources and our energy to benefit women and their 
children," Wagner said. "I don't think we can stand back and deprive ourselves 
of the opportunity to at least better some of the human condition."

POPE TO FIGHT RESOLUTION TO ALLOW GAYS TO MARRY; VATICAN: PONTIFF SPEAKS OUT 
AGAINST EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT'S NON-BINDING MEASURE, WHICH WOULD ALSO GIVE 
HOMOSEXUALS THE RIGHT TO ADOPT CHILDREN. 'WE CAN'T LET THIS PASS,' HE SAYS.

 Pope John Paul said Thursday that the Roman Catholic Church would fight a 
European Parliament resolution proposing that homosexual couples be allowed to 
marry and adopt children. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't let this pass," the Pope said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pope departed from a prepared address to bishops attending a Vatican 
seminar on the problems of the family to make a clear reference to Tuesday's 
controversial resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Reading the prepared part of his text, the Pope said society could not achieve 
authentic progress without safeguarding the unity of the family. 
</P>
<P>
 "More and more public authorities who are alert and far-sighted are becoming 
aware of this elementary civil and political truth," the Pope said, reading his 
text. 
</P>
<P>
 He then added in unscripted remarks: "Not all of them (public authorities), 
however, as we have seen. We have seen and we must react. We can't let this 
pass." 
</P>
<P>
 It was not clear what the church would do to fight Tuesday's resolution, which 
was drawn up by German Green deputy Claudia Roth and approved at the parliament 
in Strasbourg by 159 votes to 96. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, the Vatican issued a document to contest moves to give 
homosexuals equal rights, particularly in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 That document said homosexuals could legitimately be discriminated against in 
employment, housing and the adoption of children. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest resolution, which is not binding on the 12 European Union states, 
also calls for an end to the prosecution of homosexuality as a public nuisance 
or gross indecency, and to discrimination in criminal, civil, contract and 
commercial law. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pope spoke a day after the Vatican newspaper condemned the resolution in 
an editorial that said "no man can take the place of a natural mother." The 
newspaper said children adopted by homosexuals would bear the scars of 
suffering and frustration.

 A religious education congress sponsored by the Los Angeles Roman Catholic 
Archdiocese expects to draw more than 20,000 people to the Anaheim Convention 
Center next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Called "Live the Promise," the Feb. 17-20 meeting is called the largest 
convocation of its type, featuring an energetic exchange of ideas at more than 
200 workshops in English and Spanish and talks by more than 140 speakers and 
theologians from around the globe on topics such as education, spirituality and 
personal growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before it begins, the congress has drawn fire from numerous Catholics, 
including Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, over a scheduled speaker, former priest and 
abortion advocate Daniel Maguire. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, the opening day of the congress, is reserved for 10,000 ninth- 
through 12th-graders from Catholic and public high schools who will choose from 
workshops including "Me, Myself and My Sexuality," conducted by Bishop Patrick 
Ziemann, of the Diocese of Santa Rosa. Mahony will celebrate Mass for the 
youths. 
</P>
<P>
 Adult participants may be interested in two presentations by author Thomas 
Moore. The former psychotherapist and religion professor, the best-selling 
"Soul Mates," will speak on "The Soulful Educator" at 3 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. 
Friday and on "The Soulful Practice of Religion and Spirituality" at 10 a.m. to 
11:30 a.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 It is "extraordinarily difficult" to be a soulful educator in a society that 
pays lip service to education but undervalues it, Moore said in an interview 
from San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main thing is to realize that education does not mean to train or inform, 
but to provide certain types of experiences that deeper initiate us into what 
it means to be a human being, a part of society, and what it means to live with 
meaning and fruitfulness." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond education, he said, "It is awfully important for us as a society to 
recover a sense of sacredness in every single aspect of our life" and "not to 
focus on differences" in our religious experiences. 
</P>

SCHOOL BOARD RECONSIDERS BAN AGAINST WEARING OF SIKH DAGGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 School officials are trying to decide whether a dagger worn by members of a 
Hindu sect are a religious symbol that should be allowed on campus or a weapon 
that should be banned. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the school board ruled against what people of the Sikh faith call 
a kirpan. On Tuesday, the board agreed to reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram Singh of San Jose, a Sikh spokesman, has been given two weeks to show 
school officials a kind of compromise dagger -- one that meets religious 
standards but cannot also be used as a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Sikh faith, which originated in northern India, usually wear 
the daggers under their clothing. Many are dulled and worn in sheathes strapped 
to their bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 In Livingston, a farm town in Merced County, five students have refused to 
come to school unless they are allowed to wear kirpans.  
</P>
<P>
 School board member Vernon Boyd said the previous ruling came after the board 
was shown a six-inch blade worn outside a student's clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Students of the Sikh faith have worn kirpans without incident for many years 
throughout the United States, Canada and England, Singh said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 people of the Sikh faith attend schools in Livingston, but only 10 
have been baptized and wear kirpans. Since kirpans were banned at school, five 
started wearing religious medallions instead.

MUSLIMS AND CHRISTIANS SHARE FASTING TRADITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY B. STAMMER, TIMES RELIGION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 February begins a time of reflection and fasting by Christians and Muslims 
throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
 While Muslims observe the month of Ramadan, Christians observe the 40 days of 
Lent leading up to Easter. 
</P>
<P>
 In both cases, the observances mark a time of fasting, self-reflection and 
introspection even though the origins of the observances are quite different. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramadan commemorates the Prophet Muhammad's receiving of revelations from the 
archangel Gabriel. Lent is often seen as a pious identification with Jesus and 
the 40 days that Christian Scriptures say he spent in the wilderness before he 
began his active ministry. 
</P>
<P>
 The month of Ramadan is one of the most important observances in Islam and is 
one of the so-called Five Pillars of Islam. During Ramadan, all Muslims with 
the exception of the very young, the very aged, the pregnant and those who are 
traveling, are supposed to fast daily, abstain from sex and avoid all 
wrongdoing from sunrise to sunset. 
</P>
<P>
 After sunset, Muslims break the 12-hour fast together and meet for prayers. 
Typically, they try to read the entire Koran -- the Islamic holy book -- during 
this time. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Ramadan is a lunar month -- the ninth month of the Islamic calendar -- 
it begins on the sighting of the first crescent after the new moon. Depending 
on where the sighting takes place, Muslims expected the observance would begin 
either on Friday or today. The Islamic Center of Southern California designated 
Feb. 11 as the first day of Ramadan based on their calculations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Christian observance of Lent begins on Ash Wednesday, Feb. 16, in Western 
Christianity, and ends with the observance of Good Friday, commemorating the 
Crucifixion of Jesus. In some churches, fasting is required. Roman Catholics 
are asked not to eat meat on Ash Wednesday and all Fridays during Lent. 
</P>
<P>
 In most Christian churches with a liturgical tradition -- particularly 
Anglican (Episcopalian), Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Lutheran -- as 
well as many others, the 40 days of Lent is a penitential season of confession, 
amendment of life, prayer, study, increased alms giving, charitable service and 
other spiritual exercises.

CONTINUING OUTRAGE OF TAILHOOK; WHISTLE-BLOWER IS OUT, ALTHOUGH HER ABUSERS AND 
ADM. KELSO ESCAPE THE AX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The woman who had the courage to confront the Navy and report the outrageous 
1991 Tailhook sex scandal once against appears to be the victim of the 
insidiousness of sexual harassment. In a letter of resignation to the Navy, Lt. 
Paula Coughlin said the physical attacks on her at the Tailhook convention and 
"the covert attacks on me that followed have stripped me of my ability to 
serve." 
</P>
<P>
 That the Navy did so little to stop such continuing abuse is all the more 
maddening considering that no serious consequences were suffered by any of the 
men directly involved in the abuse. Pentagon investigators concluded that 83 
women were assaulted at the Tailhook convention in Las Vegas, during which 
scores of women were forced to run a gantlet of drunken aviators. 
</P>
<P>
 And the process of justice apparently was subverted by the Navy's top admiral. 
A military judge dismissed the last three cases against Navy men involved in 
the Tailhook affair on the grounds that Adm. Frank B. Kelso tried to cover up 
his knowledge of the 1991 incident and to manipulate the initial investigative 
process to shield himself from blame -- all of which Kelso denies. The judge 
dismissed charges against three aviators who contended Kelso's actions tainted 
their cases. In a separate action, the last Tailhook case, against a Marine 
aviator, was dismissed last week. So out of 140 Tailhook cases, no one was 
court-martialed (about 50 men received administrative discipline). A secretary 
of the Navy resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, sadly and in the bitterest of ironies, Coughlin is leaving while 
officers like Kelso hang on. So much for officers and gentlemen. Coughlin's 
departure sends a chilling message to women -- but one that could be 
ameliorated by Kelso's departure.

GIVING THE RASCALS A REAL FIGHT; THE IMPORTANCE OF CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Indignation at the existence of a "ruling class" of de facto senators- and 
representatives-for-life has fueled a nationwide term-limits movement aimed at 
elected officials -- first in state legislatures and more recently in Congress. 
The passage of Proposition 140 has limited the terms of California's 
legislators. In the state of Washington, Initiative 573 was to have had the 
same effect on that state's U.S. senators and representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, however, U.S. District Judge William L. Dwyer ruled that 
Initiative 573 was invalid. The U.S. Constitution does not impose term limits, 
and only by an amendment to the Constitution, Judge Dwyer's opinion stated, can 
limits be imposed. The ruling applies only to the state of Washington, but its 
implications extend to and beyond the states where similar term-limit measures 
have been enacted or are pending. In due course it will reach the docket of the 
U.S. Supreme Court, where, given the clarity of the Constitution on this 
matter, the ruling is almost certain to be upheld. 
</P>
<P>
 DAUNTING TASK: At that point, backers of term limits for federal legislators 
will face amending the Constitution, a task that the Founding Fathers 
deliberately made difficult. If support for federal term limits remains high, 
proponents should eventually succeed. There are two reasons the inevitable 
delay may be beneficial. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the opponents of term limits have argued that this change would make 
government less, rather than more, responsive to the citizenry as well as more 
susceptible to corruption. The opponents may be wrong, but we need not 
speculate for too long. Results will soon be coming in from the 15 states that 
have imposed term limits. Those states may be seen as laboratories whose 
experiments will provide invaluable data for the coming debate about the more 
momentous federal change. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, with term limits now seriously postponed, throwing the rascals out by 
electing their opponents remains the voters' best defense. Unfortunately, 
campaign financing law heavily favors incumbents over opponents, and, needless 
to say, most incumbents like that. 
</P>
<P>
 HOUSE CLEANING: But representatives who are serious about wanting to "clean 
the House" have the means at hand. H.R. 823, a campaign reform bill drafted by 
Rep. John Bryant (D-Tex.), would reform lobby disclosure laws and restrict the 
gifts and miscellaneous freebies that lobbyists provide our lawmakers. The bill 
has loopholes we would like to see eliminated, notably one that provides an 
exception to the ban on gifts from lobbyists if the gifts arise from "personal 
friendship." (Some deep-pocket lobbyists have never seen a lawmaker they didn't 
want to befriend.) But amendments have been offered to close some of the 
loopholes, and on balance this bill would do much to halt the sale of 
legislators to the highest campaign-funding bidder. 
</P>
<P>
 If and when the Constitution is amended to limit congressional terms, this 
reform would be the best possible complement to the amendment. Until then, it 
is the best possible alternative.

COMMUTER FLYING MADE SAFER; FAA WILL MANDATE TRAINING AIMED AT REDUCING 
PILOT-RELATED ACCIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For airline passengers accustomed to the comforts and convenience of modern 
jet travel, hopscotching on a cramped turboprop -- the typical passenger plane 
of America's commuter airlines -- may seem like choosing the luggage 
compartment over first class. Even so, as fierce competition causes major 
airlines to stop flying to many areas, travelers increasingly are turning to 
regional commuter airliners -- noise and bumps notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year commuter planes, defined as passenger aircraft with fewer than 60 
seats, carried 51 million people, or about 12% of the nation's air passengers 
-- up from 11 million since deregulation of the airline industry in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Government statistics show that over the last 15 years the number of accidents 
involving these planes dropped dramatically. In fact, 1993 was the 
second-safest year on record for commuter planes, although flying hours nearly 
doubled over the same period. However, the rate of commuter plane accidents is 
about five times that of larger airliners. 
</P>
<P>
 As testimony before a congressional subcommittee revealed this week, the 
overwhelming majority of those accidents, including the crash of a Northwest 
Airlink flight that killed 18 near Hibbing, Minn., last December, can be 
attributed to shortcomings in pilot judgment and training. 
</P>
<P>
 At Wednesday's hearing, Federal Aviation Administrator David R. Hinson 
announced that his agency will strengthen pilot safety and training standards, 
particularly for those pilots who fly planes that carry fewer than 30 
passengers. From now on, those pilots must take refresher training on flight 
simulators every six months. 
</P>
<P>
 That should ease the safety problem. So will new policies that address 
communication between flight crews and aircraft dispatchers, who alert pilots 
to safety factors such as weather and runway conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Implementation of new policies at the FAA typically moves slowly. 
Transportation Secretary Federico Pena should prod the FAA to adopt the 
standards quickly -- bureaucratic noise and bumps notwithstanding.

QUAKE WATCH; A POOR RATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Standard & Poor's Corp. has taken a new look at California and changed its 
long-term rating outlook from stable to negative. The credit rating firm says 
the downgrading reflects the continuing deterioration in the state's cash 
position and the bleak budgetary view for 1994.Once again, an operating deficit 
is expected, with no deficit reduction in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 What the S&P action means, among other things, is that buyers of the state's 
bonds are likely to demand a higher return on their investment. Gov. Pete 
Wilson, who wants to put a bond issue on the June ballot to pay for the state's 
share of earthquake repairs, should take note. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson favors going the bond route as a way to avoid any temporary rise in 
taxes. But a bond is a debt. The interest paid on a bond and the return of 
principal can come only from state revenues, which are derived from taxes or 
user fees. A 20-year bond simply obscures the source of repayment while 
shifting much of the debt burden to a future generation. That may be the safest 
thing to do politically. But in this case it is clearly not the fiscally 
responsible thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Short-term selective tax increases of a few cents a gallon on gasoline and a 
quarter-cent on the sales tax would give state and local governments the funds 
they need to repair earthquake damage to public facilities and retrofit others 
to withstand future quakes. Certainly bonds have their place in providing for 
many long-term needs. But the only fiscally sensible way to cover quake-related 
emergency costs is on a pay-as-you-go basis.

VIETNAM TRADE EMBARGO LIFTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1975, the United States lost the military and political wars in Vietnam. On 
Feb. 3 she lost the moral war when President Clinton lifted the U.S. trade 
embargo against the Communist regime of Vietnam. In the end, it is fitting that 
a draft-dodging American President should make this ignominious loss complete 
and close a shameful chapter of American history. 
</P>

of the Republic of South Vietnam.

</P>
<P>
 The lifting of the Vietnamese trade embargo was wrong; it was done more for 
corporate gain than for any humanitarian reason. Why should the Vietnamese 
government cooperate with the U.S. in resolving the POW/MIA issue now? Ever 
since the Paris peace talks the Vietnamese government has gained every major 
concession while yielding very little. As a Vietnam veteran, I find it 
offensive that lining the pockets of the greedy takes precedence over resolving 
the POW/MIA issue. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 It is quite understandable that families of MIA/POWs still grieve and wonder 
what happened to their loved ones more than 20 years ago in Indochina. Has that 
not been the fate of innumerable families through the ages who lost sons to 
equally innumerable wars, and who can only grieve at the tomb of the unknown 
soldier? Grief is grief and must be respected. 
</P>
<P>
 To turn the issue into a political football is another matter. It smacks of 
hypocrisy and opportunism on the part of politicians and all those who have 
been making a handsome living by creating what by now must be an industry that 
exploits the sorrow and hopes of those families. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't believe we asked for a "full accounting" from the Germans, Japanese or 
Koreans at the close of hostilities in those wars. I wonder what the American 
government's response would be if the grieving relatives of the dead Iraqi 
soldiers that were bulldozed under the desert sands by American forces at the 
end of the Gulf War demanded a "full accounting" as to the whereabouts of their 
MIAs?

ZOO RENOVATION PRIORITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The dispute described in "Dogfight at the Zoo" (Jan. 30) is predictable at a 
zoo whose dated facilities will require more than $100 million to modernize but 
has only $25 million in bond money to begin the process. Our disappointment 
with your article is that it emphasizes the dispute and says little about the 
steps being taken to resolve it or about what has been done already to upgrade 
facilities. (It does report the tremendous strides taken over the last three 
years "in improving safety and sanitation standards for (the zoo's) animals, 
according to evaluations by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.") 
</P>
<P>
 Although the existing priorities were established after a series of meetings 
seeking public input, and were designed at least in part to take advantage of 
the Greater Los Angeles Zoo Assn.'s anticipated ability to raise money for 
appealing projects, everyone has agreed to consider reordering the priorities. 
The study commissioned by Mayor Richard Riordan and City Council President John 
Ferraro should produce a workable approach. 
</P>
<P>
 The article omits many steps taken or approved to repair and upgrade the zoo 
without the first cent of Proposition A money. A $1.2 million improvement in 
the elephant facility is near completion, and the zoo has recently made repairs 
to the quarters for the marmoset colony, the snow leopards, the Indian rhinos, 
the sea lions, the hippos, the gorillas, the chimpanzees, orangutans, bears and 
goats and sheep. Also completed in 1993 were a children's play area, the new 
Tiger Falls exhibit, and other facilities improvements. GLAZA provided 
substantial funding for a number of these projects. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the elephant exhibit and holding area, 1994 projects include 
the gelada exhibit, a necropsy and hospital holding area, a holding area for 
the World of Birds show, the oryx yard, veterinary staff offices, the gorilla 
holding area, play area restrooms, and a giraffe barn. The zoo badly needs both 
a new polar bear and penguin exhibit and new chimpanzee exhibit and holding 
area. Between private donations and some portion of the Proposition A bond 
money, we expect to be able to accomplish both. 
</P>
<P>
 We can't expect a 21st-Century zoo if we spend all of the Proposition A money 
just to repair a mid-20th-Century facility. 
</P>

<P>
 When Los Angeles voters approved Proposition A's $25 million for L.A. Zoo 
improvements, they had every reason to believe the money would go toward better 
living conditions for the animals. We would like to commend The Times for your 
article, which brought to the public's attention the behind-the-scenes drama 
regarding this matter. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in the L.A. Zoo's history, it has received a lump sum of 
$25 million with which it can truly make a difference in the lives of the 
animals housed there -- many who are suffering from inadequate shelter from the 
rain and cold, others who must bathe in filthy watering holes, and still others 
who are forced to live under cramped, substandard conditions. Instead, however, 
the zoo director has drawn up a list of expenditures which are primarily 
cosmetic changes designed to benefit people and, supposedly, boost attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 We applaud the zookeepers and curators who have persuaded Riordan and Ferraro 
to take a closer look at the spending "priorities." Only when zoo officials 
make the animals a priority will they be able to bask in the glory of improved 
public perception and increased attendance.

 In my letter of Feb. 3, two sentences were accidentally word-processed into 
confusion.The letter should have read: "In fact, Sen. Barbara Boxer, Rep. Henry 
Waxman, and 16 of their liberal California colleagues wrote to Gov. Pete Wilson 
demanding that he buckle under to EPA demands, even though that would result in 
21,000 lost jobs. If the governor refused to go along with the EPA and its 
Democrat boosters, California would lose $1 billion in highway funding that is 
due the state. Either way, California would lose."

GRETZKY HAS THE ANSWER; HOCKEY: KING CENTER SCORES TWO GOALS, ASSISTS ON THE 
OTHERS IN 5-3 VICTORY AFTER DUCKS MAKE HIM A VERBAL TARGET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks learned a lesson of the Don't-Tug-on-Superman's-Cape variety 
Friday night, when Wayne Gretzky made them pay for some extremely unwise words. 
</P>
<P>
 With all the modesty a man can muster when he owns 60 NHL records and has just 
moved two goals closer to his 61st, Gretzky spoke the plain, simple truth after 
the Kings' 5-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, I guess people just never learn that these kind of things kind of 
push me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky scored two goals and assisted on the Kings' other three in front of a 
sellout crowd of 17,174 at Anaheim Arena. His 792nd and 793rd goals leave him 
eight shy of Gordie Howe's record of 801. And he could have had a couple more. 
He hit the goal post in the first period, and Duck goalie Guy Hebert stopped 
him on a breakaway in the third. 
</P>
<P>
 King Coach Barry Melrose shook his head after thanking the Ducks and Tony 
Tavares, the club president, for the comments that lent an assist to the Kings' 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe there are still people in the NHL who would challenge Wayne 
Gretzky," Melrose said. "I just can't believe it. I hope everyone does. I hope 
everyone in the league rips him." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks have talked big about the Kings all week, saying that "five-on-five" 
they think they are a better team, but the words that got to Gretzky came from 
Tavares, who said Gretzky gets preferential treatment from officials -- that he 
"cries all the time" and "has influenced more calls than any other player 
probably in the history of sports." 
</P>
<P>
 And the Ducks' Todd Ewen said Gretzky is more likely to win the "Whiner Byng," 
than the Lady Byng -- the trophy given to the NHL player who best exemplifies 
gentlemanly conduct and playing ability. 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky saw the comments Friday morning, and after he told King owner Bruce 
McNall about it, McNall knew what everybody but the Ducks seemed to. 
</P>
<P>
 "Uh-oh, they're in for a long night," McNall said. "I didn't think (Tavares) 
meant anything by it, but anything that can get Wayne pumped up is great." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Gretzky: "I'm very surprised at Mr. Tavares' comments. . . . They were 
pretty much uncalled for. It kind of lit a fire underneath me today and I was 
ready to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt his comments were totally uncalled for and very unprofessional for the 
president of a hockey club. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they learned a very valuable lesson tonight that you do your talking 
on the ice." 
</P>
<P>
 Jari Kurri scored also scored twice, and Kelly Hrudey made 46 saves 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very big game, and who else but Wayne Gretzky rose to the occasion 
again for about the 1,000th time, showing once again he's the greatest ever to 
play the game," Hrudey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks -- who had three potential goals ruled no-goal -- cut the lead to 
4-3 in the third period on Bobby Dollas' slap shot from the left point at 9:52. 
</P>
<P>
 But they couldn't tie it, and Gretzky scored the clincher into an empty net 
from just beyond his own blue line at 18:48. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings led, 2-0, in the first period when Gretzky scored one goal and 
assisted on Mike Donnelly's goal. But the Ducks tied the score with two rare 
power-play goals by Shaun Van Allen and Bob Corkum. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings jumped back ahead in the second behind two goals from Kurri, both of 
them assisted by Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 57 seconds into the period, Gretzky skated down the right wing boards, 
spotted Kurri through a crowd and passed the puck to him in the opposite 
circle. Kurri lifted the puck high on Hebert for a 3-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Kings, they declined all opportunities to criticize the Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd be stupid not to respect your opponents -- or say anything about them 
in the press," Melrose said.

PAVIN BLOWS INTO THE LEAD; GOLF: FORMER UCLA STAR SHOOTS A 64 IN THE WIND AND 
HOLDS A THREE-STROKE ADVANTAGE OVER COUPLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ROBLEDO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It didn't take Corey Pavin long to sort out his mixed feelings after shooting 
a seven-under-par 64 Friday at Riviera Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Pavin said it might have been the best round of his life, considering the 
difficulty of the course under cool and windy conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 At 11-under-par 131, he has a three-stroke lead over Fred Couples, who shot 
his second 67, through 36 holes of the $1-million Nissan Los Angeles Open. 
Kiyoshi Murota of Japan is third at 136 after shooting a 67. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bad news for Pavin, a former UCLA star, is that he will be playing in 
the final group today, which means he will probably miss at least the first 
half of the UCLA-Washington State basketball game at Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can't do anything about that now," Pavin said. "Outside of the majors, this 
would be my favorite tournament to win. I have always loved this course ever 
since watching my first tournament here when I was in (Oxnard) high school." 
</P>
<P>
 Pavin is looking forward to playing head to head with Couples, a gallery 
favorite at Riviera, but he knows it's too early to start thinking about only 
one opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the wind took its toll on the leader board, there are still several 
experienced players at Riviera capable of making a run. 
</P>
<P>
 Chip Beck, who won this event in 1988, shot a 71 and is tied at 137 with Craig 
Stadler, who shot a 69. 
</P>
<P>
 First-round leader Tom Purtzer, also a former champion, eagled the first hole, 
then struggled and shot a 74 that left him sixth at 138. 
</P>
<P>
 Hal Sutton, who won the 1983 PGA Championship at Riviera, shot a 68 and is 
tied with four others at 139. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unlikely anyone will come from any farther back to catch the leaders 
unless they vastly exceed their play on the first two days. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being the leader is no big deal after the second round," said Couples, who 
was already eight under when Pavin started his round. "But it is exciting. I 
always feel like I have a chance to win here. Part of it is the fans; they 
really make a lot of noise." 
</P>
<P>
 Pavin's gallery was pretty vocal, too.  
</P>
<P>
 They had a lot to yell about. Starting on the back nine, Pavin birdied the 
first three holes, then did the same on the first three holes of the front 
nine. He added his other birdie at the seventh hole with a 12-foot putt. 
</P>
<P>
 He had only 20 putts. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the second time I've shot a 64 on this course," Pavin said. "The 
other time was in 1985, the year Lanny Wadkins won by seven strokes, but this 
was a much better round because the conditions were so much more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "The wind was not only strong, it was blowing from the northeast, which is 
opposite of what it usually is." 
</P>
<P>
 The key to his success was his iron shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't ever remember hitting so many good irons," Pavin said. "I hit every 
single iron at the flag today. That's the first time that's ever happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Couples was one of the few other players succeeding in the wind on a day when 
only nine players broke par and the field average was 74.55. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really happy with the way I managed the wind," he said. "You have to be 
thrilled any time to shoot 67-67 at Riviera." Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Although Craig Stadler hasn't won since the World Series of Golf in 1992, he 
emerged from a slump with four top-four finishes last year. He earned $110,357 
in his first 19 tournaments, then added $443,226 in the last five. "I don't 
lose any sleep over not winning in a year in a half," Stadler said. "I went 
seven years without winning from '74 to '81, so I sort of got used to it. But I 
started playing well at the end of last year and I'm still playing pretty 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 It took a score of four-over-par 146 or better to make the cut, and 75 players 
made it. Among those who missed were Jack Nicklaus (150) and his son Gary 
Nicklaus (147), Lanny Wadkins (148) and his brother Bobby Wadkins (149), U.S. 
Open champion Lee Janzen (147) and 1987 L.A. Open champion T.C. Chen (148). . . 
. Defending champion Tom Kite again shot a 72 and is far back at 144. * A NEW

NO. 1 THING ON MINDS IS TAKING DOWNEY TO TASK FOR UCLA PRAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Mike Downey, 
</P>
<P>
 I totally agree with your Feb. 4 column. UCLA should definitely be No. 1 
again. The Bruins looked unstoppable. Who would have ever thought that this 
team could have destroyed such a tough team like USC? After all, the Trojans 
were riding high on a five-game losing streak and had one of the best records 
in college basketball at 10-7, not to mention their tough schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 I just finished watching the Notre Dame game. Those Bruins took a 6-13 
Fighting Irish squad and manhandled them, only to lose a squeaker, 79-63. They 
sure were setting the nets on fire with a whopping 32% from the field. No 
question -- UCLA looked like No. 1. 
</P>

<P>
 Poor Mr. Downey. I was sorry to see the rose-colored glasses through which he 
viewed UCLA's drubbing of USC get crushed by the revelation that was Notre 
Dame's drubbing of UCLA. Although a lot of teams can look like No. 1 when 
playing USC, UCLA is not a legitimate contender for the throne. It will be 
business as usual when Final Four time comes along with two Big Ten teams, one 
ACC team and a Big Eight team.

<P>
 After watching UCLA lose to Cal and Notre Dame, two things are apparent. The 
Bruins may have the best material in the country, but they are poorly coached. 
When they come up against a tight defense, they play out of control, their 
interior passing is sloppy and they give up easy baskets. The only thing 
consistent about their play is their always miserable free-throw shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Harrick is a Terry Donahue clone: great recruiter, lousy game coach. Maybe 
I'm spoiled. When I attended UCLA, the coaches were John Wooden and Red 
Sanders.

HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL; SANTA MARIA VALLEY CHRISTIAN GUARD SETS RECORD: 89 
POINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chad Bickley, a six-foot junior point guard for Santa Maria Valley Christian 
Academy, scored a CIF Southern Section record 89 points -- including a record 
20 three-point shots -- to lead the Lions to a 130-48 Coast Valley League 
victory over Cuyama Valley on Friday night at Cuyama Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Bickley's 89 points shattered the previous record, which was set by Nick 
Tenneriello of Colbert in a game against Brentwood in the 1967-1968 season, by 
15 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Bickley made 20 of 32 three-point attempts to break the previous record of 14, 
set by Joe Phears of Pomona in a game against Bassett in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Bickley also broke the record for three-point baskets in a season. His 150 
this season breaks the previous record of 140, set by Steve Clover of Rolling 
Hills in the 1989-90 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Bickley made 27 of 48 shots from the field and 15 of 16 from the 
free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Maria Valley Christian Academy, 20-3 overall and 8-0 in Coast Valley 
play, is a private school of 72 students. Stan Bickley, Chad's father, is the 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuyama Valley is 4-14, 1-7.

CENTURY LEAGUE BOYS' ROUNDUP; SANTA ANA VALLEY USES ONE-MANN ARMY, WINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For fourth-ranked Santa Ana Valley, Olujimi was the Mann, leading the Falcons 
to a 64-41 victory over third-ranked Orange in a Century League game Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 A capacity crowd jammed the Santa Ana Valley High gymnasium and watched Mann, 
a 6-foot-4 sophomore point guard, score 28 points to help the Falcons (23-3, 
9-1 in league) earn a share of the league title. 
</P>
<P>
 Mann dominated the third quarter, scoring 14 points, and also had two 
crowd-pleasing dunks in the first half, including a reverse, two-handed dunk in 
the final minute of the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Mann had five rebounds and five assists and also made 11 of 13 free throws. He 
made eight of 16 from the field, and when Mann missed, teammate Darnell Adamson 
was there to clean-up, finishing with 14 points and 10 rebounds, including 
seven offensive rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the game, Mann wanted to talk about defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the key was shutting down (Orange forward Gil) Gonzales tonight," 
Mann said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mann had the assignment of guarding Gonzales in the Falcons' man-to-man 
defense, and he finished with five steals, while holding Gonzales to 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales made only four of 15 from the field Friday. He scored 22 points, 
including five three-pointers, in the Panthers' 64-58 victory over Santa Ana 
Valley Jan. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no excuses," Orange Coach Richard Bossenmeyer said. "They didn't do 
anything different tonight than the first time we played them." 
</P>
<P>
 Falcons Coach Rich Prospero liked what he saw early when Santa Ana Valley's 
pressure forced Orange (21-3, 9-1) to commit 13 first-half turnovers.  
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales made a three-pointer 22 seconds into the game and added a pair of 
free throws 40 seconds later to give Orange a 5-2 lead. It was Gonzales' last 
three-pointer of the game, and his free throws were Orange's last points for 
the next nine minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Valley scored 20 unanswered points to take control with Alex 
Fletcher making two three-pointers during the run to give the Falcons a 22-5 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 With 10 seconds remaining in the second quarter and Santa Ana Valley leading, 
28-11, Orange's Nestor Cabalo and Fletcher exchanged words and a minor scuffle 
broke out near mid-court. 
</P>
<P>
 But tempers cooled as the margin grew, and both teams set their sights on the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't want to prepare to play against us in the playoffs because we do a 
lot of different things," Prospero said. "We play pressure defense, we play 
up-tempo . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 And opponents have to prepare for Mann. 
</P>
<P>
 In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill wins -- Foothill (11-15, 5-5) clinched third place and a playoff 
berth with the victory. El Modena finished 9-16, 3-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon 66, Villa Park 63 -- John Werhas scored a game-high 19 points in 
Canyon's victory. Adam Hoover and Ryan Walker each added 12. Canyon is 9-15, 
4-6. Villa Park is 3-20, 0-10.

NHL ROUNDUP; DETROIT AT BEST WHEN WEAKEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Detroit Red Wings were most effective when they had fewer players on the 
ice. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that that's anything new. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Wings scored three short-handed goals in a 6-3 victory over the 
Philadelphia Flyers at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 That Steve Yzerman had one of the three also isn't anything new. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit has scored three short-handed goals in a game three times in franchise 
history, and Yzerman scored one of the goals in each. 
</P>
<P>
 Flyer Coach Terry Simpson was shaking his head over his team's powerless power 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they would have let us decline penalties, we would have been even with 
them," he said. "We were just too slow at moving the puck and too slow coming 
up the ice. I don't know why we were so vulnerable, but we were." 
</P>
<P>
 Yzerman finished with two goals and an assist against Philadelphia, which is 
1-7-1 in its last nine games. 
</P>
<P>
 His assist came on a goal by Ray Sheppard, his 40th of the season. Sheppard 
assisted on both Yzerman goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo 5, Montreal 1 -- Alexander Mogilny scored two goals at Buffalo as the 
Sabres snapped Montreal's six-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Mogilny, who had been sidelined four games because of an ankle injury, scored 
his 22nd and 23rd goals of the season. Richard Smehlik assisted on three goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo has lost only once and allowed only 12 goals in its last six games. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 3, Winnipeg 1 -- Dave Andreychuk scored short-handed midway through 
the second period to help the Maple Leafs snap a winless streak at four games 
and stay two points ahead of Detroit in the Central Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Winnipeg is 0-10-2 in its last 12 games and has scored only 17 goals in the 
eight games since Teemu Selanne went down with a season-ending Achilles' tendon 
injury in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Calgary 4, Hartford 1 -- Trent Yawney and Theore Fleury scored second-period 
goals and Mike Vernon stopped 19 shots for the Flames at home. 
</P>
<P>
 German Titov and Gary Roberts also scored for the Flames, who tied a season 
high with their fifth consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartford has won only two of its last 14 games. 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose 4, Chicago 3 -- Sergei Makarov and Todd Elik scored two goals each as 
the Sharks, behind a career-high three assists from Sandis Ozolinsh, took their 
second consecutive victory over the Blackhawks at San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sharks and Blackhawks will play for the third time in six days on Sunday 
at San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sharks, continuing their run for a first playoff spot, have won three in a 
row and are 8-3-1 in their last 12 games.

ORANGE LEAGUE BOYS' BASKETBALL; VALENCIA BEATS MAGNOLIA, BUT BOTH TEAMS EARN 
SHARE OF TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A wide grin creased the face of Valencia first-year Coach Dean Yoshimura as 
the buzzer sounded Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The host Tigers defeated first-place Magnolia, 42-40, in the teams' 
regular-season finale, providing Valencia with a share of the league title and 
fulfilling a promise Yoshimura made to his charges when he rolled out the balls 
in October. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to make his sound egotistical, but I told these kids a long time 
ago they would be in this position," Yoshimura said. "This is what I'm here for 
. . . that's what these kids are here for. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't play (the season) to come in second." 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers, however, did finish second in a sense. 
</P>
<P>
 A coin flip by the schools' athletic directors after the game determined 
Magnolia (18-7, 8-2 in league play), the defending league champion, enters the 
Southern Section playoffs as the league's top-seeded team. Valencia is 14-10, 
8-2. 
</P>
<P>
 The championship is the third for Valencia in 60 years and the first since 
1987. The Tigers also won a title in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sentinels played without standout swingman Frank Henderson, the team's 
leading scorer. Coach Al Walin said Henderson was serving a one-game suspension 
for disciplinary reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 He was missed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not taking anything away from them; (Valencia) played a great game, but 
things might have been different under normal circumstances," Walin said. 
"Maybe they wouldn't, but Henderson is a big-time player. I know I don't want 
to play without him next week." 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Jermaine Gray had 12 points and eight rebounds in helping the Tigers 
avenge a 54-49 loss to the Sentinels on Jan. 21. Guard Max Zamora contributed 
11, including a key basket on an offensive rebound that gave the Tigers a 38-35 
lead with 3 minutes 2 seconds remaining in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard La Shaun Neal led Magnolia with 16 points and center Brandon Hearvey had 
12 points, eight rebounds and five blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Valencia begins play in the Division II-A playoffs next week. The Sentinels 
are in Division III-AA. 
</P>
<P>
 In other Orange League games: 
</P>
<P>
 Savanna 90, Anaheim 60 -- Jermaine Moore scored 21 points and Malcolm Dougan 
added 17 for Savanna (13-11, 7-3), which finished third in league play. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Castillo scored 23 for Anaheim (7-17, 3-7). 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda 46, Western 40 -- Wayne Spurlock scored 13 for Brea-Olinda. 
Teammate Matt Bodiford added 10. Brea-Olinda finishes 6-19, 2-8. Paul 
Lindemeyer scored 13 for Western (11-14, 2-8).

CONTRERAS ESCAPES AT UCLA; COLLEGE BASEBALL: NORTHRIDGE PITCHER, IN PROCESS OF 
BLOWING FOUR-RUN LEAD IN NINTH, FINDS HIMSELF AND HOLDS ON FOR 7-5 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 You are under my spell. Your eyelids are feeling heavy. Uh, but your arm 
isn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge pitcher Marco Contreras was wobbling noticeably when 
Coach Bill Kernen came out to work on his noggin Friday at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Contreras was in the process of blowing a four-run lead in the top of the 
ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Two runs had scored and the go-ahead run was at the plate when Kernen 
sauntered out to give his pitcher a brief lecture in comparison and contrast. 
</P>
<P>
 An inning earlier, Contreras had retired the Bruins on nine pitches, with two 
strikeout. 
</P>
<P>
 "You mean to tell me you're not the same person you were in the eighth?" 
Kernen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Contreras got the message and served up a game-ending double play on the next 
pitch and Northridge escaped with a 7-5 victory at Jackie Robinson Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Comparison and contrast. . . . Last week, the senior right-hander gave up 
eight earned runs in a dismal 9-8 loss to Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. Against the 
Bruins, however, Contreras (1-1) was a different pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Staked to a 5-0 lead, he bulled his way through the UCLA lineup. He challenged 
every hitter and often got away with it. He finished with 10 strikeouts and 
allowed three earned runs on nine hits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going right at 'em," Contreras said. "When you have a five- or six-run 
lead, even if they hit it out, it's only a run." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge designated-hitter Eric Gillespie hit one out and then some. In the 
bottom of the first -- Northridge was officially the home team -- the freshman 
ripped a three-run homer to right for a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge (1-3) added two runs in the second. 
</P>
<P>
 With runners at second and third and none out, shortstop Chad Thornhill and 
outfielder Joey Arnold sent groundouts to the right side to drive in runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Just to prove it was no fluke, with runners in the same position in the fourth 
and Northridge leading, 5-2, Thornhill and second baseman Keyaan Cook each 
drove in runs on groundouts to re-establish the five-run lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Comparison and contrast. . . . UCLA (1-2) had runners at second and third with 
none out in the seventh, but Contreras retired the Nos. 3-4-5 hitters -- 
allowing only one run on a groundout -- to escape with a 7-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good turnaround for (Contreras) as an individual," Kernen said. "He 
had much better stuff this time." 
</P>
<P>
 But it almost wasn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing in the ninth, 7-3, the Bruins started ripping liners. Zak Ammirato 
reached base on a throwing error by first baseman Jason Shanahan to open the 
inning, but the defense squared its account when shortstop Thornhill stole a 
hit on an acrobatic, backhanded catch of David Roberts' liner. 
</P>
<P>
 Contreras, who had allowed only six hits, surrendered a double to Brett 
Schafer and run-scoring singles to Mike Mitchell (Rio Mesa High) and Chris 
Lohman (Notre Dame) as UCLA closed to 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
 However, catcher Tim DeCinces -- whose father Doug was a major league third 
baseman -- ended it on the next pitch by sending a double-play grounder to Cook 
at second. 
</P>
<P>
 Comparison and contrast. . . . Sophomore right-hander John Mitchell (0-1) took 
the loss, allowing seven runs in three innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell pitched five innings in an alumni game Sunday at UCLA against former 
Bruins such as Eric Karros, Todd Zeile, Sean Berry, Torey Lovullo and Ryan 
McGuire. He allowed one run on three hits. Matador Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The cinder-block outfield wall at Matador Field, a longtime nemesis of 
outfielders, will be torn down because of earthquake damage. The wall will be 
replaced by an eight-foot chain-link fence, hopefully in time for next 
Saturday's scheduled home opener against Cal State Fullerton.

PATTERSON HELPS HART CORRAL CANYON, 72-57 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They brought their leapers, streakers and 14 pairs of high-top sneakers. 
Canyon High's Cowboys laced them up tight in hopes of roping rival Hart on 
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 With a share of the Foothill League championship at stake, the Cowboys brought 
all their ammunition to their home court. But they forgot one thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon didn't have anybody to lasso Cody Patterson, Hart's 6-foot-8 center. 
Thanks to Patterson's 24 points, this showdown went to the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart wrapped up its third consecutive league championship with a 72-57 victory 
in front of 1,200 fans. The Indians, ranked No. 1 in the area by The Times, 
improved to 21-1, 8-0 in league play, and should get a high seeding in the 
Southern Section Division I tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon finished 19-6 and 6-2, with its only league losses being inflicted by 
Hart. The Cowboys will get a berth in the Division II playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson has a knack for making layups after offensive rebounds. Putbacks 
accounted for 12 of his points. Canyon couldn't stop him, even after he picked 
up his fourth foul with one minute left in the third quarter. He scored 12 
points after that, as Coach Mike May never removed him from the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of a gamble, but Cody's a smart kid," May said. "He plays that 
way every day in practice. He's one of the most tenacious, determined players 
I've ever had. Tonight he was our backbone." 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon features the league's top two scorers in Greg Minor (23 points per 
game) and Charles Woodard (20). The Cowboys are talented, but the first time 
they played Hart they looked confused and lost, like a wagon train crossing the 
Brooklyn Bridge. They seemed more at home this time, but they blew too many 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Most memorable were two blown dunks by Woodard a minute apart in the first 
half with Canyon trailing by one. 
</P>
<P>
 "They could have taken the lead," Patterson said. "I think (trying to dunk) 
was a serious mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 Four Canyon players finished in double figures: Woodard (16), Minor (12), 
James Manning (10) and Pat Backes (10). Randy Roa had 18 points for Hart and 
was the go-to guy early. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was Patterson who took over the shooting match after Hart clung to a 
four-point lead through much of the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Patterson was the difference," Canyon Coach Greg Hayes said. "Every one of 
those putbacks could have been a fast break for us. Patterson played the last 
nine minutes of the game with four fouls, and he never backed down."

OLLIE'S SHOT AND BLOCK SAVE NORTH HOLLYWOOD AT WIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Senior forward Damon Ollie, who leads the region in rebounds and blocked 
shots, came up with one of each in the final 25 seconds of overtime Friday 
night to key North Hollywood High's 65-63 victory over Grant in a physical East 
Valley League game. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams -- the biggest of rivals in the Valley Pac-8 Conference for the 
past eight seasons -- went into the game with 7-0 marks in league play. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, however, heavily favored North Hollywood came up with the key 
plays to win it. And Ollie, who was corralled by three defenders for most of 
the game and held to 15 points, proved to be the deciding factor. 
</P>
<P>
 Sparked by the outstanding play of brothers Ron (17 points) and Don Patterson 
(14 points, 13 rebounds), Grant refused to give in to the Huskies' thieving 
defense and fast-paced transition game. The Lancers tied it three times in the 
first half, but were forced to play catch-up for most the game. Grant's Alvin 
Castro hit a 10-foot turnaround jumper for a 59-59 tie with 1 minute 10 seconds 
remaining in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the overtime period, North Hollywood maintained its role as pacesetter. 
Arthur Lee buried (25 points) a baseline jumper to open the period. Ali 
Karimian answered with a short jumper to tie it. North Hollywood's Fantasia 
Johnson (22 points) banked in a eight-foot shot with 2 minutes left to reclaim 
a two-point lead for the Huskies. 
</P>
<P>
 With 25 seconds remaining, Johnson missed on the front end of a one-and-one, 
but Ollie grabbed the rebound and hit a short follow-up shot to give the 
Huskies a 65-61 cushion. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant's Ron Patterson nailed two free throws with 10 seconds left to get the 
Lancers closer. One second later, Ollie was fouled, but he missed on his first 
free throw and Ron Patterson grabbed the rebound and pushed the ball up the 
court. Alvin Castro (11 points) misfired on a three-pointer, but Don Patterson 
(13 rebounds) rebounded and went back up for a basket that could have tied the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ollie smacked the ball away from Patterson at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
 North Hollywood (14-5, 8-0), which has not lost to a California team this 
season, will face Grant (16-4, 7-1) next Friday in the final league game of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant Coach Howie Levine, who was extremely pleased with his team's play 
against The Times' second-ranked team, can only hope the Lancers are up for a 
repeat performance next week. 
</P>

THOUSAND OAKS FINDS A FAMILIAR ENDING; HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL: LANCERS GET 
SHARE OF FOURTH MARMONTE TITLE IN ROW WITH 78-60 WIN OVER SIMI VALLEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just to keep things interesting, Thousand Oaks High lost its first two 
Marmonte League basketball games this season. 
</P>
<P>
 That way, when the Lancers came back to win a share of the championship, which 
they did with a 78-60 victory over Simi Valley on Friday night, it would have a 
different flavor than the titles of the previous three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "The league was more competitive this year," senior Jason Hartman said. "This 
championship feels a lot better because we beat better teams." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers will share the title with Agoura, which beat Channel Islands on 
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley (17-8, 8-5) is likely to make the playoffs because its record 
would probably earn an at-large bid even if the Pioneers don't finish with one 
of the league's four automatic spots. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks likely will start the Division I-A playoffs next week with a 
home game by virtue of winning the league championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Just like last year. Same end. Different means. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Thousand Oaks was 14-0 in the Marmonte League. The Lancers only 
setback of the regular season was to North Hollywood, but this year Thousand 
Oaks finishes the regular season 20-6, 11-3 in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was such a whole new team," Coach Ed Chevalier said. "The kids really 
grew into their roles and that's why they are such good kids." 
</P>
<P>
 The best kid Friday night was Hartman, who scored 21 points, 15 in the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jason worked a lot harder in the second half," Chevalier said. 
</P>
<P>
 During one stretch in the third quarter, when Thousand Oaks put the game away, 
Hartman scored eight consecutive points. He then made a great pass to forward 
Brian Downing, who converted a three-point play to give Thousand Oaks a 64-51 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers made an impressive 26 of 40 shots (65%). 
</P>
<P>
 "That doesn't surprise me because we have such good shooters," Hartman said, 
"but it was nice to see it in a big game." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior guard Peter Lauer added 16 points, including three three-pointers, for 
Thousand Oaks. Downing scored 11 and Kevin DePiazza added 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Every player on the Simi Valley roster scored, with Vernon Simmons leading the 
way with 12. 
</P>
<P>
 But Simmons missed nearly all of the first half after he was whistled for his 
second foul about three minutes into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Without him, the Pioneers were still able to take the early lead because of 
hot shooting from the field. Simi Valley made 10 of its first 12 shots, and 
took a 25-17 lead early in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks came back when the Pioneers cooled down. Making 12 of 17 shots 
from the field in the first half, the Lancers went into the locker room with a 
34-30 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartman's scoring burst late in the third quarter and early in the fourth put 
the game away. Simi Valley could get no closer than 10 points after that. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks made 13 of 19 free throws in the closing minutes to bury the 
Pioneers.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE ROUNDUP; SADDLEBACK HOLDS ON, REMAINS TIED FOR FIRST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saddleback, which spent much of Friday enjoying a comfortable lead, appeared 
to be on its way to an easy victory in Orange Empire Conference men's 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 But the host Gauchos had to make some clutch free throws to beat Golden West, 
90-85, and remain tied for first with Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback led, 72-52, with 8 minutes 27 seconds left, but Golden West closed 
the gap thanks to intense defense and Gerald Rhoden, who had 31 of his 
game-high 34 points and six three-pointers in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West's Matt Murphy made a three-pointer from about 23 feet away with 22 
seconds left to cut the Saddleback lead to 86-85. The Gauchos then turned the 
ball over. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West, out of timeouts, worked the ball around for 10 seconds before 
guard Tobie Priest tried to pass back to Rhoden, who had broken for the basket. 
Rhoden reached back and grabbed the jersey of Tes Whitlock and was called for 
an intentional foul. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitlock made both free throws to put Saddleback up, 88-85. The Gauchos then 
turned the ball over, but a three-point try by Golden West's Jeff Phillips went 
off the rim with a second left. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback's Josh Borella got the rebound and was fouled, and he made both 
free throws to finish with a team-high 19 points for Saddleback (20-6, 10-2). 
</P>
<P>
 "We got through it," Saddleback Coach Bill Brummel said. "But it shook our 
confidence a bit." STEVE KRESAL

CENTURY LEAGUE WRESTLING; EL MODENA TAKES SUSPENSE OUT OF THINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM Q. BERKSHIRE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With El Modena claiming the team championship so early in the game, the 
Century League wrestling finals looked elsewhere for drama and intrigue. 
</P>
<P>
 So a handful of individual match-ups provided the necessary fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
 In a staggering showing, El Modena powered its way to its second consecutive 
league title, smothering the competition by placing 12 wrestlers in the finals 
and scoring 222 1/2 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Runner-up Canyon, whose stronghold on league titles spanned 12 years before El 
Modena's triumph last season, placed five wrestlers in the finals and scored 
140 points in Friday night's tournament at Foothill High. Four Villa Park 
wrestlers advanced to the finals and the Spartans were third with 110 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the Vanguards' 12 finalists, seven won their weight classes, including 
repeat league champions junior Milo Ventimiglia (112) and seniors Juan Alvarez 
(135), Chris Jaime (45) and Brad Carlson (171). 
</P>
<P>
 One of El Modena's most-watched wrestlers was also its newest, Savanna 
transfer Teak Sato, the 130-pounder who is top-ranked in the county and 
finished third in the state last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Sato sent ripples through wrestling circles when he transferred to El Modena 
last week for what he termed academic reasons. The Vanguards would have easily 
won the league title without him, but his presence certainly won't hurt their 
Southern Section or State tournament chances. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was nervous," Sato said of his El Modena debut, in which he pinned 
Foothill's Matt Webb in 5:40. "But I'm always nervous. I could have wrestled 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 The rematch of the county's top-ranked 140-pounders, No. 1 Darryl Christian of 
Canyon and No. 2 David Wells of El Modena was closer than their first meeting, 
in which then second-ranked Christian upended then top-ranked Wells, 15-1. 
Christian still prevailed, this time by an 8-3 margin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he'd try to be more defensive and it showed," said Christian, a 
transfer from Grants Pass, Ore. "It didn't seem like he really wanted to 
wrestle." 
</P>
<P>
 Christian, who has already won a State championship in Oregon, wouldn't mind 
adding a California title to his resume: "I'd like to," he said. "Then all the 
hard work will have paid off." 
</P>
<P>
 What paid off for first-time league champion Zane Koss of El Modena was a 
strategic last-second move that gave the senior 189-pounder a 12-10 overtime 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Koss scored on a takedown with 15 seconds left in the third period to draw 
even with Cott, 10-10, then scored the winning points seconds into the extra 
period on another takedown. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a tough loss for Cott, who led, 8-3, in the second period and had lost 
to Koss, 13-5, on Feb. 3.

REPORTS EASE INFLATION FEARS; ECONOMY: FALLING FOOD COSTS KEEP WHOLESALE PRICE 
RISE TO JUST 0.2%, AND RETAIL SALES DROP. INTEREST RATES SHOULD STAY DOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wholesale prices rose a scant 0.2% last month and retail sales dropped 0.5%, 
the federal government said Friday, easing fears that inflation is heating up 
and taking some of the pressure off the nation's central bank to raise interest 
rates again soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Falling prices for food partially offset rising prices for gasoline in 
January, leaving wholesale price inflation at a modest 2.9% annual rate, the 
Labor Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the 0.5% drop in January retail sales that the Commerce Department 
announced in a separate report was larger than expected, analysts said much of 
the decline could be blamed on the Northridge earthquake last month and 
unusually harsh weather in the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is nothing in these reports to make me think that interest rates are 
going to have to be bumped up again soon," said Robert Dederick, chief 
economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. "At this point, inflation is simply 
a non-issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Most other analysts agreed that Friday's reports had quelled their fears that 
the Federal Reserve Board would have to raise interest rates again in the next 
few weeks to cool down the economy and ease long-term inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Fed raised its federal funds rate -- the rate banks charge each 
other for overnight loans -- to 3.25% from 3%. It was the first such increase 
in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, some experts said the increase would be the first of several in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
 But analysts said Friday's reports could allow the Fed to wait until the 
spring or even summer before raising rates again. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Department tracks wholesale prices through its monthly producer 
price index. The index's 0.2% increase in January indicates that consumers 
won't be paying much more at the checkout counter or gas pump when the goods 
get to market in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month's increase in the index was fueled by a 6.5% jump in the cost of 
gasoline. Overall energy costs, which also include the cost of natural gas and 
heating oil, climbed a smaller 0.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 Tobacco and auto prices also rose, helping to wipe out the benefits of a 0.3% 
drop in food prices -- the biggest one-month decline since last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts had said retail sales in January would slow from their feverish 
Christmas pace, but the 0.5% drop reported by the Commerce Department was much 
larger than most had expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of big-ticket durable goods, such as appliances and other items built to 
last at least three years, dropped 1.6% last month after jumping 2% in 
December. Total sales slipped to a seasonally adjusted $181 billion, the first 
month-to-month decline since March. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, few analysts were worried about the sales drop. 
</P>
<P>
 They noted that unusually bad weather in the Northeast kept many shoppers at 
home last month, while the earthquake closed several large shopping centers and 
many small businesses in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, consumer confidence remains relatively high. Although its overall 
reading of confidence fell for early February, the University of Michigan said 
a preliminary reading of its consumer expectations index -- which some analysts 
use to estimate future consumer spending -- rose.  
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, it appears the drop in sales primarily was due to the weather 
as opposed to any downturn in consumer confidence," said Lynn Reaser, chief 
economist at First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles. Producer Price Index

DOW DRIFTS, AND SO DOES THE SNOW, IN SESSION CUT SHORT BY THE WEATHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Blue-chips stocks recovered from a morning drop to close slightly lower in a 
session cut short by a severe snowstorm in the New York area. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time the New York Stock Exchange had closed early due to 
weather since Feb. 6, 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2:30 p.m. EST closure was 90 minutes ahead of the regular closing. The 
exchange took the step after major commodities markets and the government bond 
market closed because of the storm. 
</P>
<P>
 A securities industry source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said major 
brokerages had pressured the NYSE for an early close because Wall Street 
workers faced a treacherous journey home. The NYSE normally is averse to 
suspending regular trading hours for any reason. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average finished at 3,894.78, off 0.56 point, which 
left it up 23.36 points, or 0.6%, for the week. The Dow drifted at neutral 
levels for much of the abbreviated session until futures-related selling 
temporarily depressed it by more than 20 points around midday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broad market, declining issues beat gainers 3 to 2 on light NYSE volume 
of 213.4 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the weather was the main topic, financial markets were jittery 
following stocks' renewed slide Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said many investors remain nervous in the wake of the Federal Reserve 
Board's decision to tighten credit a week ago. That news caused a 96-point 
plunge in the Dow last Friday, and stocks have been struggling to regain their 
footing since. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Friday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Profit takers continued to hammer auto stocks and other industrial issues. 
GM dropped 1 1/8 to 61 1/8, Chrysler dipped 3/4 to 59 and Ford fell 1/2 to 65 
1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Alcoa lost 1 1/8 to 78 1/8, Bethlehem Steel eased 5/8 to 23, Union 
Carbide lost 1 to 24 1/2 and Phelps Dodge sank 2 3/8 to 53 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Airline stocks were weak. AMR, parent of American, fell 1 5/8 to 65 1/8, 
USAir slid 1 to 12 1/4 and Delta gave up 1 to 51 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the tech sector, computer networking company Cisco Systems gained 2 3/8 
to 74 3/8 after it reported solid quarterly earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 But video-conferencing systems firm PictureTel plunged 2 1/4 to 14 3/4 after 
Goldman Sachs cut earnings estimates.  
</P>
<P>
 * Another big loser was Timberland, the footwear and apparel maker, which 
tumbled 9 7/8 to 43 1/2 after its fourth-quarter earnings fell below estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 * Procter & Gamble added 1 3/8 to 58 3/4 after Dean Witter recommended the 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign markets took their cue from Wall Street's Thursday drop. In London, 
the FTSE-100 index fell 28.1 points to 3,378.9. Frankfurt's DAX-30 gave up 
28.35 points to 2,090.61. In Mexico City, the Bolsa index eased 16.38 points to 
2,802.06, its third straight drop. In Toronto, the TSE-300 index tumbled 36.37 
points to 4,405.60. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tokyo market was closed for a national holiday. Other Markets 
</P>
<P>
 Mixed signals on inflation triggered wild swings in the Treasury market, but 
by the session's early close interest rates were modestly lower across the 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year Treasury bond yield fell to 6.40% from Thursday's 6.45%. Among 
shorter-term issues, the yield on three-month T-bills eased to 3.33% from 
3.35%. 
</P>
<P>
 The major news of the day was the Labor Department's report that its producer 
price index, which provides a gauge of inflation at the wholesale level, rose a 
lower-than-expected 0.2% in January. 
</P>
<P>
 The news initially pushed interest rates lower because it showed that 
inflation stayed low, thus lessening the likelihood that the Fed will raise 
short-term interest rates again soon. 
</P>
<P>
 But some traders apparently lost enthusiasm after refocusing on the so-called 
core rate of inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy sectors. By 
midmorning, yields were rising again. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, buyers returned after the University of Michigan reported a drop in 
consumer confidence in the economy this month. A weaker economy would reduce 
the chances of the Fed tightening credit again. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere: 
</P>
<P>
 * The dollar fell to a three-month low against the Japanese yen after 
President Clinton and Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa failed to 
clinch a trade agreement in a long-awaited summit. The dollar fell to 106.80 
yen in New York from 108.18 on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gold for current delivery settled at $380.00 an ounce, down $2 on the New 
York Comex. Silver lost 6.4 cents to $5.25.

 Super glue was used on engines of NASA shuttles that were flown in space, 
officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The unauthorized use of the hobby store glue by technicians at Valencia-based 
Paragon Precision Products was discovered in a servicing of the main engine's 
low-pressure turbo pump. 
</P>
<P>
 Paragon is a small company that specializes in aircraft turbo pumps and 
subcontracts pump repairs to the Rocketdyne division of Rockwell International, 
the prime contractor of shuttle main engines. Paragon officials did not return 
telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 June Malone, a NASA spokeswoman, said the glue was used to hold metal plating 
inside the pump. The glue itself presented no safety or performance risk, she 
said. But she noted, "It was an unauthorized procedure, and we don't like to 
see that." DON LEE

IRS MOVES TO BLOCK REFUNDS ON FALSE TAX CREDIT CLAIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Internal Revenue Service, battling a huge increase in fraud, has quietly 
launched a program to crack down on certain low-income tax cheats allegedly 
responsible for billions of dollars' worth of bogus refund claims. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is the agency's first attempt to block refunds to people who 
falsely claim to qualify for the earned income tax credit, a generous tax break 
for the working poor. As a result, millions of low-income families are likely 
to see their refunds delayed or rejected and could face civil and criminal 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 About one of every four earned income credit claims is rejected because of 
fraud or error, said Judith Golden, an IRS spokeswoman in Laguna Niguel. 
Taxpayers, seeking refundable credits of as much as $2,364, usually commit 
fraud by misrepresenting their marital status, dependents or job status. 
</P>
<P>
 Bogus earned income credit claims are expected to total $5 billion for the 
1993 tax year, compared to about $3.4 billion in 1992, she said. The problem 
appears to be particularly severe in Southern California, Chicago and Florida, 
tax experts add. 
</P>
<P>
 Revelations about widespread fraud could be embarrassing for the Clinton 
Administration, which recently bolstered the earned income credit by increasing 
the amount that low-income parents could claim and opening it up to individuals 
without children as of 1994. White House officials did not return calls seeking 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over 75% of the fraud that comes into our offices in some way relates to the 
earned income credit," said Tim Robinson, Southern California district manager 
for Jackson Hewitt Tax Service, a tax preparation franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 There are three prevalent types of earned income credit fraud, tax preparers 
say. One involves people who falsely claim they have children or understate the 
age of the children. Others fabricate jobs, because taxpayers can claim the 
credit only if they have earned income such as wages, salaries or tips. Married 
couples who earn too much together to qualify also claim to be divorced. That 
allows them to split their income -- and their children -- and both claim the 
credit, preparers say. 
</P>
<P>
 The new IRS program is designed to ferret out those who falsely claim they 
have children or jobs, tax officials say. The agency is also apparently 
attempting to improve its ability to check marital status. However, that part 
of the program is not as effective at finding cheaters, tax preparers say. 
</P>
<P>
 Since January, the agency has been using a sophisticated computerized matching 
program that checks the ages and Social Security numbers of dependents on the 
earned income form with information on file with the Social Security 
Administration. It has also improved its system to verify employment 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is too soon to measure the program's effectiveness, tax preparers 
say they have loads of anecdotal evidence to prove it is working. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, on Thursday four separate groups came into Jackson Hewitt's 
Inglewood office with fake W-2 forms -- the employer-provided income statements 
necessary to file tax returns -- according to Robinson, the district manager. A 
Burbank preparer recently dealt with an 18-year-old girl who attempted to claim 
her 14-year-old friend as a dependent. And an Ohio preparer's client attempted 
to claim a 35-year-old friend as a minor dependent. 
</P>
<P>
 However, thanks to the matching program, age and wage disparities were kicked 
out of the computer overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 The immediate fraud signal is pivotal because, in past years, the IRS tended 
to uncover earned income credit fraud after refunds were issued. 
</P>
<P>
 In many cases, preparers and filers had fled, making it virtually impossible 
for the IRS to reclaim the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxpayers can legitimately claim the earned income tax credit if they earned 
less than $23,050 in 1993 and have a "qualifying child." To qualify, the child 
must have lived with the taxpayer in the United States for more than six months 
of the year. The child must be younger than 19 or a full-time student younger 
than 24, or he or she must be permanently disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxpayers generally cannot get the credit if they receive military housing or 
subsistence payments or if they are on welfare. The point is to give poor 
families an incentive to work, McClellan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden stressed that not all of the returns kicked out of the system are 
fraudulent. Some contain simple errors, such as a wrong birth date or a 
transposed number. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxpayers shouldn't panic if they are contacted by the IRS after filing a 
legitimate claim, Golden said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, if a return is found to be fraudulent, she said, the IRS will pursue 
civil and criminal penalties against the taxpayer and tax preparer who filed 
it.

AS PARAMOUNT DEADLINE NEARS, QVC DENIES VIOLATION OF BIDDING RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Amid a cross-fire of complaints, QVC Network Inc. insisted Friday that it is 
abiding by auction rules for Paramount Communications Inc. and refused to tip 
its hand about any last-minute help it might get from wealthy backers that 
include BellSouth Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the severe winter storm Friday that closed New York airports and stock 
exchanges, the combatants for Paramount sniped at one another via facsimile 
machines and press releases, trying to gain the upper hand before their tender 
offers expire at 9 p.m. PST Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Feb. 1, Viacom Inc. has appeared to be in the lead because its 
stock-and-cash bid contains slightly more cash and some protection for 
Paramount shareholders if Viacom shares decline in value. But QVC, which has 
offered no such protection, has stirred hopes on Wall Street that it might come 
back with a better bid Tuesday if Viacom fails to gain the 50.1% of Paramount 
shares required under the auction rules. 
</P>
<P>
 QVC has not discouraged speculation that BellSouth or other backers -- which 
include Comcast, Cox Enterprises and Advance Publications -- may announce a 
plan to buy QVC shares in the open market, which would bolster the value of QVC 
shares issued to Paramount shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Thursday, Viacom protested that QVC was making a "backdoor attempt" to 
change its bid after the Feb. 1 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Paramount said it had received inquiries from confused shareholders 
and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Paramount dispatched a letter to 
QVC's lawyer expressing "grave concerns" about QVC's compliance with the 
auction rules. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, QVC legal adviser Martin Lipton said that "QVC has not violated 
the bidding procedures and has no intention of doing so." Lipton complained 
that Viacom had made "erroneous and misleading statements" about the auction 
process to Paramount shareholders in private meetings Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount responded with a second letter, promising to look into Viacom's 
conduct but pointedly asking a second time "whether there are any plans or 
intentions with respect to open market purchases of QVC stock by its investors 
or any other party and, if so, why you believe they do not violate the bidding 
rules." 
</P>
<P>
 As of late Friday, QVC had no response. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount shares closed unchanged at $76.875 on Friday, while those of QVC 
rose $1.25 to $46.875. Viacom Class A added 25 cents to $36.50, while Viacom 
Class B fell $1.125 to $31.625. The shares of the perceived winner decline in 
value because victory will mean the assumption of debt.

TAILORED TO THE AREA; DISCOUNT MEN'S CLOTHIERS DO WELL IN SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The men's tailored clothing business has been unraveling for years, 
particularly in Los Angeles. The flagging economy and Southern California's 
dress-down attitude have made it a graveyard for many sellers of men's suits. 
</P>
<P>
 That didn't stop George Zimmer, chairman of Men's Wearhouse, a Fremont, 
Calif.-based discount suit retailer. Zimmer entered the Los Angeles market by 
opening 10 Southland stores in the past four months, and he plans to open a 
dozen more in the region this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of our employees expressed concern when we decided to move into the Los 
Angeles market," Zimmer said. "Some analysts on Wall Street questioned our 
decision, but we think we have a huge opportunity in the Los Angeles area." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, while many companies are closing apparel stores amid Southern 
California's economic gloom, discount suit sellers are expanding rapidly. By 
taking advantage of a drop in the cost of floor space and a rise in the demand 
for value, discount clothiers have become a rare retailing success story in the 
Southland.  
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles has been the most difficult area for conventional store chains," 
said Alan Millstein, a New York-based apparel industry analyst. "Some stores 
would like to pull out of Los Angeles, which makes it all the more remarkable 
that Men's Wearhouse has decided to double its presence. It's a sign that price 
is more important to men. This is becoming the decade of the bargain hunter." 
</P>
<P>
 Other apparel retailers are rushing in: Harris & Frank, known for decades as 
an upscale chain, now offers discount prices. C&R Clothiers, which strayed from 
its original value-pricing strategies, is now back to its former format. And 
Suitmasters, a discount suit retailer that opened its first shop in Glendale 
last year, plans to open 10 more stores in the next two years.  
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, Southland clothiers are responding to well-established trends. 
Industry analysts say price is an increasingly important incentive because 
American men buy half as many suits as they did a decade ago. Price is 
especially important in the Southland because consumers are concerned about the 
state's economic slump and because more men  
</P>
<P>
 are dressing casually at work in California.  
</P>
<P>
 "Dressing down is a trend in California, Texas and Florida," Millstein said. 
"You won't sell a lot of suits in those states if your prices are high, because 
men have more options." 
</P>
<P>
 Men's Wearhouse, which sells designer label suits, appears to have learned 
these lessons best. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales from its 183 stores -- including those in the Los Angeles area -- 
totaled $240.4 million, an increase of 41.1%, for the 12 months ended Jan. 29. 
Same-store sales -- revenue from Wearhouse stores open at least a year -- rose 
17% for the period.  
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, the men's tailored clothing business experienced a 5% decrease in 
sales industrywide in 1993, and several major retailers and manufacturers are 
also trying to cope with financial snags. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Chicago-based Hartmarx, a major apparel manufacturer and 
retailer, filed for bankruptcy protection in December. GFT, a New York and 
Turin, Italy-based manufacturer of licensed designer label lines -- Armani and 
Calvin Klein among them -- lost an estimated $59 million in 1993. Its creditors 
may put the company on the auction block.  
</P>
<P>
 While many chains have been closing some of their stores -- Kuppenheimer and 
Richmond Bros. among them -- Men's Wearhouse has expanded rapidly in recent 
years. The chain, which has quadrupled in size since 1988, added 40 stores in 
1993. The company's Northridge store -- one of the 10 Southland stores opened 
late last year -- was severely damaged by the earthquake, but the retailer 
plans to reopen in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Zimmer has followed the same strategy in each of the 50 cities Men's Wearhouse 
has entered. The company avoids malls and locates its stores on streets because 
"men don't like huge parking lots and like to get in and out of stores 
quickly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company attracts customers with low prices on brand-name clothing with a 
strong cachet -- recognizable brands such as Pierre Cardin, Givenchy, Halston 
and Yves Saint Laurent. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which has stores in 21 states, also touts its service, including 
free pressing and follow-up calls to determine the level of satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Zimmer has also used television advertising to raise the company's profile, 
appearing in commercials in which he invokes his low-price "I guarantee it" 
slogan. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the apparel industry will be watching the performance of Men's 
Wearhouse as it expands in the Los Angeles area because of the market's 
perilous history. For example, Silverwoods, a chain that operated in Southern 
California for 70 years, closed its 18 stores in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The former owner of Harris & Frank, another money-losing seller of upscale 
tailored clothing in the Los Angeles area, sold the chain to Miami-based 
clothier Alan Glist in 1992. Glist bought 12 of the 17 stores and saved them by 
changing the format. 
</P>
<P>
 "We now offer the same kinds of prices that you find at discount chains, 
because Los Angeles is a very tough market," Glist said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight for the discount suit buyer intensified when Suitmasters opened its 
first store in Glendale in September. The company plans to open its next store 
in Burbank this year, said Joe Cheon, the company's general manager.  
</P>
<P>
 Culver City-based C&R Clothiers, a longtime leader in the market, slid into 
bankruptcy in 1992 largely because it began to offer customers more expensive 
and more cutting-edge fashion, Chief Executive Paul Reisbord said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which has 34 stores in Southern California, now offers more 
mainstream fashion at lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
 C&R saw double-digit increases in the number of suits sold during the final 
three months of 1993, Reisbord said. The Rise of Men's Wearhouse 
</P>
<P>
 While many men's tailored clothing retailers are in trouble, Men's Wearhouse 
is building sales and expanding rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales (in millions): $237.0 
</P>
<P>
 Number of stores: 183

 Merck & Co. to Increase R&D Budget: The world's largest prescription drug 
company said it will raise research and development spending 12% to $1.3 
billion this year, after telling Congress earlier in the week that national 
health reform could force the company to cut back on science. "We will keep 
pumping funds into research so long as it's productive," said Merck Chairman 
and Chief Executive P. Roy Vagelos at a meeting with analysts in New York.He 
said the research will focus on broadening Merck's product line and the 
long-term cost-effectiveness of certain drugs. His comments came as the drug 
industry struggles to figure out how it will remain profitable in the era of 
managed care, which focuses sharply on cost.

LESS BANG FOR THE BUCK; TOY MANUFACTURERS SHY AWAY FROM VIOLENCE THIS YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Toy manufacturers, responding to a violence-weary public less willing to buy 
gun-toting, shoot-'em-up products, will feature educational games and items 
based on movie characters at this year's toy fair. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual American International Toy Fair, which begins Monday in New York, 
is an opportunity for manufacturers to tout their wares and for retailers to 
place orders for the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
 El Segundo-based Mattel Inc., the nation's second-largest toy maker, will 
introduce a line of toys based on "The Flintstones," the Stone Age family 
famous on television a generation ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Flintstones will appear in a feature film to be released this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Electronic toys with interactive multimedia components are expected to be 
plentiful at this year's fair. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiger Entertainment Inc. is introducing a broad line of interactive 
computerized toys. 
</P>
<P>
 Salomon Bros. toy industry analyst Jill Krutick said she sees "a rising 
sensitivity" on the part of manufacturers to avoid blatantly violent toys. 
</P>
<P>
 "But some toys still cross the line," she added. Tiger Entertainment Inc., for 
example, is featuring an electronic game called Battlevision, based on a 
warrior destroying his opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the action-figure category, some manufacturers are basing their 
characters on heroes rather than fighters, Krutick said. 
</P>
<P>
 The big themes this year will be licensed characters and games from popular 
movies and more educational toys, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hasbro Inc., the largest U.S. toy manufacturer, with $2.7 billion in annual 
sales, will introduce two new action figures, licensing characters of films to 
be released this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 One toy includes the characters and vehicles in "Stargate" and the other, from 
Hasbro's Kenner division, is a character from the film "The Shadow." 
</P>
<P>
 "We think there is a difference between action and violence," Hasbro Vice 
President Wayne Charniss said. "We focus on action." 
</P>
<P>
 G.I. Joe, perhaps the ultimate action hero, will celebrate his 30th birthday 
this year, and Hasbro is introducing a new series of G.I. Joe figures. The 1994 
Joe is not only a Marine, but also an astronaut, with accessories for space 
travel. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Mattel's Barbie turns 35 this year. The company, for whom Barbie is 
the single largest revenue producer, will come out with new dolls and 
accessories.

CENTEX TO BUY SLICE OF ORANGE COUNTY LAND; REAL ESTATE: NATION'S LARGEST HOME 
BUILDER WILL PAY TROUBLED LYON CO. $45 MILLION FOR FOOTHILL RANCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Centex Corp., the nation's largest home builder, has agreed to buy 915 
single-family home lots in the master-planned community of Foothill Ranch in 
Orange County for about $45 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Centex signed a letter of intent earlier this week to purchase the property, 
barely edging out Kaufman & Broad, California's largest home builder. 
Dallas-based Centex has a handful of small home-building projects in San 
Clemente and Rancho Cucamonga, as well as bigger developments in Hemet, Lake 
Elsinore, Victorville and Highland. 
</P>
<P>
 The property is being sold by financially troubled William Lyon Co. in Newport 
Beach, which bought 1,277 lots in Foothill Ranch in the late 1980s. The 
community five miles northeast of the junction of Interstates 5 and 405 is to 
have 4,000 homes and 8.5 million square feet of office, retail and industrial 
space. 
</P>
<P>
 Centex outbid not only Kaufman & Broad, which also bid about $45 million for 
the lots, but also J.M. Peters Co. of Newport Beach, which bid about $30 
million. Centex officials would not disclose the exact purchase price. 
</P>
<P>
 Roland Osgood, president of Kaufman & Broad's Orange County division, 
confirmed that his company bid about $45 million for the land -- an indication 
that the Centex bid must have been only slightly higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Lots in Foothill Ranch reportedly went for $80,000 to $100,000 when William 
Lyon Co. bought the property at the peak of the market. Centex's purchase price 
was about $50,000 per lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyon, one of Southern California's largest home builders, has run into trouble 
in recent years as the slowdown in home sales forced it to cut prices. That put 
the company behind on its own payments for land acquisition and construction 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyon has sold only 451 homes in its Foothill Ranch developments, or about a 
third of the houses it had planned to build, a spokesman for the community said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The spokesman said the sale to Centex will "mean more construction and more 
people moving in." 
</P>
<P>
 Wal-Mart, Target and Mervyn's plan to open stores in the Foothill Ranch 
community later this year, and a 24-screen movie theater is also planned.

 Medical Device Firm Curtails Operations: Cardiac Science Inc., which has 
become known more for its role in the recent ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc. imbroglio 
than for its automatic heart defibrillator, said it has shut down engineering 
operations but will continue to be operated by its president. The Irvine 
research and development company, which has no revenue and lost $1.1 million in 
the first nine months of last year, is struggling to raise $5 million as it 
seeks federal approval to continue testing its defibrillator, which 
automatically sends an electrical shock to the heart when in senses cardiac 
arrest. Howard K. Cooper, the company's president and now its only employee, 
was part of dissident ICN shareholder Rafi Khan's failed bid to unseat Milan 
Panic as ICN chairman.

 Ford Recalls 1988 Trucks: About 31,500 of the company's Ranger compact pickup 
trucks with 2.0-liter engines are being recalled because their emissions may be 
excessive.Tests done by Detroit-based Ford Motor Co. and the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency show that the trucks could exceed allowable U.S. and Canadian 
levels of nitrogen oxides. About 3,800 of the trucks were sold in Canada, Ford 
said. Ford will make all repairs for free at authorized dealerships. The repair 
includes replacement of the exhaust catalyst and exhaust gas recirculation 
valve.

JAZZ REVIEW; WILSON EMERGES WITH A VOICE FOR THE '90S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The only problem with Cassandra Wilson's Los Angeles debut at the Troubadour 
on Thursday was that it ended too soon. In her brief, one-night-only 
performance, the eclectically talented singer made it clear that she is one of 
the important emerging jazz voices of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she has been on the scene for a few years, touching styles ranging 
from pop and folk to rhythm & blues, Wilson's current album, "Blue Light 'Til 
Dawn," showcases a dramatically focused new music style. Much of the repertoire 
for her Troubadour set was drawn from the recording, and she sang it with the 
joyous elan of an artist who has been reborn. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the high points: a revealing look at Van Morrison's "Tupelo Honey," a 
seductive rendering of Robert Johnson's blues classic "Come On in My Kitchen," 
penetrating readings of Joni Mitchell's "Black Crow" and Ann Peebles' "I Can't 
Stand the Rain" and -- especially -- an exquisite interpretation of her own 
song "Redbone." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson was aided immeasurably by five brilliant musicians who functioned in 
equal creative partnership -- pushing and pulling, teasing and demanding, 
constantly finding unexpected ways to interact with Wilson's vocals. 
</P>
<P>
 Guitarist Brandon Ross produced most of the spare, but precise arrangements 
that were at the heart of the music, and violinist-mandolinist Charlie Burnham, 
bassist Lonnie Plaxico, drummer Lance Carter and percussionist Jeff Haynes 
added nonpareil solo and ensemble work. DON HECKMAN

THEATER REVIEW; UCI FINDS POETRY IN ARRESTING EARLY ONE-ACT BY FUGARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 South African playwright Athol Fugard spends his time these days writing about 
apartheid fallout, the results of the alleged abandonment of that heinous 
social order. But he made his name with the righteous anger behind the often 
poetic, and sometimes humorous, tone of his earlier work. 
</P>
<P>
 One such play is "Statements After an Arrest Under the Immorality Act," 
inspired by the vivid, real-life police photographs of a black man and a white 
woman after their discovery in a Cape Town love nest in 1972. The anger and 
bitter honesty of Fugard's dramatic setting are vividly present in a production 
playing through Sunday at UC Irvine's Village Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 But more important, director Eli Simon has found the rich lyricism and the 
earthy humor in Fugard's writing. He conducts the one-act drama like a chamber 
concerto, with a light touch that is often giddy in its affection for the human 
comedy and yet can reverberate with thundering effect when the action warrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon's staging is impeccable, theatrically mesmerizing even on a bare stage 
dressed only with a blanket on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 The director's concept is expertly realized in the lighting design by Alison 
Brummer, the two nude characters often in the dimmest shadow in the darkened 
room where their love finds its fulfillment, moving like a musical theme into 
and out of the soft evening light filtering through the closed curtains of a 
single window. 
</P>
<P>
 The setting is a microcosm, its own world, that eventually explodes with 
dramatic force as police camera flashbulbs rip apart Fugard's tender mood and 
the lovers' sanctity. 
</P>
<P>
 Demetra Tseckares and Kelly Perine are stunning in the truth, passion, 
tenderness and compassion they realize in their performances, and for their 
expert dialects. Tseckares, as librarian Freida Joubert, has the gentle 
dependence of a spinster who has found her first love with a forbidden partner 
and a sense of the profound fire burning within her. 
</P>
<P>
 Perine's joy and sense of humor as Errol Philander is only at the surface of 
his characterization. Behind it is the firm solidarity of a man dedicated to 
doing right and the integrity of his belief in the rightness of his love. 
</P>
<P>
 Freida and Errol speak worlds to each other, the small things of passing days, 
the wonder of the words of great thinkers, the simple games that lovers play to 
bridge moments of unease, the flights their love takes as it forms into 
impossible dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 It is all shattered by their arrest. And the arresting officer, 
Detective-Sergeant J. du Preez, speaks with the voice of white South Africa, 
with a self-satisfied authority that believes nothing is more important than 
forcing others to believe as you believe, to think as you think. This sense of 
complacent national bigotry is perfectly framed in the calm, pious performance 
of Todd Denning as Du Preez. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no credit for the subtle and evocative sound design, with authentic 
music and the faint sound of dogs barking in the distance, that helps create 
the world of Freida and Errol, a world that is to them so right, so ordained, 
that Errol speaks to every South African when he calls out, "They can't 
interfere with God anymore!"

DANCE REVIEW; MCKAYLE'S 'GUMBO' PREMIERES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first program this week by the San Francisco Ballet concentrated on 
plotless musical visualizations. The second, which included the world premiere 
of Donald McKayle's "Gumbo Ya-Ya," Thursday at the War Memorial Opera House, 
was devoted to rituals of community. 
</P>
<P>
 The actual world premiere of "Gumbo" (which means: everybody talk at once) was 
supposed to have happened at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in 
Washington, which commissioned the work. But a strike there prevented that from 
happening. The Kennedy Center would prefer that the world regard the San 
Francisco performance as a mere preview, but a premiere is a premiere is a 
premiere. Washington will see it in May. 
</P>
<P>
 In comparison to David Bintley's gesture-obsessed "The 'Wanderer' Fantasy" and 
Redha's fetishistic "La Pavane Rouge," which bracketed it on the program, 
McKayle's "Gumbo" was sweet and easy to accept, if rather simplistically 
feel-good and didactic. 
</P>
<P>
 The message is that humankind in a state of nature is more authentic and free 
and blissfully, harmoniously happy than when living in an urban environment, 
among skyscrapers that suggest the Big Apple. Ah, no argument there. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of things helped to make this Romantic vision palatable. A. Christina 
Giannini's slinkly colorful costumes and stylized scenic designs evoked no 
specific time or place or ethnic group, and so the three-part ballet 
("Gathering," "Safe Harbor" and "Migration") unfolded as a kind of parable or 
fairy tale. No real history had to intrude. 
</P>
<P>
 Secondly, McKayle, a professor of dance at UC Irvine as well as a Tony Award 
nominee and respected modern dance choreographer, crafted kinetic, evocative 
movements that suited his varying purposes deftly, if not with great depth. He 
made the company look springy, versatile and alert. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, Yuri Zhukov brought charisma to the role of the shaman figure; 
Eric Hoisington and Muriel Maffre danced the convoluted central pas de deux 
skillfully. 
</P>
<P>
 Flutist James Newton, who also teaches at UCI, composed the original taped 
score, which contained generalized, moody washes of sound punctuated by drum 
beats, bird calls and his own flute solos. 
</P>
<P>
 Bintley's decorative " 'Wanderer' Fantasy" looked like at least 33 ways of 
holding one arm in the air, until it became a kind of salute or statement of 
membership in a group. The gesture perhaps deserves near-permanent retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael McGraw was the fluent piano soloist. Emil de Cou conducted the Liszt 
orchestration of Schubert's piano original in primary colors. 
</P>
<P>
 Redha's seemingly endless "Pavane Rouge" (to a taped collage) had something to 
do with ritual ceremony, social relations and sex among a community of red- and 
black-clad figures sometimes holding black umbrellas who spend their lives 
wandering to quasi-religious music amid five Corinthian-crowned pillars. 
</P>
<P>
 It showed the company at its youthfully alluring best and proved the dancers 
could arch their backs and maintain clear shapes until the cows come home. But 
the pretentiousness of the dance was risible.

DANCE REVIEW; A DRAMA OF RITUALS FROM AMERICAN INDIAN THEATRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Swimming majestically through sprays of light on the the stage of the Cerritos 
Center for the Performing Arts, a masked whale-dancer opens a hypnotic North 
Coast initiation ritual presented by American Indian Dance Theatre on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Worn as a sculptural crown, the whale mask is both a family crest and an 
effigy representing the connection between humans and the natural world. 
</P>
<P>
 This traditional Red Cedar Bark Ceremony (or "Tseka") of the Kwakiutl people 
dramatizes many similar connections, invoking the ancestor figures, nature 
spirits and dark forces that teach the initiate his place in life. 
</P>
<P>
 Dwarfed by enormous birds, dragged screaming into the forest, he is ultimately 
purged of his own blood lust, rewarded and returned to society. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the Kwakiutl people of Alert Bay, British Columbia, live closer to 
whales and ravens than we do. But, even for California theatergoers, these 
images resonate beyond the picturesque, conveying with dark splendor a deeply 
holistic view of nature and of dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1979, the locally based Aman Folk Ensemble mounted its own Kwakiutl winter 
ceremonial -- spelled "Tseyka" -- with faultless dancing and with the 
spectacular masks, robes and other regalia no less authentically reproduced. 
But the special achievement of the American Indian Dance Theatre staging by 
Bill Cranmer is its unwavering focus on the essential social purpose of the 
ceremonial: depicting what each individual must face and learn in order to 
become civilized. 
</P>
<P>
 Dances that teach how to be an accepted member of the community form one whole 
block of the American Indian Dance Theatre repertory. But the company's new 
"Winter Dances" production also showcases other modes of movement expression. 
</P>
<P>
 Partly revised this year, the Plains suite revels in virtuosity, with the 
bravura footwork of soloists George Alexander, Roland Barker and Poncho Brady 
nearly eclipsed by the mesmerizing movement of the tassels and plumage adorning 
their incredibly puffed-up costumes. 
</P>
<P>
 A new suite of Pueblo Winter dances from the Southwest attempts an ambitious 
layering of the workaday and the miraculous. At one extreme, women grind corn, 
and a hoop dancer (the phenomenal Eddie Swimmer) launches ever more intricate 
displays of dexterity. But before and after these village activities we see 
symbolic deer, eagle and buffalo dances of great dignity and weight. 
</P>
<P>
 And, somehow, it doesn't play: Despite the careful contextual scene-setting, 
most of the episodes prove too brief to take an outsider deeper than the 
obvious major contrasts they offer, and the result seems too self-consciously 
panoramic. We're given a survey of pueblo dances but not the experience of them 
-- at least not until the final Hopi Butterfly dance, where the sense of 
community interaction, and the antics of the clowns, involve us in a joyous 
celebration of renewal.

JAZZ REVIEW; ELIANE ELIAS TAKES STEPS TOWARD MAINSTREAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eliane Elias, the pianist from Sao Paulo who arrived in this country 12 years 
ago, revealed in a concert Thursday at Ambassador Auditorium how much headway 
she has made since her early days here, when she toured with the fusion group 
Steps Ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Elias today has a powerful dual personality.While a Latin rhythmic character 
remains prominent in her performances of Brazilian tunes, some of the American 
standards played Thursday reveal the extent to which she has moved into the 
jazz mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 This was particularly evident in a medley of "All the Things You Are" and 
"Bouncing With Bud," the latter a tribute to her idol, Bud Powell. "Alone 
Together" and "I Love You" again found her in rhythmically propulsive form. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, some of the Brazilian pieces came off less effectively. "Waters 
of March" and "Desafinado" were too often buried in off-the-wall variations. 
More attractive was an unaccompanied, unannounced solo number. 
</P>
<P>
 On most tunes Elias benefited from a valuable rhythm section. John Patitucci's 
bass pushes the envelope of the instrument's potential; he is a true giant, and 
in Peter Erskine he has a partner whose drums adapt themselves equally well to 
the straight-ahead and Brazilian works. The company of players like these has 
undoubtedly contributed to Elias' slow but sure evolution over the past decade.

TV REVIEWS; NUN FACES REALITY IN 'BODY AND SOUL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was a time when Hollywood frequently made movies about religious 
subjects. Nuns and priests were particularly popular and were interpreted with 
unwavering fervor by many of the biggest stars of the day (Ingrid Bergman, 
Audrey Hepburn, Jennifer Jones, Spencer Tracy, Pat O'Brien, Bing Crosby). 
</P>
<P>
 That was then. Nobody would make a movie like "Going My Way" or "Song of 
Bernadette" today. On the other hand, nobody back then would have dared make a 
movie about a wavering nun standing naked before a mirror like the woman in 
"Masterpiece Theatre's" four-part "Body and Soul" (at 9 p.m. Sunday on KCET-TV 
Channel 28 and KPBS-TV Channel 15, 8 p.m. on KVCR-TV Channel 24). 
</P>
<P>
 A 34-year-old nun who's spent her entire adult life in a strict convent deep 
in the Welsh countryside is rudely dispatched into the real world to take care 
of family affairs after her brother is killed in a car crash. The nun's first 
encounter in 16 years with modern British life (billboards, short skirts, 
magazines filled with sex, her first adult contacts with men) is poignantly 
established by British actress Kristin Scott Thomas as Sister Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
 The luminous Thomas -- who's particularly effective in the nunnery scenes, 
where incredible silences and intense denial render conversation and touching 
taboo -- reflects the pale beauty of an angel in a Botticelli painting. 
</P>
<P>
 But this miniseries, directed by Moira Armstrong and adapted by Paul Hines 
from a 1991 novel by Marcelle Bernstein, is really two alternating stories: one 
about the outer serenity and inner turmoil of an equivocating nun and the other 
a secular drama about the nun's efforts to put her pregnant sister-in-law's 
life back together and salvage her family's floundering mill from the clutches 
of a scheming mill manager (the wonderfully callow, venal Anthony Valentine, 
who nearly steals the movie). 
</P>
<P>
 "Body and Soul" indeed. It's a tale of a lust for life vying with spiritual 
vows, but told with a tone more calm than histrionic, eschewing melodrama and 
cheap sentiment. Bristling Drama in 'Emergency' 
</P>
<P>
 "State of Emergency" (at 8 tonight on HBO), set entirely in a public 
hospital's war zone of an emergency room, is bristling advocacy drama about an 
urban health-care system in shocking disarray. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospitals have been the setting of so many movies and TV dramas that the 
subject may seem exhausted. But this crackling teleplay, based on the real-life 
experiences of a veteran emergency room physician (Dr. Lance Gentile), proves 
how rigorous and timely the form can be. 
</P>
<P>
 The plot is basic life-and-death material: A family man (Paul Dooley) suffers 
head injuries in a car crash on a downtown L.A. freeway (in a screeching 
sequence that sets the breakneck tone of the whole movie). All the city's 
emergency rooms are shuttered except the understaffed, ill-equipped county 
hospital, where the traumatized victim is deposited in an atmosphere that 
resembles a hospital in Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 Treated brusquely by the harried staff, he's plopped unattended on a gurney 
for four hours as his condition deteriorates to the point where a doctor (Joe 
Mantegna) makes a moral choice to exceed his medical expertise and perform 
necessary neurosurgery. At risk is his job and the future of the hospital, 
which is in the midst of merging with a private management firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Lesli Linka Glatter, co-writers Gentile and Susan Black and 
Mantegna's smoldering, foul-mouthed doctor give the movie a visceral, 
documentary-like urgency. Anyone who has ever set foot in the emergency room at 
County-USC will instinctively identify with the medical chaos here. 
</P>
<P>
 But be cautioned that the application of scalpels, medical saws and one 
flinch-provoking cranium incision are exceedingly graphic and unnerving. RAY

HABITAT FORMING; O.C. GARDENERS TAKE A WILD APPROACH TO INSTALLING CREATURE 
COMFORTS IN THE BACK YARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON COHOON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One yard is alive with butterflies; another has an alligator sunning itself. 
One is a small lot on a hilltop; another is the common grounds of a townhouse 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
 What they have in common is a welcome mat for wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 Scores of Orange County gardeners have joined the Backyard Wildlife Habitat 
program of the National Wildlife Federation -- many in the past year -- in an 
effort to lure more wild creatures to their yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Backyard Wildlife Habitat program was inaugurated by the federation in 
1973 to encourage homeowners to make gardens more hospitable to wildlife by 
providing them with four basic necessities: food, water, cover and a place to 
raise young. 
</P>
<P>
 Supplying these basics is easier than people think and doesn't require a total 
revamping of existing landscaping, according to Craig Tufts, national manager 
of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something as simple as adding a birdbath can make a big difference," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Every small step helps, too, Tufts says. "Loss of habitat is the No. 1 threat 
to wildlife," he says. "We can help counteract that loss by creating thousands 
of mini-refuges across the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Interest in the habitat program is at an all-time high, Tufts says. One reason 
is the federation's recent success in dispelling some misconceptions about its 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't need a country estate to create a viable habitat, for instance. 
Tufts' own yard, Habitat No. 2364, is less than a quarter acre. Yet it contains 
more than 300 varieties of plants ("Diversity is key to a successful habitat," 
he says) and attracts more than 40 kinds of butterflies. 
</P>
<P>
 A garden doesn't have to look "wild" to qualify as a habitat either. The 
approximately 12,000 gardens certified under the federation's program are as 
different as their owners, Tufts says. "Some are very naturalistic, but others 
are surprisingly formal." 
</P>
<P>
 Here are five of the distinctive back-yard wildlife habitats in Orange County: 
</P>
<P>
 Shady Oasis 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen years ago, the Corona del Mar garden of Ron and Brigitta Yeo was among 
the first in the county to become certified by the federation. Though this 
property is quite modest in size -- 30-by-118-foot, half of which is house -- 
it, too, supports a varied wildlife population. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yeos' yard is dark and jungly. The mature pines, sycamores and Chinese elm 
that originally enticed the Yeos into buying the property now attract many 
species of birds for cover and nesting sites. So does the giant bamboo the Yeos 
added later. 
</P>
<P>
 The flowers that thrive under this canopy of shade tend toward the exotic -- 
orchids, begonias, clivia, epiphyllum.  
</P>
<P>
 The visual focal point of the garden -- a 6-by-12-foot pond stocked with 
goldfish and water lilies -- is also a wildlife magnet. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pool is the heart of the yard," Ron Yeo says. "It's the source of the 
life here. It's what really draws in the animals." 
</P>
<P>
 Aquatic insects begin the chain, as well as the occasional amphibian, then 
birds of all sorts -- attracted by the insects as well as the water -- and 
finally a nocturnal parade of mammals -- raccoon, skunk and opossum. 
</P>
<P>
 "They come in sets -- almost like work shifts," Yeo says. "It's great fun to 
watch them arrive (from the window of the living room)." 
</P>
<P>
 The Yeos' garden illustrates several points, according to Tufts. One is the 
importance of water: "It's the most overlooked requirement of wildlife, 
especially in urban areas."  
</P>
<P>
 Another is the value of considering property from a vertical as well as 
horizontal point of view regarding its potential for animals. "Animals live at 
different levels, which means you can support more than you think, even in a 
small yard," he says. Small Cottage Garden 
</P>
<P>
 This minuscule cottage garden full of roses, perennials and herbs is high in 
the Orange hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner, who asked that her name not be used, said her primary aim in 
creating a habitat was attracting more birds and butterflies. Toward this 
purpose she put in a concrete, pedestaled birdbath, two regular bird feeders 
and a hummingbird feeder. All these amenities proved wildly attractive to the 
local avian population; they were discovered immediately and are put to use 
daily. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the feeders are the main attraction to her yard, she believes the seeds 
of many of her favorite cottage flowers also turn out to be avian treats. 
</P>
<P>
 "Birds love my alyssum seeds," she says. "So do the cottontails that come to 
nibble on my grass. Birds like my feverfew seeds too. And my stock, sweet peas, 
hollyhocks and nasturtiums."  
</P>
<P>
 Butterflies are attracted to the nectar of many of these flowers, as they are 
to the lovage and dill in the herb bed. To attract even more butterflies, the 
homeowner is putting in additional caterpillar fodder -- such as a South 
African milkweed bought at UCI Arboretum -- and is ordering a butterfly nesting 
box and feeder from a garden catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
 The coloration of this garden may be a little more vivid than most cottage 
gardens. Butterflies hone in on purple, and hummingbirds on red and orange, so 
these colors were chosen over pastels. But otherwise there's nothing here that 
shrieks "habitat." Yet this tiny garden supports a rich ecosystem. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason is its absence of chemicals. Pet rabbits provide superb fertilizer; 
no pesticides are used. ("Pesticides and wildlife are basically incompatible," 
Tufts says.) Birds and lizards keep the insect population in check. Tropical 
Jungle 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Amodio's half-acre-plus property in Laguna Niguel is heavily canopied, 
and walking through the gate into this habitat feels like walking into the San 
Diego Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
 Stepping over the full-grown American alligator sunning itself on the bridge 
over a pond may have something to do with it. (There's a second alligator in a 
separate pond; Amodio raised both from eggs.) An exotic pheasant does a mating 
dance; koi swim in a third pond, and a pot-bellied pig and lop-eared rabbit 
roam the property freely. A walk-in aviary is filled with African starlings, 
Peking robins and other exotic birds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had a zoo around me since I was a kid," Amodio says. 
</P>
<P>
 Mature eucalyptus trees provide the uppermost tier, and palms, bananas and 
bamboo fill out the understory. All were planted by Amodio. 
</P>
<P>
 This Australian-style forest provides abundant habitat for the local avian 
population. "Nine vultures comes to roost here every night," Amodio says. 
"Crows, ravens and hawk visit regularly, and I've seen orioles here the last 
few years." 
</P>
<P>
 Amodio provides food for his avian clientele as well as cover and water. Half 
a dozen bird feeders dot the property, and on his sunny back slope he's put in 
blackberry and raspberry bushes and a fig tree and, for the hummingbirds, 
nectar-rich hibiscus shrubs. Edge of the Wilderness 
</P>
<P>
 John Albritton and Paulette Cullen's property in Laguna Canyon is like a zoo, 
too. Only all the animals in it are wild. 
</P>
<P>
 "We live on the edge of civilization, close to a greenbelt and have a creek 
running through our back yard," Albritton says. "It's like a highway for 
animals. We don't have to lure them here. I don't think we could keep them 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 The property was already a good habitat when the couple bought it. That was 
one of its attractions. It contains several mature pecan trees that attract 
raccoons, woodpeckers, blue jays and other birds, dense oleander shrubs that 
house noisy flocks of sparrows and finches and a thick mat of ivy edging the 
creek that is home to insects, spiders and small rodents. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple have seen a red-tailed hawk capture prey in their yard, a fledgling 
hawk test its wings on their roof, a barn owl perch on their fence, a blue 
heron fish their creek and a family of skunks sleep under their porch. 
</P>
<P>
 No pets or chemicals help make this a successful habitat. But mostly, they 
say, its their philosophy of leaving things alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't rake away leaf litter, and we prune very lightly, if at all," 
Albritton says. "Some of our relatives can't visit without wanting to break out 
the hedge clippers, but we like the feeling like we're in the middle of a 
wilderness." Condominium Community 
</P>
<P>
 The Tiburon townhome complex in Fountain Valley is one of the most recent 
applicants in the county to be certified by the Wildlife Federation. The 
project is still in its early stages but is seen as having the potential to 
become a significant habitat for wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents of the 513-unit complex made the decision to turn their land 
into a habitat after they were frustrated with the disruption of plant and 
animal life in a high-maintenance landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have now is late hodgepodge," says Jim Christman, resident and 
chairman of the planning committee for the environmental project. "What we want 
is plants that require less water, less maintenance and that will provide more 
support for birds and butterflies." 
</P>
<P>
 The mature trees on this 50-acre property already attract many species of 
birds, but residents of the community think they can do much better. 
</P>

 "Instead of turf and foundation plantings, we envision a series of pocket 
parks, butterflies gardens and strands of trees. Eventually we want Tiburon to 
look like a natural landscape that just happens to contain buildings."

<P>
 It's the kind of vision the Backyard Wildlife Habitat program wishes more 
people would have. A Wildlife-Friendly Yard 
</P>
<P>
 The ideal back-yard wildlife habitat for our area would be composed primarily 
of indigenous plants. Native plants are not only ideally suited to our soil and 
weather, but they have a proven track record of supporting local wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some indigenous plants suggested by Earthscaping Designs of Laguna 
Beach that can be used to create a wildlife-friendly yard:

CONSTRUCTION; DESIGNER HAS DIRT ON EARTHEN HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY BRYANT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The recent fires, mudslides and earthquakes are forcing many to rethink the 
way contemporary homes are built. Ironically, one of today's best construction 
materials is right under our feet: earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Non-polluting and easily available, soil is constantly being created. Much of 
it, such as decomposed granite, is perfect for ramming back into rock-hard 
walls. The construction technique, known as "rammed earth," has been used since 
earliest times to create homes that are energy-efficient and strong.  
</P>
<P>
 Designer/builder David Easton, who grew up in Anaheim, has spent 18 years 
researching and developing methods for forming, reinforcing, stabilizing, 
compacting and finishing earthen structures for modern use. The basic technique 
-- which has been used on nearly every continent in the world -- is to compact, 
or ram, prepared moist soil inside a sturdy wooden form to create solid, 
monolithic walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the ancient construction technique with a few new twists, Easton has 
created more than 100 modern earth-walled projects. His company, based in Napa, 
is called Rammed Earth Works. 
</P>
<P>
 The buildings constructed with the technique include a pet hospital in Santa 
Inez, single family residences, winery buildings and the 3,000-square-foot home 
Easton and his wife, Cynthia Wright, share in the Napa Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Easton, a 1964 graduate of Anaheim High School, was strongly influenced by the 
architecture of the California missions and by the Craftsman buildings of his 
grandfather, builder-designer Louis B. Easton. After graduating from Stanford 
with a degree in engineering, David Easton embarked on developing the processes 
and the documentation required to educate people about the construction 
advantages of the once-venerated material, earth. 
</P>
<P>
 "This way of building was very popular in the '30s and '40s," Easton said. 
"There are old rammed-earth houses in Los Angeles and San Diego. In fact, 
artist Millard Sheets' house in Claremont was constructed that way." Renowned 
architects including Frank Lloyd Wright, Le Corbusier and Bernard Maybeck have 
designed earth-walled houses. 
</P>
<P>
 As Easton explained, in the years during and immediately after the Depression, 
building materials were scarce, but there was plenty of labor available. People 
were willing to build their own homes and had the time, if not the money. 
Underfoot was the dirt-cheap building material they needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we developed the powerful machinery to process trees quickly into 
lumber, mass-produced tract houses took the United States by storm," Easton 
said. "These were the decades of building euphoria. Now, however, we're 
entering a new era, and we want houses to be better built and to last longer. A 
rammed-earth house will last for centuries." 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Easton said, "imagine our children having to bulldoze all the 
'fast tract' houses we're building, carting the refuse off to be buried in a 
landfill and replacing them with other homes which will be bulldozed." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The solid, reinforced earth walls of Easton's Napa Valley home -- named 1993 
Pacific Gas & Electric Energy Showcase Home -- are up to two feet thick. They 
keep the air inside the house cool in the summer and warm in the winter. "We do 
not have air conditioning in our Napa house, and we don't need it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Good solar orientation is essential for a thermal mass building for passive 
winter performance. Easton installed hydronic radiant heating directly into the 
structural slab as a supplemental heat source. One of the added bonuses of 
those thick walls is almost total soundproofing, a real bonus in high density 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The ideal soil to create a rammed-earth house has a blend of coarse particles 
for strength and fine particles for binding. The ratio of coarse to fine varies 
depending on the soil type, but typically 30% clay and 70% sand will yield a 
durable wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Modern rammed-earth builders add 7% to 10% Portland cement to their earth 
mixes to achieve even greater strength and moisture resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Easton has been developing a new method for building the solid earth walls. 
He's dubbed this new technique PISE, an acronym for Pneumatically Impacted 
Stabilized Earth. ( Pise de terre is the French phrase for rammed earth.)  
</P>
<P>
 According to Easton, the PISE process uses existing technology and equipment 
to "shoot" a soil and cement mixture against a one-sided form. PISE is a much 
faster method than traditional rammed earth. It requires less than half the 
form work and uses powerful mixing and delivery equipment. It took a work crew 
only three days to complete the installation of the walls for Easton's home. 
</P>
<P>
 The PISE way, Easton said, has other advantages over traditional rammed earth. 
Because the soil mixture is installed at a higher moisture content, it binds 
better with a steel reinforcing grid to create a wall system that affords even 
greater earthquake safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Existing trades are easily incorporated into the process: Carpenters set the 
plywood forms; ironworkers tie the reinforcing steel; electricians and plumbers 
install conduits, pipes and chases. Once the walls are finished, the plywood, 
2-by-4s and form work can be dismantled and recycled into interior partitions 
and roof sheathing. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of construction varies significantly depending upon the design of the 
home and how it is finished. Easton said the cost per square foot of 
rammed-earth homes he has built ranges from $60 to $200. In conventional 
construction, he estimated the cost per square foot is about $100. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The color of the exterior is determined by the soil used, with choices ranging 
from reddish brown to slate gray -- "earth tones," Easton joked. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is to use dirt from the building site. It can be supplemented with 
nearby soils to get the right balance of clay and sand.  
</P>
<P>
 Because the color is intrinsic in the soil, there is never any maintenance or 
repainting. "Select a nice-colored soil and then stabilize it with cement. It 
will never change, only develop the soft patina of age," Easton said. "Many of 
our clients even appreciate the look of unfinished earth on the interior 
surfaces as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who prefer a traditional look can finish the interior walls with plaster 
or drywall. If drywall is used, the plywood form on the interior is left in 
place and the drywall attached to it. Interior walls and partitions are 
constructed separately, usually of conventional materials such as wood and 
drywall. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the house is constructed, it can be expected to last a very long time. 
</P>
<P>
 The rammed earth technique has long been common throughout North Africa and 
the Middle East, with many cities and villages boasting earth buildings 
occupied continuously for hundreds of years. 
</P>
<P>
 Portions of the Great Wall of China are of rammed earth, as are many of 
China's contemporary houses. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1926 U.S. Department of Agriculture bulletin cites, among other projects, a 
house in Washington, D.C., built of rammed earth in 1773 and still in use. 
</P>
<P>
 In France, pise de terre dates to Roman times. Its use is being revitalized 
with work by the group CRATerre and a university-level study program in earth 
architecture. 
</P>
<P>
 Other nations also reviving their earth construction heritage are Denmark, 
Germany, New Zealand and Australia, especially in Western Australia, which is 
plagued with termites and little usable timber. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among the key concerns addressed in engineering the homes for use in this area 
was earthquake safety, Easton said. "We used the results of extensive 
field-testing (California's 200-year adobe heritage) and proven engineering 
principles to design what we believe are extremely dependable buildings." 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the rammed earth houses constructed in Southern California -- one in 
Borrego Springs and one in Malibu -- were subjected to recent earthquakes and 
came through without damage, Easton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Contractors and owner-builders who have taken Easton's seminars and workshops 
have applied the technique to buildings as small as 500 square feet to as large 
as 5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Easton, obviously, would like to see the material being used in developments 
everywhere in order to show that resource-sensitive construction techniques can 
provide sustainable alternatives to modern practices. 
</P>
<P>
 "I build with earth to show what can be done," Easton said. 
</P>
<P>
 David Easton will explain how earth construction can be used in luxury and 
affordable housing and describe the PISE method at 7 p.m. Wednesday at the 
Orange County offices of the AIA, 3200 Park Center Drive, Suite 110, Costa 
Mesa. Admission is $10 for members of Eos Institute, ADPSR or the AIA; $15 for 
the public; $5 for full-time students. Any homeowners rebuilding after the fire 
will be admitted free.

ASK THE HANDYMAN / JOHN MORELL: UNLESS YOU HAVE KNOW-HOW, MARBLE INSTALLING IS 
A JOB BEST LEFT TO PROS

 Question: We're considering installing marble tile in our foyer. We'd like to 
do it ourselves, but have been told that working with marble requires special 
tools. Is that the case? 
</P>
<P>
 W.E. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: "Installing a marble floor is probably a job best left for a 
professional, unless you know just what you're doing," says Becky Gonzales of 
Anaheim Centsible Tile. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a natural product, and the tiles aren't necessarily uniform in 
thickness. If you lay it just like a factory-made tile, you'll probably notice 
that some of the tiles are higher than others. A professional will float it in 
a half-inch mortar bed, which allows you to vary the height of each tile to 
make them level." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We have Berber carpeting in our home and have received contradictory advice 
on how to clean it. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it better to have it dry-cleaned or cleaned normally with hot water or 
steam? 
</P>
<P>
 J.N. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills 
</P>
<P>
 A: "Berber is a different type of weave, but it's the same fiber as other 
types of carpeting," says Harvey Tessier of Colonial Carpeting in Westminster. 
"You don't have to dry-clean it; it can be cleaned by other methods. It's 
similar to nylon, so there shouldn't be a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We have some cracks and small holes in our drywall where we had furniture 
bump against the walls in one room. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the cracks are bad, and some are hairline. How do you make the 
decision about when to patch the drywall and when to replace it? 
</P>
<P>
 E.D. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
 A: "It's unusual for drywall to be cracked all the way through," says Pete 
Gorman of Rancho Lumber in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 "Drywall is made with a sheet of paper covering it, and this is sometimes 
given a textured coating. You may see cracks that look like it's all the way 
through the drywall, but it's just a crack in the coating. This can be patched 
with drywall mud or an interior spackle. The small holes can be patched using a 
drywall patch kit, available at most hardware stores, or you can do it yourself 
with drywall mud." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We have a china cabinet that's about 60 years old, and we have no key for 
its lock. Is there a way to find a skeleton key for it? 
</P>
<P>
 D.D. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove 
</P>
<P>
 A: "The best way to find out is to get the lock out if you can," says Ford 
Higgens of Carolina Craftsmen in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a skeleton key available that can open 75% to 80% of the 
old-fashioned locks out there, but, of course, there are no guarantees. These 
kind of keys are in great demand, so anyone who sells quality furniture 
hardware should carry them. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have a lock that doesn't work with the skeleton key, blank keys are 
available for antique hardware, and you'll have to have a locksmith cut one for 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I've seen some material that looks like Silly Putty that you apply to the 
bottom of your figurines and crystal and supposedly will keep them from moving 
during an earthquake. Does it work? 
</P>
<P>
 A.S. 
</P>
<P>
 Yorba Linda 
</P>
<P>
 A: "These kinds of fixes are available, and they can help," says glass 
repairman Steve Gracie of Anaheim, "but they're just an option. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have some glass figurines on a shelf, you may want to consider putting 
a very fine string of monofilament along the shelf to prevent them from falling 
off. Wood shelves can also be modified by placing a strip of thin molding along 
them to act as a 'lip' that protects collectibles or plates from sliding off. 
</P>
<P>
 "On some small china items, some people even put a tiny patch of Velcro on the 
piece and the shelf to hold it in place if the house starts shaking or even if 
someone bumps into the shelf."

DO-IT-YOURSELF; TAPPING THE SOURCE FOR HOT WATER OUTSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Have you ever wondered, maybe while washing the car, filling the kiddie pool 
or handling any of a dozen other outdoor water chores, why someone hasn't 
designed a hot-and-cold-water outdoor faucet? 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, such faucets do exist, and have been used at the commercial level 
for years. But for some reason, they've seldom made the trip to the residential 
side of the street. 
</P>
<P>
 It could be because they're a bit pricey ($225 to $250), but more likely, it's 
because few of us know that they exist. 
</P>
<P>
 If you decide you would benefit from having an outdoor hot water faucet, 
installing one in a typically framed house is relatively easy for a confident 
do-it-yourselfer. 
</P>
<P>
 Begin by choosing a joist space convenient to both outdoor watering tasks and 
indoor plumbing lines. Because the body of the valve must fit through a sizable 
opening in the rim joist, you'll need to cut (not drill) the siding and joist. 
Position the faucet in a convenient location, then mark the siding for the 
faucet body cutout using a level. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the cutout is marked, bore saw blade entry holes at the four corners. Use 
a one-quarter-inch bit for good clearance. Then, cut between the holes by using 
a reciprocating saw or sabre saw. Once the opening is cut, check the faucet for 
fit. Apply a bead of caulk to the rim of the opening and press the faucet in 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 Before fitting any piping to the faucet, install the check valves in the hot 
and cold mixing-valve ports. With the water shut off at the meter and the 
piping system drained, cut into your home's hot and cold water supply lines. 
(Most likely, these lines will be made of copper.)  
</P>
<P>
 To make the connection between the water supply lines and the new faucet, 
splice tees into the trunk lines and continue piping toward the faucet. With 
connections made, solder all fittings with lead-free solder and support the 
piping at least every six feet with pipe hangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many chores, sweat soldering plumbing fittings looks more complicated 
than it is. The basic requirements are simple: Cut the tubing cleanly and 
squarely, and clean all mating surfaces so they are free of dirt and 
contaminants. 
</P>
<P>
 To get a good cut, use a high-quality tubing cutter. And to make sure 
everything is clean, rigorously rub all mating surfaces with steel wool, then 
coat them with flux before joining them. 
</P>
<P>
 Also keep in mind that lead-free solder requires more heat to melt than older 
solders. Just hold your propane torch on each joint longer before applying the 
solder.

DECORATING; NOVELTY PRINTS OFFER A LIVELY WAY TO CHANGE A ROOM'S MOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When you want to wake up a sleepy room, consider an eye-opening novelty print 
fabric for a table skirt, throw cushions, slipcover or window treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Novelty prints, or conversational prints, although easily recognized, are what 
you least expect: lip prints on the bed sheets, for example. They offer a 
relatively inexpensive and quick way to add personal style. But beware. Their 
message can get old fast. 
</P>
<P>
 Years ago, novelty prints were considered too casual and were shunned by 
top-of-the-line designers. Now they are quite fashionable, and there are a lot 
to choose from in the tonier fabric and decorating shops. They are also popular 
mass-market items. 
</P>
<P>
 Licensed motifs offer one form of novelty fabrics. Pro sports logos such for 
NFL teams and cartoon prints such as Mickey Mouse come to mind. There are more 
subtle patterns too. 
</P>
<P>
 New to the market, for instance, are Fiestaware pattern table linens, chair 
pads and pillows from Dakotah. These are fabrics printed with Fiestaware 
plates, either in the brights the dinnerware was made in from 1936 to 1973, or 
pastels, as in more recent issues. Prices range from $4 to $20. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're looking for something more formal, there are historical prints. 
Ancient ruins and motifs such as Greek urns, Roman emperors' heads and 
Renaissance statues decorate fabrics designed by a couple of Londoners, Sue 
Timney and Grahame Fowler. The fabrics start at about $40 a yard to the trade. 
They are marketed by Ramm, Son & Crocker of London through Beacon Hill 
showrooms in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Specialty fabrics give rooms originality, style and personality together with 
a focal point," Timney says. "The fabric dictates the mood of the room. This 
reverses the more usual situation in which the fabric is an accessory to the 
furniture." 
</P>
<P>
 Motifs that are large enough can be cut out and glued on to walls, decorative 
screens or other surfaces for a special touch. 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't want to face a major redo when your novelty fabric ceases to 
amuse, consider conversational prints in small doses, such as in an 
unconstructed slipcover on a dining chair, a cushion cover or a table skirt. 
These projects are quick and easy, and the fabric is readily replaced when you 
tire of it. 
</P>
<P>
 But wherever you put it, make sure your conversational print makes a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would do a whole chair or all the pillows, not just one pillow, because too 
little won't be noticed," designer Nina Campbell says. "Don't lose your nerve, 
and don't ask your girlfriend. Just do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell, who has an international design and home furnishings business based 
in London, recently used a novelty fabric in a big way to brighten a library 
for a New York client. The room was filled with what she calls serious antique 
furniture, and all but the top quarter of the walls were filled with built-in 
dark wood bookcases. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found a deep red fabric with crazy animals and used it all the way around 
the room to fill the space between the bookcases and the ceiling and then did 
curtains to match," Campbell says. "Suddenly, this dark room developed a 
personality. It became funny and charming." 
</P>
<P>
 When possible, Campbell likes to pull a real object depicted in the print and 
use it somewhere in the room. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of fabrics are printed with patterns of famous china such as 
Mintonware. In that case, she would find the plate and use it as an accent 
piece. 
</P>
<P>
 Her own fabric called Coromandel features stylized animals such as rabbits, 
monkeys and camels. Figurines of such animals are often seen in antiques shops 
and could be used as accessories. 
</P>
<P>
 Coromandel, which is marketed by Osborne & Little of New York, is available 
through designers.

RENOVATION; NEED CIRCUITS? START WITH THE SERVICE PANEL

<P>
 Two things determine the expansion capacities of your home's electrical 
system. Most important is the amp rating of your service entrance. The other is 
the amount of circuit space left in your service panel. 
</P>
<P>
 To determine the rating of your service panel, open the panel cover and look 
for the amperage designation near the main disconnect. You should see the amp 
rating near the panel's brand name. 
</P>
<P>
 Your ability to install new circuits will depend on the number of breaker or 
fuse spaces left in the panel. A home's wiring will seldom need all the breaker 
slots provided in a 100-amp or greater panel. Each vacant breaker slot will 
hold one new 15- or 20-amp circuit. If you have two vacant slots, your panel 
will accommodate a new 240-volt circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want to expand the service of an older 60-amp system, you'll have to 
determine how much expansion your system will handle. The first thing to do is 
to make a map of your home's existing circuitry. Tracing circuits sounds 
complicated, but it need not be. All you'll need is a floor plan drawing of 
your home and a voltage tester or lamp. 
</P>
<P>
 Start by drawing the perimeter of your home on graph paper. Using a simple 
one-eighth-inch to 1-foot scale (each little square on the graph paper equals 1 
square foot of living space). Draw in approximate locations of all interior 
walls and indicate the location of each outlet box and each permanent light 
fixture. 
</P>
<P>
 Begin by removing the fuse or tripping the breaker on the first circuit in the 
panel. Mark that breaker or fuse No. 1. Then take your voltage tester or lamp 
and plug it into all outlets near the circuit you've just interrupted. In 
addition, determine which light fixtures do not function. On the map next to 
each outlet and light fixture that doesn't work, mark the number 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Now restore power to the No. 1 circuit on the panel and remove the fuse or 
trip the breaker to the next circuit in the panel, and mark that breaker or 
fuse No. 2. Repeat the process for all circuits, being sure to number each 
circuit in the panel. When you are finished, every outlet and fixture on your 
map should have a number. Tape the map to the inside of the panel cover for 
future reference. 
</P>
<P>
 To determine total circuit amperage, each permanent light and outlet should be 
rated at 1.5 amps. This means that a 15-amp fuse or breaker (on No. 14 wire) 
will support 10 outlets. A 20-amp fuse or breaker (on No. 12 wire) will support 
13 outlets. If your mapping identifies a circuit that can support additional 
outlets, you can tap into that circuit at any location to add new outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 If your map identifies two circuits with so few outlets that both circuits 
could be protected by a single fuse or breaker, you can combine those two 
circuits in the panel, thus freeing one whole circuit for expansion.

TIPS TO CULTIVATE A LIVELY BACK YARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Here are some sources of information on converting your garden into a 
back-yard wildlife habitat: 
</P>
<P>
 * Send for the National Wildlife Federation's packet on the Backyard Wildlife 
Habitat program. The packet contains an application form, a booklet on planning 
and planting a habitat, and the paperback "The Backyard Naturalist," describing 
the experiences of the manager of the program in creating a habitat. Send a 
check for $5.25 (includes postage and handling) to the National Wildlife 
Federation, 1400 16th St., N.W., Washington, D.C., 20036-2266, or call its 
toll-free number, (800) 432-6564, to order. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Your Backyard Wildlife Garden," by Marcus Schneck (Rodale Press, 1992, 
$25), is an excellent introduction to the subject. It explains how to look at 
your yard from the viewpoint of an animal, contains many useful charts (such as 
lists of plants to attract hummingbirds and specific butterflies and birds), 
lots of photos for inspiration, fun ideas (such as creating a toad house) and a 
great pictorial glossary in the back with all the common wild creatures likely 
to be attracted to a typical back yard. Even the kids will enjoy referring to 
the glossary. 
</P>
<P>
 * Another good basic book is "Attracting Backyard Wildlife," by Bill Merilees 
(Voyageur Press, 1989, $10.95), available in most libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 * Back-yard habitats from the standpoint of design are featured in 
"Landscaping With Nature," by Jeff Cox (Rodale Press, 1991, $27). The author 
explains in detail how to simulate nature in our own back yards and proves that 
doing so is not only more compatible with wildlife but also can be more 
aesthetically pleasing. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Natural Habitat Garden," by Ken Druse (Clarkson Potter, $40) due out in 
March. This third book by writer-photographer Druse on the naturalistic garden 
will emphasize the benefits of native plant gardening and include instructions 
for firescaping. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sea & Sage, the local chapter of the Audubon Society, can help you learn 
what kinds of birds you can expect to attract. Call (714) 261-7963 for 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Butterflies of Greater Los Angeles" is an illustrated guide to the 106 
species in the area. Order from Theodore Payne Foundation, (818) 768-1802. 
About $8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fullerton Arboretum propagates many native plant species for its weekend 
plant sales. Call (714) 773-3579 for more information. Tree of Life Nursery in 
San Clemente is another good local source of native plants. (714) 728-0685. 
</P>
<P>
 * For inspiration, visit some gardens that are already good habitats. Hortense 
Miller's in Laguna Beach is a good one. Call the city of Laguna Beach at (714) 
494-0716 to make reservations for a tour. For ideas on how to incorporate 
native plants into the landscaping, visit the Home Demonstration Garden at the 
Santa Barbara Botanic Garden, (805) 682-0988; the Rancho Santa Ana Botanical 
Garden, (909) 625-8767 in Claremont, or the Theodore Payne Foundation, (818) 
768-1802 in Sun Valley. SHARON COHOON

LINCOLN CLUB WANTS EL TORO ISSUE ON BALLOT; BASE REUSE: INFLUENTIAL O.C. GROUP 
SAYS DECISION IS TOO BIG TO BE LEFT TO POLITICIANS. SUPERVISORS HAVE RESISTED 
VOTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Frustrated by the political indecision over the future use of the El Toro 
Marine Corps Air Station, an influential conservative political group is 
pushing for a countywide vote on the issue this November. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lincoln Club, using the results of a recent poll showing Orange County 
residents divided over the future use of El Toro, plans to pressure the Board 
of Supervisors to place the issue on the November ballot, to let county voters 
decide. 
</P>
<P>
 County supervisors have long opposed a ballot initiative on El Toro because of 
the belief that to do so would be to abdicate their responsibility to plan the 
county's future. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lincoln Club President Doy Henley said Friday that his Republican group 
commissioned the "unbiased, non-conflicting" poll out of concern that county 
officials may decide on a redevelopment plan -- including whether or not to 
place a commercial airport at El Toro -- based on who makes the most noise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought (the El Toro issue) was too big to leave to the politicians to tap 
dance around," Henley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Emphasizing the role that the base is expected to play in reviving the 
county's anemic economy, Henley added: "I think this is a 100-year -- a 
multi-generational -- issue for the county of Orange." 
</P>
<P>
 While the supervisors are not expected to readily agree to put the future of 
El Toro on the ballot, the Lincoln Club's entry into the issue is not likely to 
be ignored since the group's membership roster includes major political 
contributors. 
</P>
<P>
 The club's involvement also indirectly adds momentum to a petition drive for 
an El Toro ballot initiative being organized by a Newport Beach community-based 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley said the Lincoln Club would not be involved in the signature-gathering 
campaign -- many of the club's members are split on whether a commercial 
airport should be included in the base conversion plan -- but some of its 
members are expected to provide funding for the petition drive. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the Lincoln Club is preparing to present the poll results to the 
supervisors "to persuade (them) that an issue like this ought to appear on the 
ballot in a constructive way," Henley said. "I don't think they will" agree. 
</P>
<P>
 The El Toro issue has divided the county since July, when a federal 
base-closure commission voted to shut down the base by 1999. South County 
cities oppose a commercial airport at El Toro out of fear that it will disrupt 
their quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
 After six months of political infighting, the planning for El Toro's 
conversion from military to civilian use was recently turned over to a 
nine-member board that includes the county supervisors, three Irvine council 
members and one Lake Forest council member. 
</P>
<P>
 The business community, South County homeowner associations and council 
members from all 31 Orange County cities will be invited to serve on an 
advisory panel that will pick the top three redevelopment plans for the 
4,700-acre base. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the leading proponents of developing a commercial airport at El Toro 
said the Lincoln Club's involvement shows the "tremendous unrest" over the 
Board of Supervisors' handling of the El Toro planning. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a conservative county, the Lincoln Club is a conservative 
organization, and they are at odds with the Board of Supervisors. It's just 
that simple," said the airport proponent who agreed to talk on condition that 
he not be named. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor William G. Steiner said he would "welcome any material" brought to 
the board by the local business community. 
</P>
<P>
 "But by the same token, I think the process we have in place has to be played 
out. And the business community is going to play a big advisory role in that 
process," Steiner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the creation of the county's El Toro Reuse Planning Authority, Steiner 
said he would have supported a public vote on the matter "only as a last 
resort." 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, we have a leadership structure in place," he said. "Not everybody agrees 
that it is the best one. But on an important issue like this one, you are going 
to find some disagreement. To take this to a vote of the people now would 
create the public perception that elected officials had abdicated their 
authority." 
</P>
<P>
 Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley, who represents the district 
that includes the base, and Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, whose district is next 
to the base, have expressed similar viewpoints in the past. They could not be 
reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, who previously remained open to the idea of a 
ballot measure, also could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Roger R. Stanton, who along with Steiner had earlier proposed a 
ballot measure as a last option, said that the "idea (of a ballot measure) has 
some merit, but I certainly would not want to commit to it" until he has 
reviewed the Lincoln Club's poll results. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton said a non-binding ballot measure to get the public's viewpoint on the 
issue could be included with other "outside data" that will be gathered before 
a final decision is made on El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would not either accept or reject the (ballot) proposal out of hand," 
Stanton added. The Lincoln Club members "are serious about the well-being of 
the county." 
</P>
<P>
 County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider said he was "surprised" that 
such a survey was taken. "I think the (Board of Supervisors) will want to see 
what comes out of the existing process," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Mayor Michael Ward, who is a member of the El Toro Reuse Planning 
Authority, also said it would be premature to hold a public vote before the 
planning process is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't like what we come up with, then take that to the voters," Ward 
said. "Give the (planning) process a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward reiterated that the screening of development options would be neutral. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could have told (the Lincoln Club) the county was split over the airport 
issue," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lincoln Club's poll, taken two weeks ago, asked 400 Orange County 
residents for their opinions on El Toro and the local economy. Several 
base-conversion options were part of the survey, including a regional airport, 
international airport or no airport, said Henley. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley would not release the results, but sources familiar with the poll said 
that opinions on both sides of the airport issue were so close that they fell 
within the margin of error of five points. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were trying to find out . . . how people really feel," Henley said. The 
poll, he added, will be presented to the supervisors as a representation of 
"all the people of Orange County, and not just Lake Forest or Irvine or 
whatever." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the base was placed on the closure list last spring, a Times 
Orange County poll showed there was no consensus on how the base should be 
redeveloped. But 54% disapproved when specifically asked whether the base 
should be converted into an international airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Last September, a UC Irvine poll showed 48% favoring a commercial airport for 
passenger and cargo flights, 42% were opposed and 10% were undecided. The poll 
had a margin of error of plus or minus three points. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 4,700 acres at the base, an airport would take up between 1,500 and 
2,000 acres, officials have estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Either (the Board of Supervisors) put it on the ballot or they assume 
responsibility and do the job they were hired to do," Henley said. "If the 
board is going to run (the El Toro project), they should run it." 
</P>
<P>
 If the issue is not placed on the ballot, Henley added, "then there will be 
the next stage, which would be going through the political deal, getting the 
signatures, which I would hope we would be above that." 
</P>
<P>
 The petition drive for a countywide initiative has not been formally 
announced, and is not expected to be unveiled until next week, at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers must notify the county registrar of voters by March 11 of their 
intent to circulate petitions for a ballot initiative. To qualify for the Nov. 
8 ballot, 66,703 signatures must be gathered and submitted to the county no 
later than June 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Several sources close to the campaign said the ballot petition would call for 
an amendment to the county's General Plan and require that a commercial airport 
be included in the final base-conversion plan for El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the planners for the countywide initiative said privately that business 
community leaders, including some members of the Lincoln Club, have agreed to 
spend between $50,000 and $150,000 on the petition-gathering effort, depending 
on the number of volunteers who are enlisted.

LOVE'S LABORS ARE FOUND IN O.C. FOR VALENTINE'S DAY; ROMANCE: WHILE SOME ARE 
GOING TRADITIONAL ROUTE, OTHERS FIND MORE HEARTFELT AND OFFBEAT WAYS TO MARK 
DAY.

<P>
 The mere mention of Valentine's Day in Orange County this year can conjure up 
images of heart-shaped boxes of chocolates, red silk boxer shorts, popping The 
Question to a loved one, the death penalty . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The death penalty? 
</P>
<P>
 It's not the predicted outcome of a failed romance, but the driving theme 
behind one of the many unusual observations planned to mark Feb. 14 in Orange 
County. Other observances include a surprise proposal of marriage from atop a 
rented white horse to a display of affection for Laguna Canyon's trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Some authorities trace St. Valentine's Day to an ancient Roman fertility 
ritual that is far removed from today's practice of celebrating with cards, 
candy and romance. The history of the saint for whom the holiday is named is 
also vague, although legend and history hold that Valentine, a physician and 
Christian priest, was unceremoniously beheaded by the Romans on Feb. 14 in the 
year 269. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was executed, and not many people know that. It's not very romantic," said 
Denise Gragg, co-founder of Death Penalty Focus of Orange County, which plans 
an anti-death penalty protest Monday evening in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Across Orange County Friday, traditional celebrants browsed through candy 
stores, flower shops and lingerie boutiques. But many also tried to find more 
heartfelt -- and offbeat -- ways to mark St. Valentine's Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweethearts Leanne Roberts, 26, and Derek Romo, 31, both of Aliso Viejo, were 
$300 richer Friday after winning a nationwide search for the "Most Engaging" 
engagement proposal, a contest sponsored by Newport Dunes Resort. 
</P>
<P>
 Romo led Roberts into a darkened theater in San Juan Capistrano last summer 
for a staging of a ruse play aptly titled "The Request." Unaware that she was 
surrounded by more than 50 friends and relatives, Roberts was blissfully 
surprised to hear the "star" of the play -- Romo -- propose to her from the 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had been publicly adverse to the prospect of marriage for so long, and made 
fun of it for so long, that I figured my proposal should be just as public," 
said Romo, a photographer, who plans to wed his beloved in August. "I never 
thought I would do something like this, but I believe genuine creativity and 
passion comes from its inspiration, and Leanne is my inspiration." 
</P>
<P>
 And another example for those who say guys aren't romantic: 
</P>
<P>
 One Orange County man has rented a banner reading "I love You" that will be 
dragged behind a plane flown over his wife's workplace Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're already married," said Doug Stavoe of Pacific Drifters Sky-Writing in 
Newport Beach. "I guess it's just reinforcement." 
</P>
<P>
 The price tag: $375. Stavoe said business has dropped off considerably this 
year. Last year, he had four such jobs, including an airborne proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to say why, maybe the economy," Stavoe said. 
</P>
<P>
 But one love-struck Orange County man is sparing no expense to ask his 
girlfriend of several years to make it official. 
</P>
<P>
 He had a jeweler handcraft an engagement ring studded with a solitaire 
diamond. He's also rented a white tuxedo and white horse and has arranged for a 
trumpet player in a "full royal courtship outfit" to help woo his lady love. 
</P>
<P>
 He plans to be carrying a dozen white long-stem roses when he rides up to her 
window at work on Monday to propose. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, she'll see me and come out," he said Friday, adding that he's 
pretty sure she will say yes. "Please don't mention my name or anything. If she 
finds out, I'll just cry. A lot of planning has gone into this." 
</P>
<P>
 In Newport Beach Friday afternoon, children scribbled hearts and rainbows on 
Valentine's cards that will be sent to abused children in homes run by Olive 
Crest Treatment Centers Inc., an Anaheim-based nonprofit group. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm 100% for anything we can do to make these kids feel special," said Jene 
Meece, 38, of Newport Beach, as she watched her 3-year-old daughter, Breanna, 
color a card at Fashion Island Newport Beach. "It'll make the kids feel 
wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 "You are very special. Be my valentine. God bless you," read one card 
decorated with a rainbow and signed by "Hannah, age 2, and her mommy."  
</P>
<P>
 Kids and parents can color cards today from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and on Sunday 
from noon to 5 p.m. The booth is between the Broadway and the Limited. 
</P>
<P>
 "Valentine's Day has become kind of commercialized. It's seen as a holiday for 
couples. But it's really about traditional love," said Fashion Island 
spokeswoman Brooke Rhodes. "There are people who are forgotten on Valentine's 
Day, and these cards are for children who need a little extra love and 
attention."  
</P>
<P>
 In Laguna Beach, environmentalist Beth Leeds has finally finished cutting out 
dozens of red hearts. Beginning Sunday morning, she plans to pin two to each 
eucalyptus and oak tree lining a two-mile stretch of Laguna Canyon Road, from 
El Toro Road to the Irvine city limits. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a practice she has followed for the past four years to protest local road 
widenings and construction, including the planned San Joaquin Hills toll road, 
which she says will destroy the area's natural beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are really beautiful trees, and I want to protect them. I just thought 
Valentine's Day would be perfect for letting people know," Leeds, 52, said. 
</P>
<P>
 Death Penalty Focus of Orange County, an organization dedicated to abolishing 
the death penalty, also chose to hold a death penalty protest on Valentine's 
Day to draw attention. 
</P>
<P>
 According to one legend, St. Valentine was executed because he encouraged 
soldiers to marry and pursue a domestic life, in direct violation of a Roman 
decree that forbade soldiers to marry as a way to keep them focused and tough, 
said Gragg, who is also a deputy public defender. 
</P>
<P>
 The protest will be held from 6:30 to 7:30 p.m. on Main Street and Town and 
Country Road in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Disneyland is offering a Valentine's Day special today and Sunday for parties 
of two or more. The $45-per-adult evening tickets include park admission and a 
complimentary dinner, live entertainment and a rose. 
</P>
<P>
 But before sweethearts gorge themselves on chocolates or other rich foods, a 
registered nurse for Orange County weight loss centers urges people to 
celebrate the day in a low-calorie way. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just feel that people should try to be healthy every day of the year," Jan 
Hunter said. "People tend to use holidays as an excuse to go overboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Forget chocolate. I believe in jewelry."

EARTHQUAKE FORCES SCHOOLS TO REVAMP DISASTER PREPARATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE CHAVEZ and BETH SHUSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Unified School District admitted on Friday that it was not 
fully prepared for a large earthquake with students on campus and said that 
officials will revamp disaster plans that left many schools without basic 
emergency provisions Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Supt. Francis Nakano, a top aide to Supt. Sid Thompson, called the 
earthquake a blessing in disguise that will force the huge district to pay more 
attention to emergency plans. He said more money will be sought to stock 
schools with supplies such as water, blankets and bandages that could be needed 
if many students were injured or stranded on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, schools with staff members or parents who made disaster preparation 
a high priority are the most likely to have adequate stocks of provisions. 
Schools where it was of less concern tend to lack many of the basics, in part 
because the Board of Education never set side money for earthquake 
preparations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be better off for it," Nakano said of the Jan. 17 quake. "In the next 
few weeks or months, everyone will be ready (to handle a disaster) and be 
adequately prepared." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the top priorities will be to bolster the district's Office of Emergency 
Services, which for years has been a one-person operation with no budget, 
Nakano said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we are going to have to redirect some funds or reprioritize and we will 
put together an office," he said, adding that the district will still have to 
seek donations for emergency supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake damaged at least 1,500 classrooms at nearly 200 schools, and left 
some of those campuses heavily damaged and without power or communications. All 
schools were closed that day for the Martin Luther King holiday and remained 
closed for the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Although schools were ordered as recently as 1993 to obtain supplies and store 
enough water and food to supply students for 72 hours after a quake, no money 
was provided by the Board of Education to acquire provisions.  
</P>
<P>
 "We told the schools the district could not afford to buy all that stuff," 
Thompson said. "Remember, we are talking about a time when there was a question 
on our budget as to whether we were going to be solvent. . . . We talked to the 
state about giving us some money to buy equipment. We didn't get it." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the late 1980s, the district has only been able to offer formal disaster 
training to about 200 administrators in a giant system that includes 645 
schools and about 30,000 teachers and principals. Some schools have 
independently obtained training for their staff. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, the district provided basic first aid kits for every school, which 
even now make up the backbone of disaster supplies on some campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think all schools have some kind of supplies, but I am not at all impressed 
with the universality of having water, for example," Thompson said. "Does every 
school have sufficient water? I don't think so." 
</P>
<P>
 Left to fend for themselves, most schools have relied on parents, or local 
businesses to obtain supplies. Some PTA chapters were formed solely to raise 
money for earthquake supplies, which run into thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools with the most active parents or where the staff is motivated to 
prepare for earthquakes have written sophisticated emergency plans and amassed 
caches of supplies, complete with stretchers, wheelchairs and large quantities 
of food and water. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however have the bare minimum, with scant first aid and water 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), author of a state law requiring schools 
to have detailed disaster plans, sharply criticized the Los Angeles district 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would imagine if this had happened during school hours and there had been a 
significant loss of life or injuries, they would have a real hard time avoiding 
the liability simply by saying we did not have enough money to make 
(preparedness) a priority," Katz said. "In my mind, safety should have the 
first call on funds." 
</P>
<P>
 The spottiness of quake preparations was attacked this week by Helen Fallon, 
the chairwoman of the 10th District Parent Teacher Student Assn.'s 
disaster/earthquake preparedness committee, who testified at a hearing of the 
state Seismic Safety Commission in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 "How much longer do we parents have to put our children at risk every day that 
they attend a school that has not bothered to prepare for earthquakes?" said 
Fallon, who charged that first aid kits had been emptied, medicine was out date 
and that equipment such as hard hats and crowbars are scarce. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, how much longer do parents in this district have to listen to 
employees argue that preparedness does not need to be a priority at their 
school and that it is not their responsibility or obligation to prepare?" 
</P>
<P>
 State law requires that school disaster plans "maintain the safety and care of 
students and staffs." Drop drills and staff training are also required. 
</P>
<P>
 Although state law does not require schools to be equipped with emergency 
supplies, Los Angeles district policy calls for schools to be able to care for 
at least a portion of their student population for 72 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 To comply with the state law, the district requires every school to complete 
an eight-page, fill-in-the-blank form each year in which principals identify 
teams to handle first aid, search and rescue, and fires. 
</P>
<P>
 Another district bulletin lists the emergency supplies that campuses should 
stockpile and offers a list of vendors that sell survival products, including 
tents, radios and body bags. 
</P>
<P>
 The district, however, does not certify the plans or check on supplies, citing 
a shortage of staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "After all the years we had in budget cuts we are squeezed down," Nakano said. 
"We have a skeleton crew for everything." 
</P>
<P>
 A survey will be conducted to determine the status of earthquake supplies and 
disaster plans at all schools, Nakano said. The district expects to complete 
the review in about a month. 
</P>
<P>
 The state law does not carry any punitive measures if schools are out of 
compliance. Katz said Friday that he is considering amending the law to take 
state funds away from school districts that are not adequately prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 Harriet Sculley, the president of the 31st District Parent Teacher Student 
Assn., which covers the San Fernando Valley, said she does not believe the 
organization should be the only provider of earthquake supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does not seem appropriate that parents should be responsible for 
earthquake supplies in a public school system," Sculley said. "If it's needed, 
we'll help out, of course, but we shouldn't be solely responsible." 
</P>
<P>
 Balboa Boulevard Gifted/High Ability Magnet's parent committee stocked the 
school with walkie-talkies, stretchers, a wheelchair, search-and-rescue 
equipment along with basic medical supplies and water and blankets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say that every school needs about $5,000 worth of equipment to be fully 
prepared for three days," said Gail Lang, a Balboa parent who is active in the 
preparedness program. "Unless there's a real gung-ho mother demanding 
earthquake preparedness, it's probably not going to be a priority." 
</P>
<P>
 At Langdon Avenue Elementary in North Hills, the school has basic supplies -- 
such as bandages and tape -- but no storage container for tools nor enough 
blankets for all the students. Jacqueline Howard, the assistant principal, said 
she believes the school could ensure student safety in a quake but not keep 
them on campus for an extended amount of time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really depends on the emphasis put on it by the principal, the staff and 
the teachers," Howard said. "There isn't any district standard. If some schools 
opt not to do it, then there's nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Board of Education President Leticia Quezada said she has found a worrisome 
disparity of quake supplies in her district, which stretches from the Eastside 
to the East Valley. Quezada said she will encourage the school board to fund 
earthquake preparedness during this spring's budget deliberations, when school 
reform and restoration of the 10% pay cut imposed on teachers, among other 
things, will be competing for district dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Quezada said she is concerned that schools in poor communities are not as well 
equipped as those in more affluent neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's uneven and I'd like it to be even," she said. "One way or another we 
have to have these provisions available for all out schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Principal John Chernow of Paul Revere Middle School in Brentwood 
said "we are fortunate in that we are affluent enough to be able to" conduct 
fund-raising events that have enabled the school to buy protein bars and water 
for every student for three days. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have to make choices between school supplies and quake supplies," 
Chernow said. 
</P>
<P>
 But at Hollywood High, Assistant Principal Dick Rippey said the school is 
somewhat prepared, but not fully equipped. Supplies include flashlights, 
district-provided first aid kits and search equipment held in a cargo 
container. 
</P>
<P>
 The water supply for the 2,400 student body is contained is two 55-gallon 
drums, enough for 110 students for one day. 
</P>
<P>
 Principals and other staff members said that with severely limited funding, it 
is sometimes difficult to make earthquake preparedness a priority. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a "low priority," Rippey said. "Naturally, improving test scores and 
improving your instructional curriculum is obviously No. 1 on your list and 
should be. You get down to other things, safety on campus . . . graffiti 
cleanup, campus beautification, where are you going to spend the money you 
have? (Preparedness) does get shoved down to the bottom." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Jan. 17 quake, more schools have begun to address the lack of 
supplies. At Hamlin Street Elementary in Canoga Park, for example, teachers 
have re-evaluated their disaster plans and purchased backpacks for every 
classroom filled with gloves, first aid and other supplies.

 CLINTON CALL: Cal State Northridge reopens Monday, and you can bet that there 
will be plenty of media coverage. KABC talk-show host Michael Jackson will 
carry his show from campus, and President Clinton will call in. . . . "I think 
it will add stature to the whole day," Jackson said. "He's such an embracing 
person."

 OSCAR ON VENTURA: The Academy Awards are coming to the Valley. Well, sort of. 
For the first time, the academy will hang banners on both sides of Ventura 
Boulevard near Sepulveda Boulevard -- celebrating the March 21 show. . . . This 
is nothing new in Los Angeles, so why suddenly Sherman Oaks? "That's what you 
get when you put someone in charge who is from the Valley," said program 
coordinator Mikel Kaufman, raised in Hidden Hills.

 HALL OF FAME: What a week for ex-Valley athletes. First, San Fernando High's

star Robin Yount, above, retires after a 20-year career. (C14) . . . Yount is a 
certain Hall of Famer. It is believed that he'll become only the second 
Valleyite inducted at Cooperstown. The other is Van Nuys High's Don Drysdale.

 GOOD RECRUITS: Recruiting football players at Cal State Northridge is always

inexplicably overlooked. . . . The quake should make the job even harder. Who 
wants to come to a school in quake crisis? Apparently, says Coach Bob Burt, 
quite a few. (C14)

 CRAZY CASE: This week's news that Crazy Otto's Diner in Lancaster may remodel

that the Copper Skillet stole its recipe for hash browns, salsa, chili and 
omelets. . . . The matter, says the Skillet's ex-owner, is still scrambled in 
the courts. Michael Arkush

ONCE BEDROCK OF VALLEY, BOULEVARD SENT REELING; BUSINESS: QUAKE WAS THE LATEST 
SETBACK FOR VENTURA BOULEVARD MERCHANTS, WHO FACE AN UNSETTLING FUTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 The trembling of the ground is finally subsiding, but for shop owners up and 
down this once-busy stretch of Ventura Boulevard, business remains shaky. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than the steady clang of cash registers, they hear the grinding of 
wrecking cranes outside their windows, knocking down office and apartment 
buildings rocked by the Northridge earthquake -- the ones that once created the 
clientele they fear may never be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 "More than half of my business comes from a one-mile radius," said Michael 
Ourieff, owner of Michael J's restaurant, 14611 1/2 Ventura Blvd. "And now 
they're gone, they're all gone." 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake has been but the latest disaster to send shock waves along the 
once-glitzy boulevard, which for years has seen its business base rocked by 
recession, where the "Grand Opening" signs of old have slowly become replaced 
by placards of a different sort: "Going Out of Business." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the post-World War II consumer boom, the 17-mile-long commercial stretch 
has run across the San Fernando Valley floor like an unabated river of retail, 
representing a healthy, buying, vibrant America. It was the Melrose Avenue of 
the Valley, a sign that folks north of the hill had their own economic, 
cultural and aesthetic centerpiece. 
</P>
<P>
 But recent years have been hard on the boulevard, where vacancy rates have 
soared and discount stores have popped up in choice locations as rents 
plummeted to as low as $1.25 per square foot, roughly half what was being 
charged before the recession. 
</P>
<P>
 And even as planners developed a vision for refurbishing the retail strip into 
the next century -- a specific plan to create more parking and pedestrian 
access to compete with nearby malls and other retail drags throughout the 
Valley -- business owners squabbled over how the plan's $222-million price tag 
would be paid. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, as their prized boulevard reels from earthquake damage, already 
cautious politicians, business owners and residents alike are more fearful than 
ever over the future of the traffic-choked thoroughfare known as the Valley's 
Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
 And for good reason. Between Studio City and Woodland Hills, 384 properties 
along Ventura Boulevard suffered more than $41 million in earthquake damage, 
according to a city building and safety report. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sherman Oaks alone, more than 165 buildings located along the boulevard 
were damaged by the temblor -- 19 of them deemed unsafe and another 30 confined 
to limited entry, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ventura Boulevard got a huge punch in the stomach -- it was knocked out, the 
smelling salts are being taken out all over the place," said Michael Lushing, 
vice president of CB Commercial, a local commercial real estate firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's the heart of retail in the Valley -- it can't afford to be out. 
Still, it's like a boxer down for the count. We businessmen, we're like the 
trainers in the corner, yelling 'Get up! Get up! You can't afford to stay 
down.' You're standing in the corner of the ring, hoping for the best." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Brain, who heads a city advisory board on the street's development, 
worries about the domino effect a financially crippled boulevard would create. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people aren't going to be able to pay their rent," Brain said. "That 
means they're not shopping, not buying. Without government help, the economy of 
the boulevard could go into a real tailspin. And as goes Ventura Boulevard, so 
goes the entire San Fernando Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to reassure shaken businesses, U.S. Commerce Secretary Ron Brown 
took a half-hour tour of quake-beleaguered Ventura Boulevard last week, looking 
at buildings that had buckled as though bombs had dropped from the ashen winter 
skies above, talking to owners about how they planned to bring customers back. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting with 40 business owners, Brown promised that the Clinton 
Administration would do what it could to cut bureaucratic red tape and see that 
redevelopment money in the form of grants and loans was rushed to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many owners feel economically adrift -- without lifeboats or even 
preservers -- waiting for help they fear may never come. "Brown said all the 
right things," Ourieff said. "Now we just have to wait to see if they come 
true. But the clock is ticking away. A lot of people can't wait for the life 
preserver. They're going down too fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, at a time when a future vision is sorely needed, the floor has been 
pulled out from under thousands of white-collar workers, who are like the 
walking wounded, displaced by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "More than a million and a half square feet of commercial-office tenants have 
been displaced -- 5% of the the entire Valley market -- and another 500,000 
square feet of small-business space damaged," said Bruce Frasco, senior vice 
president of Beitler Commercial Realty, whose own business was forced to move 
from its 10,000-square-foot Sherman Oaks headquarters into a space one-third 
the size in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
 "These tenants are out on the street. And the problem is, for many, that their 
leases are still in effect. In most cases, the landlord has up to a year to 
rebuild the premises and 90 days just to inform you what he is going to do -- 
tear down the building, or whatever. 
</P>
<P>
 "Meanwhile, many landlords aren't willing to lease to businesses on a 
temporary basis until they can move back into their old haunts. So, people are 
literally out in the cold. They're stuck in limbo. Time has become a killer." 
</P>
<P>
 And many small-business owners are faced with a conundrum: If they just walk 
away from their shops, give them back to the banks, their employees will be 
back on the streets, out of work -- adding to the quake's economic blow to the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 At the meeting with Brown, a Bullock's vice president told Brown that his 
retail chain would lose $120 million in sales to the earthquake. More 
startling, he said, 300 employees had been laid off from the store's Sherman 
Oaks location and another 300 in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, even before last month's temblor, the boulevard was at an economic 
crossroads, experts say -- one that has been made even more critical by the 
recent disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Along one popular stretch between Beverly Glen and Van Nuys boulevards, six of 
18 shops sat empty at year's start. Now that blight has been joined by a new 
earthquake-related eyesore: plywood covering former window displays, broken 
light poles and cracks in the street. 
</P>
<P>
 There are "Now Leasing" and "Available" signs everywhere on almost every 
block, as well as ones that cry "Earthquake menus!" and "Earth-shattering 
sales!" 
</P>
<P>
 And the damage goes even deeper. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look around," said Brain, chairman of the Ventura Boulevard Specific Plan 
Review Board. "We've lost all the building blocks of a balanced community. 
Malls are damaged. Drugstores abandoned. The only hotel in Sherman Oaks has 
been declared unsafe. Grocery stores and multibusiness office buildings -- all 
declared unsafe. A local church is holding Masses in a tent out back." 
</P>
<P>
 While no one would dare venture that Ventura Boulevard might indeed benefit 
from the quake, many planners see Brown's promises of financial support as the 
first ray of sunlight in an otherwise horribly gray day. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake has also prompted some merchants to take a closer look at the 
Ventura Boulevard Specific Plan, a broad planning blueprint that aims to 
upgrade the infrastructure of the boulevard and control what residents had 
complained was runaway growth. The estimated cost of the project had been $222 
million. Much of those funds were to come through "trip fees" assessed to 
businesses, based on how much traffic they generated. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the quake, business owners complained that the fees were too high 
and suggested that other funding sources, perhaps an assessment district, be 
explored. And this week, Brain and other merchants asked the city Planning 
Commission to cut the proposed price tag of the plan to $100 million. The panel 
agreed to consider the proposed reductions. 
</P>
<P>
 But whether through taxing owners or through government earthquake relief, 
planners know that Ventura Boulevard will need more than a cosmetic lift to 
compete in the next century and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're at a fork in the road," Brain said. "And if things continue going 
downhill as they are on many stretches of the boulevard, people are going to 
choose to stop going there. They're going to hit the local malls or shopping 
districts along Tampa or Nordhoff. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in a battle for retail supremacy here. And we've got our fingers 
crossed that we'll find a way to save this boulevard."

USC'S STRONG RECRUITING SENDS OMINOUS MESSAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In reading about USC's super football recruiting class, I can't help but have 
a sense of deja vu , to when USC was one of the nation's leaders in NCAA 
probations. When it also was mentioned that four or five of the recruits still 
have not qualified academically and that five are so-called president's 
"special cases," i.e. junior college transfers who are marginal academically, I 
can't help but believe that John Robinson has got USC to sell itself out again 
for its football program.

 Gene Wojciechowski just doesn't get it. Sure, Notre Dame was probably behind 
the Kerrigan hit. And if you study the photos long enough, you'll see six 
Catholic nuns, a leprechaun and Touchdown Jesus disassembling their AK-47s just 
beyond the grassy knoll.But now Wojciechowski wants us to believe that the 
Notre Dame hierarchy devours its own after carefully extracting what is to be 
extracted from the open veins of Digger Phelps. Ridiculous! What Wojciechowski 
doesn't get is that the only substantive and accurate elements of his article 
are his unexplained vituperative attitude toward Notre Dame.

 Columns like these make it pretty obvious that Florida State could have 
counted on Gene's vote regardless of who had the better team. Gene's vote and 
his column are too predictable; the guy just hates Notre Dame.

QUAKE FUELS ONLY A BRIEF AFFAIR WITH MASS TRANSIT; COMMUTING: TIME-CONSUMING 
PROBLEMS DASH HOPES THAT DAMAGE WOULD SEVER ANGELENOS' ROMANCE WITH CARS.

 After the earthquake snapped the freeways, Phyllis Solomon switched to public 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Door to door, her one-way train-and-bus commute from Palmdale to Century City 
sometimes took more than four hours. Finally, she gave up this week and drove 
-- cutting her commute time in half. 
</P>
<P>
 "Public transportation is just not worth it to me," said Solomon, 49, a legal 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation officials hoped that agonizingly long drives around 
quake-damaged freeways would succeed where advertising campaigns had failed and 
force thousands of Angelenos like Solomon to give up their cars in favor of 
mass transit. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days after the Jan. 17 earthquake, the number of passengers riding 
commuter trains soared to an all-time high. But only two weeks later, ridership 
on the Metrolink line most affected -- the Santa Clarita route -- dropped more 
than 50% as many passengers decided once again to drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Raising this question: If a magnitude 6.8 quake will not permanently change 
solo driving habits, then what will?  
</P>
<P>
 The answer, experts say, has less to do with improving mass transit than 
making driving so odious that Southern Californians would find it easier to 
take trains and buses. That, they believe, would require a slew of politically 
unpopular moves, effectively stripping the automobile of many of the unnoticed 
government subsidies that it has enjoyed.  
</P>
<P>
 It would mean eliminating free parking at places such as shopping malls and 
libraries. Or instituting an odd/even policy so people drive only every other 
day. Or charging motorists a fee for using freeways during rush hours just as 
the telephone company charges higher rates for calls during business hours.  
</P>
<P>
 Such measures could level the playing field, making mass transit an acceptable 
alternative, experts say.  
</P>
<P>
 "People drive not because habits are hard to break but because it's more 
rational for them to do so -- it takes less time and money," said Martin Wachs, 
professor of urban planning at UCLA. "The auto goes any place you want at any 
hour." 
</P>
<P>
 Technology exists that allows cars to be equipped with a device that monitors 
the time of day the car operates and whether it is on a congested roadway. In 
such a scheme, which would most likely have to be government-sanctioned, 
motorists on empty country roads would not be charged, but those on Interstate 
5 during rush hour would receive monthly bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Congestion pricing is very unpopular but we know it works from the airlines 
because people do stay over Saturday nights to get cheaper fares," said Wachs, 
who added that the method would be more effective than a gas tax in penalizing 
those using crowded roads during peak hours. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, the relatively low price of operating automobiles 
encourages people to drive, said Don Shoup, professor of architecture and urban 
planning at UCLA. Gasoline and vehicle registration fees are about three times 
more expensive in Europe, where about 20% of people use mass transit. By 
contrast, about 3% of Southern Californians use buses and trains. 
</P>
<P>
 Forcing Angelenos off jammed roads would mean "increasing the cost of using 
your car to unimaginable high levels," Shoup said. "Maybe we would have to 
quadruple the cost of using the car to double transit use." 
</P>
<P>
 Charging for parking at many public places would force people to plan 
excursions more carefully, driving less so they would pay fewer fees, Shoup 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 According to a recent Metrolink survey, free workplace parking was a key 
factor in whether drivers rode the train or drove, said Richard Stanger, 
executive director of Metrolink.  
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest problem is that so many workers get free parking at their 
employment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While setting up a system to discourage drivers, transportation officials 
would have to simultaneously improve mass transit, experts said. This could 
mean offering more coordinated and frequent service on buses and trains as well 
as adding an option: vans that offered door-to-door shared-ride services. These 
vans would be cheaper but run less direct routes than taxis, and they would be 
more convenient than standard buses.  
</P>
<P>
 "We need things that are more appropriate to the way people travel . . . 
shuttles can serve the dispersed (commuting) patterns that we have," said 
Genevieve Giuliano, associate professor of urban and regional planning at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 If the shattered freeways are restored without taking steps to modify 
behavior, urban planners say, Angelenos will soon return to their cars, 
relishing the days when traffic delays are caused by a mere SigAlert. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fundamentally, people are not going to change," said Jim Moore, associate 
professor of urban and regional planning at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of Transportation Federico Pena and transit officials disagree, 
saying that at long last Angelenos are ready to welcome mass transit. Southern 
Californians, even more than their San Francisco counterparts, will embrace 
public transportation because people commute longer distances here, Pena has 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 After the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989, ridership on the Bay Area Rapid 
Transit also reached record highs, increasing from 218,000 a day to a peak of 
357,000 before the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge opened. But once roads were 
reopened, BART won only a 10% increase in passengers, said Michael Bernick, 
vice chairman of the BART board. In Los Angeles, the vast majority of all 
workers -- 79% -- drive to work alone, according to a 1993 survey commissioned 
by state transit officials. Even if transportation officials tripled the number 
of people riding the rails, the impact on congested freeways would scarcely be 
noticeable, they say.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you are running a transit system, having even 15% more passengers helps 
you pay the bills," said Charles Lave, professor of economics at UC Irvine. 
"But if you are trying to solve the transportation problems of Los Angeles, and 
you add 15% to a transit mode that doesn't carry a lot in the first place, it 
doesn't do a lot for you." 
</P>
<P>
 For transportation officials, the Northridge earthquake posed a unique 
opportunity to introduce mass transit to people, such as Solomon, who had never 
used it before. In the days after the quake, the 1-year-old Metrolink got more 
publicity than the commuter train line could ever buy. There was footage of 
happy commuters boarding periwinkle blue and white trains slapped up against 
vistas of motorists snarled in traffic jams for hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Plenty of commuters, such as Gary Arlt, sung Metrolink's praises. Arlt, 44, 
took the 5:22 a.m. Santa Clarita train, leaving about two hours earlier than 
during pre-quake days when he drove to his Glendale office. 
</P>
<P>
 "It beats sitting in the car for three hours," Arlt said. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake transformed Solomon's typical 90-minute drive into a four-hour 
odyssey on public transportation. After the earthquake, Solomon decided to try 
riding the train rather than driving on the crippled freeways. She left her 
Palmdale home each weekday morning at 4 a.m., drove to Santa Clarita to catch a 
commuter train Downtown, then hopped a bus to Century City. Finally, she walked 
four blocks to reach her office. 
</P>
<P>
 In rain and cold, the walk was miserable. Sometimes the bus was late and 
Solomon would miss her evening train home. Because of the infrequency of trains 
running to Palmdale, Solomon frequently ended up getting home at 11 p.m. 
Exhausted, she would skip dinner and only eat a piece of fruit. She would go to 
bed 30 minutes after getting home so she could get up in time the next morning. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Too fatigued to cope with chores, she hired a housekeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't seen my husband at all; it's killed my home life," Solomon said. 
"On weekends, I'm tired all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Caltrans was opening improved detours, allowing more cars to travel 
faster around battered freeways. Solomon was experiencing a crucial flaw in the 
Southland's public transportation system: having to rely on buses to hook up 
with trains. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more time people have to spend standing at bus stops, the less likely 
they are to ride," planning expert Giuliano said. "Fare is not as critical as 
the service provided. For people who are not transit-dependent, for people who 
have a choice, the biggest issue is convenience." 
</P>
<P>
 And so back to the car went Solomon, breathing a sigh of relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yesterday I left work at 4:50 and got home at 6:20. If I'd taken the train 
the earliest I would have gotten home would have been 8 o'clock," she said 
Friday. "I think people aren't going to give up their cars. They like being 
able to go when they want."

CONCEDING POOR PREPARATION, SCHOOLS REVAMP QUAKE PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Los Angeles Unified School District, acknowledging that it is not fully 
prepared for a large earthquake with students on campus, said Friday that 
officials will revamp their disaster plans after finding that many schools were 
without basic emergency provisions Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Supt. Francis Nakano called the earthquake a blessing in disguise 
that has forced the huge district to pay greater attention to the risk of 
earthquakes. He said more money will be provided to stock schools with basic 
supplies needed for students who may be injured or stranded on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be better off for it, but hopefully we will not have another 
earthquake," Nakano said. "In the next few weeks or months, everyone will be 
ready (to handle a disaster) and be adequately prepared." 
</P>
<P>
 When the Jan. 17 quake struck, damaging at least 1,500 classrooms at nearly 
200 schools, many campuses lacked supplies such as water, food, blankets and 
hard hats that are required by board of education policy. Schools were closed 
that day for the Martin Luther King holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although schools were ordered in the early 1990s to obtain the supplies and 
store enough water to supply students for 72 hours after an earthquake, no 
money was provided by the Board of Education to acquire provisions.  
</P>
<P>
 "We told the schools the district could not afford to buy all that stuff," 
said Supt. Sid Thompson, who was deputy superintendent at the time. "Remember, 
we are talking about a time when there was a question on our budget as to 
whether we were going to be solvent. . . . We talked to the state about giving 
us some money to buy equipment. We didn't get it." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the late 1980s, the district has been able to offer disaster training to 
only about 200 administrators in a giant system that includes 645 schools and 
about 30,000 teachers and principals. In 1988, the district provided basic 
first aid kits for every school, which even now make up the bulk of disaster 
supplies on some campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think all schools have some kind of supplies, but I am not at all impressed 
with the universality of having water, for example," Thompson said. "Does every 
school have sufficient water? I don't think so." 
</P>
<P>
 Left to fend for themselves, some schools have raised money from parents or 
local businesses to obtain supplies. Schools with the most active parents or 
with staff motivated to prepare for earthquakes have written sophisticated 
emergency plans and amassed caches of supplies, complete with stretchers, 
wheelchairs and large quantities of food and water. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however have the bare minimum, with scant first aid and water 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), author of a state law requiring schools 
to have detailed disaster plans, criticized the Los Angeles district Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would imagine if this had happened during school hours and there had been a 
significant loss of life or injuries, they would have a real hard time avoiding 
the liability simply by saying we did not have enough money to make 
(preparedness) a priority," Katz said. "In my mind, safety should have the 
first call on funds." 
</P>
<P>
 The spottiness of quake preparations was attacked this week by Helen Fallon, 
the chairwoman of the 10th District Parent Teacher Student Assn.'s disaster / 
earthquake preparedness committee, who testified at a hearing of the state 
Seismic Safety Commission in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 "How much longer do we parents have to put our children at risk every day that 
they attend a school that has not bothered to prepare for earthquakes?" Fallon 
said. "Frankly, how much longer do parents in this district have to listen to 
employees argue that preparedness does not need to be a priority at their 
school and that it is not their responsibility or obligation to prepare?" 
</P>
<P>
 State law requires that school disaster plans "maintain the safety and care of 
students and staffs." Safety drills and staff training are also required. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the state law does not require schools to have emergency supplies, 
Los Angeles district policy calls for schools to be able to care for at least a 
portion of their student population for 72 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 To comply with the state law, the district requires every school to complete 
an eight-page, fill-in-the-blank form each year in which principals identify 
teams to handle first aid, search and rescue and fires. 
</P>
<P>
 Another district bulletin lists the emergency supplies campuses should 
stockpile and offers a list of vendors that sell survival products, including 
tents, radios and body bags. 
</P>
<P>
 The district, however, does not certify the plans or check on supplies, citing 
a shortage of staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "After all the years we had in budget cuts we are squeezed down," Nakano said. 
"We have a skeleton crew for everything." 
</P>
<P>
 A survey will be conducted to determine the status of earthquake supplies and 
disaster plans at all schools, Nakano said. The district expects to complete 
the review in about a month. 
</P>
<P>
 The state law does not carry any punitive measures if schools are out of 
compliance. Katz said Friday that he is considering amending the law to take 
state funds away from school districts that are not adequately prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the Los Angeles district, local PTA chapters have purchased the bulk of 
supplies at schools. Some chapters were formed solely to raise money for 
earthquake supplies, which can cost thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Harriet Sculley, the president of the 31st District Parent Teacher Student 
Assn., which covers the San Fernando Valley, said she does not believe the 
organization should be the only provider of earthquake supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does not seem appropriate that parents should be responsible for 
earthquake supplies in a public school system," Sculley said. "If it's needed, 
we'll help out, of course, but we shouldn't be solely responsible." 
</P>
<P>
 Balboa Boulevard Gifted/High Ability Magnet's parent committee stocked the 
school with walkie-talkies, stretchers, a wheelchair, search and rescue 
equipment, basic medical supplies, water and blankets. In two years, the Balboa 
PTA spent about $4,000 on supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say that every school needs about $5,000 worth of equipment to be fully 
prepared for three days," said Gail Lang, a Balboa parent who is active in the 
preparedness program. "Unless there's a real gung-ho mother demanding 
earthquake preparedness, it's probably not going to be a priority." 
</P>
<P>
 At Langdon Avenue Elementary in North Hills, the school has basic supplies -- 
such as bandages and tape -- but no storage container containing tools or 
enough blankets for all the students. Jacqueline Howard, the assistant 
principal, said she believes the school could ensure student safety in a quake 
but would not be able to care for students on campus for an extended time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really depends on the emphasis put on it by the principal, the staff and 
the teachers," Howard said. "There isn't any district standard. If some schools 
opt not to do it, then there's nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Board of Education President Leticia Quezada said on the aftermath of the 
quake that she had found a worrisome disparity of supplies in her district, 
which stretches from the Eastside to the East San Fernando Valley. Quezada said 
she will encourage the school board to fund earthquake preparedness during this 
spring's budget deliberations, in which school reform and restoration of the 
10% pay cut imposed on teachers, among other things, will be competing for 
district funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Quezada said she is concerned that schools in poor communities are not as well 
equipped as those in more affluent neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's uneven and I'd like it to be even," she said. "One way or another we 
have to have these provisions available for all out schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Principal John Chernow of Paul Revere Middle School in Brentwood 
said the school is fortunate to be affluent enough to conduct fund-raising 
events that have provided enough money to buy protein bars and water for every 
student for three days. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have to make choices between school supplies and quake supplies," 
Chernow said. 
</P>
<P>
 But at Hollywood High, Assistant Principal Dick Rippey said the school is 
somewhat prepared, but not fully equipped. Supplies include flashlights, 
district-provided first-aid kits and search equipment. Two 55-gallon drums hold 
the water supply for the 2,400 students. 
</P>
<P>
 Principals and other staff members said that with severely limited funding, it 
is sometimes difficult to make earthquake preparedness a priority. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a low priority, Rippey said. "Naturally, improving test scores and 
improving your instructional curriculum is obviously number one on your list 
and should be. You get down to other things, safety on campus . . . graffiti 
cleanup, campus beautification, where are you going to spend the money you 
have? (Preparedness) does get shoved down to the bottom." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Jan. 17 earthquake, more schools have begun to address the lack of 
supplies. At Hamlin Street Elementary in Canoga Park, for example, teachers 
have re-evaluated their disaster plans and already purchased back packs for 
every classroom filled with gloves, first aid and other supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had talked about it before but hadn't done anything about it," said 
Shirley Hammer, a fifth-grade teacher and union representative at Hamlin. 
"Money's a problem. We just weren't prepared before. The awareness just wasn't 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Other school districts have joint programs with cities. The Burbank district, 
for example, conducts annual refresher courses for staff members. The city of 
Burbank allocated $250,000 for the program in 1990.

WIDOW CULTIST STARS IN DAVIDIANS' TRIAL; JUSTICE: WOMAN WHOSE HUSBAND WAS 
KILLED IN SHOOTOUT WITH ATF AGENTS TESTIFIES TO GET REDUCED SENTENCE. DEFENSE 
LAWYERS ATTACK HER CREDIBILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. JACKSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kathryn Schroeder, frequently brushing back strands of long brown hair and 
weeping, has been the government's chief witness against 11 Branch Davidian 
cultists charged with conspiring to murder four Treasury Department agents last 
February -- an episode that culminated 51 days later in a conflagration that 
left more than 80 dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last month, Schroeder and more than 100 other witnesses for the 
prosecution have described in court for the first time events inside the 
compound: cult leader David Koresh's erratic behavior, his insistence on 
building up a cache of fearsome weapons -- such as hand grenades and assault 
rifles -- and his preachings that cult members must be willing to "kill for 
God" in any showdown with the government. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the prosecution's case has been built largely on eyewitness testimony 
-- always crucial in conspiracy cases -- it has left some gaps for the jury to 
ponder, even as defense attorneys prepare to begin their presentation. 
</P>
<P>
 Schroeder, for example, testified that she saw eight of the 11 defendants on 
trial holding guns during the standoff. But she did not see any of them fire a 
weapon, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Bernadette Griffin, an agent with the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms, which raided the compound, said she saw defendant Jaime 
Castillo aim a rifle at her but never saw him fire at anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 But the witness who has drawn the most attention is the 31-year-old Schroeder. 
Widowed when her husband, Michael, was killed in the Feb. 28 shootout, she 
subsequently agreed to testify for the government in return for a reduction of 
the serious charges against her. 
</P>
<P>
 Her credibility has been attacked in cross-examination by defense lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Dan Cogdell asked Schroeder if she had told a cellmate before 
reaching her plea bargain: "I'm going to tell them (the prosecutors) whatever 
they want to hear. I've got to get out of prison to be with my children." 
</P>
<P>
 Schroeder's reply: "I don't remember." 
</P>
<P>
 Under questioning by Jeff Kearney, another defense lawyer, Schroeder 
acknowledged that she already has received an initial sum of money as part of a 
movie deal. Although not mentioning amounts, she said most of the money will 
come later. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to gain the sympathy of jurors, the defendants have been pictured 
by their lawyers as Bible-toting victims of Koresh who are nonviolent by 
nature. Schroeder partly contributed to this image. She tearfully told of being 
forced to serve as one of Koresh's wives in the compound and portrayed him as 
dominating his followers. 
</P>
<P>
 She quoted Koresh as telling the cult members: "If you can't kill for God, you 
can't die for God." She said many followed his orders. 
</P>
<P>
 Wounded in the initial shootout, Koresh predicted that he would die and 
developed a suicide plot for his group, Schroeder and other cultists said. 
</P>
<P>
 Former cult member Victorine Hollingsworth, 59, told jurors: "Everyone was 
happy that this was going to be the end . . . and we would go to our heavenly 
mother and our heavenly father." But Koresh recovered from his wounds and 
called off the plan, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cult members also testified that at least two of their wounded members were 
"finished off" by Koresh's close aides. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Rodriguez, an undercover agent for ATF, confirmed a key finding in a 
federal investigative report last fall by testifying that Koresh was tipped off 
to the Feb. 28 raid and thus had his followers armed and ready. 
</P>
<P>
 "Neither the ATF nor the National Guard will get me," he quoted Koresh as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez said he immediately told his superiors that Koresh knew of their 
plan. But the raid took place anyway. Defense lawyers want jurors to doubt the 
credibility of ATF officials, five of whom later were reprimanded for lying in 
claiming that they thought they had preserved the element of surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 A veteran prosecution team is directing the case. It is headed by Ray and 
LeRoy Jahn, the husband-and-wife assistant U.S. attorneys who obtained the 1982 
conviction of Charles W. Harrelson for assassinating federal judge John H. Wood 
Jr. of San Antonio in a murder-for-hire scheme by a drug ring. 
</P>
<P>
 The Waco defendants, if convicted in the federal courthouse named for Wood, 
face up to life imprisonment. Under federal conspiracy law, anyone who 
contributes in any way to a group's criminal activity -- in this case murder -- 
may be found guilty. Members of the group also are charged with lesser weapons 
offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial, which is expected to conclude in early March, was moved from Waco 
to San Antonio, 180 miles to the south, because the judge believed that it 
would be easier to find 12 jurors who did not already have opinions about the 
emotionally charged case.

<P>
 William Conrad, burly star of the series "Jake and the Fatman," "Cannon" and 
other television shows, died of a heart attack Friday. He was 73. 
</P>
<P>
 Conrad became ill at his home and died at the Medical Center of North 
Hollywood, hospital spokeswoman Tricia Spellman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Conrad played J.L. "Fatman" McCabe, a tough district attorney and former cop, 
on the CBS-TV series "Jake and the Fatman," which ran from 1987 to 1992. He had 
previously played the lead in the detective series "Cannon," which ran from 
1971 to 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 An announcer for radio station KMPC before serving as a fighter pilot in World 
War II, Conrad returned to radio after the war as the original Matt Dillon in 
the popular Gunsmoke series. His motion picture career, which also began after 
the war, included roles in "The Killers," "30," "Body and Soul," "East Side, 
West Side" and "The Naked Jungle." 
</P>
<P>
 Conrad was born Sept. 27, 1920, in Louisville, Ky., the son of a theater 
owner, and later moved with his family to California.

OREGON JUDGE DELAYS RULING ON HARDING; OLYMPICS: JURIST TELLS USOC, FIGURE 
SKATER TO TRY TO SOLVE THEIR PROBLEMS OVER THE WEEKEND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 On the eve of the XVII Winter Olympics, the Tonya Harding affair remained as 
unsettled as ever. 
</P>
<P>
 An Oregon circuit judge on Friday became the latest to delay a decision that 
could affect Harding's participation in the Olympics. Patrick D. Gilroy, a 
Clackamas County judge, said he would not rule until at least Monday afternoon 
on a motion that would keep the U.S. Olympic Committee from holding a hearing 
that could bar Harding from the Games. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing, which was originally scheduled for Tuesday in Oslo, was postponed 
until Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilroy, after 3 1/2 hours of deliberations, including 1 1/2 in chambers, said 
he was concerned about the disruptive nature of events that have transpired 
since Nancy Kerrigan was clubbed on the knee Jan. 6. Since then, four men have 
been arrested for the assault, including Harding's ex-husband and her sometime 
bodyguard. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge asked representatives from both sides to redouble their efforts to 
solve the impasse this weekend. However, that is unlikely. Harding wants more 
time to prepare a defense as well as the chance to skate. The USOC wants the 
opportunity to call disciplinary hearings whenever necessary -- even on short 
notice. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilroy's delay is the latest in a string of nondecisions surrounding Harding. 
</P>
<P>
 Last weekend, Claire Ferguson, president of the U.S. Figure Skating Assn., 
decided not to immediately suspend Harding after a USFSA panel determined there 
were reasonable grounds to call for a disciplinary hearing. Instead, the figure 
skating group followed procedure and is allowing Harding 30 days to prepare for 
the hearing, which will come after the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 The International Olympic Committe also stayed out of the fray, saying that it 
had no desire to rule on her eligibility and would leave the decision to the 
USOC. 
</P>
<P>
 The USOC then called for its Games Administrative Board to decide whether 
Harding had violated the body's code of conduct by lying to FBI agents about 
what she knew about the attack on Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the USOC had to defend its position that a hearing should be held 
quickly. Its attorneys came armed with a list of compromises it hoped would 
show the court it was attempting to act in good faith in the Harding matter. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the compromises was postponing Harding's eligibility review until 
Friday -- three days before the USOC must submit its final roster for women's 
figure skating. The women's competition is scheduled for Feb. 23 and 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Susemihl, USOC assistant general counsel, offered four other 
stipulations to ensure Harding's rights would not be violated. The organization 
said it would provide lodging and a training facility for Harding and her 
coach, Diane Rawlinson, in Oslo; would accommodate her attorneys; would 
accommodate her witnesses and would work out an arrangement whereby Harding is 
comfortable with the 13 members of the Games Administrative Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding's attorneys had argued that previous comments attributed to USOC 
President Leroy Walker, a board member, tainted his impartiality. 
</P>
<P>
 In offering the compromises, Susemihl acknowledged the USOC is not completely 
equipped to handle the unusual circumstances surrounding the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding's attorneys argued that no matter what the USOC offered, it would be 
unable to hold a fair hearing, if for no other reason than the time factor. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gilroy said if he accepted that theory, Olympic officials could never hold 
disciplinary hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds ludicrous to take this too far," Gilroy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, the judge was unwilling to make a decision that could have a chilling 
effect on how sports organizations control their athletes. Gilroy said he found 
the issues complex and difficult, and needed more time to consider the 
arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 As much as he agreed with the USOC's right to hold hearings, Gilroy said, he 
was concerned about the fairness of forcing Harding to defend herself on such 
short notice when she has spent her life training for the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding's attorneys said they need proper time to prepare a defense, including 
the gathering of half a dozen witnesses, who they claim would refute 
allegations that Harding acted irresponsibility in making contradictory 
statements to the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Harding's lawyer, Dennis Rawlinson, standing in front of the old 
stone courthouse in this historic Portland suburb, said he was optimistic the 
the USOC would be prevented from removing Harding from the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonya Harding has worked all of her life for the opportunity to represent her 
country in Lillehammer," said Rawlinson, husband of Harding's coach. "If we 
take that opportunity away from her, we can never, never make it up to her." 
</P>
<P>
 Susemihl had no comment about the proceedings. In Lillehammer, USOC officials 
were unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding did not appear in court, although her criminal attorney, Robert 
Weaver, joined the litigators in the fight to keep the U.S. national champion 
on the Olympic team. Harding was said to have watched the hearing on 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding, however, did return to the ice at a rink outside of Portland on 
Friday morning when she skated with Stephanie Quintero, the friend with whom 
she has been staying. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in a purple leotard, black tights and baggy white sweat shirt, Harding 
dodged well-wishers and skated carefree, holding Quintero's hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if she would skate in the Winter Games, Harding replied in a quiet 
voice: "I hope so."

JUDGE MAKES NO DECISION ON HARDING; FIGURE SKATING: HE ASKS FOR RESOLUTION IN 
DISPUTE WITH USOC. HEARING POSTPONED THREE DAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From Associated Press

<P>
 A judge urged Tonya Harding and the U.S. Olympic Committee on Friday to 
resolve their dispute over a disciplinary hearing, saying he is "genuinely 
concerned" the controversy could disrupt the Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
 The USOC agreed to postpone Harding's Olympic eligibility hearing from Tuesday 
until next Friday -- only three days before the USOC must submit its final 
roster for women's figure skating. 
</P>
<P>
 Clackamas County Circuit Judge Patrick Gilroy put off until at least Monday 
any decision on Harding's motion to block the USOC hearing from taking place at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling came on the eve of the Games' opening ceremony in Lillehammer, 
Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge said he was concerned about the fairness of forcing Harding to 
defend herself on such short notice before a hearing that could "take away her 
Olympic aspirations." 
</P>
<P>
 And he said he was "genuinely concerned what effect this process is going to 
have on the Olympic Games themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Harding's lawyer, Dennis Rawlinson, said he was optimistic the court would 
prevent the USOC from removing her from the team for her role in the Jan. 6 
attack on Nancy Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonya Harding has worked all of her life for the opportunity to represent her 
country in Lillehammer," he said. "If we take that opportunity away from her, 
we can never, never make it up to her." 
</P>
<P>
 The delay means Harding, the national figure skating champion, will remain on 
the Olympic team for at least the first week of the Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issues involved in this case are very complex and very difficult and 
they're particularly difficult to resolve instantaneously," Gilroy said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Lillehammer, USOC officials were unavailable for comment. Phones calls to 
the hotel room of Executive Director Harvey Schiller were not answered. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding won the U.S. championship in Detroit on Jan. 8, two days after 
Kerrigan was knocked out of the event when struck on the right knee by a man 
wielding a club. 
</P>
<P>
 Four men were later arrested in the case, including Harding's ex-husband Jeff 
Gillooly and her bodyguard. Both have implicated Harding in the assault. 
</P>
<P>
 The USOC took up the question of Harding's eligibility for the Olympic team 
after the U.S. Figure Skating Assn. issued a report saying there was reason to 
believe Harding violated skating's ethics. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding said she learned of details of the attack after she returned home on 
Jan. 10, but did not immediately report them to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding attorney Don Marmaduke argued that the hearing by the USOC's Games 
Administrative Board would not give his client enough time to gather witnesses 
on her behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems in the Harding case "are too complex for a quickie rush to 
judgment," Marmaduke argued. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding's criminal attorney, Bob Weaver, said it "would take weeks and maybe 
months" to develop the expert testimony necessary to adequately defend his 
client. 
</P>
<P>
 Some witnesses do not want to cooperate and could not be compelled to do so, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding spent part of Friday where she is most at home -- on the ice -- 
laughing and holding hands as she skated with a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if she would skate in the Winter Games, Harding replied in a quiet 
voice: "I hope so." 
</P>
<P>
 Harding filed a lawsuit Wednesday seeking at least $25 million and asking that 
the USOC proceedings be blocked because, among other things, they fail to 
provide her with a fair chance to defend herself. 
</P>
<P>
 The USOC contends that Congress, in the Amateur Sports Act of 1978, gave it 
the sole authority to determine who remains on the U.S. Olympic team. The 
committee said in court documents that it is not subject to the strict due 
process provisions of the Constitution and must only provide the same general 
fairness that would be required of any private organization. 
</P>
<P>
 In documents supporting its motion to dismiss the lawsuit, the USOC noted that 
Harding lied to the FBI in an interview Jan. 18, then changed her story after 
being confronted with the falsehoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that Harding lied to the FBI has raised the issue of whether Harding 
conducted herself, and continues to conduct herself, in a manner befitting a 
member of the Olympic team," the USOC said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her attorneys argued, however, that Harding initially lied to the FBI because 
she feared she would be harmed by Gillooly. Weaver said witnesses could 
corroborate that, but that attorneys had no power to subpoena them under the 
USOC procedures.

BASEBALL CHANGES TOP JOB; OWNERS: POWER OF COMMISSIONER IS SEVERELY LIMITED. 
FORMER COMMISSIONERS SAY THE MOVE WEAKENS THE OFFICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The power of a commissioner to act in the best interest of baseball has been 
significantly curtailed, according to restructuring changes released by the 
owners that prevent interference with their business decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The new provisions prevent commissioners from using the best-interest canopy 
to affect the World Series and postseason play, scheduling, interleague play, 
divisional alignment, expansion, the sale of teams, the relocation of teams and 
revenue-sharing. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodger President Peter O'Malley, a member of the restructuring committee and 
an advocate of a strong, independent commissioner, refused to address specifics 
of the Friday release by baseball because he had not seen it, but he said in 
general that the work of the committee "identified, clarified and removed 
ambiguities" that previously existed in the 73-year-old major league agreement 
under which the commissioner operated. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anything," he said, "the powers of the commissioner and league presidents 
have been strengthened, not weakened." 
</P>
<P>
 That interpretation was disputed by former commissioner Fay Vincent, who 
resigned under pressure on Sept. 7, 1992, two months after he unilaterally 
realigned the National League, prompting a court battle with the Chicago Cubs 
over the commissioner's power. The office has been vacant since Vincent stepped 
down, and the owners recently voted to have Bud Selig, president of the 
Milwaukee Brewers, remain in an interim position as chairman of baseball's 
executive council until completion of collective bargaining negotiations with 
the players' union. 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent said the changes weaken the office and are wrong. However, he 
predicted that they "will be corrected in time." He added: "Baseball has seen 
this before, but eventually it changes back." 
</P>
<P>
 Former commissioner Peter Ueberroth told the Associated Press: "Basically, the 
commissioner seems to have no portfolio, power or job. That's what it looks 
like from a distance. I think the changes dramatically change the position. 
There will be the appearance of more responsibility, but substantially less 
authority. That's the recipe for a non-job." 
</P>
<P>
 Ueberroth said the changes will lead to teams taking in less money, and 
predicted owners will raise ticket prices to make up the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have a committee make business decisions, it usually doesn't produce 
very positive results," he said. "Baseball is certainly run by the owners, and 
that may be proper for a while, but I agree with Fay that eventually their own 
actions will force a way back to a more traditional commissioner, like 
basketball or football." 
</P>
<P>
 Selig commented positively on the changes, saying: "I think overall the office 
is clearly strengthened. This brings the whole structure and office into this 
decade and gets ready for the 21st Century. I think the key is it clears up the 
ambiguities." 
</P>
<P>
 New York Met President Fred Wilpon, co-chairman of the restructuring 
committee, defended the changes, saying they made the commissioner's job more 
attractive because the role was more defined. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's involved in the integrity of the game,as well as (being) the chief 
person running the game," Wilpon said. "He's the chairman of all the major 
committees. That's a very powerful position." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the owners had announced at a January meeting in Florida that they 
were putting labor relations under the auspices of the commissioner and 
eliminating their Player Relations Committee, the new changes say: "The powers 
of the commissioner to act in the best interest of baseball shall be 
inapplicable to any matter relating to a subject of collective bargaining 
between the clubs and the Major League Baseball Players Assn." 
</P>
<P>
 That prevents a commissioner from unilaterally ending a management lockout, as 
Bowie Kuhn did in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes were contained in the long-dormant restructuring report adopted by 
the owners on Jan 19. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement released by the commissioner's office Friday said: "Owners have 
enhanced the authority and independence of the baseball commissioner" and 
changes were made to clarify the best-interest power. 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, the best-interest clause seems to have been gutted, but American 
League President Bobby Brown said: "The best-interest clause is still effective 
where it's most needed, in protecting the integrity of the game. The only thing 
(the owners) were trying to do was eliminate the possibility of (a unilateral) 
move (by a future commissioner) that didn't make an awful lot of sense." 
</P>
<P>
 The changes announced Friday failed to resolve one of their central disputes 
with Vincent: whether they have the power to fire a commissioner. However, the 
executive council may declare a commissioner incapacitated and take over his 
power by a two-thirds vote.

BONNETT KILLED IN CRASH AT DAYTONA; AUTO RACING: ANOTHER MEMBER OF NASCAR'S 
ALABAMA GANG DIES WHEN HIS CAR GOES OUT OF CONTROL IN TURN 4 DURING PRACTICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Tragedy continued to stalk stock car racing's Alabama Gang when veteran driver 
Neil Bonnett suffered fatal head injuries Friday when his car crashed into the 
Turn 4 wall at Daytona International Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 The death of the 47-year-old Bonnett, one of the most popular drivers on 
NASCAR's Winston Cup circuit, came as he was attempting a comeback in hopes of 
qualifying for the Feb. 20 Daytona 500. It was the latest in the tragic saga of 
a tightly knit group of racers from Hueytown, Ala., whose successes in stock 
car racing became legendary, but who have been affected by one tragedy after 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby Allison, the godfather of the Alabama Gang, suffered a head injury in a 
race in July 1988 that ended his Hall of Fame career. A head injury also cut 
short the career of Donnie Allison, Bobby's brother. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Bobby's sons, Clifford, was killed in a racing accident in Michigan in 
1992, and his other son, Davey, winner of the 1992 Daytona 500, died last July 
of injuries suffered in a helicopter accident at Talladega, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Davey Allison was going to Talladega from Hueytown to watch 
Bonnett's son, David, test a car. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's accident occurred shortly after noon during the first practice 
session for today's front-row qualifying trials for the 500. After being taken 
to the Halifax Medical Center trauma unit, Bonnett was declared dead at 1:17 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 An announcement of his death was delayed almost five hours while race 
officials tried to contact his wife, Susan, who had left the family home at 7 
a.m. and was driving to Daytona Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said that Bonnett's car, a Chevrolet owned by James Finch of Panama 
City, Fla., appeared to break loose as it entered the fourth turn, then veered 
abruptly to the safety apron before spinning around and shooting straight up 
the track into the outside wall. 
</P>
<P>
 It was almost the same spot where rookie driver Andy Farr of New Baltimore, 
Mich., crashed Thursday while attempting to qualify for Sunday's ARCA 200. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than a year ago, Bonnett was talking about his latest comeback and said 
he knew people were saying, "What's that crazy guy doing, trying to kill 
himself driving a race car again?" 
</P>
<P>
 Bonnett had suffered head injuries in a crash on April 1, 1990, at Darlington, 
S.C., that left him with a case of amnesia so serious that he was unable to 
recognize or remember his wife for some time. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors forbade Bonnett's return to racing for several years while he 
underwent neurological therapy. During that time, Bonnett became a color 
analyst and commentator for CBS Sports, TNN and TBS. 
</P>
<P>
 "Head injuries are strange," Bonnett said during his absence from the track. 
"You question your ability to do certain things. That type of injury is very 
difficult to deal with. That's where friends come in. Those who stuck by me the 
last three years are the ones I'm closest to now." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, after getting medical clearance, Bonnett made his first start in 
more than three years on July 25 at Talladega. He flipped on Lap 131 in a crash 
that caused the race to be halted while repairs were made to the fence. Bonnett 
was not injured and remained undeterred about his comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 "That wreck wasn't near as bad as it looked," he said later. "I came out of it 
with a positive attitude. It was at Talladega (where) I knew I had to keep 
racing. When I went out to qualify . . . and started down the straightaway, I 
started crying. That's how much it meant to me. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when I started planning to get a ride for this year's Daytona 500." 
</P>
<P>
 He appeared in one other race last year, the season finale at Atlanta, where 
he drove only one lap and retired for the day. He had qualified the car as a 
favor for Dale Earnhardt, his longtime hunting buddy, in case something 
happened to Earnhardt's car and he needed a backup in his points championship 
competition with Rusty Wallace. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonnett credited Earnhardt with helping him regain the confidence needed to 
race again. 
</P>
<P>
 "People joke about Earnhardt and myself," he said earlier this year, "but I 
don't care how much therapy you do, what he did was incredible. He stuck by me 
more than anybody when I was down. My best rehabilitation was when Dale asked 
me to climb into his race car." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonnett had planned to drive in at least six races this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they announced the race at Indy (the Brickyard 400 on Aug. 6), I decided 
I wanted to do that one," he said. "I'd like to drive a race at Charlotte and 
one at Talladega to see if I could finish in one piece, as well as Daytona and 
Indy. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife probably would prefer if I didn't go racing anymore, but I've always 
done the things I wanted to do, and she knows why I want to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 His Winston Cup career began in 1974, when he was a rookie protege of Bobby 
Allison. Bonnett won 18 Winston Cup races and 20 poles while earning nearly $4 
million in purses. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonnett won the 1979 Firecracker 400 at Daytona, but his best finish in the 
Daytona 500 was a third in 1980. He did, however, win twin 125-mile qualifying 
races in 1980 and '83. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonnett's first superspeedway victory was in the 1977 Los Angeles Times 500 at 
Ontario Motor Speedway, in the final success for a Dodge in Winston Cup 
competition. He also won the World 600 in 1982 and '83 at Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 His career the last 10 years, however, was plagued by accidents and injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonnett's death was the 24th on the Daytona track since it opened in February 
1959, including motorcycles and go-karts, as well as stock cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors include his wife, son David, 29, and daughter Kristen, 20.

THESE GAMES ARE SERIOUS BUSINESS; OLYMPICS: WITH OPENING CEREMONY TODAY, MANY 
ATHLETES HAVE OTHER THINGS ON THEIR MINDS. 
</P>

 Norwegians by reputation are polite but reserved, slow to warm to strangers, 
and were it not for the sheer joy they feel, and unreservedly share, as hosts 
of the XVII Olympic Winter Games, there would be a gloom over today's opening 
ceremony at Lillehammer Olympic Park to match a hazy sky in which the sun is no 
more than a rumor. 
</P>
<P>
 It was only two years ago that we did this, gathering for the XVI Winter 
Olympics in the French Alps, and as a result, many of the athletes who will 
compete during the next 16 days are familiar -- skier Alberto Tomba, 
speedskaters Bonnie Blair and Dan Jansen, figure skater Viktor Petrenko, the 
Jamaican bobsledders. 
</P>
<P>
 Others returning from Olympics past include figure skaters Brian Boitano, 
Katarina Witt, and Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean. 
</P>
<P>
 But they have been overshadowed by events of recent months, most tragically by 
the death of 68 persons in an attack on Sarajevo's Central Market in the same 
week that the Olympic movement commemorated its 10-year anniversary of the 1984 
Winter Games there and on the same day that a truce sponsored by the 
International Olympic Committee and the United Nations was supposed to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Austrian Alpine skier Ulrike Maier, a contender for three medals here, was 
killed in a downhill crash in Germany last month; U.S. ice dancer Elizabeth 
Punsalan's brother was arrested last week for the stabbing death of her father 
in Ohio; Norway's most popular athlete, cross-country skier Vegard Ulvang, who 
will deliver the athletes' oath today, has been searching for months for his 
brother who disappeared while skiing in a snowstorm. "In the springtime, when 
the snow is gone, I will go and try to find him," he said this week, his face 
streaked with tears.

 When luger Cammy Myler carries the flag for the U.S. delegation in the opening 
ceremony, her brother, Tim, who introduced her to the sport, will be watching 
on television from a hospital bed in Lake Placid, N.Y., where he is undergoing 
treatment for cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems of figure skaters Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding seem minuscule 
by comparison. It is they, however, who are dominating the headlines, even in 
Norway. A photograph of Kerrigan's face covered the front page of Norway's 
largest tabloid, VG, one day last week. Superimposed was the headline: 
"GALSCAP." Madness . 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing horned Viking helmets, painting their faces like the Norwegian flag 
and clanging cowbells until all hours of the morning, the citizens of this 
region have been similarly afflicted, behaving like, well, Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 A young waitress in a cafe here one day last week slipped on a wet spot and 
took a spill. Leaping to her feet, she struck a speedskater's pose and said, 
"Koss," referring to Norway's speedskating hero, Johann Olav Koss. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for their giddiness is that Norwegians like winter, and they have 
had plenty of it this year, with the most snow in three decades and 
temperatures hovering between minus-12 and 12. It is not quite as cold as it 
was during the 1952 Winter Games 110 miles south of here in Oslo, where carrier 
pigeons for news organizations froze to death, but it is cold enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason is that they like winter sports. They have bought virtually all 
of the 1.4 million tickets available for 112 events in eight sports, far 
surpassing the record set by the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee, 
which sold 84% of its allotment for the 1984 Summer Games. Thousands more 
Norwegians who were unlucky losers in the ticket lottery for the most popular 
sport here, cross-country skiing, are expected to line the snow-covered course 
for each race, many of them camping out overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 They are anticipating a gold rush for their athletes. After finishing first in 
the medal standings in five of the first six Winter Olympics, between 1924 and 
'52, Norway has done so only once since, in 1968. But with the collapse of the 
Eastern Bloc and the revitalization of their own sports system, Norwegians 
could win more medals here than any of the other 65 countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans, led by speedskaters Blair and Jansen and figure skaters Boitano and 
Kerrigan, could -- if everything goes right, which it never does -- win as many 
as 14 medals. The most they have won in the Winter Games is 12, at Lake Placid 
in both 1932 and 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Olympic Committee's executive director, Harvey Schiller, said Friday 
he fears that the Harding-Kerrigan affair could prove a distraction for U.S. 
athletes. But John Ruger, a former biathlete who serves as chairman of the 
USOC's athletes' advisory council, thinks not. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not their No. 1 topic of conversation," he said. "It comes up, but it's 
the third or 10th or 15th thing on their list of things to talk about. The 
Winter Olympics are so important to all 154 of our athletes that they're 
concentrating only on their events. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Olympic Games are about hope and promise and fulfilling your dreams, and 
those are the elements that our athletes are focusing on. This is their 
moment." 
</P>
<P>
 Today was supposed to be the moment for Ole Gunnar Fidjestol. Striving to 
one-up organizers of the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, who 
commissioned an archer to light the torch with a flaming arrow, the Lillehammer 
Olympic Organizing Committee arranged for the former ski flyer to sail off the 
end of a ski jump with the Olympic flame in the crowning spectacle of the 
opening ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 But after completing the jump in a rehearsal Thursday night, Fidjestol 
stumbled headfirst into a snowbank and suffered a concussion. Norwegians 
toasted him with a Sterno-like drink, aquavit, and partied into Friday. Stein 
Gruben will take Fidjestol's place today.

REMARKABLE COMEBACK; PREP PLAYER RETURNS QUICKLY FROM SERIOUS BRAIN INJURIES

<TEXT>
<P>
 College View Academy trailed by four points with just over four minutes 
remaining in its season-opener against Palmyra. College View junior Justin 
Schober stole the ball and raced down court. 
</P>
<P>
 As he went up for a layup, two defenders went for the block. One player's 
elbow hit Schober's right temple. He fell to the court, landing on his left hip 
and shoulder. Then he banged his head. 
</P>
<P>
 A pool of blood rapidly formed under his left temple. His breathing stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 The high school game was suspended. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months later, it resumed Wednesday night with Schober sinking one free 
throw and missing the second. 
</P>
<P>
 "I should've made both of them," he said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the attitude of the 17-year-old, whose return has been termed 
remarkable. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dec. 2 collision left him in a coma for four days. Justin suffered a brain 
stem bruise, some small brain bruises and bleeding in the ventricles, said his 
father, Gene Schober. 
</P>
<P>
 After four days in intensive care, he was transferred to a rehabilitation 
center, where doctors expected him to stay at least three months and up to a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Five weeks after being admitted to the center, he was released as an 
outpatient. About a week later, he returned to classes at his small private 
school in Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
 "His recovery is better than any head injury story I've heard," Gene Schober 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Justin Schober attributed his recovery to his will to leave the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 He left the game against Palmyra after missing his second free throw Wednesday 
night. His team lost, 58-52. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was neither nervous nor intimidated about playing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm fine," he said. "It's really a miracle."

MORNING BRIEFING: NO WORD ON WHETHER THEY CARRY BATONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 No doubt figuring that the world would be eager for the information -- and 
also to provide relief from the river of TonyaGate stories -- the Lillehamer 
Olympic Organizing Committee issued a release on trolls, the legendary little 
creatures of local legend.  
</P>
<P>
 Trolls are said to live in caves and come out and scare people to get food. 
They're crotchety characters, the release said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Norwegians claim: "We have had to fight with trolls because they are more 
stupid than us." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked officially about trolls, Peter Ronningen, the LOOC's deputy managing 
director, said: "They live in the mountains. They're huge. And very old. The 
oldest is 2,000 years old." Ronningen appeared to have a twinkle in his eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Are trolls dangerous? "No," he said. "They are kind to people." 
</P>
<P>
 Are they stupid? "Some of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Have you seen a troll in person? "Oh, yes." Pause. "But you have to be alone 
to see one." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Where and when did Jack Nicklaus get his first check as a 
professional golfer? 
</P>
<P>
 Surfin' with Tonya: From Leonard Shapiro of the Washington Post: "Wednesday 
night, NBC dredged up a 1992 interview with Harding, home videos of her skating 
at 13 and recycled tape of her encounter with the cop who wanted to tow her 
truck last week.  
</P>
<P>
 "If that's what passes for journalism at NBC these days, maybe it's time to 
surf somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 Add TonyaGate: From Tony Kornheiser of the Washington Post: "There's going to 
be a market for Tonya Harding in the same way that there is going to be a 
market for Amy Fisher, when she gets out of jail. That's who Tonya is now: Amy 
Fisher on skates." 
</P>
<P>
 Era of fear?John Kruk speaks almost wistfully about the days when no one paid 
any attention to the Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could go into a restaurant in almost any city and people didn't know who 
we were," he said. "It was kind of nice." 
</P>
<P>
 No more. Philadelphia's 1993 National League pennant and Kruk's status as the 
poster boy for the scruffy team make anonymity virtually impossible . . . and 
Kruk finds it a bit frightening. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mitch Williams got death threats," Kruk noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Monica Seles got stabbed. Nancy Kerrigan got attacked. Tennis and ice 
skating? Those are passive, timid sports. So when you see things like that 
happen, it's scary. 
</P>
<P>
 "People send you food or cookies. Do you eat them? It's getting to the point 
where it's hard to trust anybody. Players are going to be more and more 
reluctant to stop in a crowd." 
</P>
<P>
 Good deal: Pittsburgh Post-Gazette columnist Bruce Keidan recounted a story 
told to him by Atlanta writer Lewis Grizzard, who was recalling his favorite 
Super Bowl story from his sportswriting days: 
</P>
<P>
 "A sportswriter assigned to cover the big game was approached by a lady of 
easy virtue in his hotel bar. 
</P>
<P>
 "For $50," she says, "I'll do anything you want." 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything?" he asks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything," she repeats.  
</P>
<P>
 "Here's the fifty," he says, reaching for his wallet, "go up to my room and 
write a column and a sidebar." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Nicklaus earned $33.33 in the 1962 Los Angeles Open at Rancho 
Park golf course.

DON'T BURY YOUR HEART AT A WOUNDED KNEE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Downey's column on Feb. 2, "Harding's Fall Really Big Push?" suggested 
that the only thing Tonya Harding ought to be charged with "is criminal taste 
in men."  
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Downey's opinion demonstrates what most females do by the age of 3 or 4: 
That all they have to do to melt most men into complete idiocy is turn on a 
sweet and innocent look, smile and bat their eyelashes. A few tears don't hurt, 
either. Tonya is a champion -- not only at skating, but at manipulating, too. 
</P>
<P>
 As the investigation proceeds and more facts are made public, I suspect that 
Mr. Downey will realize he was fooled -- and probably not for the first time in 
his life. We females all do it from time to time, some more (and better) than 
others.

 Mike Downey's crush on Tonya Harding is cute and his stonewall defense of her 
in light of the ever-increasing evidence of her guilt is amazing.

 The lead article in the Feb. 6 sports page, "Panelist: Harding's Rights Are 
First," illustrates the confusion surrounding the standards that should be 
applied to the Tonya Harding situation. Richard Pound, a Canadian lawyer who is 
a member of the International Olympic Committee, is quoted as saying that 
unless there is compelling evidence, such as a confession or a conviction, 
there is no basis for overturning the results. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Pound is wrong. He uses a criminal law standard rather than a civil law 
standard to judge the case. Civil laws require only that there be some reliable 
evidence to support any decision of the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonya Harding is not a sportswoman. She does not typify the Olympic ideals. 
She clearly has violated the Olympic oath. She should be barred from 
participation.

<P>
 If we are to follow the current trend in national affairs, it is clear that 
Tonya Harding should represent the United States in the Olympics. When the 
attack on Nancy Kerrigan took place, Harding was not present and claims to have 
had no previous knowledge of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as ex-Presidents Reagan and Bush continued to represent their country, 
Tonya Harding should represent us in the Olympics.

BOXING / TIM KAWAKAMI; AFTER TWO MONTHS, DE LA HOYA REDISCOVERS THE EXCITEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The last time he was in camp, Oscar De La Hoya was on the fast track to 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 He was confused, cranky and either crazed by greed and his desire to be a 
movie star or courageously trying to extricate himself from a situation that 
had become too difficult to bear. 
</P>
<P>
 Not exactly a portrait of impending greatness, either way. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, he has shed his old management team, canceled a fight, taken a 
two-month break from boxing, decided never to let any outsider make his career 
decisions and, to the shock of many, returned to his usual Big Bear training 
camp looking like a world-class fighter and acting like a grown-up. 
</P>
<P>
 There's apparently nothing like a major dose of bad publicity and agreeing to 
dole out about $1 million of his future earnings to rid himself of Steve Nelson 
and Bob Mittleman, to prepare a fighter for the real world of boxing. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya, who turned 21 on Feb. 4, seems to be handling his March 5 World 
Boxing Organization junior-lightweight title bout against Jimmi Bredahl at the 
new Olympic Auditorium as though it were his first fight, not an audition for 
some future movie role. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've only seen him like this once before, when he was training for his pro 
debut," trainer Robert Alcazar said. "He's like a kid with a new toy. He's 
excited, he just can't wait for the day." 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya checked into camp at 138, eight pounds over the junior-lightweight 
limit. The 5-foot-11 De La Hoya has never made 130 in his professional career, 
never trained at anything much less than 133, and always was considered a more 
natural 135- or 140-pounder. And this time, he was coming in after not having 
fought since Oct. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened? Training with the heat blasting to sauna levels, De La Hoya 
dropped to 133 faster than anybody, maybe even himself, expected, and the last 
few days, according to Alcazar, has weighed 131 immediately after his early 
evening, pre-dinner sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, De La Hoya, known to sneak a snack or two to his room in the middle 
of training, seems to have learned discipline. Last week, a birthday cake from 
HBO sat on his refrigerator, untouched. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, some are asking if he is too light, peaking too soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're ahead of schedule, but it's good," said Alcazar, who wants to break 
camp two days before the fight with De La Hoya weighing 128, giving him some 
leeway once the distractions of home re-enter his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Those distractions -- the push and pull of his family, his business associates 
and his boxing advisers -- are what threatened to derail De La Hoya only two 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But he says he has uncluttered the chain of command and taken responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I'm getting overanxious," De La Hoya said, explaining his weight 
loss. "I want to get to it right away and prove to people that first of all, I 
can make the weight, and second of all, I'm going to be strong and win the 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel no pressure now. All I have to do is box and train, worry about 
nothing. When (Mittleman and Nelson) were here, there were just problems. They 
were bringing in their own team, own publicist, own lawyers, everything. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't say I'm my own manager now, but I'm on my own. I have my legal 
advice, my senior adviser and I have all these people who, when we have 
something to discuss, we all get together, kind of talk it over. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a jury in some ways. It's much better. Now, we don't have people 
doing things behind our backs, doing things under the table. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I make the final decision." 
</P>
<P>
 The key figure in the current arrangement appears to be local car dealer Mike 
Hernandez, a friend of the family who stepped in at the height of the crisis to 
settle De La Hoya down. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez is continuing as a senior adviser, and according to promoter Bob 
Arum, refuses to be paid more than $1 a fight while leaving De La Hoya's 
training to Alcazar. 
</P>
<P>
 "He talks to us and he has no interest whatsoever in percentages or anything," 
De La Hoya said of Hernandez. "He's just there as a friend to maybe tell me a 
few things. The relationship we have is good. 
</P>
<P>
 "I trust him, he trusts me. We have good communication. It's like a friend 
(advising) me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could never really communicate (with Mittleman and Nelson). Something would 
always be bothering me, they were pressuring me into something, I would be 
unhappy -- and they could see it, but I had no say in anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Arum: "Luckily, he's done what he promised, thrown everything at 
Hernandez, so he's not distracted with it. The same vultures fly around all the 
time, and now they have to go through Hernandez, and that's not easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "They look to me on the boxing promotion side, and they look to Hernandez on 
everything else." 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming that De La Hoya defeats Bredahl and wins the WBO title, his new 
freedom from weight worries could open up new avenues. Until recently, the plan 
always was to win a quick junior-lightweight title, perhaps defend it, then 
climb to lightweight as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, De La Hoya is putting off the movie deals and considering staying at 130 
and possibly winning one of the major junior-lightweight titles instead of 
rushing into the bigger divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It depends on the fight, how I feel," De La Hoya said. "If I'm tired, if I 
feel weak, then I'll just go up. If I feel strong and really feel overpowering, 
then I'll stick around, no problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Arum said it might do De La Hoya good to stay at 130 for a while, making sure 
his body is ready to take the shots of bigger fighters. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya said he'd like to fight in May, possibly at the MGM Grand in Las 
Vegas, and his next HBO fight is set for July. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kid really has put all this other nonsense on the back burner," Arum 
said. "I told him, 'Oscar, I'll keep you busy in boxing and we'll keep making 
you rich.' "

<P>
 It's Lillehammer time! 
</P>
<P>
 Norway? Way! Today is the opening ceremony. Welcome to the Winter Olympics. 
I'm your host, Bob Sledd, along with my partner, Bjorn Free, coming to you live 
from greater metropolitan Oslo, where the four key words are cold, colder, 
coldest and yeeeeeeee-owwwwwwww! I don't want to say it was cold here in the 
Northland yesterday, Bjorn, but my nose almost fell off my face. I'm talking 
Minus Six Degrees of Separation here. 
</P>
<P>
 Ya, your face looks like a teapot, Bob. Are those your ears or are you 
auditioning for the Norwegian production of "Dumbo?" 
</P>
<P>
 Very funny, Bjorn. Especially coming from a guy who thought Henrik Ibsen was 
the actor who played Jed Clampett and Barnaby Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's preview today's opening ceremony, Bob. Here in the big Norge outdoor 
refrigerator, 66 different lands from around the globe will be represented in 
the big parade of nations! 
</P>
<P>
 I hope those men from American Samoa brought their flannels, Bjorn. 
</P>
<P>
 And some Chap-Stick, Bob. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the dignitaries here today, Bjorn, will be King Harald and Queen Sonja 
from your beautiful country! 
</P>
<P>
 Right you are, Bob. I had a chance to speak with the King last night at the 
big Heineken-Heineken Light party promoting Heineken Bowl XVII and "ABC's 
Monday Night Skiing" with Dan Dierendoorfen. 
</P>
<P>
 Who was the King with, Bjorn? 
</P>
<P>
 The Palace Cowboy cheerleaders, Bob. 
</P>
<P>
 What did the King say, Bjorn? 
</P>
<P>
 He said, "It's good to be the King," Bob. 
</P>
<P>
 Say, how was that party, Bjorn? 
</P>
<P>
 Great, Bob! Great food! I had myself a double reindeer whopper with fries and 
a large Ovaltine shake. Mmmm, delicious. You should've been there. 
</P>
<P>
 Count me out, Bjorn. I can't see myself eating Rudolph the red-nosed 
cheeseburger. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, then you should've come for the music, Bob. We had a live telecast 
featuring some of Scandinavia's top performers! The Grateful Sled! Whitney 
Helsinki! Oslo Osborne! Myron Copenhagen! Andrew Ice Clay! Sardine Martin! 
Salmon Davis Jr.! 
</P>
<P>
 Must have had a big TV audience, Bjorn! 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, our Brigitte Nielsen ratings were huge, Bob! 
</P>
<P>
 Who else will be attending today's opening ceremony, Bjorn? 
</P>
<P>
 Hillary Rodham Clinton's coming. 
</P>
<P>
 Good! She can look at my frozen nose! 
</P>
<P>
 Why's that, Bob? 
</P>
<P>
 Health care! 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe your First Lady will do the wave, Bob. When we went to Albertville two 
years ago, Francois Mitterand and Dan Quayle did the wave. 
</P>
<P>
 Probably to keep from freezing to their seats, Bjorn. 
</P>
<P>
 Didn't Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson sit with the Vice President at the 
Albertville ceremonies, Bob? 
</P>
<P>
 Yep. I hear Florence Griffith Joyner's going to be here with Mrs. Clinton 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 In this cold? Man, with those fingernails, she's going to turn into a Swiss 
Army Knife. 
</P>
<P>
 Better drink some of that aquavit, Bjorn. 
</P>
<P>
 Ya, that'll keep her warm. 
</P>
<P>
 That'll keep her embalmed. Wow, Bjorn, I know this aquavit is your national 
drink, but this stuff comes in three flavors -- super, regular and diesel. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's begin the parade, Bob. 
</P>
<P>
 Right you are, Bjorn. 
</P>
<P>
 See all those beautiful ice skaters sitting by the King, Bob? 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah. How come, Bjorn? 
</P>
<P>
 It's good to be the King, Bob. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the Winter Olympics, everybody! On behalf of Bjorn Free, Al Pine, 
Jim Damply, Bob Frostas, Nestle Visser, Frozen O.J. Simpson, Long John Madden, 
Pat Winterall and our entire Lillehammer Olympic team, enjoy the opening 
ceremony, and stay tuned for, "Pneumonia, She Wrote," right after the show!

EXPERIENCED CBS READIES FOR ANOTHER WINTER OF CONTENT; TELEVISION: ONLY TWO 
YEARS AFTER ALBERTVILLE, THE NETWORK WILL PUT THE SPOTLIGHT ON LILLEHAMMER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In January of 1984, a month before it would televise the Winter Olympics at 
Sarajevo, Yugoslavia, ABC agreed to pay $309 million for rights to the 1988 
Winter Olympics at Calgary, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal, made in Lausanne, Switzerland, left a sour taste in the mouths of 
Roone Arledge and other ABC executives. 
</P>
<P>
 They believed they had been had. The bidding was turned into an open auction 
by Barry Frank, acting as a consultant to the International Olympic Committee, 
and it pushed the price higher than anyone had believed possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The $309 million was more than three times greater than the $91.5 million ABC 
had paid for the Sarajevo Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
 Donna de Varona, then Arledge's assistant, recalls that Frank had ABC over a 
barrel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Roone was very big on motivating the troops, and losing out on the Calgary 
Olympics one month before the Sarajevo Olympics would have killed morale," De 
Varona said. "Frank knew he could take Roone to the wall." 
</P>
<P>
 Frank got his price, but the Calgary Winter Games would be the last Olympics 
televised by ABC. 
</P>
<P>
 By agreeing to pay so much, ABC took itself out of the bidding for the 1988 
Summer Olympics at Seoul, Korea, which went to NBC for $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
 De Varona recalls that Arledge told IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch that, 
at such prices, there was no way one network could televise two Games in the 
same year, as ABC had done during the years it billed itself as "the network of 
the Olympics." 
</P>
<P>
 If Arledge was right, one network would always be automatically eliminated 
from the bidding. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a simple solution, however. Arledge suggested that the IOC stagger 
the Winter and Summer Olympics, holding one every two years instead of both 
every four years. 
</P>
<P>
 The IOC, normally a slow-moving, cautious group, acted quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting at Lausanne in October of 1986, the IOC, prompted by Samaranch and its 
11-member executive board, broke a 70-year tradition and rather quietly, 
without much fanfare, agreed to stage a Winter Games in 1994 and continue 
thereafter at four-year intervals. 
</P>
<P>
 So now CBS, only two years after televising the Winter Olympics at 
Albertville, France, is televising another. 
</P>
<P>
 Only last month, CBS also won the rights to the 1998 Winter Games at Nagano, 
Japan, with a bid of $375 million, which was $80 million more than the rights 
fee for this month's Winter Olympics at Lillehammer, Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS has lost the NBA, major league baseball and the NFL, but now it can bill 
itself as "the network of the Winter Olympics." 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel that we have the experience and the confidence in our production and 
sales staffs to do the Winter Olympics better than anyone," said Neal Pilson, 
president of CBS Sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "NBC knows the Summer Olympics, and that gives them an advantage there." 
</P>
<P>
 And the new setup -- an Olympics every two years -- is good for everyone in 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are only positives," said Mark Harrington, CBS' vice president in 
charge of Olympic coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Klatt, coordinating producer of TNT's coverage, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 The big pluses are: It spreads out advertising, meaning sponsors aren't asked 
to support two Olympics in one year, and it spreads out promotional aspects. 
</P>
<P>
 It would seem also to be a plus for viewers. They no longer will have a 
four-year wait between Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 CBS will devote 120 hours to the Lillehammer Winter Games, with 50 hours in 
prime time. 
</P>
<P>
 TNT will add 45 hours of supplemental weekday coverage of the event, which 
opens today and runs through Feb. 27. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS generally will have three blocks of coverage, with a fourth added on some 
weekend days. 
</P>
<P>
 Weekdays, coverage will run 7 to 9 a.m., 8 to 11 p.m. and after David 
Letterman, 12:37 to 1:37 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 TNT's weekday coverage will run from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 With Lillehammer nine hours ahead of the West Coast, almost all of CBS' 
programming will be tape-delayed. Some of TNT's will be live. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Gumbel will be the host of CBS' prime-time coverage, replacing Tim 
McCarver and Paula Zahn, who split that chore at Albertville in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Gentile, CBS' senior vice president of production, acknowledged that the 
"fit wasn't right" with McCarver and Zahn. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Gumbel, he said: "He's an easy look and listen, a good traffic cop, 
personable and a good storyteller." 
</P>
<P>
 Oversimplifying it, Gumbel said: "My job is to make sure I don't make people 
throw up." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "I'm no genius. If it was up to me, I'd mount the goalie on the 
goalie-cam (rather than the other way around)." 
</P>
<P>
 Gumbel's younger brother, Bryant, was the prime-time host for NBC at the 1988 
Seoul Olympics. Similarities between Greg and Bryant are only coincidental. If 
Bryant is three-piece suits, Greg is jeans and a T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't bad-mouth Bryant to Greg. "One time someone came up to me and said: 
'You're not the jerk your brother is,' " Greg said. "My response was, 'Have you 
ever met my brother?' He said he hadn't, so I told him he didn't know what he 
was talking about." 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Gumbel co-anchored the weekend morning broadcasts from Albertville in 
'92. 
</P>
<P>
 Zahn returns for the Lillehammer Games. She and Harry Smith will co-anchor the 
weekday morning telecasts; Andrea Joyce and Jim Nantz will handle the weekend 
daytime slots, and Pat O'Brien will again be host of the late-night shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosts for TNT include John Naber, Nick Charles and Fred Hickman. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives of CBS and TNT will meet each weekday to decide which network gets 
what, with CBS having priority. 
</P>
<P>
 TNT's Klatt said his network will devote considerable time to hockey, with a 
complete or almost-complete game each day. 
</P>
<P>
 Figure skating, of course, figures to be CBS' big sport.

T-SHIRT PRICE NOT EXACTLY RIGHT FOR OLYMPIC CHIEF SAMARANCH

 Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the International Olympic Committee, was 
outbid for the final countdown T-shirt in downtown Lillehammer. 
</P>
<P>
 Harald Belsvik, a local businessman, has been auctioning a T-shirt a day for 
the last three years, starting with one that said "1,000 days left till the 
Olympics," turning the proceeds over to the Lillehammer Olympic Organizing 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's said "1 day left till the Olympics," and went for 56,000 Norwegian 
kroner -- more than $7,500 -- to Arthur Buchardt, a businessman. Samaranch 
dropped out of the bidding at 50,000 kroner. MIKE KUPPER

WINTER OLYMPICS / NOTEBOOK; PIPKINS CONQUERS THE UNKNOWN IN LUGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert Pipkins, 20, an alternate on the U.S. luge team, was introduced to the 
sport in the summer of 1988 when his mother, who worked for the NYNEX 
Corporation in New York, one of the team's major sponsors, read about a novice 
training camp at Lake Placid, N.Y., in a company publication. 
</P>
<P>
 Recalled Pipkins: "She asked me if I wanted to try, and I said, 'Sure, great. 
What's luge?' And she said, 'I don't know.' I mean, all we knew is that it was 
an Olympic sport. We didn't know if it was Summer or Winter Olympics." 
</P>
<P>
 Pipkins tried it on wheels first and was hooked. He now is a luge nomad in the 
winter and an architectural engineering major at Drexel University in the 
spring and summer. 
</P>
<P>
 He was also linked to headlines in October when a group of skinheads in 
Oberhof, Germany, mocked his African-American roots, and luge teammate Duncan 
Kennedy physically intervened, giving Pipkins time to escape. 
</P>
<P>
 Pipkins said he has harbored guilt about not standing up for himself, but 
Kennedy is quick to absolve him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he was going to be killed," Kennedy reiterated the other day. "He 
has no reason to feel guilty. There were 12 or 15 of them and they weren't 
going to stop with just taunts. Anyone being threatened like Robert was would 
have gotten out of there." 
</P>
<P>
 Pipkins said he was not letting his life revolve around the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "But sometimes I walk around a corner and wonder if I'm going to bump into one 
of those jerks," he said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In luge doubles, scheduled here next Friday, communication is conducted in 
body language, and driving is shared. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to know each other inside out," said Gordy Sheer, who teamed with 
Chris Thorpe to finish fourth overall in World Cup competition this season, 
their best performance in four years as a U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheer, who as the bottom man can't see anything but Thorpe, steers with his 
shoulders. Thorpe uses his feet. Any sudden or unplanned movement during the 
race significantly affects aerodynamics -- and relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've literally butted heads a few times, but basically there's total trust," 
Sheer said. "We pretty much spend every day of our lives together. I mean, we 
sometimes get upset like brothers, but if you hold a grudge on the ice, you're 
going to end up killing each other." 
</P>

 A federal court in Indianapolis has scheduled a hearing Tuesday for a suit 
filed by bobsled driver Bruce Rosselli. He is charging driver Brian Shimer and 
the U.S. Skeleton and Bobsled Federation with a conspiracy against him in the 
Olympic trials and is requesting new trials. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobsled competition is scheduled to begin here four days after the hearing, 
which raises a question as to when new trials could be conducted. Rosselli's 
contention has already been rejected in arbitration, a ruling that was upheld 
by a state court in Chicago. ROSS NEWHAN

 The last few months have been eventful ones for the Richter family of Madison, 
Wis. 
</P>
<P>
 First, son Barry made the Olympic hockey team. Then Pat, Barry's father and 
the athletic director at the University of Wisconsin, watched as the Badger 
football team beat UCLA in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a lot of fun," said Barry, a defenseman. "It's all been great. I 
just hope all the great things that have been happening don't stop happening 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Richter is expected to arrive in Norway this weekend.

 Building the Olympic teams around NHL players, as is expected to happen in 
1998, defeats the purpose of the Games, according to U.S. hockey Coach Tim 
Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like what we do here," he said. "I like the process of taking a team and 
molding it and letting its character develop. Any success we achieve here in 
Lillehammer is going to be dependent on that chemistry. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I believe Olympic athletes should make a sacrifice, come in here having done 
everything he or she can to be the best athlete. That doesn't happen when you 
just pull someone off an NHL team. Something's lost." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Peter Laviolette, the captain and oldest player on the U.S. team at 29, will 
be playing in his second Games. Laviolette played for Dave Peterson at Calgary 
in 1988 and, after failing to win a medal there, felt something was missing 
from his hockey career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came back because, after looking back over the years, I found myself 
thinking, especially after '92 and how well they did, how disappointing it was 
to finish seventh in '88," Laviolette said. "I was fortunate enough to have 
this chance once. To get a second crack at it, that's great." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The U.S. players voted unanimously to participate in today's opening ceremony, 
which has Taylor fretting. Festivities begin at 4 p.m., and the team is 
scheduled to skate at 8. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want them to be on their feet for seven hours in the cold," he said. 
"But the players feel they'd like to be there, like to be a part of it. It's an 
Olympic experience and it's motivational just to be there. Whatever detrimental 
effect the cold and standing up might have will be more than compensated by the 
(emotional) rush of it." HELENE ELLIOTT

FRIEND OF HARDING HIT BY CAR THAT WAS FOLLOWING SKATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A friend of Tonya Harding escaped injury Friday when he was struck by a car 
after demanding that the car's driver stop following Harding and her entourage, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding witnessed the altercation, which took place in downtown Portland, and 
notified authorities by calling 911, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident involved David Webber, 51, who is the father of Harding's friend, 
Stephanie Quintero, and who has been described as a surrogate father to the 
embattled figure skater. Harding has been living with Quintero and her husband, 
John, since leaving ex-husband Jeff Gillooly last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Police gave this account: 
</P>
<P>
 Harding, Webber and Quintero were driving downtown from an ice rink in 
suburban Beaverton, where Harding skated for about an hour Friday morning, when 
they noticed they were being followed by two cars. 
</P>
<P>
 When all of four vehicles came to a stop at a traffic signal, Webber got out 
of the car and confronted the driver of one of the other cars. He told the 
driver, a cameraman for NBC News, to stop following and harassing them. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the second car accelerated and struck Webber, knocking him to 
the pavement, and then drove away. 
</P>
<P>
 Later Friday, John Quintero was arrested after allegedly grabbing the manager 
of his apartment building by the arm and complaining that too many reporters 
were being allowed in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporters, photographers and camera crews have been in and around the 
apartment complex to track Harding's movements. An ABC television crew has 
rented an apartment next to the Quinteros. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quintero was arguing that the management was not doing enough to keep the 
media from invading his privacy and his company's privacy," said Mark Hyde, a

KERRIGAN TOYS WITH MEDIA AFTER FIRST NORWAY PRACTICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Six women figure skaters were scheduled to practice at 11:35 a.m. Friday at 
the Olympic Amphitheatre. Two showed up. 
</P>
<P>
 So did 10 television camera crews, about 75 to 100 newspaper reporters from 
throughout the world, a smattering of fans and even some coaches and skaters 
who were not scheduled to practice then. 
</P>
<P>
 Who were they there to see? 
</P>
<P>
 Hint: It was not South Korea's Lee Lily Lyoonjung. 
</P>
<P>
 Skating onto the ice to Tina Turner's "The Best," Nancy Kerrigan practiced for 
the first time since arriving in Norway on Thursday for her Winter Olympic 
competition, which will begin Feb. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Performing her long program, she might not have been, as the lyrics say, 
"Simply the best, better than all the rest." But she was pretty good, skating 
her entire four-minute freestyle program without interruption and perfectly 
landing five of six triple jumps she attempted. 
</P>
<P>
 As she left the rink through a tunnel afterward, reporters shouted questions 
at her from the bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
 The knee? 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't answer that?" she said, playfully. "You didn't think it looked OK? 
It feels wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 The practice? 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a couple of slips, but that's the first practice," she said. 
"That's expected. I'm a little tired from the trip." 
</P>
<P>
 The media attention? 
</P>
<P>
 "I prefer not to be followed wherever I go," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The impromptu news conference ended when a reporter asked for her response to 
Tonya Harding's comment Wednesday that she would like to give Kerrigan a hug. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan consulted momentarily with Kristin Matta, U.S. Figure Skating Assn. 
spokeswoman, turned back toward the reporters and said: "Bye." RANDY HARVEY

FORMER BRUIN ALTENBERG HOSPITALIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kurt Altenberg, 50, who caught a pass from Gary Beban to set up the winning 
touchdown in UCLA's first Rose Bowl victory on Jan. 1, 1966, is in the coronary 
care center at UCLA Medical Center awaiting a heart transplant. 
</P>
<P>
 Altenberg, who led the Bruins in receiving in 1964 and '65, was vacationing in 
Mexico with former teammate Byron Nelson last November when he caught a virus, 
another former Bruin, Don Francis, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apparently, the virus affected the heart muscle and it stopped beating," 
Francis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Altenberg was revived, but damage was so severe that a heart transplant will 
be needed, Francis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins upset No. 1-ranked Michigan State, 14-12, in the 1966 Rose Bowl.

SANTA ANITA; CARDMANIA OUT OF SAN ANTONIO WITH BROKEN LEG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not long after Cardmania was entered in Sunday's San Antonio Handicap at Santa 
Anita, it was determined that the 8-year-old gelding had a fractured cannon 
bone in his left hind leg and will have to be sidelined for a minimum of six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 The injury was discovered after Cardmania, who won the Eclipse Award as the 
nation's top sprinter last year on the strength of his victory in the Breeders' 
Cup Sprint, galloped Friday morning at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Derek Meredith was unsure about how the break occurred. "I still can't 
believe it," he said. "He galloped and then he walked back to the barn well. In 
fact, I went ahead and entered him in (the San Antonio)." 
</P>
<P>
 Meredith said he noticed Cardmania, who won his first start of the year in the 
San Carlos Handicap last month, limping while the son of Cox's Ridge was 
cooling out. X-rays revealed the fracture. The cannon bone is the largest bone 
between the knee and the ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 Additional X-rays have been scheduled, and Cardmania probably will undergo 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ron McAnally isn't conceding anything regarding Paseana's return in the 
$158,200 Santa Maria Handicap today at Santa Anita. The trainer believes 
Paseana, a two-time Eclipse Award winner, is ready for success in her first 
race since losing by a nose in the Breeders' Cup Distaff last Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's doing very well," McAnally said. "She should be fit enough. We've 
worked her pretty hard the last three or four works. She's cranked up about as 
tight as I can get her. She blew out really well (running a half-mile in 46 
4/5) on Thursday." 
</P>
<P>
 Paseana, who will carry 124 pounds and concede her six rivals 8-10 pounds in 
the 1 1/16 mile Santa Maria, is the 6-5 favorite in her first race as a 
7-year-old. Chris McCarron will ride her again, and Paseana has never been 
worse than second in seven starts at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, considering her advancing age and the fact that she was upset in this 
race a year ago by Race the Wild Wind, today would seem to be the day she might 
be beaten. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she's ready," McAnally said. "We've been kind of planning on this 
race. I can't see much difference in her from last year or the year before. 
She's a pro." 
</P>
<P>
 Sensational Eyes is the 5-2 second choice. An abscess in her left hind foot 
caused her to miss the La Canada, but she has bounced back and worked six 
furlongs in 1:13 3/5 last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kent Desormeaux will be making his first ride on Sensational Eyes, who figures 
to take the lead. Desormeaux rode Race the Wild Wind when she defeated Paseana 
in last year's Santa Maria. 
</P>
<P>
 "All (the foot) needed was a little rest," trainer Gary Jones said. "It saved 
us five pounds." Sensational Eyes, who has won three of her six starts, had 
been scheduled to carry 119 pounds in the La Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Supah Gem, who beat Sensational Eyes in the El Encino last month, is the 4-1 
third choice, and the other Santa Maria entrants are Senate Appointee, Market 
Booster, Party Cited and Alysbelle. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fly'n J. Bryan, one of the most impressive maiden winners of the meeting in 
his debut on Jan. 22, will step right into the San Vicente Breeders' Cup Stakes 
on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Owned by Joseph Fenley and trained by Doug Peterson, the 3-year-old Ogygian 
colt quickly opened up on his field, which included the highly regarded 
Laabity, through a 21 2/5 first quarter, then went on to win by 4 1/2 lengths 
in 1:08 2/5. 
</P>
<P>
 Only five others were entered Friday morning in the seven-furlong San Vicente, 
and Fly'n J. Bryan is the likely favorite. He worked five furlongs in 1:00 last 
Sunday, an exercise that drew raves. It was termed breezing by the clockers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was tremendous," Peterson said. "He came home (the last three furlongs) in 
34 4/5 and went the last eighth in 11 3/5, and he did it under a hold." 
</P>
<P>
 Fly'n J. Bryan trained exceptionally well last spring at Hollywood Park for 
trainer Brian Mayberry and was scheduled to make his debut last July 3, but was 
scratched when he wrenched an ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 Sent to a farm in Rancho Santa Fe to recover, the $110,000 purchase was out 
for 90 days before being turned over to Peterson by Fenley on the 
recommendation of Tom Cavanagh, for whom Peterson also trains. 
</P>
<P>
 "I greatly appreciate what Mr. Cavanagh did," Peterson said. "From Day One, 
this horse has lived up to everything everybody has said about him. Only time 
will tell (how good he can be), but obviously, there's something different 
about him than your average horse. He has a great attitude."

MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK: HER VICTORY MADE SPARKS FLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When a tire explodes at 260 m.p.h., catapulting the rubber carcass through the 
air like a Frisbee, it's no mean task to prevent the speeding vehicle from 
spinning wildly out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 It happened to Shelly Anderson last Sunday during the top fuel finals of the 
National Hot Rod Assn.'s Winternationals when the drive shaft broke on her car 
and the reverser punctured the huge right rear tire. Remarkably, the 
28-year-old driver from Covina kept the 5,000-horsepower engine under control 
and continued down the 30-foot lane in a shower of titanium sparks to win the 
season's opening event at the Pomona Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson's reaction: "It was no big deal, just part of driving." 
</P>
<P>
 Her father, Brad, a three-time national alcohol funny car champion turned car 
owner and crew chief, is a taciturn man of few words and even fewer platitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 "She did quite a job of driving," he said. "The crew gave her a car (in 
qualifying) that was a winner. That 4.79 (seconds elapsed time) belonged to the 
crew. What Shelly did all day long (Sunday) belonged to her. She never did have 
an easy run." 
</P>
<P>
 Only seven drivers before Anderson had posted a time better than 4.8 seconds 
for a quarter-mile from a standing start. Her speed of 297.91 m.p.h. was the 
best of her career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if that was the most exciting run I ever had or not," Anderson 
said. "I had one at Seattle where we broke an A-arm and the car exchanged 
lanes. That was pretty hairy, although I didn't hit anything." 
</P>
<P>
 In the final elimination against Rance McDaniel, when Anderson's car dropped 
down on the rim, the reverser dragged along the track, sparks flying in its 
wake. Adding to the excitement, the blower came off and a fire erupted in the 
motor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fire made it more spectacular for the fans and the TV, but the safety 
crew was right there to put it out as soon as I quit sliding," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 And after she quit sliding and the safety crew was escorting her to the 
ambulance, her mother, Carol, who is the team's manager, walked alongside and 
said: "Check your eye makeup, your mascara got smeared (when you took your 
helmet off)." 
</P>
<P>
 After all, the final rounds were on live television. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it was more dramatic for the fans, the final run might not have been 
the most difficult for Anderson. In the second round, against Mike Brotherton, 
Anderson's car broke an A-arm, forcing her to steer with only one front wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really hard to keep it inside the lane," she said. "My chutes came out 
late because I was so busy I couldn't take my hands off the steering wheel." 
</P>
<P>
 In her other two races, she lost traction coming off the starting line. On 
both occasions, her opponents (Pat Austin and Clayton Harris) had the same 
problem, but neither reacted as quickly as Anderson and she beat them to the 
finish line. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tired to overpower the track and ended up smoking the tires," Anderson 
said. "When you do that, you have to pedal it down the track, hoping you get 
there first." 
</P>
<P>
 The victory over Austin evened the score for the Anderson family. Earlier that 
day, Austin had defeated Shelly's brother, Randy -- the NHRA champion -- in the 
semifinal round of alcohol funny car eliminations. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The opening round of the eight-race Mickey Thompson Stadium Off-Road Racing 
Series -- postponed because of earthquake damage to the stadium -- is scheduled 
tonight at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Johnson and Ivan Stewart, who staged one of stadium racing's closest 
finishes in a driving rain last year, will be back in their Grand National 
trucks, along with defending series champion Rod Millen. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, a former national motocross champion from Encinitas, edged his 
Chevrolet truck past Stewart's Toyota on the last jump of the last turn a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since I won Anaheim last year, I'm starting out the season as the one to 
beat," Johnson said. "I like it that way. I'd like to repeat the win in the 
same fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will never forget the '93 race, and I don't think Ivan (Stewart) will, 
either, because it couldn't have been much more exciting. A torrential downpour 
turned the course into deep mud, and Ivan and I got a little tangled up at the 
finish. The crowd went crazy when I took the checkered flag, and Ivan ended up 
on top of a course barrier." 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmie Johnson, 18, will be Rick Johnson's teammate on the Nelson & Nelson 
Racing team. Both are from the San Diego area and are not related. Jimmie, who 
lives in El Cajon, drove in three races last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart and Millen, in matching Toyotas from Cal Wells' Precision Preparation, 
Inc., shop, will be seeking an 11th manufacturers' championship. Millen won 
only one event last year but still managed to edge Rick Johnson for the 
driver's title. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Mears, winner of the last two races in 1993, and his son, Roger Jr., 
will be in the family's Budweiser trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker Evans, the 1991 series champion from Riverside, will not be racing 
after having competed in all 14 previous seasons. Evans, who will continue to 
race his trucks in desert events, will become a TV analyst on ESPN for the 
Thompson stadium series. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of the six class champions will defend their titles. In addition to 
Millen, they are Jerry Welchel, super 1,600; Greg George, superlite; Doug 
Eichner, four-wheel ATV; and Larry Brooks, ultracross. Two-time sports utility 
champion Tommy Croft has retired his Jeep Cherokee for 1994.

VIEW FROM OTHER SIDE NOT AS GOOD; BASKETBALL: FORMER MATER DEI GUARD DAVID 
DRAKEFORD, WHO ISN'T USED TO LOSING, LOOKS FOR POSITIVES WHILE PLAYING FOR 
OREGON STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So this is how all those opponents felt during David Drakeford's high school 
basketball career. 
</P>
<P>
 It took the Oregon State freshman all of 2 1/2 weeks in college to see how the 
other half lives. The Beavers lost five of their first six games this season, 
which was one more loss than Drakeford suffered in his junior and senior 
seasons combined at Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole experience left Drakeford feeling a bit jilted. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first five losses I cried, because I just wasn't used to that," Drakeford 
said by phone from Corvallis, Ore. "The whole time I was at Mater Dei, from 
freshman to junior varsity to varsity, my teams went 115-7, and to come here 
and lose five games so quickly destroyed me." 
</P>
<P>
 Drakeford would go straight home or back to his hotel room to sulk after those 
losses. He was depressed. He wouldn't talk to anyone, except his parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I called them a lot during that time," Drakeford said. "They just said to 
keep my head up, that things will get better." 
</P>
<P>
 Things did. Injuries to several key players vaulted Drakeford into the 
starting lineup in late December, and Drakeford played well in consecutive 
victories against North Carolina Wilmington, Oregon and Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 Drakeford has held his starting job and has continued to impress Oregon State 
Coach Jim Anderson with his outstanding defensive play and solid, if not 
spectacular, offense. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-foot-11, 180-pound point guard is averaging 6.0 points entering today's 
game against Oregon and has committed only 11 turnovers in 446 minutes, the 
lowest among Beaver starters despite playing the position most conducive to 
turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't make many mistakes and he gets us into our offense well," Anderson 
said. "Not very many freshmen come into the Pac-10 and get prime time, but he's 
averaging 25 minutes a game. He doesn't get scared, he gets more confident with 
each game, and he's becoming one of the best defensive guards in the 
conference." 
</P>
<P>
 But Oregon State and Drakeford have not been progressing down parallel tracks. 
With starters J.D. Vetter, Sonny Benjamin and Mustapha Hoff out because of 
injuries, the Beavers have struggled in Pac-10 play, losing eight of their last 
nine games to fall to 5-13, 1-8 in conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The skid hasn't devastated Drakeford like those early-season losses, though. 
With increased responsibility on the court and numerous counseling sessions 
with his father, Drakeford has gained a more mature outlook on the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm handling this a lot better because of my father," said Drakeford, whose 
family lives in Placentia. "He always taught me that whatever situation comes 
in life, good or bad, you have to deal with it. He taught me that it's good to 
win, but in a sense, because of the way we were winning at Mater Dei, maybe I 
needed a losing season to keep me humble, so I know what it feels like to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 "To tell you the truth, I didn't get an opportunity to feel what other teams 
felt in high school. Now, I can honestly say I have." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Oregon State's record, Drakeford looks at this season as a positive. 
Here he is, a mere freshman who averaged eight points last season at Mater Dei 
and wasn't expecting much playing time this season, starting in the Pac-10 and 
going head-to-head with the conference's best guards. 
</P>
<P>
 Drakeford's specialty is defense -- that's what earned him Times All-County 
honors in 1992-93 -- and Anderson usually assigns Drakeford to the opponent's 
best back-court player. 
</P>
<P>
 That means difficult matchups against the likes of California's Jason Kidd, 
UCLA's Tyus Edney, Arizona's Damon Stoudamire, Stanford's Brevin Knight and 
Arizona State's Stevin Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely tough, but I enjoy the challenge," Drakeford said. "That's 
why I wanted to play in the Pac-10. Hopefully when I'm older I'll be 
categorized as one of those players." 
</P>
<P>
 Drakeford has held his own most nights. Knight failed to make a field goal in 
Stanford's 71-67 victory over Oregon State last Saturday, and Drakeford limited 
Kidd to 11 first-half points in Cal's 67-61 victory Feb. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 But Drakeford was held hostage one night. Arizona State's Smith scored 39 
against Drakeford in an 88-82 Sun Devil victory Jan. 27. 
</P>
<P>
 "They call him 'Headache' because that's what he can give you," Drakeford 
said. "Basically, he's one of the best shooters I've played against my whole 
life. He was just in a zone that night, and when he hit his first few shots, it 
was all over. It didn't matter if I was in his face, or not." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the kind of game that would demoralize most freshmen, but a post-game 
gesture by Smith helped Drakeford recover quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a great player who's headed for the NBA, and he told me don't even worry 
about the game," Drakeford said. "He said, 'I'm a senior, I've been here four 
years, and you're just getting your feet wet. You're a great player, keep your 
head up and you'll go a long way in this league.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little surprised. I thought he was one of those guys who talked trash 
and probably wouldn't congratulate you after a game, but he was real cool. I 
felt kind of good after he told me that." 
</P>
<P>
 It's doubtful Drakeford will become a prolific college scorer like Smith, but 
he does have a decent outside shot. He played off-guard before becoming the 
full-time point guard and shares the team lead in three-point baskets (25) with 
Brent Barry, the son of former NBA great Rick Barry. 
</P>
<P>
 But Drakeford, who averages only five field-goal attempts, wasn't recruited to 
be a scorer. Anderson is getting just what he expected and hoped for from 
Drakeford -- consistent, dependable offensive play and aggressive, nose-to-the- 
grindstone defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson just wasn't expecting it so soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very difficult for a freshman to come in and check guys like Smith, 
Edney and Stoudamire," Anderson said. "Those are tough cookies to handle, but 
he's keeping up with them now. David takes a lot of pride in being the stopper 
on defense. He's had it shot in his face a few times, but he keeps coming 
back."

MIKE PENNER: KINGS NOT DETERRED BY DUCKS' TOUGH TALK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This outrageous squawking by the Mighty Ducks about being "a better team than 
the Kings, five-on-five" was put to the test Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Five-on-five, the Kings beat the Ducks, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Four-on-four, the Kings won again, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Five-on-six, with the Kings playing short-handed, the Kings scored twice and 
the Ducks scored twice, bringing our final totals for the evening to Kings 5, 
Ducks 3. 
</P>
<P>
 That runs the Ducks' record to 0-4 against those inferior five-on-fivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing at even strength, the Ducks have now been outscored in those games, 
10-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Care to change your story while you have the chance, Todd Ewen? 
</P>
<P>
 "No," said Ewen, the right winger who led the Ducks' cocky chorus that had 
scorched the Kings' ears all week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we played a great five-on-five game tonight. We outshot them, we 
had 49 shots on goal, we worked all four corners, we had them scrambling at the 
end. It was great to see. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may not have the scoring punch yet to put these games away, but we have a 
lot of untapped talent on this team . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "If that's everything they have to throw at us, if that's everything they put 
on the table, we don't have to back off from anything we've said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can get better. And when we do, we can win these games." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the Ducks felt they won this one, or at least tied it, given that 
potential goals by Joe Sacco and Shaun Van Allen were disallowed -- with only 
Sacco's receiving a trial by the video judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Allen's attempt to poke the puck past Kelly Hrudey through a scrum in 
front of the net was most controversial because of the timing (4:36 left in the 
third period), the circumstance (Ducks down by a goal, 4-3) and the lack of a 
replay ruling when the play cried out for one. 
</P>
<P>
 Troy Loney, stationed alongside the left goalpost, began the flurry with two 
quick jabs that Hrudey turned away. The puck skittered in between legs through 
the crease toward Van Allen, who pushed it inside the right goalpost, onto the 
goal line and, possibly, beyond the line before a lunging Hrudey could cover 
the puck with his glove. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tie game," Loney declared in the Duck dressing room. "The puck's in the net." 
</P>
<P>
 Upstairs in the press box, one replay angle appeared to indicate the puck had 
crossed the goal line, but officials never called for a replay review, which 
left Duck Coach Ron Wilson as perplexed as he was angry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was a goal," Wilson said, "but even if it's not, it was 
certainly close enough to request a replay. Why have a replay (camera) if 
you're not going to use it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Loney said an official told him no replay was requested "regardless if it was 
a goal or not, because we had a guy in the crease." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, yes, there were several guys in the crease, some of them Ducks, some of 
them Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you have a goal-mouth scramble," Loney said, "there's going to be 
guys in the crease. That's a silly assumption." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the play was whistled dead because referee Richard Trottier lost sight 
of the puck, which irked Loney even more. 
</P>
<P>
 "The puck pops out, I'm three feet in front of the net, I have an open net and 
the whistle blows," Loney fumed. "He says 'I lost sight of it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Loney shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were mistakes made by both officials and players tonight," he said. 
"That's the way it goes sometimes -- the breaks go the other way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Still, after a while, it can get on your nerves." 
</P>
<P>
 Funny, that's what the Kings were saying about the Ducks down the hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Those upstarts with the big mouths down south, after a while, can get on your 
nerves. 
</P>
<P>
 In a hilarious commercial spot plugging ESPN's coverage of Friday's game, King 
defenseman Rob Blake responded to that annoying quacking by holding his hockey 
stick like a rifle, taking aim toward the heavens, pulling an imaginary trigger 
and blowing the pest out of the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 On the ice, Wayne Gretzky accomplished much the same thing while holding his 
stick in the customary position. Two goals, three assists, a hand in every goal 
the Kings produced. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacco, just a young kid, shrugged off the Ducks' bold bulletin-board material 
as "just hype before a big game." But Loney, the wizened Duck captain, frowned 
and said, "I'm sure we helped motivate them with those comments. I've been on 
the other side and when you hear those things, it fires you up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can think it, I can say it to my teammates, but I won't tell you guys (the 
media) too often because it seldom works to your favor. Too often, you help the 
other team." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings don't need that kind of help. Five-on-five, up a man, down a man, 
whatever, they are undefeated against the Ducks. Any other edge they can get is 
simply piling it on.

MIGHTY DUCK NOTEBOOK / ELLIOTT TEAFORD; KINGS' HRUDEY HAS HANDS FULL EVERY 
NIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks fired shot after shot at King goaltender Kelly Hrudey, a.k.a. 
the human backstop, and he hardly flinched Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-nine shots, a Duck record, flew at him and he stopped all but three. If 
it weren't such a nightly occurrence, it might rank as an amazing game for 
Hrudey. 
</P>
<P>
 But 49 shots, even by the expansion Ducks, is pretty much business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more rubber he sees the better he plays," Duck Coach Ron Wilson said 
after the Kings had defeated the Ducks, 5-3, at Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Hill and Bob Corkum each had seven shots on goal. Peter Douris had six 
and Shaun Van Allen five. 
</P>
<P>
 The central question after the game was whether all those shots added up to 
good scoring chances, or simply routine saves. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put a lot of shots on Hrudey, but I don't think they all tested him," Tim 
Sweeney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Troy Loney: "It (49 shots) really doesn't mean anything when we don't win 
the game." 
</P>
<P>
 When it was over, Hrudey seemed unfazed. He's apparently grown accustomed to 
such nightly bombardments. After all, he's faced more shots this season than 
any NHL goaltenders except Edmonton's Bill Ranford and St. Louis' Curtis Joseph 
-- an average of 35 shots per game. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are one of the teams you really have to be prepared to play against," 
Hrudey said. "Playing the Ducks is tough right now. They make the job for 
goalies extremely difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he plays better when he faces more shots, Hrudey shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care how many shots I face," he said. "When I play well I'm 
indifferent. When I don't play well I'm indifferent." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, it's not like he has any control over the sieve-like King defense. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, few teams can match the Kings' offensive firepower and 
Hrudey said he got a huge confidence boost when Jari Kurri scored a 
short-handed goal 57 seconds into the second period. Kurri's goal gave the 
Kings the lead for good at 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks scored once more, but the Kings countered with two goals. Most 
games, that seems to be their best game plan: score more than the other guys 
and leave the rest to Hrudey. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Almost lost in Wayne Gretzky's vintage two-goal, three-assist performance were 
two goals and one assist from Kurri. 
</P>
<P>
 Hrudey noticed, though. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can see why he's probably the greatest two-way player ever to play the 
game," Hrudey said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson blamed the defense for allowing Gretzky and Kurri so much open ice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their three-on-ones and two-on-ones were due to our poor play," Wilson said. 
"They weren't necessarily great plays by them." 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't help the Ducks' cause that they were swept up in the Kings' 
wide-open style. Sometimes, they fared well, but so many other times faster 
King skaters whipped the slower Ducks down the ice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy to get caught up in it," Wilson said. "We learned a lesson and 
we'll profit from it in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sweeney received 12 stitches to close a gash near his mouth. When a camera 
crew asked which side he would rather be filmed from, he said, "Right now, I 
don't have a good side." 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, he said Friday's game was as important as any the Ducks have 
played this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were up for this game," Sweeney said. "But against a team like L.A. you 
can't make mistakes. We were looking at this game as a must-win for us." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Ewen on Gretzky: "He had a great game. He played spectacularly. We had as 
much of a chance to win as anybody, even with Wayne Gretzky making all those 
great plays."

ROLLING THE DICE . . . AGAIN; THE MOUTH THAT ROARED TONES DOWN GROWL FOR FANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID KRONKE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Consider the schizophrenic existence of Andrew Clay Silverstein. By day, he 
performs the requisite spin control with the media, explaining how he honestly 
doesn't advocate the views and attitudes expressed by his comic creation, 
Andrew Dice Clay. By night, as Dice, he becomes his usual revolting, women- and 
immigrant-hating lout. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just had to clean up my kid, and if you just saw me with him, you'd say, 
'This isn't Dice,' " Silverstein said during a phone interview. "Dice wouldn't 
do that, he'd call his 'chick' in, that's what he'd call her, his 'chick' . . . 
Dice is just a great acting job. They say you can't fool all the people? I did, 
to the point that they were all afraid of me. They were calling me a Nazi when 
I'm a Jewish guy from Brooklyn." 
</P>
<P>
 (He spoke from his East Coast home where he lives with his wife and "too many 
kids to afford" -- he declines to discuss details of his personal life.) 
</P>
<P>
 After some time maintaining a low profile and mulling over what to do about 
his prickly persona, the mouth that roared is roaring back. At 36, he recently 
released a new CD, "The Day the Laughter Died, Part II," he's presenting a 
pay-per-view special tonight, "The St. Valentine's Day Massacre," and he's even 
hopped back into bed with Fox, the company that released his film, "The 
Adventures of Ford Fairlane." 
</P>
<P>
 This time it's for a TV series to premiere in the fall ("Bangers," a projected 
sitcom for ABC, never made it beyond a pilot last year). A Fox network 
spokesperson declined to comment on the planned series. 
</P>
<P>
 For Clay, it's a spate of activity to rival the amount of work at his career 
peak at the turn of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Spinning off a character who was initially a small part of his stand-up 
routine, Dice became the man who, along with the late Sam Kinison and, on a 
more modest level at the time, Howard Stern, helped usher in what was called 
"rock 'n' roll comedy" -- jokes that were noisy, white-male-oriented and 
frequently stupid. It was the kind of stuff that had genteel critics fretting 
that the Apocalypse was nigh and First Amendment champions defending its 
practitioners, while cringing at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 After "Ford Fairlane" and some notorious TV appearances that got him banned 
from MTV and "Saturday Night Live," critics and feminist groups cried foul. 
"Politically correct" soon became the country's buzzword and 20th Century Fox 
backed off a three-picture deal, apparently thinking its tarnished image wasn't 
worth the modest box-office projections of his future product. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that character was put in a sitcom, on a network, there never would have 
been any controversy, it would have been like Barbarino (John Travolta's 
"Welcome Back, Kotter" character) in the '70s," he says. "But because I do it 
alone in stand-up, and with the foul language and adult material, I'm looked at 
as this bad guy. I just wanted to show what was out there, to do the ultimate 
(obnoxious person), to show what things go on in the country, what goes on 
beyond closed doors. I'm like Dr. Ruth on acid." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Clay doesn't blame the PC brigade for his waning popularity, 
Silverstein the creator eventually came to realize "I had a certain element in 
the audience that liked that kind of character, and would cheer. I saw the 
influence it had on some men, taking that stuff as gospel, and thought, I've 
gotta get rid of those fans. So I decided . . . to rip men, to take it so 
overboard that you'd have to ask, how can anyone take it so seriously? This is 
a goon, a buffoon you're gonna hear. I did a lot of men-bashing stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the comic, what accounted for his slide in popularity after his 
peak is that he lost those in his audience who were making him -- and his 
critics -- uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I'm not playing arenas anymore," he posits. "I took some grief 
from fans, but those were the fans I didn't want. I feel the difference now in 
crowds -- there are more couples, but there are still groups of guys. But the 
couples, they take it for what it is -- nonsense." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone is convinced that even Dice Lite is palatable for mainstream 
audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was blackballed from Leno and Letterman -- I can't believe things like that 
can still go on," Clay -- or Silverstein, it's still hard to tell sometimes -- 
grouses. The best he could manage was appearing on "Late Night With Conan 
O'Brien" last week -- as the second guest of the show, and only after a lengthy 
internal debate among the program's brain trust. "Those other guys are idiots," 
he says, and you can imagine the shrug through the phone line. 
</P>
<P>
 He credits Fox with taking another chance on him. "They got a lot of guts," he 
says, adding that on the show, "I'll be a Brooklyn guy. Onstage, I'm 
one-dimensional. But in a sitcom you can't do that, there'll be a lot of 
different sides. I'll be vulnerable, I'll have heart, an edge, I've got to have 
it all. The pilot will be about sex versus romance." 
</P>
<P>
 Never one to indulge in understatement, Clay says, "I could give them a 
historic show. If it's done right, they will see a great actor. I've got the 
base audience and once the rest of the country sees me and sees what I'm about, 
sees the whole, rounded person, I think they'll enjoy it. They'll see I've got 
a lot to offer. Things got crazy back then, but I don't mind that they did -- 
in four months' time I went from playing 200 seats to 20,000 seats a night, I 
filled every arena in the (expletive) country more than once." 
</P>
<P>
 And just in case you feared him the first time around, and are wondering when 
his lightning will strike a second time, when you'll need to start stocking up 
on goods for your underground safehouse, he has the answer: Nine months. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be a huge return, with movies and the sitcom," he vows. "I'll be here 
again, and there's nothing I can do to stop it. You'll look back at this story 
in nine months and say, he knew, he actually told me."

Q & A WITH RICK DEES; HE'S TRYING TO DILUTE RADIO'S MEANNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a business where popularity is fickle and disc jockeys on top can quickly 
find themselves on a plane bound for Poughkeepsie, Rick Dees has remained a 
fixture on morning radio here for more than a decade.  
</P>
<P>
 After starting out nearly 20 years ago at small stations in the South, Dees 
gained fame in 1976 when his novelty song "Disco Duck" sold 2 million copies. 
He was hired at KIIS-FM (102.7) in Los Angeles in 1981 and ranked as the 
top-rated morning host from 1983 to 1988. His standing has fluctuated since 
then; at one point last year he dropped to seventh, but in the most recent 
ratings he'd climbed back to No. 2 among English-language stations, trailing 
only nemesis Howard Stern on KLSX-FM (97.1). KIIS reportedly pays him about 
$2.5 million a year.  
</P>
<P>
 His radio fans are drawn to such loony Dees staples as "Spousal Arousal," in 
which a spouse calls his or her partner offering romantic enticements, and 
"Battle of the Sexes," where men and women compete in trivia contests. Dees, 
41, also hosts an internationally syndicated radio program, "Rick Dees' Weekly 
Top 40," and has made forays into television: In 1983-84 he was host of the 
variety show "Solid Gold," and in 1991 he had his own late-night talk show on 
ABC, "Into the Night With Rick Dees."  
</P>
<P>
 Question: You've been in radio close to 20 years and have been the morning 
drive-time personality at KIIS for 13 years. To what do you attribute your 
longevity? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I try to stand for things that are different. People are really 
searching for communication with somebody. They're searching for a 
relationship. And to feel that I'm giving somebody a relationship is exciting 
to me and very rewarding. I don't think you have to be goody-goody, because my 
show is not like that at all. It's very cutting edge. It takes things right up 
to the limit. . . . My dilemma is that people are attracted to evil and 
meanness. So my challenge is to do things that represent making people feel 
better about themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you put much stock in ratings? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Of course I enjoy when the ratings go up, but I can't get too excited when 
they're up because then I would get too depressed when they're down. I don't 
really live and die by the ratings. I know that that sounds crazy, but (the 
ratings make me) feel like I'm always in high school. I'm always taking SATs. 
It's a nightmare. That's the only nightmare part of my job. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Let's stick with that high school analogy, but take it out of the academic 
realm. The contest is on for Big Man on Campus. What do you think of the 
competition on morning radio? 
</P>
<P>
 A: First of all, I do enjoy competition and I think the competition now has 
taken radio to a height of awareness with the public it has never enjoyed 
before. The competition has also gotten to a point where a certain element of 
radio is mean-spirited now. And I feel that one of my challenges is to dilute 
that mean-spirited part of radio. 
</P>
<P>
 I used to listen to the famous names in radio in Los Angeles, like Robert W. 
Morgan, Charlie Tuna, Dick Whittinghill. They always represented being funny 
and cutting edge and doing satire and having a slanted, strange look at life 
and doing things you could repeat in a big group of people and not offend 
anyone. Now you get Howard Stern. He's the bully who pushes everybody around 
and knows that they won't fight back. But now someone is fighting back, and 
it's a joy to watch him squirm. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I heard Stern on the air the other day railing about you. He's called you a 
moron with a fake laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 A: The amount he rails about me on the air is directly proportional to the 
insecurity he has about the fact that I'm really getting under his skin. So I 
wear every time he says my name in a negative way as a badge of honor. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: There are others on morning radio who also like to make you the butt of 
their jokes. I'm speaking specifically of Kevin and Bean, the morning team on 
KROQ. They've said that your style of radio is irrelevant. Does this get to 
you? Is it all part of the game? 
</P>
<P>
 A: These guys I feel sorry for because they must not have much of a show if 
all they want to do is follow me and chronicle what I'm doing every day. What a 
dull life that is. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: There was a recent incident where Kevin and Bean sent someone from their 
show to follow you to work one morning. You were upset and mentioned at the 
time that you were considering legal action. Did you take any? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I tried. I talked to attorneys. But do you know they would have to do that 
to me twice? I've never had it in for them, but they've been very 
mean-spirited. And I think there's a price to pay for it. I don't know what it 
is, but it's not for me to decide. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: That comment and some others you've made have some religious overtones. I 
understand you're a born-again Christian. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, I am, and I'm not ashamed of that at all. But I'm in a secular world 
and there's a tendency for people to think that someone who has a spiritual 
connection, who has a personal relationship with God, is not cool and they 
don't know how to dress right, they don't know how to make people laugh and be 
entertaining. I don't think that's necessarily true. And it is true I do think 
about naked girls sometimes. I lust in my heart even more than Jimmy Carter, so 
I guess I can't be President. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Your success on radio has not translated to your television efforts. Why 
didn't "Into the Night With Rick Dees" work? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I was so excited about that TV show. But I had the misfortune of being 
released to the public on late-night television in the middle of Johnny 
Carson's last year on TV and in the middle of the Gulf War. Our show didn't 
come on half the time until about 1:45 or 2 in the morning. It's very hard when 
Ted Koppel wants to just grab an extra 35 minutes to show people blowing up in 
Saudi Arabia. I'd love to have another opportunity but who knows? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you have any other television projects in the offing?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I do. I'm working on a project with Barry Diller. We're working on a whole 
new approach and a whole new network. He's got QVC but there's going to be a 
young version called Q2. I'd have a show with celebrities and, if I did have 
music, most of it would be raw and a cappella. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are you involved in any ventures outside of broadcasting? 
</P>
<P>
 A: A business partner and I have been experimenting for three years with the 
world's lightest videocassette. You might say, "What would you want with a 
light videocassette?" Well, that videocassette could actually be sent out to 
people in their mailbox for the same amount of money that you send out a 
catalogue. You'd have a videocassette with (for example) BMW's 1995 line. And 
(people would) put it in their VCR. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: If this takes off, do you see yourself leaving radio? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Never. I just love it; it really is a hobby. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: A well-paid hobby. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, thank you. Although John Madden's getting $8 million a year. Time to 
re-negotiate.

FILMFORUM TACKLES THE 'BEAST'; MOVIES: THE ORGANIZATION IS IN THE MIDST OF THE 
MOST AMBITIOUS PIECE OF PROGRAMMING IT'S EVER ATTEMPTED. THE CITYWIDE FESTIVAL 
INCLUDES ABOUT 150 EXPERIMENTAL FILMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KRISTINE McKENNA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The thing you have to remember about experimental film is that its roots are 
in the static visual arts rather than the movies. 
</P>
<P>
 A rigorously conceptual practice that concerns itself with such things as the 
mechanics of perception, the believability of images and the dismantling of 
cinematic cliches, experimental films care not a whit about linear narrative, 
heroes and villains and box-office prowess. They are, in short, diametrically 
opposed to all the Hollywood industry holds dear. 
</P>
<P>
 So, don't show up at "Scratching the Belly of the Beast: Cutting Edge Media in 
Los Angeles, 1922-94," with a bag of popcorn prepared to click off your mind -- 
this history of experimental film in Southern California requires some effort 
by the viewer. 
</P>
<P>
 Given that, it's not surprising that the 19-year-old Filmforum, the L.A. 
showcase for experimental film that organized the event, is for many filmgoers 
a well-kept secret. Founded in 1975 by Terry Cannon, Filmforum relocated in 
1984 from its first home in Pasadena to the downtown Wallenboyd Center, where 
it operated until 1987, when it began presenting films at LACE. Filmforum has 
been without a permanent home since 1992, and for the past year and a half most 
of its programming has been presented at Hollywood Moguls, a cafe on Hudson 
Street in Hollywood with a 99-seat theater. This May, Filmforum reunites with 
LACE when both will resurface in new digs at the Newberry Building on Hollywood 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that Filmforum has thrived as an idea rather than an actual place for 
almost two years, makes it doubly impressive that it is currently in the midst 
of the most ambitious piece of programming it's ever attempted. A seven-week, 
citywide festival presented in conjunction with the Getty Center for the 
History of Art and the Humanities, the Los Angeles Public Library's Central 
Library, the Los Angeles Municipal Gallery, MOCA, the UCLA Film and Television 
Archive, and Beyond Baroque, "Scratching the Belly of the Beast" will include a 
series of roundtable discussions and several special events. The soul of the 
festival, however, is the 150 films that will be screened. 
</P>
<P>
 Organized by Filmforum's director Jon Stout, the festival kicked off last 
Thursday with the premiere of the fourth film by Gregg Araki. From there, the 
series spins out into an elaborately structured affair that includes programs 
conceived by nine guest curators, four evenings celebrating local organizations 
that have kept experimental film alive here for the past 70 years, shows 
devoted to groundbreaking explorations in animation, and seminal video works 
done by visual artists such as William Wegman, Paul McCarthy and Chris Burden. 
</P>
<P>
 In surveying this series, the question arises as to whether there's anything 
distinctly regional about experimental film in L.A. Taking a cursory glance at 
this far-flung array of films, the answer would be no; each filmmaker included 
has developed a singular style unique unto itself. When one digs deeper, 
however, recurring motifs begin to appear. At the top of that list is the fact 
that experimental film in L.A. is obsessed with mainstream movies to a far 
greater degree than the experimental film of New York or the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
 This concern is particularly apparent in Monday's program, curated by film 
scholar David James. Titled "The Distinction of Idioms: Non-Industrial Film in 
Los Angeles," the program includes Robert Florey and Slavko Vorkapich's German 
Expressionist influenced 1928 essay on the perils of Tinseltown, "Life and 
Death of 9413 -- A Hollywood Extra," along with important works by seminal L.A. 
filmmakers Chick Strand and Morgan Fisher that deconstruct the cinematic 
experience. Also included is Maya Deren's "Meshes of the Afternoon" (1943), a 
groundbreaking work that filters Hollywood cliches, specifically those of film 
noir and women's movies of the '40s, through a feminist lens. 
</P>
<P>
 A second recurring regional tick surfaces in Wednesday's program, "Independent 
Animation in the Los Angeles Area," curated by Maureen Furniss. Paralleling a 
venerated tradition in local visual art, animated films hereabouts indicate an 
enduring love for eye candy. Is this to suggest we're just a dumb blond city? 
Not exactly, but the look of things has always counted for a lot in L.A. The 
local penchant for richly optical art can be traced from Stanton 
McDonald-Wright's Synchromist paintings of the '20s and '30s, to the Lyrical 
Abstraction of artists like Sam Francis, to the Finish Fetish school that 
blossomed in L.A. in the '60s, up on through the Light and Space art of the 
'70s. Similarly, there's a tradition here of filmmakers who've made unabashedly 
lush "paintings" on film. 
</P>
<P>
 More often than not, these cinematic paintings are scored to music, and 
included in Wednesday's programs are several visual symphonies by celebrated 
animator Oskar Fishinger, as well as works by brothers John and James Whitney, 
who pioneered the use of computers in films synthesizing abstract design and 
music. "Why do they always have to play with mice?" James Whitney once asked in 
reflecting on the limits of animated films, and the point of the work in this 
program is to transcend that cliche. 
</P>
<P>
 The program on Feb. 21, "Looking Over an Underground" is one of the most 
fascinating bills in the series, including such treasures as artist Wallace 
Berman's "Untitled 1957-65." Since his death in 1977, Berman's influence on the 
art of L.A. has become increasingly apparent, and opportunities to see this, 
the only film he made, are rare. A short collage of Pop imagery, Berman's 
modest film is a remarkably beautiful evocation of the audaciously sexual youth 
culture of the '60s. Also on the program, curated by filmmaker Thom Andersen, 
is "Marcello, I'm So Bored," a hilarious short that director John Milius made 
in 1966 with John Strawbridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Other programs of note include "Radiating Visions: A Tribute to the Creative 
Film Society," curated by Angie Pike and slated for March 5. A film 
distribution service founded in 1957, CFS handled everything from William 
Hale's "The Towers," a short documentary on L.A. folk artist Simon Rodia, to 
Art Clokey's "Gumbasia," an exercise in stop-action animation that served as 
the prototype for his subsequent series "Gumby." Curator Claire Aguilar's 
program of March 28, "Personal Visions: Mapping Territories in Southern 
California," is highlighted by an excerpt from "The Works," a collaborative 
film by L.A. historians Reyner Banham and Mike Davis, and "Bump City," a short 
made by Pat O'Neill in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill is acknowledged as one of the most influential experimental filmmakers 
to emerge from L.A., and his 1988 film "Water and Power" is considered his 
masterpiece. The series wraps up on March 31 with a screening of that film, 
which is a highly abstracted examination of the relationship between nature and 
the industrial civilization of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Screening with "Water and Power" is Charles Burnett's exquisitely realized 
1977 debut feature, "Killer of Sheep." Best known for the critically acclaimed 
"To Sleep With Anger," Burnett paints a haunting portrait of the life of an 
alienated slaughterhouse worker living in South-Central; this beautifully 
scored film is a defining work on late 20th-Century life in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival will throw a party for itself March 30 when it presents "Salome" 
and "The Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome," two films by legendary bad boy of 
the underground Kenneth Anger (Anger's "Puce Moment" and "Kustom Kar Kommandos" 
are included in other programs). The director will be in attendance, as will 
"Inauguration" stars Cameron and Samson DeBrier. 
</P>
<P>
 A disciple of Aleistair Crowley, Anger hammered out a Dionysian approach to 
filmmaking best described as a demented hybrid of Cecil B. DeMille and 
Pasolini. Bringing homosexual themes to the screen with candor and wit long 
before that was considered acceptable, Anger's films combine elements of high 
camp and mythology to explore various American outlaw subcultures. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Anger's films may strike some as just this side of silly, but they were 
nothing short of revolutionary in their day. It's often been the case that 
innovations hammered out by experimental filmmakers have been appropriated by 
the mainstream film industry and transformed into popular cliches. So before 
you dismiss one of these films, check the date when it was made; that may make 
it clear why it's regarded as an important piece of history. 
</P>
<P>
 * Guest-curated programs will be presented at Hollywood Moguls on Monday 
nights. A series of feature films made by local experimental filmmakers will 
screen Tuesdays at the Los Angeles Public Library's Central Library. The Getty 
Center for the History of Art and the Humanities will present a series of 
roundtable discussions Wednesday evenings at Hollywood Moguls. Roundtable 
discussions and screenings at the Central Library are free; admission to other 
events varies. Information: (213) 663-9568.

 Tupac Conviction: Controversial rapper and actor Tupac Amaru Shakur was 
convicted Thursday in a Los Angeles Municipal Court for assault and battery 
stemming from a March attack on film director Allen Hughes. The 22-year-old 
rapper could receive as much as six months in jail when he is sentenced on 
March 10 for the crime. The rapper was found guilty of attacking Hughes with a 
weapon after being fired from Hughes' film "Menace II Society." Shakur, who 
co-starred with Janet Jackson in the movie "Poetic Justice," also faces a trial 
for forcible sodomy of a 20-year-old woman in New York and has been charged 
with two counts of aggravated assault in Atlanta stemming from an October 
disturbance in which he allegedly shot and wounded two off-duty police 
officers. He was also arrested on March 11 in Los Angeles for carrying a 
concealed weapon and again two days later outside the set of Fox-TV's "In 
Living Color" where he allegedly assaulted a limo driver -- who in turn filed a 
civil suit against the rapper. TV & VIDEO

 Sawyer Signal?: Diane Sawyer did not co-host "PrimeTime Live" with Sam 
Donaldson Thursday night. Sawyer has been ill with the flu, but sources at ABC 
News said that her no-show also was a sign that her negotiations with ABC this 
week have not been going well. There was also some speculation at the network 
that, at a time of bidding over her services, Sawyer did not want to be beaten 
by Connie Chung in the ratings. Chung's "Eye to Eye" show, which featured an 
interview with figure skater Tonya Harding, aired opposite "PrimeTime Live" and 
scored what CBS said was its highest rating ever. Others at ABC said that 
Sawyer wanted to send a signal to the network not to take her for granted.

 Host With Most: David Letterman, a fan of auto racing, will present the Auto

broadcast Feb. 28. Letterman joins a lineup that includes host Dennis Miller 
and presenters Joe Pesci, Bill Murray, Bob Costas, Rosie Perez, Sarah Jessica 
Parker and Bill Cosby. . . . And speaking of awards and Letterman, he and 
Barbra Streisand are among the front-runners to host the 1994 Tony Awards on 
CBS in June, according to Gary Smith, executive producer of Broadway's top 
awards, which will air later this year. MOVIES

 'Cowboy' Rides: The American Film Institute kicks off its 1994 Favorite Film

only X-rated film to win the Oscar for best picture. The event will reunite the 
filmmakers and stars, including director John Schlesinger and actors Dustin 
Hoffman, Jon Voight and Brenda Vacarro. United Artists is re-releasing the film 
in theaters Feb. 25. RADIO

 Feeding on Its Own: At KFI-AM (640), which prides itself on being 
controversial, even its own talk-show hosts are fair game. On Thursday night, 
reacting to reports that Rush Limbaugh had been hired to follow in the 
footsteps of Anita Bryant and Burt Reynolds as commercial pitchman for Florida 
orange juice, KFI host Stephanie Miller urged listeners to join her in a 
boycott of the product, calling Limbaugh a "right-wing, homophobic bigot." 
Limbaugh's nationally syndicated radio program airs weekdays on the very same 
KFI.

 'Streets' Smart: Hip-hop station KPWR-FM (105.9) has a hit on its hands with a 
benefit album released last month. "Straight From Da Streets," a compilation of 
16 hit songs, this week became the No. 1-selling record in Los Angeles, 
according to Soundscan tabulations. Proceeds from the album will go toward 
building a Performing Arts/Training Center for Los Angeles youth on city-owned 
property. The station, which is seeking listener donations and corporate 
sponsorship, hopes to raise $2.5 million toward construction. PEOPLE

 Roseanne's Latest: On Monday's "The Oprah Winfrey Show," Roseanne Arnold says 
she has multiple personalities or what she calls "dissociative identity 
disorder." In the first of what will probably be many interviews promoting her 
new book, "My Lives," Arnold says 20 people "share my body.". . . Arnold also 
makes an appearance on Friday's "20/20," which also features what is being 
billed as the first interview with the daughter Arnold gave up at birth 22

 Bank on the Diva: Soprano Jessye Norman helped foil a bank break-in in Boston 
and has a security guard's badge for her trouble. Norman and her chauffeur were 
entering Symphony Hall earlier this week when someone broke a window of a bank 
across the street. The diva rushed inside the hall and asked a guard to call 
police. A man was charged with breaking and entering, but police said he may 
have been looking for a warm place to sleep. The bank's president made Norman 
an honorary security guard and is making a $1,000 donation to Boston Symphony 
Orchestra's Youth Concerts in her name. DAVID J. FOX

THEATER REVIEW; ACTORS AREN'T UP TO TASK IN 'THERESE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN BRESLAUER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thomas Job's "Therese," an adaptation of the Emile Zola's novel "Therese 
Raquin" set in 1875 New Orleans, has lots of roles -- which probably explains 
why the Hollywood Thespian Company decided to stage it. Unfortunately, the 
acting on view at Theater 1761 is so consistently wretched that the plodding 
drama serves as anything but a showcase. 
</P>
<P>
 A melodramatic rehash of the Naturalist saga about a woman who takes an 
artist-lover who helps murder her husband, "Therese" would be tough going even 
for expert actors. But these performers, under Rai Tasco's static direction, 
show no trace of inner life. What's more, they don't so much act as declaim, 
saying their lines at rather than to one another -- and flubbing every other 
one at that. 
</P>
<P>
 Poor Therese may have had it tough, but never this bad. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Therese," Theater 1761, 1761 N. Vermont Ave., Hollywood. Fridays-Saturdays, 
8 p.m. Ends Feb. 26. $12. (213) 298-0961. Running time: 2 hours, 30 minutes.

IN PAY-PER-VIEW, STERN AND CLAY RUB EACH OTHER'S BACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Andrew Dice Clay's last pay-per-view special, "No Apologies . . .," was in 
July, 1993. About 100,000 homes bought the event. That's a decent, although 
certainly not extraordinary, buy rate of 0.5% for entertainment 
programming.(Howard Stern's New Year's Eve special broke all entertainment 
pay-per-view records with a 2% buy rate, or 400,000 buys.) About 20 million 
homes are capable of ordering pay-per-view programming. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell McLaren, general manager of Semaphore Entertainment Group, the 
company behind both events, says Clay's upcoming concert is on track to do at 
least as well, probably better. (Exact numbers of how many homes buy a 
pay-per-view event are usually not known for a week or so until after the 
event.) 
</P>
<P>
 McLaren says Stern's success will rub off on Clay: "Absolutely. Howard Stern 
should get a medal from the pay-per-view industry. Because he went on national 
radio every day for four months and told people over and over how to order 
pay-per-view. He really educated the public about pay-per-view -- although 
Andrew's first pay-per-view concert educated Howard what pay-per-view could 
do." DANIEL CERONE

 Creatively, the Saturday-morning CBS cartoon "Cadillacs and Dinosaurs" is a 
curious mix of action, merchandising and political correctness. 
</P>
<P>
 "The machinery of life is a balance," intones the hero of the futuristic tale, 
an ecologist-adventurer named Jack Tenrec. "We have to maintain it." 
</P>
<P>
 Such dollops of environmentalism are hardly the overwhelming content of the 
children's show -- they are dropped in here and there amid the adventure and 
commercialism that over the years have become trademarks of Saturday-morning 
cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
 But Southern California viewers have not been able to get much of a look at 
the show because of preemptions, which will continue with CBS' coverage of the 
Winter Olympics next week. "It's preempted a lot," acknowledges a network 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cadillacs and Dinosaurs" is, however, scheduled to make one of its rare 
appearances here at 10:30 a.m. today (Channels 2 and 8). And if the 
environmentalism doesn't exactly match the slam-bang action, the series 
nonetheless is yet another pertinent example of how the much-criticized use of 
kids' programs as 30-minute commercials to sell related products is being 
upgraded for the interactive computer age and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 The co-executive producers of the half-hour "Cadillacs and Dinosaurs" include 
Steven de Souza, screenwriter of such movies as "Die Hard" and "48 HRS.," and 
Sasha Harari, who produced the film "The Doors." 
</P>
<P>
 Their Saturday children's program -- now in its first season, with renewal up 
in the air -- has made a deal granting licenses for the show to the new Palo 
Alto, Calif.-based firm Rocket Science Games Inc. for such technology as Sega 
CD, Sony CD and CD-ROM, disks that combine audio, video and text. 
</P>
<P>
 "Understanding that games are serious business is the new revolution in 
Hollywood," says Mike Backes, a co-founder of Rocket Science whose credits 
include display graphics for "Jurassic Park" and writing for the film "Rising 
Sun." 
</P>
<P>
 "Key players are beginning to see that when kids spend more money on Nintendo 
and Sega games than they do for movie tickets, the future in entertainment may 
be in game software," Backes adds. 
</P>
<P>
 So are we solely into a mind-bending, unfolding maze of technology, or is the 
play still the thing? For Harari, there is no doubt: The key to "Cadillacs and 
Dinosaurs" -- whether it is picked up or remains in television syndication -- 
has been the creator, Mark Schultz, the noted comic book artist on whose work 
the series is based. 
</P>
<P>
 If "Cadillacs and Dinosaurs" has the requisite good guys, bad guys, chase 
scenes and the like, nonetheless, an analysis of the CBS Saturday morning 
schedule by Esther Sinclair, UCLA associate professor of psychiatry and 
bio-behavioral sciences, had some favorable words for the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jack is altruistic, does not have aggressive impulses, resists temptation and 
is sympathetic toward others," she wrote, also noting the attitude toward 
protecting animals: "The viewer may draw an analogy to other endangered species 
such as eagles and condors. . . . There is an emphasis on the interconnection 
of all living things. Jack respects all life forms." 
</P>
<P>
 In the series, as CBS describes it, Jack and scientist Hannah Dundee, in the 
26th Century, cruise the landscape "in their classic Cadillac, searching for 
the remnants of ancient technology that can tame their savage world. Pitted 
against them are dinosaurs (as well as) tyrants and warlords, poachers and 
mutants." 
</P>
<P>
 With TV violence and commercialism of kids' shows deservedly being targeted, 
Harari maintains that the mayhem of the comic book version was toned down: "We 
absolutely adjusted it. We did reduce this. We tried to have Jack reacting to 
choices." 
</P>
<P>
 But he concedes that "these kinds of shows are primarily oriented to boys. 
Kids need to see some forward-moving adventure, and I think we did it quite 
well. And through this we try to weave messages and introduce the goals of 
proper social behavior and the environment and ecology. If it gets preachy, you 
lose most of the audience." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he says, CBS programming standards also brought pressure to bear. 
He adds, however, that the network "did not support the show" the way ABC and 
Fox promote their children's programs and that CBS "management is primarily 
oriented toward prime time." 
</P>
<P>
 Although promotion is important to building overall merchandising impact, the 
challenges are probably more diverse in the growing world of video games and 
interactive TV. For the game versions of "Cadillacs and Dinosaurs," alternative 
scenes and endings and other viewer involvements will build on Schultz's work 
-- as with the original output of other creators. 
</P>
<P>
 Harari, discussing "Cadillacs and Dinosaurs," told Forbes magazine last year: 
"Our only care is to create a digital database of content because down at the 
bottom of everything, digital content is oblivious to its means of 
transportation . . . to the consumer. It doesn't care if it plays on a 
videotape recorder, a video game, a compact disc or a compact disc interactive. 
Content doesn't care if it is networked through cable, microwave or satellite." 
</P>
<P>
 The former owner of a computer business, Harari does not argue the point that 
children's shows like his are in large part commercials to enhance 
merchandising in other forms: "Unfortunately, it's true. The stakes are very 
high." He notes that even the high-minded "Sesame Street" is "a major, major 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
 He adds: "What's happening in the new digital world is that we're witnessing 
the birth of a more complex and non-linear storytelling. You can take a world 
created through comic books or other entertainment properties and, through 
computers, have the ability to fast-access any angle of this world, which 
doesn't have to be sequential or linear. That's the way it's been until now, 
reading a book from page one. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the death of linear storytelling, but forming a new form of 
storytelling." 
</P>
<P>
 Fine. But I want to read "The Great Gatsby" in a book, starting on page one.

'THE DIAMOND EXPOSE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There were too many mistakes in "Frontline's" "Diamond Empire" to correct them 
all. But readers of Robert Koehler's review should be aware of at least some of 
the facts ("The Diamond Expose as Big as the Ritz," Feb. 1).This program was 
based on biased research and questionable sources, even treating convicted 
felons as trustworthy authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The program makes the nonsensical suggestion that "diamonds are found wherever 
one finds carbon." A moment's thought would suggest that mining companies of 
the stature of BHP, RTZ and De Beers would hardly be spending substantial sums 
of money prospecting for diamonds if it were true that they are plentiful and 
easy to find. 
</P>
<P>
 The program also suggested that supplies are kept short. In fact, diamond 
production has grown significantly in the 1980s, with two major new mines being 
brought on stream by De Beers in Botswana and South Africa, and the Argyle mine 
coming into production in Australia. Demand for diamonds has grown in tandem. 
The De Beers' Central Selling Organisation announced record sales in 1993.

AFTER THE QUAKE, PEOPLE NEEDED NEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have a complaint! I could write a dozen terrific letters and you wouldn't 
print even one of them (I know, I've tried) -- but the letter from Shelley D. 
James of Irvine, that you print!? ("TV's Coverage on the Day the Earth Shook," 
Saturday Letters, Feb. 5.)  
</P>
<P>
 So, Shelley, you thought the continuous TV coverage after the earthquake was 
"ridiculous" and a "tragedy" past the first three hours? Well, excuse all of us 
up here in quake-ravaged L.A. County, but many, like me, had no power (i.e., 
TV) in the first three hours after the quake! 
</P>
<P>
 When the power came on, the first thing I did was turn on the TV. Like anyone 
else, I wanted to know all that had occurred; wanted to see it. I wanted news 
of my many friends who reside in the Valley. Most important, I could watch the 
newsroom's seismo-cam and have some warning or confirmation of an aftershock. 
</P>
<P>
 So, Shelley, you have to understand what a mess things were (are) up here. My 
apartment looked like a bomb hit it! You didn't get the damage we did. If you 
had, you could never have written a letter like that. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Reference the letter from John J. Pernin of Pacific Palisades: No, John, you 
are not the only one upset by KABC-TV's irresponsible remark about our drinking 
water on that Jan. 21 news promo. I was livid. I could have handled a promo for 
any "news" story, but don't jeopardize my health. If my water is not fit to 
drink, I need to know now, not at 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 I immediately called KABC, and the operator connected me with the newsroom. 
Nobody answered. I immediately called back and asked for the newsroom. She put 
the call through but nobody answered. I called again and told her. She put me 
through but apparently stayed on the line. When the newsroom did not answer, 
the operator said, "They must be on a coffee break." I said, "You are kidding 
me, right?" She said, "No." I hung up. 
</P>
<P>
 I have cooled down since then and maybe I only care enough to write this 
letter. It is unfortunate that a Los Angeles TV station cannot have a real news 
format similar to the format used by CNN.

 My name is Joshua Manly, and I'm 8. I think "The Air Up There" is fun for the 
whole family! The best part was when Saleh said he would go to St. Joe's, win 
or lose.The coach was funny. And it had a good lesson for kids. It's not 
whether you win or lose, it's how you play the game. Please take kids with you 
to see the movies.

 Many thanks to Ray Loynd for calling our attention to Hallmark Hall of Fame's 
peerless production of Anne Tyler's "Breathing Lessons" ("Garner, Woodward in 
Sweet 'Lessons,' " Feb. 5). We heartily agree that screenwriter Robert W. 
Lenski and director John Erman deserve kudos for being able to faithfully adapt 
this Pulitzer-winning novel to the special demands of commercial TV. How 
refreshing to view a warm, humorous, human drama devoid of violence, 
sensationalism and sexploitation!

 Champlin should take another look. The father never appears. He is overseas

RELATING TO RUSH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding Dennis Hunt's review of the band Rush at the Forum ("Does Rush Still 
Have It? Yes, No," Feb. 5): Rush's live performances differ from those of the 
artists that Hunt maintains "rock harder" simply because their material is much 
more complex and must be performed with precision, a manner that could be 
interpreted as "businesslike" by someone who is not a fan of or doesn't 
understand complex music. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Rush's concert lacked spontaneity.So does a Mozart recital. Art must be 
confronted on its own terms in order to be understood and appreciated. For Hunt 
to complain that Rush's music doesn't rock as hard as the Stones' is as if a 
literary critic were to complain that James Joyce's writing is not as direct as 
Ernest Hemingway's. While pointing out this difference would be of some value 
to readers, for a critic to then dismiss Joyce's writings as being inadequate 
because of it would be idiotic.

SCHIZOPHRENIA

 Ray Loynd's Jan. 15 review ("Diana Ross in 'Darkness' Spotlight") of the ABC 
television drama "Out of Darkness," which he described as ". . . Ross' 
shattering portrait of a woman's battle with paranoia/schizophrenia," contains 
one very disturbing sentence: 
</P>
<P>
 "We never sense the real source of Paulie's (Ross) illness, except once when 
she self-mockingly describes herself as 'my father's son,' a curdling line."

 As diabetes is a disease of the pancreas, schizophrenia is a disease of the

5 HELD IN 1,500-POUND COCAINE-SMUGGLING CASE; DRUGS: FOUR CANADIANS AND A 
COLOMBIAN ARE ARRESTED AFTER AGENTS FOLLOW TWO MOTOR HOMES FROM ANAHEIM TO 
CORONA AND DESERT TOWNS.

 Five people suspected of being members of a drug ring that moved as much as $1 
billion in cocaine last year through Orange County to New York and Canada were 
arrested this week after a tip from Canadian law officials, authorities said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Agents of the Drug Enforcement Agency reportedly seized a record 1,507 pounds 
of high-grade Colombian cocaine from four Canadians who allegedly posed as 
Disneyland tourists to enter the United States, travel to Orange County, then 
pick up shipments from a Colombian cartel employee at a hotel in Corona. The 
cocaine had an estimated street value of $65 million. 
</P>
<P>
 John Zienter, DEA special agent in charge, said a Quebec-based Colombian drug 
cartel has been using an intricate transportation corridor over the past year 
to move about 10 tons of cocaine from Colombia to New York and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ultimate success of this investigation was based on the exchange of 
information across borders and resulted in disrupting a new smuggling and 
transportation corridor," Zienter said. 
</P>
<P>
 All four Canadians, as well as Colombian national Miguel Angel Cortes, were 
charged with possession and distribution of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 DEA spokesman Ralph B. Lochridge said the corridor began sometime around 
January, 1993, when Cortes, 43, then living in Costa Mesa, began receiving 
monthly shipments of cocaine from Colombia via Mexican couriers. Most of the 
shipments would be turned over to Cortes at unknown locations in Orange County, 
Lochridge said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cortes then would meet the Canadian couriers throughout Los Angeles, Orange 
and Riverside counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Relying on a tip from the Quebec Providential Police and the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police, authorities said they followed two of the suspected couriers 
from their hotel near Disneyland to a motel in Corona. There, Lochridge said, 
the suspects met Cortes who loaded their motor homes with cocaine. The vehicle 
then was followed by authorities to Baker, where agents seized 825 pounds of 
cocaine in cardboard boxes and arrested Alain Famelart, 35, of St. Hubert, 
Quebec, and Marie Paulette Viau, 33, of Lemoyme, Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining 682 pounds were allegedly seized the next day from the second 
motor home that had traveled from a hotel in Anaheim to meet Cortes at the 
Corona motel and then proceeded to Ludlow. Pierre Mailloux, 50, of St. Denis 
Sur Richelieu, Quebec, and Jean Joseph Emery, 41, of Montreal were then 
arrested in Ludlow. 
</P>
<P>
 Lochridge said that although the four may have made "numerous" pickup trips 
throughout the year, other couriers were also used. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they were stopped, the agents asked them what their favorite ride at 
Disneyland was," said Lochridge. "They all broke out in a cold sweat and said 
they just passed by the park." 
</P>
<P>
 Also in connection with the case, Canadian authorities conducted 21 raids in 
Montreal and made 12 arrests, charging suspects with conspiracy to import 
cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 "These types of cooperative efforts are essential in these international 
cases," said DEA agent Zienter. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted of the charges, all five arrested by the DEA face mandatory 
10-year prison terms.

END DECLARED TO DISASTROUS FIRE SEASON; ENVIRONMENT: AFTER ONE OF THE LONGEST 
AND WORST SUCH PERIODS IN THE COUNTY, OFFICIALS SAY RURAL AREAS HAVE RECEIVED 
ENOUGH RAIN TO REDUCE DANGER. ABOUT 165,000 ACRES ARE REOPENED TO PUBLIC. 
</P>

<P>
 One of the longest and most disastrous fire seasons in Orange County history 
came to a close Friday, fire officials announced. 
</P>
<P>
 About 165,000 acres that were closed to the public since last May 10, when the 
fire season started, were reopened at midnight Friday with the end of the fire 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, after one of the longest fire seasons on record, the county has 
received enough rainfall to reduce the danger of grass and brush fires in the 
hazardous areas, Orange County Fire Department spokeswoman Kathleen Cha said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many rural areas, however, may still be subject to trespassing laws and 
property owner restrictions, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Many are relieved to see the end of this fire season, which will go down as 
one of the worst in the county, although no lives were lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very tragic time," Cha said. 
</P>
<P>
 Major devastation came late in the season in October as three arson-set 
blazes, fueled by gusty Santa Ana winds, ravaged parts of Laguna Beach and 
unincorporated areas near Anaheim Hills and off Ortega Highway. Heavy rains 
last winter left much growth to be consumed. 
</P>
<P>
 No community was hit harder by fire than Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 It was on Oct. 27 about 11:45 a.m. when the fire started in brush about 100 
feet west of Laguna Canyon Road, a mile south of the San Diego Freeway. Pushed 
by Santa Ana winds, the fire roared over more than 16,680 acres and damaged or 
destroyed more than 400 homes in Laguna Beach, Canyon Acres, Emerald Bay and 
the El Moro Beach Mobile Home Park. There were no injuries, but damage was 
estimated at more than $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it did not destroy as much property as the one in Laguna Beach, the 
Ortega Highway fire was the county's largest and longest of the season. It also 
started Oct. 27 and lasted more than four days, burning an estimated 22,000 
acres and destroying 36 houses along the rural eastern edge of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 A North County fire that started in Anaheim Hills and spread to the 
unincorporated Crest de Ville community late Oct. 26 destroyed two homes and 
damaged 29 more. 
</P>
<P>
 While the fire season has ended, officials said fire safety precautions should 
still be practiced year-round and warned that hot, dry Santa Ana winds could 
create extreme fire conditions at any time. 
</P>
<P>
 The areas that have been reopened include the following: 
</P>
<P>
 * Area 1 -- north of Brea to the county line; between the Brea city limits and 
the Yorba Linda wildlife-urban area, including Chino Hills State Park; and east 
of the Yorba Linda wildlife-urban area to the county line. 
</P>
<P>
 * Area 2 -- south from the Riverside Freeway to O'Neill Regional Park; west 
from the Cleveland National Forest boundary to the following limits: Anaheim 
Hills city limits, Tustin city limits, Irvine city limits, Irvine Boulevard and 
Trabuco Road in Lake Forest; east of Rose Canyon to the Cleveland National 
Forest boundary; east of Dove Canyon to the Cleveland National Forest; east of 
Coto de Caza to the Cleveland National Forest; urban-wildlife areas between 
Rancho Santa Margarita, Coto de Caza and Dove Canyon and from the southern tip 
of Coto de Caza south to the county line. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, west from the Cleveland National Forest boundary to the following 
limits: Mission Viejo city limits, San Juan Capistrano city limits and San 
Clemente city limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald W. Caspers Regional Park is open, including the area between the Ortega 
Highway and Lucas Canyon Road; also included are the following areas inside 
Cleveland National Forest: Silverado Canyon, Williams Canyon, Modjeska Canyon 
and Trabuco Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 * Area 3 -- south of Bonita Canyon Drive, Sand Canyon Avenue and the San Diego 
Freeway to Coast Highway; west of Laguna Canyon Road to the Newport Beach city 
limits.

EMBEZZLER OF NEWPORT FUNDS LIVING IN ORANGE HALFWAY HOUSE; CORRECTIONS: ROBERT 
J. DIXON, WHO STOLE $1.8 MILLION AS CITY'S UTILITIES DIRECTOR, WAS RELEASED 
FROM PRISON LAST MONTH. 
</P>

<P>
 Former Newport Beach Utilities Director Robert J. Dixon, who admitted stealing 
$1.8 million from city coffers over a 10-year period, has been living quietly 
in a halfway house here since his release from prison last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon, 49, served 18 months of a four-year sentence at the Richard J. Donovan 
Correctional Facility in San Diego and is eligible for parole next month, 
officials of the state Department of Corrections said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 His austere lifestyle at the halfway house, which looks like a converted 
motel, contrasts sharply with the material affluence he once enjoyed at city 
expense. He shares the facility located in a rundown area of town with 50 other 
people, including inmates and staff. Most of them are unaware of Dixon's 
high-profile crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just goes about his business," said a staff member. "He's quiet, keeps to 
himself and looks for work." 
</P>
<P>
 Another halfway house employee said Dixon spends some of his time doing 
volunteer work and has received "a lot of job offers." The volunteer work earns 
him free time away from the facility, where inmates are required to return at a 
certain time each day. 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon declined to comment on his present situation Friday, saying only, "It 
would be inappropriate for me to make any kinds of comments while I am still 
under the supervision of the California Department Corrections." 
</P>
<P>
 His early release from prison came as a surprise to Newport Beach city 
officials, many of whom are still angry over his elaborate check-writing scam 
that went undetected for years as he rose through the ranks at Newport Beach 
City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's odd that a white-collar criminal would be released after such a short 
period of time," said  
</P>
<P>
 During the years he worked for the city, Dixon submitted paperwork to the 
city's Finance Department for fictitious services or transactions. He collected 
the checks, forged signatures and deposited the money into his personal 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 His scheme unraveled when a credit card company investigator told Newport 
Beach police that many city checks were turning up in Dixon's account. When 
police confronted Dixon, he confessed. 
</P>
<P>
 With the stolen money, Dixon traveled regularly to New York on shopping sprees 
and built an extensive art collection valued at more than $200,000. The former 
utilities manager also bought time-share property in Jamaica and a wardrobe 
that included $125,000 worth of cuff links, 200 sweaters, 60 pairs of shoes, 
200 shirts and 60 suits. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was always well-dressed and I even used to kid him about it," said 
Assistant City Manager Ken Delino. "But no one realized he was wearing $3,000 
suits." 
</P>
<P>
 The city managed to recoup about $700,000 of the embezzled money by selling 
Dixon's art and expensive possessions. But, Delino said, the city had to spend 
more than $300,000 of the recovered amount on legal fees and other related 
expenses such as auction fees and storage. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the city has put the scandal behind it, city leaders say they are 
still bitter about the once-trusted employee. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a major theft," said Councilwoman Evelyn R. Hart. "It's very hard 
for me to forgive him. I don't know that I can." Added Turner, "The people who 
worked with him feel betrayed and I think they always will."

MAN PROGRAMMING PHONE CALLS 911, SO POLICE COME TO CALL; 3 ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CORE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man programming his phone to speed-dial 911 was arrested when sheriff's 
deputies responded to his call -- and found the man and two friends on drugs, 
authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Lt. Dan Martini said it happened about 5 p.m. Thursday, when someone 
calling 911 quickly hung up. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we get one of those we go ahead and investigate," Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Return calls to the number by sheriff's personnel failed to get an answer, so 
deputies went to the address in the 29000 block of Niguel Road shown on their 
computer. When they arrived, resident Mark Jason Sanger let them in. 
</P>
<P>
 What deputies found, Martini said, was that Sanger and two others appeared to 
have and to be under the influence of crystal methamphetamine, or "speed." 
Deputies said they also found drug paraphernalia in the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Sanger, 33, deputies arrested David Michael Mather, 27, of Laguna 
Niguel and Linda Christina Lyons, 22, of Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Martini said that when deputies told Sanger why they were there, he said he 
had been trying to program his portable phone so he could dial faster in an 
emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was my fault," Martini quoted Sanger. "I was dialing it, trying to punch 
it into my phone."

WORKERS' COMP UNIT GETS STARTED ON 1ST PROSECUTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A district attorney's unit launched last January to investigate suspicious 
workers' compensation claims went an entire year without prosecuting anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 But this year has started off differently. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last two weeks alone, the workers' compensation fraud prosecution unit 
has filed charges in two cases and at least four more are in the works, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 27, three counts of workers' compensation fraud and one count of theft 
were filed against Alan Griffis, a sales manager at a Camarillo computer firm. 
</P>
<P>
 And this week, prosecutors charged an Oxnard truck driver, Ronald Lopez, with 
two counts of workers' compensation fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say such fraud is one of the biggest problems facing businesses in 
Ventura County and across the state. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past year, the new unit has reviewed 63 reports of suspicious workers' 
compensation claims, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Rhonda Schmidt, who has been 
assigned to prosecute such cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cases just got to the point where they were provable," she said. "It's 
gone full cycle and we're starting to get what we need (to prosecute) now." 
</P>
<P>
 But authorities said charges against physicians and attorneys suspected of 
doctoring medical reports to help workers cheat the system may still be a long 
way off. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason is that cases against health care providers and lawyers involved in 
workers' compensation cases are harder to prove and require more complex 
investigations, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 With workers, authorities said, investigators only need to catch them in one 
lie. But with doctors and lawyers, prosecutors generally have to prove a 
pattern of abuse, Schmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she said she expects some Ventura County doctors and lawyers to be 
charged soon with workers' compensation fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got those kinds of cases under investigation and, if the investigations 
go as I anticipate, charges will be filed," said Assistant Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Colleen Toy White. 
</P>
<P>
 But the attorney representing Griffis, the first defendant charged by the 
D.A.'s unit, wonders why no doctors or lawyers have yet been charged. 
</P>
<P>
 "They set out to find what was trumpeted as the workers' comp mills, where 
those dastardly lawyers were running around and getting people to claim they 
were injured and take them to Dr. Feelbad," said David P. Callahan. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors agreed that it would send a stronger message if so-called 
providers were charged in these crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 But they said that does not lessen the culpability of individual workers 
accused of bilking the system. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffis is director of sales and marketing at BGL Technology Inc., a family 
owned computer business. 
</P>
<P>
 Last March, he injured a shoulder carrying a filing cabinet down some stairs, 
according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
 A short time later, the state workers' compensation fund received a doctor's 
report declaring Griffis temporarily disabled. Based on that report, Griffis 
was issued a weekly benefit check for $384 beginning March 26, court records 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffis visited the doctor regularly until July 29, when the doctor suggested 
he undergo surgery to correct whatever problem he was having with his shoulder, 
the records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffis stopped seeing the doctor after that surgery recommendation, which 
prompted a state investigation of his claim. 
</P>
<P>
 Undercover surveillance by state investigators revealed that he was going to 
work every day and sometime even rode a motorcycle there, court records said. 
</P>
<P>
 After viewing a videotape of Griffis' daily activities, the doctor told 
investigators that Griffis had lied about his condition because he could not 
possibly wear a heavy motorcycle helmet and turn his head from side to side if 
he was suffering neck and shoulder pain, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Callahan said he will prove in court that his client simply 
misunderstood the rules of the workers' compensation system. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a guy who suffered an injury where the doctors are telling him to 
have surgery," Callahan said. "I think the doctors were right in the first 
place. I certainly think he never intended to defraud anybody, and that's what 
they have to show." 
</P>
<P>
 In the case against Lopez, prosecutors said the truck driver for an Oxnard 
welding supply company injured his right leg in 1992. A year later, he lied 
about having also injured his left leg in the same incident and received 
benefits for it, said prosecutor Schmidt. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, who pleaded not guilty during an arraignment Wednesday, could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors, who say that workers' compensation claims have dropped 40% 
locally since the unit was launched, said the recent filing of criminal charges 
should have even more of a deterrent effect on those who might be tempted to 
cheat the system. 
</P>
<P>
 And they warn that they will step up the number of prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see the prosecution as just another part of that strong stance against 
workers' comp fraud," White said. "And we have just begun. . . ."

WOULD-BE JUDGES DECIDE NOT TO TOY WITH WHITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Terence Kilbride and a handful of other local prosecutors were all set to vie 
for a seat that opened on the Superior Court bench this week. 
</P>
<P>
 But they quickly abandoned those plans Friday when they found out that 
Assistant Dist. Atty. Colleen Toy White would provide the competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd have to be an absolute lunatic to run against Toy White," said Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Matthew J. Hardy, a Democrat. " . . . You'd have a better shot at 
running against Mother Teresa in this county than Toy White." 
</P>
<P>
 White, a longtime advocate of victims' rights and Dist. Atty. Michael D. 
Bradbury's right-hand prosecutor, appears to have scared away all other comers 
for the seat being vacated by Judge Edwin M. Osborne. 
</P>
<P>
 Osborne, a county judge since 1973, announced earlier this week that he will 
not seek a sixth term on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement raised the hopes of Kilbride and several other local 
attorneys who had aspirations of replacing Osborne. 
</P>
<P>
 Kilbride, a longtime deputy district attorney and a former Ventura school 
board member, had gone so far as visiting his bank to withdraw the $993 fee he 
would need to file as a candidate for the post. By Friday, he was headed back 
to the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going to file," Kilbride said. "But now that I know Toy is in the race, 
I feel that the Superior Court seat will be in hands that are capable." 
</P>
<P>
 Hardy said many lawyers in the district attorney's office were surprised to 
learn of White's intentions to run for judge. Many believed she was more 
interested in succeeding Bradbury whenever he steps down as the county's top 
prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
 White, however, said Friday that her mind is made up: She wants to sit on the 
Superior Court bench. 
</P>
<P>
 After 17 years as a prosecutor, the Camarillo resident said, it is time to 
change gears. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see it as a natural progression," she said. "There are certain things you 
can accomplish as a district attorney. But as a judge, your ability to do those 
things is expanded." 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury was one of the first to announce his support for White, who has been 
his chief assistant for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 "She'll bring tremendous knowledge and strength to the court," Bradbury said. 
"She is a person who is committed to maintaining a safe community and seeing 
that justice is available for everybody. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's bright, hard-working and you couldn't find a more qualified person," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury doubts that White will face any serious challengers. 
</P>
<P>
 According to prosecutors, Deputy Dist. Atty. Gary K. Barrett paid the filing 
fee before learning that White would seek the post. Barrett could not be reach 
for comment, but some of his colleagues who did not want to be identified said 
he also changed his mind once White announced her candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Osborne, who has served five terms, said he plans to leave the bench within 
two months. Officials in Gov. Pete Wilson's office said the governor does not 
plan to appoint anyone to Osborne's seat before the June primary election. 
</P>
<P>
 If White is unopposed or receives more than half of the vote, she would be 
eligible for appointment to the seat. 
</P>
<P>
 White's ascent to assistant district attorney from a poor, rural Oklahoma 
upbringing has earned her universal praise. 
</P>
<P>
 She was married at the age of 16, had her first child as a high school senior 
and moved to Ventura County to raise a family six years later. 
</P>
<P>
 She enrolled in Ventura College of Law after concluding that a lawyer 
representing her sister in a divorce action was inept. In her third year of law 
school, White and her husband themselves were divorced, although they remain 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 In seven years, White rose from law clerk to her current job. As a Superior 
Court judge, she would earn $99,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's not like a lot of lawyers who grew up with a silver spoon in their 
mouth. . .," Hardy said. "She's somebody who knows what a real victim looks 
like, how to support a victim, and has a ton of passion for victims." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, White was busy taking telephone calls from people who had heard 
about her announcement and wanted to get involved in her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to see Ventura County as a safe, good place for people to live," she 
said between phone calls. "I've been here since 1968, and that's what my 
commitment is."

CITY TO STUDY FUTURE OF RURAL SKYLINE AREA; THOUSAND OAKS: COUNCIL WILL EXAMINE 
A REPORT ON PRESERVING UNIQUE, HILLY FEATURES OF 144-ACRE SITE SOUTH OF THE 
VENTURA FREEWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Along narrow, winding Skyline Drive, the mailboxes tell the story. 
</P>
<P>
 This hilly pocket on the southern fringe of Thousand Oaks shuns the 
homogeneous red-tile look of the city's newer developments. Some parcels 
contain junkyards, others bungalows, others two-story stucco residences. 
</P>
<P>
 One mailbox, painted pert green, takes the shape of a John Deere tractor. 
Another resembles a tie-dyed shirt, with pink and aqua swirls and a prominent 
peace symbol. A third mimics a birdhouse, complete with wooden shingles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to believe that some of these little spots are so close to the 
center of a city of 110,000," Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski said. "It's a very 
special place, very secluded." 
</P>
<P>
 To preserve the unique features of the so-called Skyline Area -- 144 acres 
south of the Ventura Freeway, east of Conejo Ridge Avenue and west of Foothill 
Drive -- the Thousand Oaks City Council two years ago launched an extensive 
planning study. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will discuss the resulting 140-page report on Tuesday and will 
attempt to draft a plan for the Skyline Area's future. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a mix of older and newer, a mix of untouched land and land that has been 
altered," Zukowski said. "It's been one of the most challenging issues for the 
city to deal with." 
</P>
<P>
 Carved up by land speculators in the 1920s, the Skyline Area contains 253 
parcels. The property lines bear no relation to the region's topography -- some 
lots lack access to roads, others slant across steep slopes, others are 
amazingly narrow. 
</P>
<P>
 To prevent a landowner from building a substandard residence on each tiny lot, 
the council on Tuesday will consider merging adjacent parcels. If a single 
owner held title to half a dozen contiguous lots of 5,000 square feet each, for 
instance, the city might combine them into one large parcel and permit a single 
house there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any development in that area would have tremendous visibility, and with the 
Fire Department's requirement for 100-foot brush clearance around each house, 
(building on) a lot of small parcels would scar the hillside," Councilwoman 
Judy Lazar said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not trying to remove the possibility for owners to use the property," 
Lazar added, "but we want to ensure that future (development) will be within 
city standards." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the Skyline Area's physical constraints, however, some property 
owners doubt whether large-scale development could ever take place. Many of the 
parcels are on hillsides so steep that Thousand Oaks city codes would prevent 
grading or flattening the land. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the region lacks water and sewer facilities. Poor roads and rugged 
terrain add to the headaches of those contemplating building. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter what the city government does, Mother Nature and life in general 
will dictate who has money to build what when," said Dennis Carlson, whose 
family owns about half a dozen parcels in the Skyline Area, covering about 1.5 
acres. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to redrawing property lines, the council will consider a program 
to purchase some parcels and preserve them as open space. 
</P>
<P>
 With its historic oak trees and prominent ridgeline, the Skyline Area "is 
important in terms of the view-shed from the freeway, even if you just see it 
for a few seconds going by," Councilman Frank Schillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Land acquisition will probably target the most hilly properties, which carry 
the most scenic value but the lowest price tags due to their development 
constraints. Eleven such parcels are already up for sale, since the property 
owner has failed to pay taxes on the land since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the council will consider buying the 11 small parcels for $46,750 
-- a price Zukowski termed a steal. "It's amazing, isn't it," she said. "It's 
so cheap because it's not realistically buildable." 
</P>
<P>
 The council is scheduled to discuss the Skyline Area report at the beginning 
of its 5 p.m. session. Already, Zukowski and Lazar have held several meetings 
with Skyline Area property owners, including some who flew in from other states 
to discuss the report as it developed. 
</P>
<P>
 One active participant was Carlson, who owns a residence in the Skyline Area 
near his family's property. 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up in the region, Carlson said he enjoyed the trails to the south and 
the vast cattle ranches to the west. He said he used to be able to look out 
toward Westlake Village and see nothing but cow pastures. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though a K-mart, strip malls and housing developments have replaced the 
range, Carlson said he's still attracted to the Skyline Area because it has 
retained a remote, rural feel. 
</P>
<P>
 And he hopes the council will be able to protect that atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one's looking to build homes there now, and they won't for four to five 
years," Carlson said. "But it'll be nice to have a plan in place when the 
(developers) are ready."

ADS ATTACKING HOSPITAL PLAN DENOUNCED; HEALTH: COMMUNITY MEMORIAL 
ADMINISTRATORS NEVER APPROVED THE ADVERTISEMENTS AGAINST THE PROPOSED EXPANSION 
OF THE COUNTY'S PUBLIC FACILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Four full-page ads attacking the proposed expansion of Ventura County's public 
hospital were officially sponsored by a taxpayer alliance but paid for by an 
Orange County consulting firm after a private Ventura hospital withdrew its 
joint sponsorship. 
</P>
<P>
 The $6,000 in ads, which described the county hospital project as "a $50 
million boondoggle" cooked up by bureaucrats, were purchased by Costa 
Mesa-based Campaign Management Inc., the firm's president confirmed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Political consultant Harvey A. Englander said Community Memorial Hospital 
hired him last summer to plan a campaign opposing expansion of the nearby 
public hospital, which the private hospital considers an emerging competitor 
for private patients. 
</P>
<P>
 But Community Memorial administrators never approved the four November ads, 
requested that they not be run, then recoiled in embarrassment when the 
strongly worded advertisements sparked controversy, Englander and hospital 
administrators said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a tragic comedy of errors," Englander said Friday. "And the only 
honorable thing for me to do was to eat the cost." 
</P>
<P>
 The ads prompted a heated response. County Supervisor Maria VanderKolk 
contended that they were filled with lies. She demanded at a public meeting 
that H. Jere Robings -- whose taxpayer alliance was identified as sponsor but 
which had too little money to pay for the ads -- reveal who had picked up the 
tab. 
</P>
<P>
 Robings, now a candidate for VanderKolk's supervisorial seat, would only say 
they were purchased by "people who supported the alliance." And he refused 
comment again Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Englander said he paid the full $5,958 bill to the Ventura Star-Free 
Press, because a member of his staff had mistakenly placed the ads too soon 
without either Community Memorial or Robings signing off on them. 
</P>
<P>
 Robings had reviewed the ads for accuracy and content and had never objected 
to the taxpayers' alliance being identified as their sponsor, Englander said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Community Memorial administrators, who said they had reviewed a single ad 
for accuracy, contacted Englander when they were told the ads were scheduled to 
run, hospital Executive Director Michael D. Bakst said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakst reached Englander at a charity golf tournament the Friday before the ads 
were to begin running on Sunday. But it was too late to pull them, Englander 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said they were not his ads and he was not going to be responsible for 
them," Englander said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakst said he recalls Englander's response: "He said, 'Don't worry about them, 
they're not your ads.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But the resulting controversy embarrassed Community Memorial anyway, as county 
officials pointed fingers in its direction. Bakst now says he should never have 
been involved in the ad campaign and erred by not carefully monitoring its 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a mistake, and I'll accept responsibility," Bakst said. Despite 
Englander's apology and assurance that he would cover all ad costs, Community 
Memorial fired the consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were trying to get the politicians' attention by developing a grass-roots 
understanding of this issue," Bakst said. "I was planning on going out and 
speaking to various groups, so they would, in turn, get in touch with their 
supervisors." 
</P>
<P>
 Community Memorial officials have opposed construction of a new 
100,000-square-foot outpatient wing at the county hospital, saying it's not 
needed, it's too costly and is part of an aggressive county plan to compete for 
private patients and not just treat the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKolk said Friday that Community Memorial is wrong on all counts, and 
that its connection to the November ads demonstrates an underhanded, 
behind-the-scenes approach to an important public issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "This shows a certain lack of character on their part and brings up some 
questions about what they're trying to do," VanderKolk said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Community Memorial also hired a Sacramento legal research firm last 
year to gather thousands of pages of county documents and build a case against 
a $38-million hospital wing and parking garage. County supervisors have 
approved the project in concept but will not consider a funding package until 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of us had assumed that Community Memorial was involved in some way (with 
the ads), because they have had our staff scrambling for months to pull 
together tons of records," VanderKolk said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This leads one to believe they are just trying to discredit us, instead of 
just being straightforward and honest," she said. "They're approaching this in 
a very backhanded kind of way." 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKolk said Bakst had rejected requests by her and Supervisor Maggie 
Kildee -- who comprise the board's health care subcommittee -- to meet with 
Community Memorial's full board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now there needs to be an open and honest debate," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakst said he never tried to keep supervisors from meeting with Community 
Memorial's board and does not have that power. In fact, he said Kildee met with 
about 12 of his board's 23 members in November to discuss the potential effects 
of President Clinton's universal health plan on the county's role in caring for 
the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakst said officials have been less than forthright when explaining the need 
for new county projects and discussing county reasons for expanding its clinic 
and hospital system. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he said, "This is not the time for hospitals warring and getting 
acrimonious. We need somebody to sit down and say what is in the best interest 
of the entire community -- maybe a third party to say what would be the best 
system of care in an ideal world."

SIMI WEIGHS OPTIONS FOR DAMAGED POLICE STATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It will take weeks to repair the damage done to the Simi Valley police 
headquarters by just 30 to 40 seconds of earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 But officers and at least one City Council member say repairs are not enough. 
They want the building replaced, at a cost estimated between $10 million and 
$15 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The city staff is compiling a report on the City Council's options -- from 
completing repairs to building an entirely new police headquarters, Assistant 
City Manager Mike Sedell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parts of the 23-year-old building sank six inches in the magnitude 6.8 quake 
Jan. 17. Its walls split at the seams, ceilings sagged and broken water lines 
flooded floors. 
</P>
<P>
 Damage to stairwells rendered the second-floor locker room and gym, and the 
first-floor records department unusable. Police now have to don uniforms in 
trailers outside and carry records across the parking lot to makeshift storage 
in a neighboring building. 
</P>
<P>
 The department itself was up and running at full capacity within a day or two, 
Police Chief Lindsey Paul Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest inconvenience was the first day, when all our filing cabinets, 
desks and chairs were thrown all over the place. Everything in the police 
station was basically a big jumble," Miller said. "Once we got that cleaned up, 
once we got the electricity and the water back in, it was basically business as 
usual." 
</P>
<P>
 But smashed plaster, fallen ceiling tiles and severed wires are strewn 
throughout the building, Deputy City Manager Bob Heitzman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The damage is repairable, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 But before any interior work is done, contractors must jack up the building to 
its original height by injecting concrete into the ground underneath -- a 
process called "pressure grouting," Heitzman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city expects repairs to take 70 days and cost nearly $200,000, about 90% 
of which is to be reimbursed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Sedell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But inspectors from FEMA and the California Office of Emergency Services said 
the city must do engineering studies to determine the full scope of the damage 
before it can receive any disaster aid for the police headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the worst hit of any of the city buildings, but there wasn't any 
substantial structural damage," Sedell said. "It can largely be rebuilt to its 
original condition or better." 
</P>
<P>
 But some are calling for a new headquarters to replace the police complex, a 
patchwork of former city offices built in 1971 and 1973 that were originally 
meant to house the Police Department temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
 "The building did not do real well," said Sgt. Gary Collins, president of the 
Simi Valley Police Officers' Assn. "We have guys saying, 'I don't know if I 
want to go back in that building.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake was "a wake-up call" about the building's lack of earthquake 
protection, Collins said, and the police union wants city officials at least to 
begin planning for a new headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want a building today. We don't want a building tomorrow," Collins 
said. "We want the same type of commitment to us that was given to the builders 
of the (proposed) mall and the Cultural Arts Center. In two or three years, 
plan on identifying and purchasing the property. . . . Get some architectural 
renderings done. In four years, we'll do the groundbreaking and, in the fifth 
year, we'll move in." 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilwoman Barbara Williamson, who recently won the union's endorsement 
for her election bid in the 4th Supervisorial District, said she too wants a 
new police headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 The city should launch a five- to seven-year plan to replace the building 
because it is old, unsafe and too small, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the residents in our community voted for Proposition 172," she said, 
referring to a sales tax for emergency services, "I think they were saying it 
was our responsibility to take care of our police and fire. And to me, this is 
taking care of our police and fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of buildings in our town that . . . need repair," she said. 
"The city has been absolutely devastated because of the earthquake, and we're 
looking at millions of dollars in repairs. But I don't want to see the police 
station put on the back burner. I don't want a Band-Aid approach to fix it." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Greg Stratton said he believes that the building will be safe enough 
after the repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earthquake damage has been, I think, a little blown out of proportion," 
he said. "It was messy because a couple pipes broke. The real problem we had 
was a water heater let go, and that makes it look a lot worse than it really 
was." 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton acknowledged that police are crowded in their present quarters and 
said the department should go ahead with plans to expand into the former East 
County Courthouse next door, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And he said he has no quarrel with starting to plan for a new police 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The point is, it's going to take time to build it," Stratton said. "The real 
thing is, where do we get the money? Where do we locate it?"

TINGSTROM WILL CHALLENGE FOR ASSESSOR'S JOB; POLITICS: THE VENTURA COUNCILMAN 
CITES HIS MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Acknowledging that he has no experience in assessing land values but stressing 
his management background, Ventura City Councilman Jack Tingstrom on Friday 
announced his candidacy for county assessor. 
</P>
<P>
 Tingstrom, a 58-year-old conservative Republican with extensive ties to 
Ventura's business community, will challenge the acting assessor, Glenn Gray, 
for the $102,781-a-year position. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to bring a business look to the bureaucracy," said Tingstrom, a 
personnel consultant who was elected to the council on a pro-business platform 
in 1991. "I would like to be able to make the assessor's office closer to the 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 The office is responsible for doing inventory and evaluating all taxable 
property in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a very political office at all," Tingstrom said. If elected, he 
said, he would use his public relations skills to give the office a higher 
profile in county government. 
</P>
<P>
 "People should be aware of what's going on in government," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tingstrom said a background in assessing land values is not necessary for 
supervising the county assessor's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you need is a manager," said Tingstrom, who retired in 1985 after 30 
years as a mid-level manager at GTE Corp. "All my life I've been managing." 
</P>
<P>
 Tingstrom said he also wants to make the assessor's office more responsive to 
market conditions. "If the market is down, then land values should be down and 
people should pay less taxes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tingstrom, who spent $15,000 on his 1991 council race, said he plans to raise 
and spend about $25,000 for the nonpartisan county assessor campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "The election will be about name recognition," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If elected, Tingstrom said, he would have to resign his $7,200-a-year City 
Council seat. The council would then have the option of appointing another 
member, holding a special election or waiting until the November, 1995, 
election for voters to fill the seat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been checking with my constituents to see what they feel (about his 
running for assessor), and I have received nothing but positive responses," 
Tingstrom said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a Ventura councilman, Tingstrom said he has more recognition in west 
Ventura County than in the east county. 
</P>
<P>
 Tingstrom said he plans to use endorsements from local politicians in the east 
county to help him attract votes in the assessor's race. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton and Thousand Oaks Councilman Frank Schillo 
both said Friday that they will endorse Tingstrom and try to help his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 In turn, Tingstrom is endorsing Stratton and Schillo in their races. Stratton 
is running for county auditor-controller and Schillo has taken out forms for 
Supervisor Maria VanderKolk's seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Tingstrom's only opponent in the assessor's race so far is Gray, who has 
worked in the assessor's office for 31 years, including seven years as 
assistant assessor. A Ventura resident, Gray was appointed in June, 1993, to 
fill the unexpired term of R. J. Sanford, who died in office. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview this week, Gray said his campaign for the job will emphasize 
his experience. Like Tingstrom, Gray said the election will be won on name 
recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every piece of paper that goes out of this office has my name on it," Gray 
said. "I think that will help some." 
</P>
<P>
 Gray said he plans to file candidacy papers Monday. Tingstrom said he will 
submit his papers later. The filing deadline is March 11.

CITY WORKS TO GET TENANT FOR CIVIC CENTER; THOUSAND OAKS: COUNCIL WILL CONSIDER 
TAKING BIDS ON RENOVATING THE VACANT RUN-DOWN BUILDING. THE PROCESS COULD COST 
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Struggling to find a tenant for the long-vacant civic center on Hillcrest 
Drive, the Thousand Oaks City Council on Tuesday will consider taking bids on 
renovating the run-down building. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Jaime Zukowsi -- concerned that the civic center's leaky roof, 
broken windows and gutted interior might deter potential tenants -- made the 
request last week to give the building a face lift. 
</P>
<P>
 "I must insist that we treat that facility with the respect it deserves, or 
else no one will even consider buying it," Zukowski said. "It looks like a bomb 
shelter. We're communicating, by the current condition of the property, that 
we're not eager to sell or lease it." 
</P>
<P>
 In response to her plea, City Manager Grant Brimhall has proposed soliciting 
cost estimates from contractors interested in sprucing up the building, which 
the city vacated several years ago because of asbestos contamination. 
</P>
<P>
 But simply collecting and analyzing the bids could cost the city thousands of 
dollars in staff time, Councilman Frank Schillo said. And while he might 
support a small expense to replace boarded-up windows, Schillo said he would be 
unwilling to sink big money into the property. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why spend money renovating the building in a way that might not match the 
requirements of the person who's going to lease it?" Schillo asked. "They may 
want to tear the whole thing down." 
</P>
<P>
 The city needs to sell the civic center at 401 W. Hillcrest Drive for at least 
$11 million in order to repay loans taken out to pay for the Civic Arts Plaza, 
which is scheduled to open this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing that the economic slump will make it tough to reap such a hefty 
sum, the council has decided to hold on to the building for a few years until 
the real estate market rebounds. In the meantime, however, city staff is 
looking to lease the property, perhaps to a think tank or school. 
</P>
<P>
 Conejo Valley Chamber of Commerce President Steve Rubenstein, who sat on a 
citizens committee analyzing the best uses for the building, said he thought a 
moderate investment would serve the city well. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month's earthquake prompted some San Fernando business owners to consider 
moving, he said, and they might be more interested in a ready-to-use facility 
than a fixer-upper. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the condition it's in right now, no one would even look at it," Rubenstein 
said. "We have to bring it up to an acceptable condition." 
</P>
<P>
 As is, the civic center's pothole-marred parking lot collects pools of water 
when it rains. The broken windows are covered with plywood boards. And the 
gutted interior, while free of asbestos, remains a mess. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with cosmetic defects, the building has another serious flaw: The second 
story is not wheelchair accessible, and a new tenant might have to install an 
elevator to serve disabled people. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, the improvements might be too expensive for the council to consider 
-- unless the right tenant comes along, architect Gary Heathcote said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can see making minor repairs to the building, yes," said Heathcote, a 
member of the citizens committee that reviewed the site. "But when it comes to 
throwing money at it, I'm a little dubious."

SMOKE EXTINGUISHER; OJAI: SOME CUSTOMERS ARE ANGRY AND RESTAURANT OWNERS ARE 
WARY AS THE CITY BEGINS ENFORCEMENT TODAY OF A BAN ON CIGARETTES THAT IS THE 
TOUGHEST IN THE COUNTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The toughest smoking ordinance in Ventura County goes into effect today in 
Ojai, where restaurant owners worry about how it will affect business at their 
struggling operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's either going to help it or kill it," said Joseph Borgaro, who owns the 
Ojai Valley Bowl, a bowling alley and restaurant, with his wife, Cherie. "We 
are in trouble as it is. We don't have time to sit here and play games." 
</P>
<P>
 Borgaro said half of the bowlers who play in nightly leagues at the bowling 
alley are smokers. 
</P>
<P>
 If they decide to knock pins elsewhere, his business could land in the gutter, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, the Ojai City Council strengthened the city's smoking ordinance 
by prohibiting smoking not only in restaurants, but also in restaurant dining 
patios, city parks and other outdoor public areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance also was expanded to include smoking in sports arenas, including 
bowling alleys. 
</P>
<P>
 As of today, the city will issue citations to businesses and individuals who 
violate the law, said Assistant City Manager Dan Singer. 
</P>
<P>
 A first offense will result in a $50 fine, with larger fines for subsequent 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer said it is unlikely individuals will be cited, but businesses will be 
fined if they fail to keep people from smoking in their establishments. 
</P>
<P>
 The Borgaros said they will comply with the city's demands, directing patrons 
into the bowling area's adjacent lounge if they want to smoke. Smoking will be 
prohibited in the restaurant and bowling areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to abide by this thing," Joseph Borgaro said. "It's not that we 
disagree with the rule. All we ask is that (the city) let us work with the 
bowlers." 
</P>
<P>
 Many nonsmokers among the bowling regulars are thrilled by the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm delighted," said Jacque Pisciotta, who has bowled at the Ojai Valley Bowl 
for over six years. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the smokers have made her participation in the sport uncomfortable. 
"They feel their rights are bring taken away, but our rights are being taken 
away too by having to breathe their smoke." 
</P>
<P>
 Jo Stalder has endured the smoke-filled bowling alley for nine years and is 
thankful for the strict ordinance. "The one thing I hate about going to the 
bowling alley is I come home smelling like smoke," she said. But Cherie Borgaro 
said the new law comes at a bad time for struggling businesses like hers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here we are trying to beat our brains to get people in the building and the 
city's trying to get them out," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 With 16 weeks left in the league season, Borgaro said she has begged the 
bowlers who smoke not to walk out on them. 
</P>
<P>
 But some are angry enough to do just that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't bowl after tonight," longtime bowler and smoker Joanne Barnes said 
Thursday. Barnes has bowled at the Ojai lanes for 19 years, but because she is 
angry at the city, she said she will simply stop bowling. "I just don't think 
they have the right" to ban smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 Other local businesses are waiting to see how aggressively the city will 
enforce the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to try to accommodate this, but it's going to be difficult," said 
Jim Allen, general manager of the Soule Park Golf Course. "I don't see how I 
can comply 100% right away." Major structural remodeling is necessary for the 
course's bar and restaurant area to comply with the city ordinance. A wall will 
have to be built and individual ventilation systems installed. For now, a 
temporary partition will divide the smoking and nonsmoking rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen said he is still negotiating with the owners of the clubhouse over the 
restructuring and said the city needs to be patient. "It's not like all of a 
sudden we can build a wall and it's over with." 
</P>
<P>
 As passed, the ordinance even prohibits golfers from smoking on fairways, but 
the city is reconsidering that provision, Singer said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said local businesses have had ample time -- 60 days -- to make 
adjustments. But the city is willing to work with them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to be very strict, but we want the intention of the ordinance 
met," Singer said. "We're kind of at mercy to the level of cooperation we get." 
</P>
<P>
 The city has notified 650 local businesses by mail, Singer said, and city 
workers visited at least 25 personally to educate proprietors about the 
ordinance. He said the city has received no formal complaints, although he has 
heard a lot of grumbling. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen said he is concerned about losing customers at Soule Park. "We've had 
customers come to us and say, 'If you aren't going to accommodate us, we aren't 
going to come here.' " 
</P>
<P>
 An Ojai resident for 49 years, Helen Sieger has been a regular at the golf 
course's restaurant. She said she frequently enjoys an afternoon drink and 
smoke there with her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the new smoking restrictions, she said, she won't be coming as often. 
"I think it's ridiculous . . . but I suppose I'll get used to it."

 Mayor A.B. (Buck) Catlin and City Clerk Anne M. York will join two City 
Council members as targets of the first recall election in Fullerton history. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Tanney, Orange County registrar of voters, said Thursday that recall 
organizers submitted more than the required number of signatures needed for a

 He said his office verified 8,742 signatures in the recall effort against 
Catlin and 8,512 signatures against York.

members Don Bankhead and Molly McClanahan was certified last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The recall election of all four probably will be held June 7 to coincide with 
the primary election, Deputy City Clerk Audrey Culver said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pleased that we're through with that stage," said Thomas Babcock, 
chairman of the Fullerton Recalls Committee. "But I would much rather have 
never had to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Catlin called the entire recall process "idiotic" and said Babcock's group is 
wasting taxpayers' money on a special election when the group could campaign 
for a change in city leadership during the regular election in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not considerate of the taxpayers to use their money on a senseless 
recall," Catlin said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The recall election will cost an estimated $118,000, Culver said. 
</P>
<P>
 If one of the four officials is cast out, a special election to fill the seat 
will cost another $118,000, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The recall effort has been going on since July when the City Council voted 3 
to 2 in favor of an unpopular 2% tax on water, telephone, electricity, natural 
gas and cable television bills, in spite of objections from hundreds of 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Bankhead, McClanahan and Catlin voted in favor of the tax, 
while council members Julie Sa and Chris Norby voted against it. 
</P>
<P>
 After the vote, a group of residents formed the Fullerton Recalls Committee to 
punish what they call unacceptable behavior by the council members. 
</P>
<P>
 Babcock said York is a target because she delayed the recall process when she 
rejected recall petitions against the council members, saying they exceeded the 
legal word limit. 
</P>
<P>
 But York says she was just doing her job and couldn't have delayed the process 
because she responded within one day to every inquiry from Babcock's group. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're just making a big issue out of it because they have no other leg to 
stand on," York said. 
</P>
<P>
 All four officials have said they will fight the recall. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankhead said the four have set up a campaign fund and have received 10 or 11 
small checks from close friends but have made no public solicitation for funds 
yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Babcock said his group has about $300 and will probably rely on door-to-door 
canvassing to get their message out. MARY LOU PICKEL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; RESIDENTS RAISE STINK OVER CATTLE DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 People who live near the cornfield where 250 head of cattle will stay 
overnight before a July 15 drive met with Orange County Fairgrounds staff 
Wednesday to talk about their concerns that the animals will stink up the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Jill Lloyd, marketing supervisor for the fairgrounds, told members of the Mesa 
del Mar Homeowners Assn. that the fair staff will do everything possible to 
minimize the impact on the neighborhood. The cattle will be kept in a pen at 
Costa Mesa High School, more than 300 feet from the nearest house, Lloyd said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cattle drive, which may include Western movie stars and local officials 
riding horses, will kick off the summer fair. The drive will begin at about 10 
a.m. and will proceed on Fairview Avenue to the Princeton Street gate of the 
fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council approved the street closures in December and has required 
$5-million insurance for the event. But council members and residents have said 
they are a little nervous about the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Sandra L. Genis told fair employees that she wants someone whom 
residents can call during the night "if there's a 4 a.m. cattle riot or 
whatever." Lloyd promised there will be someone on call. 
</P>
<P>
 Cattle escaped into a grapefruit orchard before a 1985 drive in Hemet, but 
fair officials said they believe the expected 100 to 125 horseback riders will 
ably contain the animals this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't say that I'm crazy about having 250 cattle stationed there," said Roy 
Andreen, president of the homeowners association. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Ure, whose house abuts the high school field, was angry. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a stench coming from the school now," he said, referring to the sheep 
that are penned there for agriculture students. Ure said he talked with a UC 
Davis biologist and has calculated that the 250 cows will produce more than 
3,750 pounds of manure during their stay at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no chance they can get rid of it," Ure said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lloyd said the manure will be rototilled into the field and become a 
fertilizer with no smell. WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; COMPLAINTS OF NOISE PROMPT REDESIGN 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rossmoor Center officials plan to redesign a portion of the shopping complex's 
back parking lot as a way of reducing noise created by customers of the Super 
Saver 7 movie theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who live in condominiums next to the parking lot have complained 
that movie goers talk loudly and screech their car tires when leaving the 
cinema at night, keeping them up at night. 
</P>
<P>
 The parking lot remodeling -- which still must be approved by city planning 
officials -- will reduce the number of exits and entrances to the back lot, 
perhaps lessening the number of cars that use it, said Lee Whittenberg, the 
planning director. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan also calls for the landscaping with trees and plants occupying 
between 10% and 15% of the lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittenberg said that the number of complaints has tapered off in recent 
months. "They tend to occur during the Easter vacation and during the 
summertime," he said. "In the winter, people say it's not as bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Rossmoor Center officials first reacted to the complaints by increasing 
security around the back lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The city investigated the possibility of raising a wall between the lot and 
the condos with fiberglass panels. But that idea turned out to be too 
expensive, Whittenberg said. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; TOPLESS BAR PERMIT APPEAL TO BE HEARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council is scheduled to hear an appeal from a businessman who wants 
to open the city's first topless bar to be located near John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the Planning Commission voted 4 to 2 to deny a use permit to Al 
Nguyen, who wants to open a bar called Mermaids at 4248 Martingale Way and 
feature semi-nude and nude dancing as well as serve alcohol.Nguyen, who also 
owns Paddy Murphy's, a topless dancing club in Santa Ana, is appealing that 
decision to the council. 
</P>
<P>
 The planning commissioners who voted against the project claimed that the 
parking was not sufficient to accommodate the visitors that the restaurant 
would attract. Since that decision, the City Council adopted an emergency adult 
entertainment ordinance in an attempt to regulate topless dancing in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, renovation of the building that could one day become Mermaids is 
underway in a commercial area of Newport Beach. The project will include five 
"theater" stages, including large-screen TV and private viewing rooms where 
dancers will be separated from patrons by a three-foot glass wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Talmo, who represents Nguyen, has said because exotic dancing is a form 
of free speech the city does not have the legal footing to deny the use permit. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council meeting begins at 7 p.m. Monday. BOB ELSTON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA; CITY FILLS PLANNING COMMISSION VACANCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has appointed Glen E. Owens to fill former Planning 
Commissioner William E. Reeves' term. 
</P>
<P>
 With a 3-2 vote, Owens, 41, was chosen to serve on the commission over seven 
other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 He is an 18-year resident who works as an examiner of fraudulent documents for 
the California attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Reeves, who was appointed to the Planning Commission last April, resigned from 
his four-year job in November because he moved out of La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
 The city began interviewing for his replacement two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Owens, who lives with his wife, Janice, and two teen-age sons, will complete 
the term that Reeves left vacant. 
</P>
<P>
 It expires March 31, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope just to contribute to the well-being of the city," Owens said about 
his new job. "I have a very open mind." MIMI KO

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MUGU ROCK; WOMAN KILLED AS CAR PLUNGES INTO OCEAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 An elderly Malibu woman died early Friday when her car careened off a cliff on 
Pacific Coast Highway near Mugu Rock and sailed 150 feet in the air before it 
landed in the water, crushing her, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 It took firefighters more than an hour to extricate the body of 80-year-old 
Dorothy Malloy from her red Mercedes-Benz. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is not a place in that car that is not crumpled, wrinkled or smashed," 
Point Mugu Fire Capt. Carl Friddle said. "The car hit hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Although investigators had not yet determined the cause of death, Malloy 
apparently died instantly when the roof of the vehicle smashed her inside the 
car, said Mitch Breese, a spokesman for the coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
 After hitting the water, the vehicle was carried by the tide onto rocks about 
75 yards from where it had gone off the road, a spokeswoman for the California 
Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
 A surfer who had stopped near Point Mugu to take a picture of the ocean 
spotted the vehicle and notified authorities about 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the fourth fatal accident in the last five months along a six-mile 
stretch south of Mugu Rock, Friddle said. All four cars plunged off the winding 
road into the water. 
</P>
<P>
 The high number of accidents along Pacific Coast Highway has led county and 
state officials to propose a safety awareness campaign to begin in March, a 
spokesman for the California Department of Transportation said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, authorities hope to install call boxes, straighten curves and 
post better road warnings along the mostly coastal road between Oxnard and the 
Los Angeles County line. CHRISTINA LIMA

 Two Oxnard men were rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard after their fishing boat 
ran aground on San Clemente Island, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ian Janis and Robert Lee Rhoads III were found onshore about 11:30 p.m. 
Thursday after they had abandoned their 27-foot vessel. 
</P>
<P>
 The vessel's anchor chain broke and the boat drifted onto rocks while the two 
men were diving for sea urchin. The victims radioed the Coast Guard for help 
about 10:30 p.m., just before they abandoned the boat. 
</P>
<P>
 They were taken uninjured off the island by a Coast Guard helicopter.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; BRINGING TO LIFE LEGACY OF LINCOLN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE TASSY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a black felt-trimmed jacket, top hat and Quaker beard, Charles Brame stood 
before 200 youngsters and proclaimed, "Well, I'm Abe Lincoln, your 16th 
President!" 
</P>
<P>
 Brame, 68, a retired schoolteacher and working Abraham Lincoln look-alike, 
performed "The Living Lincoln" at Arthur F. Corey Elementary School in Buena 
Park on Friday morning, one of his many engagements in county schools observing 
Presidents Day this month. 
</P>
<P>
 In front of the 9- and 10-year-olds, Brame assumed the character of Lincoln at 
age 56. He told personal, first-person anecdotes, recounting, for example, how 
he had become smitten with his wife at a dance. 
</P>
<P>
 "She even speaks French, and there I was, a country hick!" he exclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
 Of his professional life, he said, "I want you to know being President ain't 
what it's cooked up to be. I've been very, very busy," dealing with the Civil 
War, which he called one of history's bloodiest. 
</P>
<P>
 Brame pulled dramatic faces as he strode back and forth, crying into a red 
kerchief when he talked about his sad experiences, slapping his legs with mirth 
over amusing stories. The students sat on the floor quietly paying attention, 
rushing to shake his hand and ask questions when his hourlong performance 
ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Brame researched and wrote the monologue and began performing it 18 years ago. 
Each show is slightly different because he tailors the drama to suit different 
age groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Brame's costume is also tailored to be appropriate for Lincoln's era. He went 
to a seamstress to have an authentic notch-collared vest made, topped it with a 
black jacket and accented it with a pocket watch. 
</P>
<P>
 His home-grown Quaker beard is shaved off his cheeks at the jawline. To 
complete the effect, he wears elevator boots that bring him up to Lincoln's 
6-foot-4 height and adds color to his hair. 
</P>
<P>
 The costume was convincing enough that one student asked, "Are you the real 
Lincoln or the fake Lincoln?" 
</P>
<P>
 Brame, who taught school for 33 years, has a master's degree in history from 
the University of Missouri at Columbia. He has performed about 2,300 times, 
sometimes as many as four shows a day in February. He charges about $250 for 
performances at schools and more for shows before private groups. 
</P>
<P>
 When Lincoln is out of season, Brame, of Alta Loma in San Bernardino County, 
sends out brochures, arranges performance dates, and spends time with his wife, 
four daughters and four grandchildren. But, he said, "I thrive on the work." 
</P>
<P>
 He often cannot separate himself from it. Because of his physical resemblance 
to Lincoln, even when out of costume Brame is approached on the streets 
year-round, he said. ELAINE TASSY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; JURY INDICTS WOMAN IN BANK ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman suspected of robbing a Bank of America branch in Ventura last month 
was indicted Friday on federal armed bank robbery charges, FBI officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shonte Lynn McKinzie, 18, formerly of Aurora, Colo., was indicted by a federal 
grand jury in Los Angeles.The indictment charges McKinzie with masterminding 
the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, McKinzie faces a maximum 25 years in federal custody, FBI 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 McKinzie is one of three people suspected of entering the bank branch on Main 
Street, holding about 20 people at gunpoint and then escaping with an 
undisclosed amount of money. 
</P>
<P>
 After leaving the bank, the suspects drove to Fillmore, where they abandoned 
their car and fled on foot, authorities said. They were arrested after one of 
them, Curtis Smith, 37, of Los Angeles, was struck by a tractor-trailer rig 
while attempting to run across California 126. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Auer, special agent in charge of the FBI's Ventura office, said Smith has 
been transferred from the Ventura County Medical Center to a Los Angeles 
hospital for further surgery and is still in serious condition. Auer said Smith 
will be indicted as soon as he is well enough to be brought before a judge. 
</P>
<P>
 The third suspect, a 15-year-old, is being prosecuted by the Ventura County 
district attorney's office. The youth will appear for a hearing in Ventura 
County Superior Court next week, Auer said. 
</P>
<P>
 McKinzie is scheduled to be arraigned at 9 a.m. Monday in Los Angeles federal 
court. TRACY WILSON

<P>
 Mabi Covarrubias Plisky, former Oxnard city clerk who was fired from another 
city job when critics alleged favoritism in her hiring, will begin working part 
time next week in the Ventura city clerk's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Plisky will work two days a week as a substitute for Diane Angle, a deputy 
clerk who has asked for a reduced schedule, said Ventura City Clerk Barbara 
Kam. 
</P>
<P>
 Kam said of Plisky, who lost a reelection bid in Oxnard in 1992: "If you're 
looking for someone to do fill-in work, how could you ask for someone 
better-qualified?" 
</P>
<P>
 Kam emphasized that Plisky was not hired for a staff position, but as a 
$14-an-hour temporary worker. "There is no position currently open and no 
qualifying list at this time," she said. "(Angle) wants to see if she can open 
her own business, and I'm trying to be flexible and supportive." 
</P>
<P>
 If Angle decides to quit her city position, the city of Ventura would then 
conduct an open recruitment to fill her position, Kam said. 
</P>
<P>
 After losing her city clerk reelection bid to Daniel Martinez, Plisky was 
hired by the Oxnard Police Department as a community representative. But 
protests by Martinez and others that the department hired Plisky because she is 
the wife of City Councilman Michael Plisky prompted the city to fire her from 
that position. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard City Council later clarified rules governing the city clerk and 
treasurer positions, barring the city from hiring office-holders after they 
leave those positions without the council's express approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Plisky, who was unavailable for comment Friday, will begin work for Ventura on 
Thursday. PATRICK McCARTNEY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; PENA VISITS METROLINK CONSTRUCTION SITE 
</P>

<P>
 U.S. Transportation Secretary Federico Pena paid a quick visit Friday morning 
to the Metrolink station under construction in Camarillo, praising transit 
officials for their speedy work in building the emergency station. 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving by helicopter, Pena used the station's dusty lot as a makeshift 
landing pad and donned a hard hat before walking the length of the construction 
site at Lewis Road and Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Congratulations," Pena told a crowd of officials from Camarillo, Ventura 
County, Metrolink and the Army Corps of Engineers. "With this station you're 
going to get more people to try Metrolink, and, with any luck, continue to use 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Shouting to be heard above roaring tractors, Col. Robert VanAntwerp, Army 
Corps of Engineers project supervisor, assured Pena that when the first 
Metrolink train rolls into Camarillo at 5:44 a.m. Monday, the parking lot will 
be paved and a 700-foot concrete platform will be in place. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't look like much now," VanAntwerp said. "But it will do the job." 
</P>
<P>
 The emergency station is scheduled to open Monday and operate for one year to 
help ease freeway congestion caused by the Jan. 17 earthquake. County officials 
have applied for disaster funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to 
pay for the station, which is expected to cost $1.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the quake, Metrolink has opened three stations in the Antelope Valley. 
Another station is scheduled to open Monday in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink Executive Director Richard Stanger took advantage of Pena's visit to 
seek the secretary's support in persuading Amtrak to stop at the Camarillo 
station. 
</P>
<P>
 Amtrak's San Diegan line, which runs from Santa Barbara to San Diego, stops in 
Ventura, Oxnard, Simi Valley and Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting Amtrak to stop here would be the next step," Stanger said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would give commuters more flexibility," he said. SARA CATANIA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; RALPHS' PERMIT OKD, DELIVERIES LIMITED

<P>
 It started last year when city code-enforcement inspectors, investigating 
complaints about noisy deliveries to the Heritage Plaza Ralphs, stumbled upon a 
fact that left store officials red-faced: The market was operating 24 hours a 
day without proper permits. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council this week granted Ralphs the right to stay open around the 
clock, even though the Culver Drive market has already been operating under 
those hours for more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
 But responding to concerns of residents, the council also imposed strict 
conditions that regulate when deliveries can be made, and ordered that a 
barrier be erected at night to prevent trucks from bringing merchandise to the 
store. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this will alleviate some of the problems the residents have been 
concerned with," Councilwoman Christina L. Shea said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the conditional-use permit approved this week, Ralphs cannot accept 
deliveries roughly between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m. on weekdays and between midnight 
and 8 a.m. on weekends. The permit also requires Ralphs to set up a chain 
barrier that blocks trucks from making deliveries during the restricted hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Donna M. LaPorte, who lives next to Heritage Plaza, submitted a petition to 
the city signed by more than 20 people calling for the installation of some 
kind of gate that would block late-night deliveries at the back of the shopping 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 LaPorte pointed out that other supermarkets in Irvine have even more 
restrictive delivery hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralphs representatives who attended Tuesday's council meeting said they 
accepted the conditions. They said the Heritage Plaza market converted to a 
24-hour operation at the same time as many stores throughout the chain. The 
Irvine Ralphs simply neglected to get its conditional-use permit amended, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shea said she has asked city officials to see if there is a way that similar 
code violations can be detected more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me that businesses need to comply with their" permits, Shea said. 
"If they don't, we need to be swift and follow through." SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; GOING FOR OLYMPIC GOLD IN PIN TRADING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ELSTON

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joyce Griffith and her friends in the Balboa Ski Club are off to Lillehammer, 
Norway, for the Winter Olympic Games, which begin today. 
</P>
<P>
 The only competition they will participate in, though, is the pin-trading 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have all kinds of Olympic paraphernalia, we'll be carrying around American 
flags and paint our faces red, white, and blue," said Griffith, a Huntington 
Beach resident. "We do all the silly stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 They are part of a 13-person group from the Newport Beach-based Balboa Ski 
Club leaving for Norway for the second week of the games and the closing 
ceremonies on Feb. 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Many in the group attended the games in Albertville, France two years ago and 
Calgary six years ago and have evolved into Winter Olympics die-hards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We booked (this trip) two years ago," Griffith said Friday in an interview in 
her house, where she wore an Olympic jacket with the colors of the American 
flag. 
</P>
<P>
 She went to Lillehammer last year to scout for the best accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
 She is proud to have landed some of the hottest tickets available and lodging 
in Lillehammer for $600 per night. 
</P>
<P>
 She, her husband, Larry, and the others will see the women's figure-skating 
event featuring Nancy Kerrigan and, maybe, Tonya Harding, the hockey 
competition and the closing ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
 But the real reason they are going is to trade pins. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffith is embarrassed to say that she plans to take a full suitcase packed 
with about 1,000 Olympic pins produced in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 She hopes to add a wide assortment of international pins to her collection, 
which includes a Jamaican Bobsled pin from 1992 and a Thailand Olympic team pin 
from 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Her best items are kept in albums with pin cushions for pages. 
</P>
<P>
 "They call it 'pin fever.' It gets to be an addiction," she said, adding that 
collectors will gather under large circus-like tents at the games to trade pins 
produced by various countries and their corporate sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 As she did at the previous two Olympic Games, Griffith will attend events 
wearing dozens of pins on her neck scarf. This acts as a beacon to other 
traders. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will come up to you and look at your pins," she said. Because of the mix 
of people and language barriers, many pin transactions are silent and quick. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody understands the language of pins," said Griffith's friend, Sandy 
Olinyk, who is also going to Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is really nothing like this," Griffith said. "I am not much into 
sports, but I really get into this." 
</P>
<P>
 When she returns from the Olympics, she will begin planning a 1996 trip to 
Atlanta for the summer games. BOB ELSTON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; NORTH TUSTIN PROTESTS CITY'S GENERAL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council on Wednesday unanimously approved the city's general plan, 
which for the first time includes the unincorporated area of North Tustin, a 
bedroom community of about 23,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 The general plan, a planning document that guides the city's future growth, is 
the result of three years of work by city employees and consultants, and deals 
with such issues as land use, housing, public safety, noise and open spaces and 
conservation. 
</P>
<P>
 It covers areas within city boundaries and land within its sphere of influence 
that may be annexed in the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 North Tustin residents have protested the inclusion of their community in the 
general plan because it will be an invitation for developers to propose 
projects that could change the semi-rural character of their neighborhoods, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many streets have no sidewalks or street lights because that is how they want 
it. They are worried the general plan would allow a zone designation that would 
make it possible to build apartments and condominiums in certain parts of the 
North Tustin area. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said North Tustin was added for planning purposes only and 
there are no immediate plans to annex the 3,800-acre area or portions of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just have to be more vigilant now," said Don Kragenbrink, president of the 
Foothill Communities Assn., which opposed inclusion of North Tustin in the 
general plan. "We don't want to be run over by Tustin." 
</P>
<P>
 Kragenbrink said they are worried city officials may allow developers to 
combine small lots to build commercial or high-density developments. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials said that single-family neighborhoods would be maintained 
and encouraged to provide a variety of housing types in the city. Currently, 
North Tustin consists mostly of single-family, one-story houses on land that is 
averaging about an acre. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; TREASURE ISLAND PLAN OKD; LAWSUIT LIKELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has approved a plan that allows the owners of Treasure Island 
Mobilehome Park to close the park, and the plan defines how tenants must be 
reimbursed when they move. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3-2 vote closes one chapter in a bitter and lengthy battle between park 
owners and tenants at the city's largest mobile home park, a sprawling, 
oceanfront complex in South Laguna. 
</P>
<P>
 Park owners, who maintain that the relocation plan favors their tenants and 
places an unreasonable burden on them, said a new chapter will be played out in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just going to go to court, that's all I can tell you," said Costa Mesa 
businessman Richard Hall, who along with Merrill Lynch Hubbard heads the 
partnership that bought the park five years ago for $43 million. "This is just 
another unreasonable, illegal land use decision by the city of Laguna Beach." 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy has centered in large part on how much the landowners can 
reasonably be expected to pay the tenants when they are forced to move. Park 
owners have said they will probably close the park within two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The landowners have maintained that state law requires only that they pay 
"reasonable costs of relocation," while residents say they should be reimbursed 
according to the "fair market value" of the homes at their current prime 
location. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the plan approved Tuesday, the park owners could choose from the 
following options: 
</P>
<P>
 * Allow mobile home owners to stay in their homes for 10 years if they forgo 
relocation benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pay to have coaches moved to other parks at mutually agreeable locations, or 
buy residents mobile homes at mutually agreeable parks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pay a cash benefit based roughly upon the price of coaches sold in 
comparable parks, or upon the appraised value of the Treasure Island coaches at 
their current location. A city appraiser has placed the overall value of the 
more than 180 coaches in the park at $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenants and park owners also have the option of working out any other 
agreeable solution. 
</P>
<P>
 K.P. Rice, president of Treasure Island Resident Owners Assn., said Thursday 
that the council took "a substantial step" toward easing what is bound to be "a 
very traumatic closing" of the 29-acre park, which has been a fixture in Laguna 
Beach for 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're closing the community we love," he said. "We don't regard this as a 
victory in any sense whatsoever. We think it's purely the justice that's 
appropriate in the situation." 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Wayne L. Peterson, who along with Kathleen Blackburn cast an 
opposing vote, said the action did "absolutely nothing" to resolve the dilemma 
because the park owners will not accept it. 
</P>
<P>
 "This ordinance goes so far beyond what the state law requires to be paid that 
the property owner has no incentive to participate in it," Peterson said.

'MUSHROOMED' BULLET FOCUS OF INVESTIGATION OF FATAL SHOOTING; VIOLENCE: SOURCES 
DENY REPORT THAT FOUR SLUGS WERE FOUND BENEATH THE BODY OF A WOMAN KILLED BY 
POLICE ON HOSPITAL ROOFTOP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Investigators probing the fatal shooting by police of a woman on a hospital 
rooftop are focusing on at least one bullet that "mushroomed" inside the 
woman's body, a phenomenon that can indicate a person was shot while lying 
down, but also can be caused by other conditions, sources said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Those same sources, however, vehemently denied a report in Wednesday's San 
Gabriel Valley Tribune, which stated that four slugs were found on the ground 
beneath the body of the woman, Sonji Danese Taylor, 27. 
</P>
<P>
 If that were true, it would strongly suggest that Taylor was shot while lying 
on the ground, but several sources familiar with the investigation said the 
newspaper report was incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was there when they rolled the body over," said one source involved in the 
investigation. "There were no slugs found beneath her." 
</P>
<P>
 That account was confirmed by officials from two different agencies examining 
the Taylor shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Forensic pathologist Cyril Wecht, a renowned medical examiner from Pittsburgh, 
was quoted by the San Gabriel paper as saying that the shooting sounded "savage 
and barbaric" and that finding four bullets beneath the body would strongly 
suggest that Taylor was lying down when the officers fired those shots. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thursday, Wecht stressed that he had only made those comments based on 
information supplied to him by the San Gabriel paper, not on official 
investigative documents. 
</P>
<P>
 The actual coroner's report, Wecht said, contained no information indicating 
that Taylor was shot while lying down. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the trajectories and the reports, I could not say whether she was 
standing, falling down, kneeling or anything else," Wecht said. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor received 10 gunshot wounds in the Dec. 16 shooting, seven of them in 
the back. That fact has sparked the interest of at least three investigative 
agencies -- the LAPD, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office and the 
FBI. None of the investigations are complete, but the district attorney already 
has convened a grand jury, which has taken sworn testimony from five police 
officers and several other witnesses to the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 As they probe the circumstances of Taylor's death, investigators are focusing 
on one bullet that "mushroomed" inside her body and another that may have, 
sources said. A bullet generally mushrooms, or flattens out, when it hits a 
hard object as it is slowing down. 
</P>
<P>
 One explanation for the bullets mushrooming could be that Taylor was on the 
ground when those shots struck her in the back of the shoulder, investigators 
said. But another explanation could be that the bullets struck bones -- most 
likely either in her shoulder or rib cage. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., the lawyer for Taylor's family, has not suggested that 
Taylor was shot while lying down, but he has said that at least one witness to 
the shooting will cast doubt on the Police Department's contention that Taylor 
lunged toward the officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Ferrer, an associate of Cochran's, said Thursday that he did not know 
whether evidence would show that Taylor was shot while lying down. He 
reiterated, however, the family's belief that the shooting was excessive and 
unnecessary, especially since all sides agree that police shot Taylor in the 
back.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; NO MEETING ON GUARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County officials have refused to meet with the Thousand Oaks City 
Council to discuss funding crossing guards for schools that take students from 
the unincorporated part of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing county budget constraints, Supervisors Maggie Kildee and Maria 
VanderKolk said they saw "no basis for the initiation of further discussions on 
the crossing guard issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks Councilman Alex Fiore, who requested the meeting to keep 
crossing guards on duty outside Madrona and Walnut elementary schools, said he 
was outraged by the supervisors' refusal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm amazed that they are unwilling to meet with elected officials," Fiore 
said. "The voters who care about this issue should know about this snub, and it 
ought to be reflected at the ballot box." 
</P>
<P>
 About 85% of the students at Walnut live in unincorporated county territory, 
along with 15% of the students at Madrona. But county supervisors have refused 
to pay a share of the crossing guards' salaries. Thousand Oaks council members 
reluctantly picked up the tab in September, but limited the funding to six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 The six-month period elapses at the end of February, but the city has extended 
its commitment to ensure that guards remain at Camino Manzanas and Marian 
Avenue and at Wendy and Ruth drives. 
</P>
<P>
 The total cost for both crossing guards is $8,400 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Frank Schillo said the council wanted to fund the crossing guards 
from money generated by Proposition 172's half-cent sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter, the supervisors said tax revenue was needed to make up for money 
lost to the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiore said the county should still be able to contribute. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've got a budget of hundreds of millions of dollars, and they can't 
squeeze out a measly $8,000 for something this important?" he said. "I'm fed up 
to my eyeballs with the fact that our city ends up paying for things that the 
county should be doing." MATTHEW MOSK

COUNTYWIDE: LA REINA HIGH WINS MOCK TRIAL CONTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the third time in five years, La Reina High School in Thousand Oaks has 
won the county's high school mock trial competition. 
</P>
<P>
 The team from the relatively small Catholic school outlasted squads from 
second-place Thousand Oaks High, third-place Santa Paula High and fourth-place 
Newbury Park High during Thursday's final two rounds of the competition, which 
began Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's case dealt with issues of child abduction, grand theft and 
self-incrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love it when little La Reina with a student body of 360 beats the much 
larger high schools in the county," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Donald C. Glynn, 
who coached the team along with Mark Scarberry, Pepperdine University law 
professor. 
</P>
<P>
 Glynn said 14 of the La Reina team members were in their first competition. 
Attorneys on the team were Tami Beitzel, Jo Dransfeldt, Mary Grehian, Sarah 
Choi, Stephanie Wolfsohn, Natalie Shum, Leila Yavari and Jahan Shirazi. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses were Kelly Lanquist, Kellie Maestri, Mary Lewinski, Leena Shankar, 
Amelia Premji, Deena Antonacci, Kelly Byrd, Shannon Creen, Corie Rogovin and 
Linda Nebin. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailiffs for La Reina were Arati Jairam and Sonia Grehian. Librarian Eileen 
Debruno served as teacher coach. 
</P>
<P>
 La Reina also won the competition in 1990 and 1991, Glynn said. The mock trial 
is sponsored by schools Supt. Charles Weis and the superintendent of schools' 
office. DWAYNE BRAY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; LIBRARY GIFT STORE MOVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks Library Foundation, a nonprofit agency that raises funds to 
support library programs, has opened a makeshift gift store in The Oaks mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month's earthquake seriously damaged the library on Janss Road, forcing 
the foundation store to close.But little of the store's merchandise was 
destroyed, and foundation directors decided to move the inventory to The Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The new store, open during regular mall hours, is on the upper level just west 
of The Oaks' main entrance. Foundation board member Frances Prince said she 
expects the mall store to remain open for four to six weeks, until library 
renovations are complete. 
</P>
<P>
 The new location is already bringing some benefits. A young woman striding by 
during her mall-walking class one morning offered to volunteer in the store, 
Prince said, adding: "We signed her up on the spot." 
</P>
<P>
 To give residents a peek at the library during the renovations, the Friends of 
the Library group will hold a Hard Hat Art Day from 1 to 3 p.m. March 5. 
</P>
<P>
 For a $1 donation, visitors will be able to scribble on the library's floor 
with crayons or chalk, to leave their mark before the new carpeting is 
installed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't expect it to make a lot of money," organizer Kathy Lewis said. "But 
kids and adults will enjoy it, and it will keep the library in their minds."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; CITY CHOOSES FIRM TO BUILD SPORTS PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council this week picked E. A. Mendoza Contractors to build the 
Tustin Sports Park on 20 acres of city-owned land in East Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buena Park-based contractor's winning bid of $2.6 million was well below 
the city engineers' estimate of $3.3 million, officials said.The city has 
already set aside $2.6 million for construction of the park and such expenses 
as architectural and permit fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine other construction companies submitted bids much lower than city 
estimates, apparently because of the slumping construction industry, and that 
allowed the city to get a favorable contract, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tustin Sports Park will be the biggest recreational facility in the city. 
It will have three lighted softball fields, six lighted tennis courts, 
restrooms, locker rooms, a pro shop and a concession area where food will be 
sold. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, there will be a picnic area, playground, a multipurpose field, 
basketball courts and parking for 200 cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Expected to be completed in the spring of 1995, it will be open to all 
residents, although a majority of the users are expected to come from the 
Tustin Ranch community. The Tustin Unified School District is also planning to 
build a new elementary school close to the park. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is coordinating with the school district to make sure that the 
designs of the park and the school blend, officials said. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA HILLS; CODE-ENFORCEMENT PLAN TO BE REWORKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CORE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although the city has no widespread problems with property owners obeying 
municipal codes, Laguna Hills officials are planning a code-enforcement program 
to target a few areas that have generated complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 Since its incorporation in 1991, the city has received 193 complaints of code 
violations and public nuisances, 152 of which came in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost invariably illegal front yard storage" that draws complaints, 
said Don White, the city's administrative services director. "Things like wood 
piles, sinks, refrigerators, trailers, inoperative vehicles." 
</P>
<P>
 About 85% of the complaints come from neighborhoods that do not have 
homeowners associations, White said. Property owners who are the objects of 
complaints are notified by letter and in nine out of 10 cases, they remove the 
nuisance, he said. Others are referred to the city attorney's office for legal 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 The city contracts with a private firm, BSI Consultants Inc., for code 
enforcement. In 1993, the company spent 969 hours, nearly 6.4 hours per 
complaint, and charged the city a total of $52,326 for its services. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than maintaining the reactive approach to complaints, White said, the 
city is planning a program that once or twice a year would seek out code 
violations in neighborhoods not controlled by homeowners associations. The 
review would be done by an inspector driving streets and recording nuisances 
based on what is visible from a car -- what White referred to as a "windshield 
survey." 
</P>
<P>
 At this time, White said, it's impossible to say whether the new program would 
result in the handling of more or fewer code violations. 
</P>
<P>
 But in an effort to decrease the number of violations -- and costs to the city 
of dealing with them -- the program may also include an educational effort in 
which flyers would be circulated or neighborhood meetings would be held to 
notify residents of potential problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have a big problem in this city," White said, "and we feel a real 
selective, pro-active educational effort once a year is going to achieve some 
tremendous results." 
</P>
<P>
 White briefed the City Council on the code-enforcement situation this week. He 
said city staff will present a proposal for operation of the new program to the 
council March 8. RICHARD CORE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; CITY BUILDING CODE WORKSHOP IS TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A task force formed after the October fire to consider changes to city 
building codes that could help make homes less vulnerable to fire will hold a 
workshop today. 
</P>
<P>
 Recommendations from the task force will be presented to the Laguna Beach City 
Council on March 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just one facet of a multifaceted approach to the risk reduction in 
the city of Laguna Beach," Fire Chief Rich Dewberry said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Any changes to the city building codes would apply citywide. 
</P>
<P>
 Since more than 400 homes were damaged or destroyed by the fires in October, 
fire survivors would especially feel the restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Some items the group has been considering could stir controversy because new 
requirements would make it more expensive to build homes in Laguna Beach. 
Dewberry said insurance would likely cover the cost of upgrades in many cases. 
</P>
<P>
 One consideration involves requiring that fire-retardant materials be used on 
decks or other structures that protrude from a home. 
</P>
<P>
 The codes are "somewhat restrictive now, but we need to address those 
appendages that will add to the fuel loading and will actually carry a fire 
right into the structure as a result," Dewberry said. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting will be held in council chambers at City Hall from 9 a.m. until 1 
p.m. LESLIE EARNEST

$75 AAMCO CAR SERVICE OFFERED ON GUN TRADE-IN; PUBLIC SAFETY: TEN POLICE 
DEPARTMENTS WILL EXCHANGE THE FIREARMS FOR WORK CERTIFICATES. A SIMILAR MIGHTY 
DUCKS PROGRAM WILL SWAP HANDGUNS FOR HOCKEY TICKETS FEB. 19. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Joining a growing list of organizations in the gun-exchange movement, Aamco 
Transmissions executives announced Friday that customers can get $75 worth of 
car service if they turn in a firearm at one of 10 police departments around 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement comes on the heels of a similar program introduced this week 
by the Mighty Ducks hockey team. Team officials confirmed Friday that the "Guns 
for Tickets" exchange will take place Feb. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone bringing a handgun to the Anaheim Police Department between 10 a.m. and 
1 p.m. would receive two tickets to an as-yet unannounced Mighty Ducks home 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 'Guns for Tickets' campaign is patterned after cities and professional 
sports teams throughout the United States," said Mighty Ducks President Tony 
Tavares in a statement. "It is also our way of being a responsible partner in 
the community. The idea behind this effort is designed to remove unwanted guns 
from Orange County streets and households in exchange for Mighty Ducks 
tickets." 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange, Aamco owner Art Eastman started the company's gun-exchange program 
by turning in a gun himself to the Police Department. Ten years ago, Eastman 
said, a customer gave him the .38-caliber Smith & Wesson as partial payment for 
a transmission repair. The firearm, along with any others collected in the 
exchange, will be destroyed, police officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like it says in the Bible, every journey starts with one step," Eastman said, 
adding that he considers gun exchanges a "crusade" to make the streets safer. 
</P>
<P>
 From Monday through Feb. 20, anyone who brings in a gun at one of 10 police 
departments will receive a $75 certificate good at any Aamco shop in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 Police departments in Orange, Tustin, Santa Ana, Brea, Costa Mesa, Irvine, 
Garden Grove, Huntington Beach, Fullerton and Anaheim are participating in the 
exchange program. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something our city welcomes very much," Orange Mayor Fred L. Barrera 
said at a news conference. "I don't know how many will be turned in, but every 
bit helps." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, another gun-exchange program in Orange, in which people who turn in 
guns receive a free carwash and wax job at Metro Car Wash, has not netted any 
weapons, officials said. Costa Mesa police have collected about a half-dozen 
guns in the same program. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials said they hope the offer of free services will encourage 
people to bring in unused guns that they may have inherited or kept around just 
because they didn't know where to get rid of them. Criminals often steal such 
guns and then use them in crimes, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can eliminate those guns being stolen, it makes a program like this 
worthwhile," Irvine Police Sgt. Ron Flathers said. "If there's an unwanted gun 
out there, treat it like you would a pet. Take it to a shelter, the police 
department. The trash is not the place for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials said they will run a computer check on the serial numbers of 
guns brought in to see if they have been reported stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange police Capt. Gene Hernandez said he hopes the expansion of gun-trade 
programs will have the same result as widespread no-smoking campaigns have had. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be a smoker now is to be a pariah," Hernandez said. "I see the same thing 
happening with this program. You'll see more and more people jumping on the 
bandwagon."

NEIGHBORS OPPOSE JAIL AT TUSTIN AIR STATION SITE; LAND USE: SUPERVISORS ARE TO 
CONSIDER A COUNTY STAFF PROPOSAL FOR DETENTION AND TRAINING FACILITIES. 
RESIDENTS PREFER RECREATIONAL USES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents and business owners expressed opposition Friday to a county staff 
proposal before the Board of Supervisors to build prisoner housing, a juvenile 
hall and a police training center at the Tustin Marine Corps Air Station when 
it closes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether it's a detention facility or jail, I don't want it, period." said 
Angie Kardashian a local restaurant owner. "I don't want a prison in my back 
yard, and the base pretty much is in my back yard." 
</P>
<P>
 Guido Borges, former president of the Laurelwood Homeowners Assn., a community 
just half a mile from the base, said: "We're concerned about public safety. 
Plus, it will negatively affect our property values." 
</P>
<P>
 Kardashian and Borges both sit on the 17-member task force that was created in 
February, 1992, to help draft plans for future uses of the base, which is 
scheduled to close in 1997. Their comments echoed a survey last year in which 
the community overwhelmingly opposed a jail or a detention facility. 
</P>
<P>
 In the survey of 30,000 residents and business owners, a jail and a detention 
facility were among the top five least-wanted facilities. The others were a 
landfill, industrial and manufacturing complex, and an airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The top five land uses most favored were parks, recreational facilities, 
schools and other educational facilities and senior citizen housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan which goes before the supervisors on Tuesday, the county would 
ask the Department of Defense for permission to build a jail for prisoners who 
are released on work furlough during the day, a juvenile hall, an alcohol 
rehabilitation center and a law enforcement training facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley said there is a need for such 
facilities in the county, although the public may have different views on where 
they should be. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, the task force, made up of public agency, community and business 
representatives, opposed a county proposal for a training center for police and 
firefighters, saying that it will not be compatible with surrounding land uses. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the training center was rejected, another county proposal to use to 
the land for residential health facilities, temporary housing, and emergency 
shelter for children under the care of the Department of Social Services was 
endorsed by the task force. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force, however, can only recommend potential uses for the base. The 
Defense Department, which owns the land, has the final authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Under federal law, the Defense Department must screen requests from federal, 
state and local agencies for surplus military property before such properties 
are sold to private developers. Some nonprofit groups also may request to use 
the properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Borges, who has served on the task force for more than a year now, said that 
he was not surprised by the latest proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public agencies just want to line up and submit their applications to be 
considered," he said. "It's part of the process. It does not mean they will get 
what they want." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Bennan, executive director of the Tustin Chamber of Commerce, said the 
"businessman in me says that a prison may not be that bad, but certainly there 
are far better uses for the land." 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin city officials said that about 300 acres of the base's 1,620 acres will 
be given or sold at discounted prices to public agencies, nonprofit groups and 
Native American tribes. The rest will be sold to private developers to pay for 
Marine relocation and to build roads, sewer lines and other infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
 The value of the land could reach between $386 million and $611 million by 
1998, according to city officials. The property taxes and sales tax from future 
businesses will make the base an economic asset to the city of Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 "What would a prison provide us?" Borges asked. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, 1992, the federal Bureau of Prisons requested 250 acres to 1,000 
acres of the base for a federal prison, which authorities estimated would 
create 800 jobs. The task force also opposed that proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything that you put in there will provide jobs," said Kardashian. "A 
commercial center could also put people to work. (But) having a jail is 
dangerous."

BONES DUG FROM PARK DATED 4,000 YEARS OLD; ARCHEOLOGY: ANOTHER SET OF HUMAN 
REMAINS WERE ESTIMATED TO BE 2,000 YEARS OLD. THE FINDS WERE REBURIED WITHOUT 
TESTING. 
</P>

<P>
 As with many amateur archeologists, Sam Massey's claims of finding ancient 
human remains in a regional park were met with initial skepticism. But this 
time, his find proved true. 
</P>
<P>
 After heavy rains fell in Aliso Viejo last October, Massey, of Laguna Hills, 
headed off-trail in Aliso and Wood Canyons Regional Park. He began searching 
newly exposed layers of dirt by the creek. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look for opportunities like that," he said. In two days, he found three 
areas with human bones. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to be careful" of legal and religious regulations. Massey contacted the 
Orange County Natural History Assn., several museums and various professional 
archeologists for three months. But nobody believed him, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the history association asked its former curator, environmental data 
systems archeologist Gary Hurd, to go take a look with Massey. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's usually a sheep or deer," Hurd said of people's claims of finding 
archeological artifacts. "Most folks see big bones and think it's human. In 
this case, Massey was correct." 
</P>
<P>
 Hurd contacted the county's park services, the coroner and the Juaneno Native 
Americans' tribal council. The finding led to a search conducted by 
archeologists this month in Aliso and Wood Canyons Regional Park, where they 
found more of the remains of a couple estimated to be at least 4,000 years old, 
said Huntington Beach archeologist Mike Macko. 
</P>
<P>
 Macko, who led the 10-day search requested by the county, said the five-member 
team found a skull and left arm of an apparent male, and most of the remains of 
an apparent female. The two appeared to have been buried together, although no 
burial artifacts were found. Estimates of carbon levels in the soil led to the 
4,000-year age estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, which consisted of Macko and two of his staff members plus two 
representatives of the Juaneno tribe, also found the remains of two other, 
younger humans scattered separately about 200 feet from the couple. Macko 
estimated these humans, who apparently were buried in fetal positions rather 
than straight like the couple, at 2,000 years old or less. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the older two, Macko said: "The uniqueness is not only that the female is 
intact except for a lower limb . . . but that these two were at a relatively 
young age when they died, even considering the shorter life span. They were 
clearly in their prime." 
</P>
<P>
 He added, "There are so many things we'd like to ask of these remains, but 
we're restricted." 
</P>
<P>
 He was referring to rights of the Juanenos under state law to have the remains 
reburied without testing, because they might be ancestors of that tribe. But, 
he said, "they deserve to be put back to rest." 
</P>
<P>
 Local Native American representatives have determined in this case to rebury 
the bones away from the creek. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3,400-acre park has many California oaks, whose acorns were a staple of 
ancient inhabitants of the area, said Tim Miller, regional manager. He said 
that the exact location of the site would be kept secret. "We don't want 
anybody knowing the location and going there to dig for bones," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The archeological findings are no surprise, said Macko, who is waiting for the 
monthlong specific soil analyses to come in. Soil samples could help determine 
diet, climate and other information, said Hurd. For instance, pollen could be 
found in soil taken from abdominal areas of the remains, indicating what season 
it was. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Aliso Creek is used so extensively for flood control drainage, much of 
its banks have been eroded and many of the bones were lost that way, Macko 
said. "It's unfortunate the erosion results in more damage like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Massey said he took care not to break the law in terms of disturbing the sites 
where he first found the remains. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that though he wouldn't want to see the remains disturbed for 
research, he regrets what won't be learned. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bones belong back in the ground," Massey said. "But the information 
belongs to everybody."

PLACENTIA POLICE TRADING CARDS COME IN SPANISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to reach more young people, the Police Department has introduced its 
second series of police trading cards in both English and Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20-card collection features photographs of police officers, civilian 
employees and support services on the front, with a brief description of their 
jobs on the back.Each card also includes a safety tip for children. 
</P>
<P>
 According to public information officer Corrine Loomis, the cards dovetail 
with the department's efforts toward community-oriented policing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make officers more accessible," Loomis said. "The cards put names 
to the faces and give kids an idea of what our jobs are." 
</P>
<P>
 Loomis said a previous 16-card collection was very popular but was printed 
only in English. The new series has all-new cards, with 100,000 printed in 
English and 20,000 in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 While most of the cards depict smiling police officers in a non-threatening 
setting, one shows the department's Contingency Action Team with guns and 
rifles drawn as they simulate busting into a warehouse. One officer wears a 
stocking-cap over his face, which Loomis said was necessary because he is an 
undercover officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning Feb. 21, the city's two DARE officers as well as patrol officers and 
those on a foot beat will carry the cards to distribute to children. The cards 
also will be available at police headquarters at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Each week for the next 20 weeks, a different card will be distributed. 
Children who collect a complete set can enter an essay contest on what the 
cards mean to them. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

POLICE SEEKING MAN WHO'S MADE DOZENS OF 'FANTASY' OBSCENE CALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As Valentine's Day approaches, the telephone pitch seems more plausible: The 
caller asks for the women by name, telling them he's been hired by their 
husbands or boyfriends, whose names he also knows, to take them on a "fantasy." 
</P>
<P>
 But after discussing breathing and relaxation techniques, the caller's 
conversations take a sexually explicit turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach police are attempting to identify the man, who has made about 50 
obscene phone calls to women in the area in the past year. They have released 
an audiocassette of the man's voice in an effort to apprehend him. Irvine 
police have received similar complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 The caller apparently gets the names of the women and men from membership 
rosters of civic groups operating in the Orange County area, according to 
Newport Beach Police Sgt. Andy Gonis. 
</P>
<P>
 Making an obscene phone call is a misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in 
jail and a $1,000 fine. Anyone with information regarding the man's identity is 
asked to call the Newport Beach Police Department at (714) 644-3717.

MAN FATALLY SHOT WHILE WALKING ON STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man was fatally shot Thursday night after an argument with two suspected 
gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleazar Urbieta, 31, and his girlfriend were walking in the 500 block of North 
Mortimer Street about 8:50 p.m. Thursday when the two men approached them, Lt. 
Bob Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman left her boyfriend to get their car and the two men argued with 
Urbieta, who also was believed to be a gang member, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several moments later, one of the men fired at least two shots at the victim's 
chest and ran away, Helton said. Witnesses told investigators the men appeared 
to be gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramedics rushed Urbieta to Western Medical Center-Santa Ana, where he died a 
half-hour later, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman told police she didn't know the assailants, but that Urbieta had 
appeared to know them.

SANTA ANA POLICE FIND COCAINE IN POMONA GARAGE; 4 HELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICIA DI RADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Ana police officers acting on a hunch arrested four men on suspicion of 
drug violations after about 823 pounds of cocaine worth about $7.8 million was 
found in a garage here, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police booked the four men, all from Mexicali, Mexico, into the Pomona city 
jail late Thursday, police reported.Each was being held on $5-million bail. 
</P>
<P>
 The men are Juan Baducuki Fernandez, 29; Guadalupe Higuera Haro, 32; Joselino 
Ojeda Camacho, 35, and Gustavo Angulo Camacho, 29, Santa Ana police Sgt. Gary 
Bruce said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce said Santa Ana police officers were investigating an unrelated case in 
East Los Angeles about 12:50 p.m. Thursday when they saw a suspicious-looking 
car beside them. Although there were only two adults and two children in the 
car, it looked as though it was being dragged down by other cargo, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on their expertise of narcotics investigations, a decision was made to 
terminate their existing investigation and follow the other car," Bruce said. 
"A pretty good hunch." 
</P>
<P>
 The investigators trailed the car to a Pomona home, where the car went into a 
garage, Bruce said. Officers stayed outside and watched. 
</P>
<P>
 About 5:15 p.m., the car came out of the garage "riding high," Bruce said, as 
though weight had been removed. Officers stopped the car and checked various 
passenger compartments, where they found more than 68 pounds of cocaine, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers then got a search warrant and raided the garage, where they 
allegedly found more than 754 more pounds of the drug, police said.

'BOY WONDER' YOUNT DREW A CROWD AT TAFT; BASEBALL: AFTER 20-YEAR CAREER WITH 
MILWAUKEE BREWERS, HE IS REMEMBERED ONE OF BEST EVER FROM THE VALLEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Area baseball coaches from the Robin Yount era at Taft High recalled fondly 
the one-time boy wonder who retired Friday from the Milwaukee Brewers after a 
20-year career that almost certainly will earn him a Hall of Fame plaque. 
</P>
<P>
 Yount, one of the best baseball players ever produced in the area, arrived in 
the major leagues as a baby-faced 18-year-old shortstop in 1974 and led the 
Brewers' charge to the World Series in 1982, where they lost to the St. Louis 
Cardinals in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
 When a shoulder injury relegated him to the outfield in 1985, Yount responded 
by becoming only the third player in major league history to win MVP awards at 
two positions -- shortstop in 1982 and center field in 1989. Hall of Famers 
Stan Musial and Hank Greenberg were the others. 
</P>
<P>
 The high school-aged Yount is remembered as a player with tremendous talent 
who regularly attracted throngs of scouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug MacKenzie, who coached the Canoga Park High baseball team for 37 seasons 
and is now the coach at Ribet Academy, has every score book from every season 
he coached. He reflected on the hard-fought games in Yount's junior and senior 
seasons in 1972-73 between Canoga Park and Taft in the West Valley League. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the games that was so impressive was at Lanark Park (Canoga Park's 
home field) his senior season," MacKenzie said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were 24 teams in the major leagues then and all 24 scouts were there. . 
. . Robin was three for four that day and had a home run and a triple, both to 
left-center field. That was pretty hard to do at Lanark Park because there was 
no fence." 
</P>
<P>
 The memory of numerous pro scouts at virtually every game during Yount's 
senior season sticks with Pierce College Coach Bob Lofrano, then an assistant 
at Chatsworth High. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played them at Taft one day and there were more scouts in the place than 
there were teams in the major leagues," Lofrano said. "Every team was sending 
two or three guys to look at Yount." 
</P>
<P>
 Yount and the late Don Drysdale, who played at Van Nuys High before becoming a 
Hall of Fame pitcher with the Dodgers, are probably the two best players to 
come out of the area, according to Lofrano. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had more of an impact than any other Valley players because of their 
success and their longevity," Lofrano said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brewers drafted Yount in June, 1973, and made him their shortstop the next 
season, when he was only 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Yount said he wants to pursue professional golf and auto racing in his 
retirement. Surprisingly, though, he said he won't miss the game of baseball, 
only its competitive nature. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what drove me the most," he said. "I really love competition. I'll 
miss the competition of it all. And I'll certainly miss the cheering crowds." 
</P>
<P>
 But having never played second string to anybody, Yount said he couldn't see 
himself as a reserve in 1994. Besides, he had considered calling it a career 
for several seasons because, he said, his four children needed a father more 
than he needed baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know the last few years, when I got between those lines and played the 
game, I cared just as much as I ever had," he said. "But I think your 
priorities change as you get older. And I think my off-season preparation 
suffered a little bit in the last few years." 
</P>
<P>
 Yount, 38, who helped bring Milwaukee its only American League pennant, 
finished his career with a .285 average and 3,142 hits, 13th on the career 
list. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no player in the first 25 years of this franchise who typifies this 
city, this state or this franchise like Robin Yount," Brewers' President Bud 
Selig said. "And so, while some will say that this is a sad day, I choose to 
think it's a day he has earned." 
</P>
<P>
 Yount suffered through one of his worst seasons last year, hitting .258 with 
eight home runs and 51 runs batted in following knee surgery April 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Yount played in 2,856 games for the Brewers -- 1,000 more than any other 
player. His best year was 1982, when he hit .331 with 29 homers and 114 runs 
batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 With Paul Molitor signing as a free agent with the Toronto Blue Jays last 
winter, the shy, soft-spoken Yount became the last remaining member of the 1982 
pennant-winning squad. 
</P>
<P>
 Yount, Molitor and infielder Jim Gantner played together for 15 seasons, 
longer than any trio in major league history. Gantner, who missed last season 
because of a shoulder injury and served as a part-time coach for the Brewers, 
also said Friday that his playing career is over. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to believe that many years went by that quickly," Gantner said. 
"It's going to be strange looking out in center field and not seeing No. 19." 
</P>
<P>
 But despite all of Yount's accomplishments in the major leagues, MacKenzie 
said, Yount remained unassuming and gracious. MacKenzie recalled visiting him 
during a trip to Milwaukee a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in Milwaukee on a trip with my family and he put us on his pass list 
(at County Stadium)," MacKenzie said. "I had a talk with him about our old 
rivalry." 
</P>

BURT STAYING UPBEAT IN WAKE OF DISASTER; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: NORTHRIDGE COACH 
EXPECTS GOOD CROP OF RECRUITS IN SPITE OF A DEVASTATED CAMPUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bob Burt does not have a plausible explanation. Then again, he hasn't paused 
long enough to consider one. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cal State Northridge football coach is immersed in his usual late-winter 
rock-turning routine, an annual ritual that finds the Matador coaching staff 
scattered about the state, looking for recruits the major Division I programs 
might have overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
 For cash-strapped Northridge, a member of the unheralded Division I-AA 
American West Conference, recruiting a new cast of football players always is a 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 This winter, there's a new twist: a university in partial ruins. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge campus, closed since the earthquake, resembles the world's 
largest trailer park. Where there once were large expanses of manicured lawn, 
makeshift temporary classrooms have been constructed. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Northridge coaches, most of whom are either in-season or in the middle 
of a key recruiting period, have been unable to do any more than visit their 
offices and quickly grab personal belongings. 
</P>
<P>
 Under these circumstances, the football team is attempting to rebuild after a 
4-6 season made noteworthy by its distractions. 
</P>
<P>
 Burt, therefore, would seem to have every excuse to fail. So why is this man 
smiling? 
</P>
<P>
 Simple: "It might take us three more weeks, but we may end up with a great 
recruiting class," Burt said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, when Northridge officially opens business for the spring semester, 
Burt expects to announce the enrollment of a four-year university transfer and 
as many as four junior college recruits.  
</P>
<P>
 Among those will be linebacker Albert Contreras of Valley College, who 
committed to Northridge on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Burt also expects others to commit to Northridge next summer after they earn 
their two-year college degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still finding a lot of good players who are interested," Burt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the earthquake shook things up, but it failed to alter the bottom line 
for a player with a choice of suitors. A typical recruit's first query, Burt 
said, still is "How much?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody knows we had an earthquake. What they want to know is how much 
(scholarship) money we have for them," Burt said. "That part hasn't changed." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge brought junior college recruits on campus for visits before the 
earthquake. Since then, Matador coaches have taken their search on the road, 
visiting players and coaches during the day and meeting at hotels at night to 
pore over film. 
</P>
<P>
 Recruits have until March 15 to sign letters of intent, and several of 
Northridge's prime targets still are available. Burt said he will not hesitate 
to bring players to Northridge for on-campus visits once school is in session. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will understand we're OK when they get here and see how quickly things 
are being put back together," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As to how he might handle the objection that the Northridge area is unsafe, 
Burt is sticking to what has become the party line among Matador coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "How often do major quakes hit the same place twice?" he said. "Northridge is 
probably the safest place in the country."

$1.1 million for the first nine months last year, is struggling to find 
investors even as it seeks federal approval to continue testing its 
defibrillator. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard K. Cooper, the company's president, acknowledged that Cardiac Science 
is out of cash and will need $5 million to get through the second phase of 
testing of the device, which delivers an electrical jolt automatically when it 
senses the onset of cardiac arrest. It completed the first phase in December, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper will continue as the only employee "with the possible part-time 
assistance of one or two administrative employees," according to a press 
release. Pay for those employees will be deferred. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, spun off from Cytocare Inc. in Irvine in 1991, wanted to begin 
selling stock to the public last fall through broker Rafi Khan's company, but 
that deal was aborted when Khan split with the brokerage. Khan is the dissident 
ICN shareholder who recently lost a long-waged bid to unseat ICN Chairman Milan 
Panic. Khan had Cooper on his proposed slate of new ICN directors.

DEVELOPER TO BUY 915 O.C. LOTS; REAL ESTATE: CENTEX OF DALLAS WILL PAY ABOUT 
$45 MILLION FOR THE FOOTHILL RANCH PROPERTY. IT IS THE BIGGEST SUCH DEAL SINCE 
'88. 
</P>

<P>
 In the largest Orange County real estate transaction since the 1980s, Texas 
developer Centex Corp. has agreed to buy 915 single-family home lots in the 
master-planned community of Foothill Ranch for about $45 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Centex, with $2.3 billion in revenue for the nine months ended Dec. 31, is the 
nation's largest home builder. It signed a letter of intent earlier this week 
to buy the property, barely edging out Kaufman & Broad, California's largest 
home builder. 
</P>
<P>
 Centex, which is based in Dallas, has small number of small home-building 
projects in San Clemente and Rancho Cucamonga, and bigger developments in 
Hemet, Lake Elsinore, Victorville and Highland. 
</P>
<P>
 The property is being sold by the financially troubled William Lyon Co. of 
Newport Beach, which bought 1,277 lots in the master-planned community in the 
late 1980s. The property is five miles northeast of the spot where the Santa 
Ana and San Diego freeways merge. Foothill Ranch plans call for 4,000 homes and 
8.5 million square feet of office, retail and industrial space. 
</P>
<P>
 Centex outbid not only Kaufman & Broad, which reportedly offered about $45 
million for the lots, but also J.M. Peters Co. of Newport Beach, which bid 
about $30 million. Centex officials would not disclose the exact purchase 
price. 
</P>
<P>
 Roland Osgood, president of Kaufman & Broad's Orange County division, said his 
firm bid about $45 million -- an indication that the Centex bid must have been 
only slightly higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Lots in Foothill Ranch reportedly went for $80,000 to $100,000 when William 
Lyon Co. bought the property at the peak of the market. Centex's purchase price 
would be about $50,000 a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyon Co., one of Southern California's largest home builders, ran into trouble 
in the early 1990s as slow home sales forced it to cut prices. That put the 
company behind on its own payments for land acquisition and construction loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyon has sold only 451 homes in its Foothill Ranch developments, or about a 
third of the houses it had planned to build, a spokesman for Foothill Ranch 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dougall Agan, a spokesman for Foothill Ranch, said the Centex deal will mean 
"more construction and more people moving in." Walmart, Target and Mervyn's are 
opening stores in the community later this year, and a 24-screen movie theater 
is planned. 
</P>
<P>
 The Centex deal is the largest sale of a single block of residential lots in 
Orange County since 1988, when Barratt American, the U.S. division of Britain's 
Barratt Homes, bought more than 700 plots from the Mission Viejo Co. Barratt 
later had financial troubles, and its lender took over 500 of the lots. 
</P>
<P>
 Centex's stock, traded on the New York Stock Exchange, closed at $42.88 a 
share Friday, down 75 cents.

BUENA PARK MARKET SUES UNIONS, RALPHS 
</P>

 A new supermarket offering discount prices has sued three unions, three locals 
and, in an odd twist, rival Ralphs Grocery Co., alleging illegal picketing as 
part of their efforts to organize the market's workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Super 1 Foods in Buena Park, which seeks $2.5 million in punitive damages, 
alleges that the unions and Ralphs illegally blocked entrances and exits, 
blocked deliveries, intimidated customers, directed "vile, profane, obscene and 
abusive language" at workers and urged patrons to shop at the Ralphs store a 
block away and other major supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 70 pickets, including a manager from the nearby Ralphs store, 
demonstrated at Super 1 on Feb. 4, said Carol J. Salgado, lawyer for the 
supermarket. The suit contends that Ralphs thereby joined union organizers in 
urging customers to shop at Ralphs or other major supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not true," said Steve Jinright, one of the managers at the nearby 
Ralphs. He would not elaborate, and corporate executives could not be reached 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit also seeks a court order halting mass picketing. The unions agreed in 
court on Wednesday not to conduct such demonstrations at least until after a 
Feb. 25 hearing in Orange County Superior Court, Salgado said. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants include the union attempting to organize Super 1 workers, the 
United Food and Commercial Workers International Union and three of its locals. 
Executives could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Mohammad Vazin, who owns the Super 1 Foods franchise, said pickets have been 
outside his store on Beach Boulevard since Feb. 1.

DANCE REVIEWS; SAN FRANCISCO BALLET SERVES UP 'GUMBO'; THE WORK, BY A RESPECTED 
UC IRVINE PROFESSOR, IS PLEASANT IF RATHER SIMPLISTIC IN ITS SUPPORT OF THE 
SUPERIORITY OF NATURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The first program this week by the San Francisco Ballet concentrated on 
plotless musical visualizations. The second, which included the world premiere 
of Donald McKayle's "Gumbo Ya-Ya," Thursday at the War Memorial Opera House, 
was devoted to rituals of community. 
</P>
<P>
 The actual world premiere of "Gumbo" (which means: everybody talk at once) was 
supposed to have happened at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in 
Washington, which commissioned the work by the respected modern dance 
choreographer, a professor of dance at UC Irvine and a Tony Award nominee. But 
a strike there prevented that from happening. The Kennedy Center would prefer 
that the world regard the San Francisco performance as a mere preview, but a 
premiere is a premiere is a premiere. Washington will see it in May. 
</P>
<P>
 In comparison to David Bintley's gesture-obsessed "The 'Wanderer' Fantasy" and 
Redha's fetishistic "La Pavane Rouge," which bracketed it on the program, 
McKayle's "Gumbo" was sweet and easy to accept, if rather simplistically 
feel-good and didactic. 
</P>
<P>
 The message is that humankind in a state of nature is more authentic and free 
and blissfully, harmoniously happy than when living in an urban environment, 
among skyscrapers that suggest the Big Apple. Ah, no argument there. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of things helped to make this Romantic vision palatable. A. Christina 
Giannini's colorful slinky costumes and stylized scenic designs evoked no 
specific time or place or ethnic group, and so the three-part ballet 
("Gathering," "Safe Harbor" and "Migration") unfolded as a kind of parable or 
fairy tale. No real history had to intrude. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, McKayle crafted kinetic, evocative movements that suited his varying 
purposes deftly, if not with great depth. He made the company look springy, 
versatile and alert. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, Yuri Zhukov brought charisma to the role of the shaman figure; 
Eric Hoisington and Muriel Maffre danced the convoluted central pas de deux 
skillfully. 
</P>
<P>
 Flutist James Newton, who also teaches at UCI, composed the original taped 
score, which contained generalized, moody washes of sound punctuated by drum 
beats, bird calls and his own flute solos. 
</P>
<P>
 Bintley's decorative " 'Wanderer' Fantasy" looked like at least 33 ways of 
holding one arm in the air, until it became a kind of salute or statement of 
membership in a group. The gesture perhaps deserves near-permanent retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael McGraw was the fluent piano soloist. Emil de Cou conducted the Liszt 
orchestration of Schubert's piano original in primary colors. 
</P>
<P>
 Redha's seemingly endless "Pavane Rouge" (to a taped collage) had something to 
do with ritual ceremony, social relations and sex among a community of red- and 
black-clad figures sometimes holding black umbrellas who spend their lives 
wandering to quasi-religious music amid five Corinthian-crowned pillars. 
</P>
<P>
 It showed the company at its youthfully alluring best and proved the dancers 
could arch their backs and maintain clear shapes until the cows come home. But 
the pretentiousness of the dance was risible.

SHORTY ROGERS AND THE OLD GANG; JAZZ: IT WILL BE A HOMECOMING OF SORTS WHEN THE 
HORN PLAYER CONDUCTS THE STAN KENTON ALUMNI ORCHESTRA FOR THE SEVENTH TRIBUTE 
TO THE LATE BANDLEADER SUNDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Shorty Rogers remembers the exact day he joined the Stan Kenton Orchestra: 
Jan. 2, 1950. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was at the time when Stan first put together the Innovations orchestra," 
the 69-year-old trumpeter-fluegelhornist said recently from his home in Marina 
del Rey, "the group with strings and French horns. It was as if this wonderful 
blank canvas had just been handed to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers went on to gain fame as a composer-arranger, not only for Kenton but as 
a figure on the Hollywood studio scene, contributing to the scores of "The Wild 
One" and "The Man With the Golden Arm" among many others. 
</P>
<P>
 So it will be a fitting homecoming Sunday at the Irvine Marriott when Rogers 
steps up to conduct the 18-piece Stan Kenton Alumni Orchestra for the seventh 
annual tribute to the late bandleader. Also on hand will be two men 
instrumental in getting Rogers into the Kenton ensemble: trumpeter Buddy 
Childers and fellow composer-arranger Pete Rugolo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had just come off of (orchestra leader Woody Herman's) band with Buddy and 
Shelly Manne, and they had been invited to join Stan before I was. And Pete and 
Buddy went to Stan -- they knew he was looking for somebody who could write -- 
and said, 'Look, you've got to get this guy into the band.' And, of course, 
Stan listened to them." 
</P>
<P>
 It was an unselfish act for Rugolo, who joined Kenton in 1946 as an arranger, 
to recommend his fellow writer. But it's for this reason that the Kenton 
Orchestra was so important to the evolution of the music. 
</P>
<P>
 It provided a vehicle not only for great instrumental soloists to prove 
themselves, but for writers. Among those who honed their talents with Kenton 
were Rugolo, Rogers, Gerry Mulligan and Bill Holman. Of Kenton's various 
ensembles, the 40-piece Innovations Orchestra was the most ambitious. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a great, great experience to be involved in," Rogers said, adding that 
the first thing he ever wrote that included strings was for the Innovations 
band. "Stan had a practice of naming tunes after the featured soloist. There 
was an album with several tunes named after people, like 'Shelly Manne,' which 
Stan wrote, and 'Maynard Ferguson,' that I wrote. So this one was called 'Art 
Pepper' (after the saxophonist). It had a varied tempo, starts out as a ballad, 
then moves into a jazz thing followed by a kind of interlude, then reverts to a 
ballad as it goes out. It was my favorite thing that I wrote for the band." 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers left the band as a player in 1951 but continued to write for Kenton. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would call me up and give me a scenario and say, 'See what you can do with 
this situation.' And I'd come up with something and mail it to them, or if the 
band was in town I'd go to the rehearsal. I did that for quite a while, well 
into the late '50s." 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers was with Herman's band when he met Rugolo. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were playing at Birdland in New York, and it was during the time that I 
had started doing a bit of arranging for the band. And Woody would just 
announce a tune, and the band would play it. It just wasn't the thing to 
announce who wrote the arrangement or give that credit out. So Pete came up 
during the break and asked who did the writing on this or that piece. And I 
said, 'I did.' And later on, he spoke on my behalf to Kenton." 
</P>
<P>
 Rugolo, who will make a guest appearance as conductor at Sunday's concert, 
also went on to compose for films and television. After leaving Kenton's 
employ, he became musical director at Capitol Records and was responsible for 
putting together, among others, Miles Davis' groundbreaking "Birth of the Cool" 
session for the label in 1949. He also produced sessions for June Christy and 
the Four Freshmen (the current edition of the Freshmen will also be on hand at 
Sunday's tribute). 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Rugolo and Rogers have remained good friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the same great guy that he was when we first met," Rogers said. "We talk 
every few months, often when something comes up involving Kenton." 
</P>
<P>
 The concert's other honoree, composer Bobby Troup, who wrote, among other 
songs, the classic road anthem "Route 66," was also a Rogers associate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bobby wrote so many great pop hits, but his first love was jazz. It was one 
of the great ingredients in his songwriting. He had a television show in the 
'50s ("The Stars of Jazz") that I was on a couple times. And I used to see him 
around Los Angeles. He worked all the clubs; that was his main activity then, 
and he played with a lot of the people that I worked with, like 
(bassist-trombonist) Bob Enevoldsen and (drummer) Jack Sperling. You know how 
it is on the coast: You only see guys when you work with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers' own career continues full bore in the present. 
</P>
<P>
 He was recently interviewed for 10 hours by Herb Wong for a Smithsonian 
Institution project on the history of West Coast jazz, and Rogers will be the 
honoree at this year's New York Brass Conference in April. 
</P>
<P>
 His involvement with the Lighthouse All Stars, an ensemble he leads with alto 
saxophonist Bud Shank, continues, though at an interrupted pace. 
</P>
<P>
 "The band is kind of a question mark now," he explained. "The economy hit us 
hard. We're kind of an elephant in size. Here's this group with eight big 
names, eight leaders, that demand eight leaders' salaries. It would be easier 
if we were a quartet. But we're here on the bench, ready to play when the coach 
calls." 
</P>
<P>
 And Rogers, respected as a trumpeter when he first broke on the scene, now 
works mainly on fluegelhorn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," he said with a laugh, "I'm still in pursuit of the perfect note." 
</P>
<P>
 * The seventh annual Tribute to Stan Kenton with the Stan Kenton Alumni 
Orchestra and the Four Freshmen is at 6 p.m. Sunday, at the Rendezvous 
Ballroom, Irvine Marriott hotel, 18000 Von Karman Ave., Irvine, (714) 553-9449. 
Tickets: $25 at the door.

UNABLE TO MEET RENT, RHYTHM CAFE CLOSES FOR GOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rhythm Cafe has lost its lease, ending its former operator's hopes of 
reviving the well-appointed, once-promising concert club in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Feder, the Cafe's operator during a high-profile but brief run in 
1992-93, had been trying to find investors who would back the 550-capacity 
club's return. But the Cafe's landlord was not about to wait any longer as 
rents went unpaid, and Feder's company, Musicsphere Entertainment, was evicted 
from the Cafe building at 3503 S. Harbor Blvd. on Feb. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrett W. McInerney, lawyer for the landlord, Santa Ana Harbor Real Estate, 
said that the eviction suit, filed in November, was settled the day before it 
was to go to trial in Orange County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 McInerney said that Feder agreed to give up Musicsphere's lease on the 
property. Musicsphere owes $69,738 in rent, McInerney said. Its lease called 
for a monthly rent of $8,500, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 Feder's lawyer, Ronald Appel, said that Feder, Musicsphere's vice president, 
is not personally liable for the back rent. 
</P>
<P>
 Before its incarnation as the Rhythm Cafe, the building housed a short-lived 
concert club called Hamptons and was also the site of the Harlequin Dinner 
Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 McInerney said that the building's Los Angeles-based owner will seek a new 
tenant. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've heard all sorts of plans, from a concert hall to a burlesque house," he 
said. "It's a nice facility, but someone's going to have to put some money into 
it. If the (economy) was a little bit better, I'm sure people would be leaping 
at it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rhythm Cafe succeeded in booking such high-profile names as B.B. King, the 
Neville Brothers and Los Lobos in a brief run from late October, 1992, to 
mid-March, 1993. But it ran into stiff competition from the better-established 
Coach House in San Juan Capistrano. Mounting losses prompted Curt Olson, a 
Newport Beach developer who was the Cafe's financial backer, to pull out, 
effectively shutting the club down. 
</P>
<P>
 His partner, Feder, who had overseen day-to-day operations, spent the rest of 
1993 seeking new investors. The Cafe reopened inDecember for one-shot concerts 
by hard-rock bands Tool and the Melvins. 
</P>
<P>
 Various promoters, including the major Los Angeles company Goldenvoice, 
expressed interest in running further shows. But by then, the landlord's 
eviction suit was moving forward, and Feder was unable to line up the financing 
needed to pay off the Cafe's debt and re-establish it as an ongoing business.

EX-BOGART'S BOOKER TO STAGE FOOTHILL SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steve Zepeda, respected for his work as the concert booker at Bogart's, will 
promote his first show since the Long Beach club closed in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Zepeda, with co-promoter Bill Hardie, will stage a show by the Texas 
rockabilly-punk band, the Rev. Horton Heat, on Feb. 20 at the Foothill in Long 
Beach.Also appearing are Flat Duo Jets and Russell Scott & the Red Hots. 
</P>
<P>
 Zepeda said he initially had hoped to use the Rhythm Cafe for the date but 
turned to the Foothill, 1922 Cherry Ave., when it became apparent that the Cafe 
would not reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he may do additional shows at the 500-capacity Foothill, "depending on 
how this one goes." Like Bogart's, the Foothill admits only concert-goers who 
are of drinking age. 
</P>
<P>
 Zepeda's first choice would be a position such as the one he had at Bogart's, 
in which he was a full-time, in-house booker whose job was to bring in a steady 
flow of local and touring bands. 
</P>
<P>
 In talks with local clubs, he said, "I haven't found anyone who's serious 
about that yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets for the Rev. Horton Heat show are $12 through Ticketmaster, $13 at the 
door. (714) 740-2000 for advance orders, or (310) 984-8349 for show 
information.

ALL WORK AND ALL PLAY; REST? CELLIST MSTISLAV ROSTROPOVICH DOESN'T KNOW THE 
MEANING OF THE WORD; JUST LOOK AT HIS CALENDAR FOR THE NEXT 3 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 If Mstislav Rostropovich has always been seen as larger than life, the same 
can be said about his calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 The celebrated cellist, who for three decades has shown he can also conduct, 
will soon step down from the helm of the National Symphony Orchestra in 
Washington. Retiring from a post he's held for 17 years would presumably allow 
him breathing room after a lifetime of concerts and recordings. That's if he 
wanted breathing space. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently he does not. 
</P>
<P>
 "June 16 and 17 are my last two days with the orchestra. But not in life, I 
hope," Rostropovich said from his office at the Kennedy Center. He performs a 
recital tonight at the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts. "Every day 
until my 70th birthday -- on March 27, 1997 -- is booked. For three years, 
every day, 9 to 4, 9 to 5, 9 to 6." 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't include nights, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 At Cerritos, he has scheduled an imposing program: Richard Strauss' Sonata for 
Cello and Piano, Opus 6; Bach's Suite for Unaccompanied Cello in C Minor; 
Debussy's First Sonata for Cello and Piano, and the West Coast premiere of 
Alfred Schnittke's Epilogue from "Peer Gynt," for cello, electronic tape and 
piano. Lambert Orkis will serve as pianist. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking ahead, his three-year-at-a-glance calendar reveals six operas, three 
of which are new: In May, he leads "Lygeia," based on the life of Edgar Allan 
Poe, by U.S. composer Augusta Read Thomas, at the International Festival of 
Evian in France (he's festival president); in December, "Lolita," by Russian 
composer Rodion Shchedrin with the Stockholm Opera, and next year, "Gesualdo" 
by Schnittke with the Vienna State Opera. 
</P>
<P>
 He'll also conduct Musorgsky's "Khovanshchina" in Moscow, Shostakovich's "Lady 
Macbeth of Mtsensk" in St. Petersburg and Benjamin Britten's "Peter Grimes" in 
Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is only six operas, but (there are) also seven compositions for cello 
premiere," he said, reeling off a list that included a concerto for flute, 
oboe, cello and piano by the late Olivier Messiaen. "And in between, I play 
normally. I will not stop my normal (performing) activities." 
</P>
<P>
 An innocent request for background materials on Rostropovich elicited a 
17-page fax, all single-spaced: 11 pages dedicated to his discography (more 
than 100 recordings), three to premieres (well more than 100), and three to 
awards, doctorates and honorary citizenships. 
</P>
<P>
 As a prerequisite to granting an interview, Rostropovich declined to address 
questions about politics, preferring instead to discuss music. 
</P>
<P>
 But one thinks of Bach and religion, Beethoven and the French Revolution. Can 
artistic expression ever be completely divorced from social, religious or 
political concerns? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know all that in general, but I know about my life, and for me that 
is impossible," he admitted. "I ask now that we not discuss politics only 
because so many people comment about that. Let me say only that I'm still very 
optimistic about my country, very optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
 He was anything but optimistic 20 years ago, when Rostropovich -- born in 
Baku, an Azerbaijani city on the Caspian Sea -- departed the former Soviet 
Union after sheltering dissident author Alexander Solzhenitsyn and writing an 
open letter to Leonid Brezhnev protesting Soviet restrictions on cultural 
freedom. Concerts, recording projects and tours for both Rostropovich and his 
wife, soprano Galina Vishnevskaya, had been canceled; they became 
"non-persons." Though granted exit visas, they were eventually stripped of 
their citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Rostropovich performed at the Berlin Wall two days after its 
destruction. In 1990, the Soviet Legislature restored his citizenship and all 
medals and honorary titles. His July, 1991, concert in Prague fulfilled a 1968 
promise to play when the last Soviet soldier left Czechoslovakia. The next 
month, without a visa and at great personal danger, he flew to Moscow to stand 
beside Boris N. Yeltsin following the coup that deposed Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, 1993, before a Red Square crowd of 100,000 -- far larger than 
any that gathered during the concurrent political crisis in which Yeltsin, who 
attended the concert, disbanded Parliament -- Rostropovich led the National 
Symphony in works by Prokofiev and Tchaikovsky. (When cannons exploded in the 
"1812 Overture," several people reportedly shouted, "A coup!") Ignat 
Solzhenitsyn, the dissident's 20-year-old son, was piano soloist for the 
two-week tour, but did not play on the brief Red Square program. 
</P>
<P>
 As important to Rostropovich, in any case, as his political activities vis a 
vis his homeland, are his efforts on behalf of the Vishnevskaya Rostropovich 
Foundation. Named for his wife, the foundation created, and funds, the 
Moscow-based Children's Healthcare Network to modernize two hospitals in Moscow 
and St. Petersburg. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like that your grandchildren have healthy grandchildren," he said. 
"Each third child born in Moscow has some genetic damage. Each third child!  
</P>
<P>
 "That's 70 years of the Communist regime, a disastrous situation for ecology. 
Not only Chernobyl -- there are so many catastrophes, and many more powerful. 
In 1957, there was an atomic explosion 20 times more powerful than Chernobyl, 
exactly in the center of Russia." 
</P>
<P>
 Extra-musical issues having been dispatched, Rostropovich ("Slava" to even the 
most casual acquaintances) seemed thrilled to focus instead on his recital, and 
especially on Schnittke, who in recent years has taken a firm place in the 
Russian pantheon of composers. "Epilogue" is a special arrangement for the 
cellist of a ballet originally scored for orchestra; though a single movement, 
it runs more than half an hour, and Rostropovich likened it to a cello 
concerto. 
</P>
<P>
 He obviously feels Schnittke's acclaim is deserved. 
</P>
<P>
 "After my friends -- the composers that enriched my life, Prokofiev, Benjamin 
Britten -- died, I had not found a musical figure who continues for me my 
contact (with) composers," he reflected. "In comes Schnittke in my life, so now 
I make performances, several world premieres, of his compositions." 
</P>
<P>
 Rostropovich also talked about Bach's six suites for cello alone, a pinnacle 
of the cello repertory. 
</P>
<P>
 "All my life I work on these suites," he said. "Two years ago, but not yet on 
the market, I finished my first recording of all the suites in audio and video, 
a monumental work in my life. Five weeks, each day and each night, I make this 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bach is so great that in one's life you come back many times. This time, I 
again revised my opinions. I have become more intelligent where Bach is 
concerned, and some things change in interpretation. This time, too, I study 
the manuscript more precisely, more carefully. Even now I change my bowings." 
</P>

NOT JUST SKATING BY; DANCE: SECURITY ELUDES THE LAR LUBOVITCH COMPANY, BUT 
AFTER 25 YEARS, ITS DIRECTOR IS STILL MAKING STRIDES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even as his troupe is celebrating its 25th anniversary season, choreographer 
Lar Lubovitch finds that a dance company's security remains an elusive thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this business, the wolf is always at the door," said Lubovitch, reached by 
phone in Montreal, where he is choreographing an ice-skating version of Gustav 
Holst's "The Planets" for Canadian television. "For 25 years, we're always on 
the verge of folding." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County fans of the Lar Lubovitch Dance Company needn't fret. The troupe 
will dance as scheduled tonight and Sunday at the Irvine Barclay Theatre. The 
anniversary season began in Virginia in October, swings through Europe in May 
and ends in South America in September. 
</P>
<P>
 While finances may always be a concern, Lubovitch strives to keep artistic 
standards high. 
</P>
<P>
 "One just makes a commitment to integrity. I've maintained my obsession with 
creating dance, and I continue to stretch myself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The eclectic program in Irvine features "Four Ragtime Dances," with music by 
Charles Ives; "Fandango," to Ravel's "Bolero"; "Marimba," choreographed in the 
1970s to music by Steve Reich, and "Waiting for the Sunrise," to five songs by 
Les Paul and Mary Ford and three by Johnny Puleo and his Harmonica Gang. 
</P>
<P>
 And on Feb. 19 at UCLA, the agenda includes "Concerto Six Twenty-Two," set to 
Mozart's Clarinet Concerto and featuring a controversial central duet for two 
men. Many have found in the duet a metaphor for the AIDS epidemic; Lubovitch 
has maintained that the pas de deux is simply a reflection on friendship and 
dignity, though he recognizes that both are powerful AIDS crisis themes. 
</P>
<P>
 Lubovitch's choreography has been described in these pages as "vivacious . . . 
full-throttled," elsewhere as "vibrant," and his troupe "high-octane." 
</P>
<P>
 In conversation the man himself seemed precisely the opposite: decidedly 
quiet, even terse. The fact that his only opportunity to talk was at 10 p.m., 
at the end of a 12-hour work day, was apparently of little consequence. 
</P>
<P>
 "In general he's pretty shy, relatively reticent, a very private person," 
concurred Dick Caples, the company's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 However unassuming, the Manhattan-based Lubovitch has choreographed more than 
50 works for his company; many of those pieces also show up in the repertories 
of companies such as the New York City Ballet, Paris Opera Ballet and Royal 
Danish Ballet. "Waiting for the Sunrise" (1992) was commissioned in part by 
Mikhail Baryshnikov's White Oak Dance Project. 
</P>
<P>
 Lubovitch was born in Chicago in 1943. He didn't pursue dance seriously until 
seeing Jose Limon's modern-dance troupe his freshman year at the University of 
Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
 The next summer he took dance classes with Limon and Alvin Ailey and soon 
attended the Juilliard School, where his teachers included Antony Tudor. He 
danced with numerous modern, ballet, jazz and ethnic companies -- supplementing 
his income with such jobs as waiter, carpenter and go-go dancer -- before 
forming his own troupe. 
</P>
<P>
 He expanded his horizons, and those of ice skating, by choreographing dances 
for such Olympic gold medalists as Peggy Fleming and Dorothy Hamill. 
</P>
<P>
 On Broadway, Lubovitch received a Tony nomination for his staging of "Into the 
Woods" and choreographed Salome's "Dance of the Seven Veils" in the production 
with Al Pacino and Sheryl Lee. Most recently he created the dances for "The Red 
Shoes." 
</P>
<P>
 "His choreography (for 'The Red Shoes') was universally acclaimed," Caples 
said. "Unfortunately, the show was otherwise a flop, a big flop." But the year 
may yield a silver lining: Lubovitch has agreed to set "The Red Shoes" ballet 
for American Ballet Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Lubovitch, his methods remain relatively constant whether the 
inspiration is Mozart or the Harmonica Gang. 
</P>
<P>
 "Improvisation, movement, discovery. . . . When I'm working I'm trying to 
discover the movement that is meant to be. I don't mean that in any magical or 
extrasensory way; I just mean to discover the movement that seems inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I get it right, there are no wasted steps. And every piece is a step in 
that direction." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Lar Lubovitch Dance Company performs "Four Ragtime Dance," "Fandango," 
"Marimba" and "Waiting for the Sunrise" tonight at 8 p.m. at the Irvine Barclay 
Theatre, 4242 Campus Drive, Irvine. Also Sunday at 3 p.m. $25. (714) 854-4646 
or (714) 740-2000 (Ticketmaster).

STATE PULLS LATIN GROUP'S HEAD START FUNDING; FINANCES: ASSOCIATION WILL LOSE 
$600,000 GRANT DESPITE REORGANIZATION, AND WILL BE BARRED FROM OPENING NEW 
CLASSROOMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Latin American Civic Assn., which last year went through a radical 
reorganization to salvage funding for its Head Start programs after regulators 
discovered widespread mismanagement, once again faces a loss of financial 
support because it has not improved enough, government officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Education has decided not to renew a nearly $600,000 
grant that paid for services for 257 preschool children in the San Fernando and 
Santa Clarita valleys. The Los Angeles County Office of Education -- which 
contracts with LACA to run the federally funded Head Start program -- also will 
exclude the agency from the list of groups that may open new classrooms after 
July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state took a chance renewing them last year, but they were no better off 
nine months later," said Mario Muniz, an administrator with the state 
Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Kennedy, the county Office of Education's senior project director for 
Head Start, told LACA in a letter that the agency's service area is being 
reduced to give it an opportunity to remedy all its past problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Irene Tovar, a founding member of LACA who took over the executive 
directorship last year as part of the reorganization, said she was "really 
shocked" by what she called the "double whammy" of the state and county cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 LACA, the sole agency in the two valleys providing meals, instruction and 
health services to mostly poor preschool children since Head Start was created 
in 1965, is not accused of any new mismanagement. Rather, both the state and 
county decisions are based on the agency not moving quickly enough to correct 
those past problems, including repayment of $100,000 in 1991-92 expenditures 
that were found to be in violation of federal guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 "What else did we have to do, bleed?" Tovar said in frustration. "We are being 
punished for something the previous administration did. Here we are like fools 
trying to clean up this mess and then for this to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 LACA is not expected to have to close down as a result of the cuts because it 
will be allowed to reapply for county funds for its current 1,332 slots, and 
county education officials say the agency is likely to receive that support. 
But LACA will no longer have a monopoly on Head Start in the San Fernando 
Valley because another agency will be brought in to open new classrooms as part 
of the county's expansion plans. 
</P>
<P>
 State and county officials say that children currently in LACA's Head Start 
programs will not be affected by the cuts because other agencies can include 
them in their programs. And they said some LACA employees who lose their jobs 
because of the cuts probably will be hired by the new agency. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tovar says that it is bound to be disruptive for children if an outside 
agency takes over services in areas that her organization has served for nearly 
30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to take them a while to set up programs," she said. "Teachers and 
sites have to be licensed (by the state) and they are going to have to be able 
to deal with children who are predominantly Latino, and many who only speak 
Spanish." 
</P>
<P>
 Problems with LACA first were uncovered in the summer of 1992. County 
inspectors, responding to complaints from parents and staff, found that LACA 
had violated federal regulations by renting office space and vans from its own 
employees, overpaying staff members and engaging in nepotism in hiring and 
contracting for services and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Last February, the county Office of Education stripped the agency of its $5.3 
million in annual funding, saying LACA was riddled with problems, including a 
projected budget shortfall of $850,000, and $100,000 in expenditures from the 
preceding year that were not approved. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, LACA totally reorganized. Longtime Executive Director Ralph 
Arriola -- who was tied in with much of the mismanagement by the county Office 
of Education -- resigned under pressure and was replaced last May by Tovar, a 
longtime community activist who helped found LACA in 1965. Most of the members 
of the board of directors also resigned, and were replaced with other founding 
members of LACA. 
</P>
<P>
 To make up for the projected budget shortfall, LACA laid off more than 40 
employees -- most of them administrators -- in the last two months of the 
fiscal year, which ended in June. The agency also promised to develop a plan to 
repay the $100,000 in disallowed expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, county officials reconsidered their earlier decision, and restored the 
funding for 1993-94. State officials also renewed their $600,000 state grant on 
the condition that LACA submit certain documents in a timely manner. 
</P>
<P>
 But late last year, state education officials notified LACA that they would 
not renew the state grant for 1994-95 because the agency had not met a Nov. 15 
deadline to file a new budget proposal, a deficit reduction plan and an audit 
of expenditures with the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did not meet any of these requirements," said Muniz, regional 
administrator for the Preschool Program/Child Development division of the state 
Department of Education. Without those documents, Muniz said, "We had no sense 
of where the organization was." 
</P>
<P>
 Muniz said LACA will not be eligible to seek new funding for three years. He 
added that the state already has begun looking for another agency to take over 
the programs. Muniz said the state is seeking a locally headquartered agency to 
avoid a disruptive transition. He said the contract should be awarded by 
mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a personal tragedy," Muniz said. "We were all rooting for the agency. 
Unfortunately, somewhere along the line, someone dropped the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 In her defense, Tovar said she missed the state's deadline by more than a 
month because she believed the agency's accountant had obtained an extension. 
She produced a letter from the accountant in which he requested an extension, 
however she acknowledged that the state never granted it. 
</P>
<P>
 But regardless of any missed deadlines, Tovar maintains that the state should 
have been more flexible. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state acted on form rather than on substance," she said. "We are on the 
road to making things happen, but the state cut these children off. (State 
officials) are so removed from reality. They have no idea what is going on." 
</P>
<P>
 LACA is expected to be funded by the county Office of Education for 1994-95 at 
a level that will support its 1,332 children, but the number of communities it 
serves may gradually dwindle because it will not be allowed to replace students 
that leave the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The county Office of Education "recognizes the fact that the present 
administration of Latin American Civic Assn. is committed to serving children 
and their families," said Kennedy in his letter to LACA. "However, due to the 
mismanagement of the previous administration, LACA needs time to heal itself 
and bring the Head Start program into compliance with the federal regulations." 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy said in his letter that LACA will only be allowed to expand when it 
"can demonstrate fiscal and administrative responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, LACA will be given "guest" status in several areas where it 
has run programs for years, including Van Nuys, Tujunga, Sun Valley and North 
Hollywood. Guest status means that no new children will be allowed to enroll in 
those areas, and LACA must close down classrooms when building leases expire. 
At least 20 classrooms that serve a total of 300 children could be affected, 
Tovar said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, county education officials have told LACA that it will have to 
close two of its six classes in Van Nuys before opening an already approved 
classroom at the Blythe Street Housing Project. Children who would have been 
served by the two closed classes instead will be served by a new agency, county 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tovar said that had she known LACA was going to be prevented from maintaining 
its existing programs, she would not have spent thousands of dollars this past 
year to improve some of the existing sites and vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 The county Office of Education "is not being fair," Tovar said. "We accepted 
the condition of not being able to expand to other areas, but we are concerned 
that we are being made guests in our own areas."

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; CITY WORKING OVERTIME TO AID CRIPPLED 
BUSINESSES; SANTA CLARITA: WITH DAMAGE WIDESPREAD, OFFICIALS TRY TO CUT RED 
TAPE AND PROVIDE REBUILDING HELP. OTHER AREAS ARE TRYING TO LURE AWAY FIRMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Before the Jan. 17 quake, city leaders had focused on attracting new employers 
to what was billed as a scenic community with clean air, little crime, neatly 
planned neighborhoods and easy freeway connections to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, with those highways shattered and the valleywide damage approaching 
$300 million, Santa Clarita has shifted gears. The 6-year-old city is now 
hustling to hang on to the businesses it already has. 
</P>
<P>
 To ease the financial burden on residents and business owners who must 
reconstruct or repair damaged buildings, the City Council also waived permit 
and inspection fees for such projects, which is expected to save the private 
sector up to $1.5 million. Expenses are expected to be reimbursed by the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The city also held a town hall meeting to tell business owners about 
disaster-relief programs. The city applied for a $125,000 state grant to set up 
an assistance center for businesses with long-term problems related to the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the assistance the city may be offering, some businesses may not 
recover until life, particularly the city's fragile road network, returns to 
normal. Meanwhile, Antelope Valley leaders hope to lure away some businesses 
that can no longer find space in Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 Among city staff members who changed course after the quake is Mike Haviland, 
the city's economic development director. Previously, Haviland spent most of 
his time luring restaurants, manufacturing plants and other businesses to town. 
Now, he tries to cut red tape and provide other help for business owners who 
must rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 "I literally abandoned the attraction program," he said. "We went into the 
hand-holding stage. If you don't get out there and work with people, you're 
going to lose them." 
</P>
<P>
 The efforts may already be paying off. 
</P>
<P>
 Marjorie Weaver said the city acted swiftly to soothe her quake-rattled nerves 
and ease her and her staff back into their office building, which had been 
badly shaken but was not structurally damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so nervous and scared when I saw the drywall down and the equipment all 
over the place," said Weaver, who manages 20 employees at a Valencia 
distribution firm. "Nobody wanted to go in there." 
</P>
<P>
 She said Haviland showed up the next day with a building inspector. 
</P>
<P>
 "He helped us a lot by just walking us through the whole building telling us 
what was wrong -- and what wasn't," she said. "It wasn't just a onetime thing. 
It seemed like after every aftershock, he dropped by just to check on things." 
</P>
<P>
 It was still uncertain last week whether Santa Clarita will lose Adrea Nairne. 
She was just getting her Valencia manicure-supply business off the ground last 
month when the ground gave way. 
</P>
<P>
 Half a dozen national sales representatives, who had checked into a Santa 
Clarita hotel to learn about her products, were tossed out of bed by the Jan. 
17 earthquake -- and quickly left town. 
</P>
<P>
 The headquarters Nairne had rented last November cracked, and much of her 
merchandise was damaged or destroyed. Her phone system went out, cutting her 
off from customers. Then, just as her business was getting back on track, rain 
began leaking in, damaging more stock and furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have you ever heard the expression, 'I'm being pecked to death by ducks'?" 
Nairne asked. "That's the way we're beginning to feel." 
</P>
<P>
 To cover her losses, Nairne is applying for a $30,000 low-interest disaster 
loan. If she gets it, she'll have to decide whether to rebuild in battered 
Santa Clarita or relocate to Nevada, where expenses are lower -- and another 
quake is unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 As the earth settles down, civic leaders in the Santa Clarita and Antelope 
Valley are grimly assessing the quake's impact on business people like Nairne. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the earthquake, about 6% to 7% of Santa Clarita's office space was 
vacant, said Tony Matthess, who runs a local commercial real estate business. 
Because so many businesses had to relocate after the quake, the surplus has 
vanished. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Matthess said, it is virtually impossible to find vacant office space 
in Santa Clarita. "We've had so many callers we had to turn away," he said. "We 
didn't know where they could go." 
</P>
<P>
 Business owners in the Antelope Valley, about 30 miles north, are hoping to 
attract some of these displaced tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 In Palmdale and Lancaster, which came through the quake without damage, local 
business groups are preparing to market the high desert's large supply of new, 
relatively affordable offices -- and homes -- to the owners of quake-damaged 
structures to the south. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just promoting all of the good things about the Antelope Valley," said 
Kimberly Maevers, administrator of the Antelope Valley chapter of the Building 
Industry Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 For Lancaster and Palmdale, the earthquake's most serious blow was the damage 
to the Antelope Valley Freeway, the concrete lifeline that connects commuters 
and businesses with the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 To address this, city leaders are encouraging motorists to car-pool, take a 
bus, ride the new Metrolink trains or "telecommute" via computers and telephone 
connections. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Clarita, city officials had to cope with far more than traffic 
problems. Hundreds of houses and commercial structures in the city of 130,000 
were labeled uninhabitable or open only with limited access. 
</P>
<P>
 City Hall itself was branded unsafe, forcing officials to move into a vacant 
industrial building owned by a submarine parts manufacturer. The Santa Clarita 
Valley Chamber of Commerce, which also found itself homeless, set up shop in a 
local Southern California Edison conference room. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is certainly the worst disaster this young city has faced," said City 
Manager George Caravalho. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the city's new assistance programs could not rescue every injured 
business, particularly those that depend on access to crippled freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 The closure of the Calgrove Boulevard exit along the Golden State Freeway has 
cost the nearby Carrows restaurant at least a quarter of its business and has 
forced layoffs, said manager Scott Postel. "It's really taken a toll," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 City spokeswoman Gail Foy said the closure of the northbound exit was ordered 
by Caltrans as a safety measure and the city can't do anything about it. "We 
understand it's for safety," Postel said. "But it's still killing us." 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Floyd, co-owner of the Santa Clarita Athletic Club next door to Carrows, 
was not so understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm paying damn good money to be next to that exit," Floyd said. "It's an 
inconvenience for my members and my staff to have to drive all the way to Lyons 
and then double back when there is no reason for Calgrove to be closed." 
</P>
<P>
 Floyd says he was first told the exit would not be closed and that now, 
neither Caltrans nor city officials are willing to take responsibility for the 
closure. He says it has led to lower attendance at the club and a slowdown in 
new registrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Viki Rudolph, executive vice president of the Santa Clarita Valley Chamber of 
Commerce, said that few of her 1,000 members have had to halt operations 
altogether due to quake damage. "Most of them are doing business," she said. 
But she added, "They may not be doing it in the same location." 
</P>
<P>
 The quake has been a double-edged sword for Ken Ames, co-owner of Action 
Copiers, a Valencia firm that rebuilds and repairs copy machines. Ames' 
technicians are extremely busy fixing quake-damaged machines in offices 
throughout the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 But the picture is far gloomier inside Ames' warehouse, where 46 rebuilt 
copiers had been sitting on racks against the wall, ready for resale. When the 
quake hit, "the copiers just flew off," Ames said. "They hit the floor and 
disintegrated." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a water pipe broke, flooding the plant with 2 feet of water. 
"When I walked in the door, our mail was floating by," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Action Copiers' insurance does not cover earthquake-related losses, which Ames 
estimates at $185,000. Quake Damage 
</P>
<P>
 According to the most recent figures compiled by the city of Santa Clarita, 
the quake: 
</P>
<P>
 * Left 50 houses and 87 condominiums or apartments uninhabitable; another 370 
homes were tagged for limited entry. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rendered 42 commercial units uninhabitable; limited entry is permitted in 
another 47. 
</P>
<P>
 * Caused $45.7 million in damage to 11 large public and business structures, 
including CalArts, City Hall, U. S. Borax and Baxter Pharmaseal. 
</P>
<P>
 * Resulted in 10,617 building inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 * Broke 5,000 block walls and 2,000 chimneys. 
</P>
<P>
 * Damaged $23 million worth of city property, including bridges, medians, 
parks and traffic signals. 
</P>
<P>
 * Caused $22 million in damage to public and private property in county areas 
just outside the city.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: GLENDALE; EVERYTHING OLD IS NEW AGAIN AT NU2U THRIFT 
</P>

 NU2U. 
</P>
<P>
 It looks like something that belongs on a personalized license plate. But 
actually, it's the name of a new thrift shop that Glendale Teen Center and YWCA 
officials hope to eventually develop into a job-training program for 
teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheduled for a trial run from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. today, the NU2U store at the 
Glendale Fashion Center, 233 N. Glendale Ave., aims to sell racks of donated 
clothing, furniture, housewares, shoes, books and sporting equipment -- priced 
from as low as a nickel up to $900, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sort of like a garage sale," said Sheila Ellis, founder of the Glendale 
Teen Center. "It's used goods, but it's new to you . . . We have a pool table, 
an air hockey table, a grand piano. "The YWCA and the Teen Center felt this is 
a really good way to raise money . . . and to provide money for teen jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis, four teen-agers from the center and YWCA officials have worked on the 
project since late last fall. The YWCA came up with the idea as part of an 
effort to expand its own in-house thrift shop, which is too small to store 
large merchandise such as furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought it would be a perfect opportunity to involve teens so they could 
get job training and actually get work experience, which empowers them to get 
better jobs," said Anne Stanfield, YWCA board president. 
</P>
<P>
 In a month's time, both organizations collected hundreds of donated items for 
the store. 
</P>
<P>
 Because office space at Glendale Fashion Center was offered on a temporary 
basis, organizers decided to use today's opening and at least one more day to 
see how the program would run and whether it could attract a steady flow of 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Students participating in the program will first serve as volunteers, working 
as clerks or cashiers. Depending on how much money is raised, YWCA and Teen 
Center officials plan to open a permanent site by April or May and offer paid 
jobs for youths. 
</P>
<P>
 No exact budget has been determined yet, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although other nonprofit organizations such as the Salvation Army already 
operate resale stores, Ellis said the difference with NU2U is that it appeals 
to the local Glendale community. 
</P>
<P>
 Money donated to national groups often goes to a general operating fund, she 
said, but "when people come here and buy something from the NU2U store, they 
know that the money will go back to the Glendale Teen Center and the YWCA." 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone interested in volunteering or donating items for NU2U should call (818) 
759-1577. TOMMY LI

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: GLENDALE; $100,000 BEQUEATHED TO STUDENTS OF ARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The late Helen Conner Nern may not be known for avidly attending musical or 
theatrical performances at Glendale Community College. 
</P>
<P>
 But one thing's for certain: If she wasn't recognized as a supporter before, 
the 94-year-old woman is now. 
</P>
<P>
 Nern, who died of a heart attack in December, left an unexpected $100,000 
legacy earmarked for students in the college's vocal and theater arts programs, 
officials announced last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The gift far surpasses any previous onetime contribution the college has 
received in its 67-year history, said Angela Battaglia, scholarship program 
assistant. A $24,000 endowment from Pauline Turrill in memory of her husband 
Russell -- valedictorian of the class of 1945 -- comes closest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a delightful surprise," said Ted Stern, chairman of the music 
department, which oversees the vocal program. "Obviously, there's enough money 
there so that the interest on the principal will generate a number of 
scholarships for a long time to come." 
</P>
<P>
 "It took me completely off guard," said Ken Gray, director of the theater arts 
department. "It's usually more than you get for a community college." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Stern nor Gray ever met Nern. Confined to a wheelchair for the last 20 
years of her life, Nern did not explain in her will exactly why she was so 
generous with Glendale College, said Joe B. Scatchard, Nern's longtime neighbor 
and trustee of her estate. 
</P>
<P>
 "She just indicated in the trust that she wanted to give this $100,000 to 
Glendale College," Scatchard said. "She was (just) interested in music." 
</P>
<P>
 Nern may have identified with aspiring performers because she was one herself, 
he said. For most of her childhood in the early 1900s, the Huntington, Ind., 
native sang and pantomimed for her parents' Christian evangelistic troupe that 
traveled the Midwest and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Her singing career ended in 1922 when she moved to Glendale and married Rodney 
Nern, who made a fortune in his office furniture business. Her husband died two 
years ago at the age of 98. 
</P>
<P>
 Though childless, the Nerns gave $150,000 to the Glendale YWCA in 1984 to 
establish a preschool center, which is named after the couple. 
</P>
<P>
 Gifts from the Nern trust totaled $750,000, including $200,000 to Purdue 
University in Indiana, $50,000 to the School of Theology in Claremont and 
$5,000 to the Braille Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale College officials said the $100,000 endowment will be divided between 
the vocal and theater arts programs. No exact scholarship amounts have been 
determined, but "they're going to be given for merit," Battaglia said. TOMMY LI

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; BRIDGE TO BE CLOSED UNTIL MID-MARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Nordhoff Street bridge between Corbin and Tampa avenues in Northridge will 
remained closed until mid-March while workers rebuild sections of adjacent 
roadways that sunk during the Northridge quake, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The bridge, measuring about one-third of a mile, was completed in 1990 at a 
cost of $6 million and was designed to ease congestion around the Northridge 
Fashion Center.The bridge extends Nordhoff Street over railroad tracks and 
Limekiln Creek, a storm drain. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Ganaja, a structural engineer for the city, said the bridge itself 
sustained no damage in the quake. The problem is that the pavement leading to 
the bridge on both ends sunk about 18 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 The sunken section of roadway was built over fill dirt that may not have been 
adequately compacted, Ganaja said. Repair of the pavement is expected to cost 
about $450,000, he said. HUGO MARTIN

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: BURBANK; METROLINK ACTION ON AIRPORT STOP DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Metrolink directors Friday postponed for a month a decision on whether to stop 
trains at Burbank Airport, asking for more study of the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Since last week's opening of a refurbished platform across the street from the 
airport, officials from the city of Burbank and Ventura County transportation 
planners have pressed Metrolink to add the stop to its Moorpark line.Currently, 
the platform only serves Amtrak trains running between Santa Barbara and San 
Diego, which use the same track as the Metrolink Moorpark line. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters say the stop would encourage airport-bound riders from Ventura 
County and the western San Fernando Valley to use mass transit, but Metrolink 
officials note that customers can already alight at the downtown Burbank 
Metrolink station and take a free shuttle back to the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The board of the Southern California Regional Rail Authority, which oversees 
Metrolink, voted Friday to have its staff analyze the proposal more thoroughly, 
including questions of upgrading the platform to meet Metrolink standards.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: DONATIONS SOUGHT IN QUAKE RELIEF EFFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Operation USA, a Los Angeles-based international relief development agency, is 
asking for donations ranging from Tylenol to tractor-trailers full of blankets 
in an earthquake relief effort spreading throughout the damaged area, including 
the heavy-hit San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization works with community-based medical clinics, free clinics and 
groups such as Proyecto del Barrio, a Pacoima agency whose building was 
severely damaged in last month's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Operation USA is asking for donations of diapers, baby food, infant formula, 
sunscreen, plastic sheeting, blankets and medical supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just got off the phone with one of the clinics we're working with. We need 
Tylenol, Liquid Tylenol, insulin syringes, bandages," said Kim Zamarin, 
Operation USA administrator. "There's an ongoing need for blankets," she added. 
"We've gotten out over 3,000, and 1,200 are going out in the next two days, but 
we need more." 
</P>
<P>
 The organization hopes that manufacturers or distributors will donate supplies 
in bulk, but any donation will be accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can send 50 cents if that's what they have to help. It all comes 
together and we turn it around." 
</P>
<P>
 Operation USA isn't looking for volunteer help yet, Zamarin said, unless the 
volunteer comes with a tractor-trailer. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they are volunteers who have big trucks and can donate time -- time and 
big trucks -- that would be excellent," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information, call 1-800-678-7255 or send donations to Operation USA, 
L.A. Quake, 8320 Melrose Ave., No. 200, Los Angeles 90069. REBECCA BRYANT

<P>
 In the wake of the Northridge earthquake, many nonprofit agencies hard hit by 
the temblor are trying to continue helping their clients while they themselves 
rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinics and centers that serve low-income residents have been calling the 
Volunteer Reception Center in Panorama City asking for help ranging from taking 
wheelchair-bound clients out for fresh air to repairing damaged buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 El Nido Family Centers is now working out of its Van Nuys administrative 
office because of severe damage to the organization's Pacoima office. Its 
clients, which include more than 400 teen-age mothers or pregnant teen-agers as 
well as low-income families, need blankets, warm clothing and medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're finding is we need somewhat the essentials, like food," said 
Patricia Cervantes, adolescent family life coordinator. "We need diapers, 
anything to do with babies -- food, blankets, also personal hygiene things have 
come up, feminine hygiene. They're dealing with priorities." 
</P>
<P>
 Workers also are trying to find shelter for clients whose homes were made 
unsafe by the earthquake and are looking for people or organizations with space 
to offer, Cervantes said. 
</P>
<P>
 For information about volunteering or donating money or goods, call (818) 
908-5003. Donations can be mailed or taken to El Nido Family Centers, United 
Way Building, 6851 Lennox Ave., Van Nuys 91405.

<P>
 "We need money, food, water, veggies and volunteers," said Carlos Reyes, 
executive director. 
</P>
<P>

DAMAGED HIGH SCHOOLS' REOPENING DELAYED

 El Camino Real and John F. Kennedy high schools will not open on Tuesday, but 
will probably resume classes the following week, Los Angeles Unified School 
District officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 District spokeswoman Diana Munatones said that while 60 temporary classrooms 
have been delivered to Kennedy, 30 still need to be installed and furnished.El 
Camino, she said, is still awaiting 25 portable bungalows, which school 
officials expect to receive during the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has not set a new start date, but principals of both schools, 
which were damaged in last month's earthquake, have said they will try to 
resume regular classes in the days after Feb. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 In their first announcements about the two most heavily damaged high schools, 
district officials said the two schools were unlikely to open before March 7. 
But facing heavy criticism from parents -- and a promise from the state to 
install portable classrooms in time to open both campuses Tuesday -- the 
district pledged to redouble efforts to repair the two schools. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said that significant damage to both schools make them 
unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
 Children at Van Gogh Street Elementary School in Granada Hills will resume 
classes Tuesday, but not in their usual classrooms, which were split by cracks 
after the quake. The children are instead sharing a separate part of Frost 
Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Van Gogh building was deemed safe by inspectors, district 
officials have questioned the integrity of the ground under it. No decision has 
been made about the permanent status of the Van Gogh campus, Munatones said.

ALARCON HIRES RIORDAN'S PRESS SECRETARY; GOVERNMENT: ANNETTE CASTRO WILL ACT AS 
CHIEF CITY HALL ADVISER. OBSERVERS SAY THE MOVE WILL HELP THE COUNCILMAN GET 
HIS MESSAGE OUT. 
</P>

 Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alarcon on Friday announced that he has 
hired Mayor Richard Riordan's press secretary and confidant, Annette Castro, to 
be his chief City Hall adviser. Some observers see the move as a bid to bring 
new media and political savvy to an office that at times has seemed adrift. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Alarcon praised his current staff but said he expected Castro 
to coordinate his legislative and media programs and provide his office with 
valuable experience in dealing with the federal government and with Riordan, 
who can play a key role in Alarcon's legislative agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to joining Riordan's campaign in November, 1992, the 29-year-old Castro, 
a native of Whittier and USC graduate, had worked two years for former U.S. 
Sen. Alan Cranston and was a scheduler for President Clinton's campaign in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Annette is going to bring some political capabilities to Alarcon's staff that 
have been missing so far," said political consultant Richard Lichtenstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro will be paid $61,400 a year -- the same salary as Alarcon's current 
chief aide, Lupe Vela, who will now head up Alarcon's field operations. Alarcon 
said he expected her to begin work in two or three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro becomes the latest member of Riordan's original City Hall team to 
depart, joining Deputy Mayor Jadine Neilsen, who left to become a private 
consultant; Deputy Mayor Al Villalobos, who resigned under a cloud of news 
stories about his gambling and business misadventures; and press aide Tom 
Kreusopon, who now works for Los Angeles City Councilman Rudy Svorinich. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro developed a close rapport with Riordan while guiding the 
multimillionaire businessman with no media smarts through his 1993 campaign for 
mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Castro said she was looking forward to working with the 39-year-old 
Alarcon, who was elected in June to represent the 7th District, the San 
Fernando Valley's most ethnically diverse and economically troubled district. 
</P>
<P>
 "His staff has done a great job and I want to work with them as a team to 
maximize the councilman's visibility and bring about real change for his 
district," Castro said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since taking office, Alarcon, the Valley's first elected official of Latin 
descent, has shown a readiness to break with the Valley's traditional 
Anglo-suburban agenda by, among other initiatives, shepherding an ordinance to 
legalize street vending, exploring the possibility of setting up a 
redevelopment area in Pacoima and quietly refusing to back a plan to break up 
the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 But some City Hall watchers have said that Alarcon tends to be bureaucratic 
and careful. "Let's face it, he's a product of City Hall," said one observer 
who asked not to be named. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Alarcon has spent much of his adult life at City Hall, working in the 
Personnel Department and for former Mayor Tom Bradley. That orientation, it has 
been said, has been a handicap to Alarcon, robbing him of a certain freshness 
of vision. 
</P>
<P>
 Another observer said that Castro's hiring means that Alarcon "sees that his 
product has been sitting on the shelf for eight months and it's not selling as 
well as he'd like, and now it's time to re-market it. But it's to Alarcon's 
credit that he recognizes the need to change."

WOODLAND HILLS MAN INDICTED IN GIRL'S KILLING; CRIME: HOOMAN ASHKAN PANAH, 22, 
COULD FACE DEATH PENALTY IN THE ASSAULT AND SLAYING OF NICOLE PARKER, 8. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A grand jury indicted a Woodland Hills man Thursday in the abduction, sexual 
assault and slaying of 8-year-old Nicole Parker, whose body was discovered in 
the defendant's bedroom closet, sources close to the case said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hooman Ashkan Panah, 22, who faces the death penalty, will appear in Los 
Angeles Superior Court for an arraignment Tuesday morning, when the indictment 
is scheduled to be unsealed, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sources said Panah faces charges of murder during a kidnaping, murder 
during child molestation and murder during sodomy. If Panah is convicted on any 
of the three charges, punishment would be either life in prison without the 
possibility of parole or the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors presented evidence to the grand jury for two days this week before 
the indictment was issued, according to the sources. Los Angeles Police 
Detective Joel Price, who headed the investigation, confirmed that he appeared 
before the panel, but he refused other comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole's nude body was found Nov. 21 stuffed in a suitcase that was hidden in 
Panah's bedroom closet. The body was found the day after she disappeared from 
the courtyard of the Ventura Boulevard apartment complex where both her father 
and Panah lived. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole had been choked, but a coroner's autopsy determined the child died from 
"traumatic injuries." 
</P>
<P>
 Until he is arraigned on the indictment, Panah remains accused in a criminal 
complaint of kidnaping, forced oral copulation, sodomy and murder. Panah was 
arrested Nov. 21 on those charges and entered not guilty pleas. 
</P>
<P>
 Panah recently hired a new attorney -- Robert Michael Sheahen of Century City, 
who is the third lawyer to work on Panah's defense. Sheahen was not available 
for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Panah made incriminating statements to police, court documents show. 
Furthermore, a female friend reported that Panah said he "was involved in 
something real bad" in relation to the missing girl and that there was a 
videotape that "made him look real bad." 
</P>
<P>
 In Panah's bedroom, investigators found camera equipment and tapes showing 
Panah having sex with adult women. However, a tape showing Nicole -- if such a 
video does exist -- has never been found. 
</P>
<P>
 As they were searching Panah's residence in the hopes of finding that 
videotape, police found Nicole's body about 36 hours after she disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 A judge previously ordered Panah to produce a saliva sample, suggesting that 
authorities hope to use DNA evidence to further link him to the killing.

ROBERTI DENIES ENDORSING ROSENTHAL AS HIS STATE SENATE SUCCESSOR; POLITICS: 
LAWMAKER FACING RECALL SAYS HE WAS LISTED AS A BACKER BY MISTAKE. FOES THINK 
SUPPORT WAS WITHDRAWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 State Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys), who will be forced to leave office 
later this year, denied this week that he has endorsed his Westside-based 
colleague, Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), to replace him. 
</P>
<P>
 When Rosenthal made the surprise announcement Monday that he would run for 
Roberti's 20th District seat, he named Roberti in writing as one of two dozen 
elected officials who were backing his candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
 But Roberti's office said Rosenthal was mistaken about the endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a miscommunication," said Staci Walters, campaign press secretary for 
Roberti, who faces a recall election. Walters said if Roberti endorses, he will 
not do so until March 11 when all the candidates who qualify for the ballot are 
known. 
</P>
<P>
 "We also have a lot of other pressing issues to deal with right now, including 
the recall and the earthquake," Walters said. Roberti's Van Nuys-based 20th 
District was heavily hit by the Jan. 17 temblor. In addition, Roberti is 
running for state treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti's name apparently showed up on a list of "endorsement naturals" and 
remained there despite the fact that Roberti was not contacted, according to 
Lynette Stevens, Rosenthal's chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens said that her boss was informed that Roberti won't endorse a successor 
until after the April 12 recall election. That election has been orchestrated 
by a coalition of Second Amendment-rights enthusiasts angry at Roberti's 
support for gun control and grass-roots political dissidents who are seeking to 
oust the former powerful head of the state Senate from office. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Roberti survives the recall, he must step down from his Senate seat in 
December because of term limits. 
</P>
<P>
 In making his announcement Monday, Rosenthal, 75, said he had originally 
planned to retire from the Senate when his current term expires later this year 
but decided to run for Roberti's seat instead because he believed his 
experience in Sacramento -- where he has served in the Assembly and the Senate 
since 1974 -- could be useful in helping the quake-shocked San Fernando Valley 
get back on its feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, opponents of both Roberti and Rosenthal, whose residence and 
political base have always been on the Westside, rejected the official version 
that the endorsement was an honest mistake. Instead, they speculated that the 
endorsement was real and was only withdrawn after it was realized that it was a 
political faux pas. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, South Bay stockbroker Russ Howard, a strategist for the Roberti 
recall movement, suggested that it was politically damaging for Roberti to 
endorse Rosenthal at a time when his own recall foes are accusing him of being 
a carpetbagger. "Being a carpetbagger who tries to be a kingmaker for another 
carpetbagger is not a good image," Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti has continued to live in the Los Feliz area of Hollywood even after he 
shifted his political base from Hollywood to Van Nuys in 1992 after 
reapportionment gutted his old Senate district. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, Howard said Roberti might not want to be tied to Rosenthal 
because Rosenthal had opposed a plan -- sponsored by Roberti -- to break up the 
Los Angeles Unified School District. The breakup plan has been one of Roberti's 
most popular initiatives in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "To endorse Rosenthal would be an admission that Roberti's school breakup 
position was really just a sham all along," Howard said. If Roberti were 
sincere about this position he wouldn't endorse a foe, he said.

SAUGUS PARENTS FIGHT PROPOSED NEW SCHOOL BOUNDARIES; EDUCATION: GROUP IS UPSET 
OVER PLANS TO BUS STUDENTS TO NEW CAMPUSES. DISTRICT SAYS IT WILL CONSIDER 
THEIR CONCERNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A group of Saugus parents, upset because their children might be bused to 
Canyon Country schools this fall, has asked for reconsideration of proposed new 
district boundaries, drawn to relieve overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a preliminary plan proposed by the William S. Hart Union High School 
District, 220 to 250 students living in upper Bouquet Canyon would attend 
Sierra Vista Junior High School rather than Arroyo Seco Junior High. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the distance from Saugus to Sierra Vista and Arroyo Seco is similar, 
the parents say children would miss out by not attending school in their own 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We moved up here so our children would have the feeling of neighborhood," 
said Chris Long, a parent who printed 2,000 flyers asking the district to 
reconsider its draft boundary plan.  
</P>
<P>
 "(District officials) are looking at their statistics and looking at their 
computers, but they're not looking at what it's going to do to a kid," Long 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The redrawn boundaries incorporate a new high school and junior high school 
opening in the fall, as well as anticipating two additional new campuses by the 
year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 11,000 students now attend the district's six schools, 37% more than 
their listed capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Valencia High School in Valencia and La Mesa Junior High School in 
Canyon Country will take pressure off existing schools, and the district is 
trying to redraw its boundaries so crowding is reduced on all campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Both schools are being opened to lower grades this fall -- seventh-graders at 
La Mesa and ninth- and 10th-graders at Valencia. District officials believe few 
juniors and seniors will want to transfer to a new school, so later grades are 
being added in subsequent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Parent Patty Kolin said she believes Arroyo Seco can accommodate the Saugus 
students through creative scheduling and the use of portable classrooms. Any 
costs could be made up in savings by not having to bus those students, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lew White, district facilities director, said he is not surprised by parental 
concerns over the new boundaries and that the district will consider their 
arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I heard anything that came up that I didn't think would come 
up," White said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart officials surveyed more than 800 parents during a series of January 
community meetings. The 470 responses indicated a strong desire to reduce 
school populations, keep students together when they move from elementary to 
junior high school and from junior high to high school, and cut travel time to 
and from campus whenever possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents have asked about the quality of education if their children are 
relocated, indicating that one particular school may be better than another. 
</P>
<P>
 But White attributed that concern to school loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who like their own school tend to notice only the negative things in 
the newspaper about the other schools," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart trustees are scheduled to vote on the new school boundaries in March.

RELIGION / JOHN DART; PERIODS OF LENT, RAMADAN OVERLAP; OBSERVANCES: 
CHRISTIANS, MUSLIMS AND JEWS HAVE KEY HOLIDAYS COMING UP. FOR MANY, THE TIME 
INVOLVES REFLECTION AND ABSTINENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Lent and Ramadan, the most important periods of reflection and abstinence for 
Christians and Muslims, will overlap in the weeks ahead, inviting comparisons 
of the meaning of fasting in this interfaith age. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the late Cardinal Timothy Manning of Los Angeles once began a 
pre-Lenten statement with an apparently unintentional quip, "Lent is fast upon 
us," the religious requirements of the Christian penitential period pale in 
comparison to Ramadan. 
</P>
<P>
 Muslims today begin a lunar month of abstaining from food and drink in 
daylight hours, as well as forgoing sex during Ramadan and increasing their 
acts of charity and devotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Followers of Islam typically rise daily about 4:30 a.m. to eat a modest meal, 
say pre-dawn prayers, then go back to bed or to work, depending on 
circumstances. All Muslims who have reached puberty -- with exceptions for 
pregnant women, the ailing and the elderly -- are expected to avoid food and 
drink until sunset, when traditionally a few dates and water are taken to break 
the fast. Prayers are said, and a complete meal is eaten. 
</P>
<P>
 Roman Catholics, Protestants and members of other Western churches Wednesday 
will mark the start of the 6 1/2-week Lenten period before Easter. But it is 
primarily the Roman Catholic Church that maintains rules for fasting and 
abstinence during Lent. 
</P>
<P>
 Devout Catholics between 18 and 59 years of age are expected to fast on Ash 
Wednesday and Good Friday, but that is defined as eating only one full, but 
meatless, meal on those days. Two other meatless snacks may be eaten on those 
days but together they should not equal a full meal, according to church law. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Catholics 14 and over are instructed to abstain from meat on all 
Fridays during Lent. 
</P>
<P>
 Within Episcopal, Lutheran and other major denominations, Lenten abstinence 
from meat, food and other pleasures has all but faded from practice, clergy 
say. The emphasis is instead on adding something to one's spiritual routine. 
</P>
<P>
 "The modern understanding in the Episcopal Church is to take on something new 
-- Bible studies, works of charity, more prayer," said the Rev. Lynn Jay of 
Santa Clarita, dean of the Episcopal parishes in the San Fernando, Santa 
Clarita and Antelope valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parishes usually have a Lenten study on a particular night of the week, often 
preceded by a simple dinner of soup and bread," Jay said. 
</P>
<P>
 The weekly soup and service during Lent has become popular in Lutheran 
circles, said Pastor Lawrence Baietti of Christ the Shepherd Lutheran Church in 
Altadena. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, we will join with the Episcopal congregation in Altadena every 
Wednesday, alternating at each other's church for a light soup supper and 
worship," said Baietti, who chairs the ecumenical committee for the Evangelical 
Lutheran Church in America's Los Angeles-based synod. 
</P>
<P>
 Baietti's church will begin Lent, as will Episcopal and Catholic churches, 
with services Wednesday. In Catholic parishes especially, ash is smudged on the 
forehead of the worshiper. 
</P>
<P>
 "The emphasis is on one's mortality, the uncertainty of life and reliance on 
the mercy of God," Baietti said. "Of course, the earthquake a couple of weeks 
ago already reminded us of our frailty." 
</P>
<P>
 Lenten observances vary widely in other Protestant churches, often with little 
note taken of Ash Wednesday and not much attention to tradition until Holy Week 
begins with Palm Sunday, which is March 27 this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1,200-member Glendale United Methodist Church will hold a Shrove Tuesday 
Pancake Supper next week, summoning up an old English tradition of using up the 
eggs, milk, fat and butter in the pantry before the start of Lent. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really thought of it as an opportunity to have fun," said Sheila Kane, 
diaconal minister of Christian education at the church. "During Lent, we aren't 
asking people to give up things, but we are planning more Bible study and 
asking people to pray 10 minutes daily for our church's ministry and for each 
other." 
</P>
<P>
 Lenten traditions have even less hold on Baptist and Pentecostal churches, 
which tend to look for biblical precedents rather than historic church 
practices for inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet pastors such as the Rev. Jack Hayford of the Church on the Way have 
rediscovered and recommended the spiritual discipline of fasting, if only on a 
modest scale, regardless of the church season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing turns off vital Christians quicker than programs of legalistic 
demands or 'churchified' efforts at ritual behavior," Hayford said. When 
fasting is a discipline linked closely to prayer, the practice is no longer 
seen as "a relic of dead traditionalism," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the legal requirements of Islam's month of Ramadan and Catholicism's 
Lenten rules are accompanied by a rich tradition of increased devotion and 
community gatherings, religious leaders say. 
</P>
<P>
 The Islamic Center of Northridge, for instance, will have Koran readers recite 
from memory the entire Islamic scriptures and lead special nightly prayers 
during Ramadan. It is also a time of increased charity toward the poor and 
homeless, said Ahmed El-Gabalawy, a representative of the center. 
</P>
<P>
 For some Catholics, Lent means extra devotional exercises in the parishes and 
sometimes a decision to go out of one's way to visit the sick and elderly, said 
Father Gregory Coiro, public affairs director of the Los Angeles Catholic 
Archdiocese. 
</P>
<P>
 In that vein, Holy Spirit Retreat Center in Encino is planning an ecumenical 
series of weekly services that take their cue from the 58th chapter of Isaiah, 
in which fasting is defined not so much as pious abstinence but helping the 
unfortunate. 
</P>
<P>
 The center will hold an hourlong service of prayers, with donations going to 
local religious social ministries, starting at 7:30 p.m. Feb. 21 and continuing 
each Monday of Lent. Among the beneficiaries will be the San Fernando Valley 
Interfaith Council for earthquake relief efforts, the Blythe Street Project for 
outreach to gang youths, and East Los Angeles' House of Ruth for a women's and 
children's shelter. Upcoming Holy Days 
</P>
<P>
 RAMADAN (Muslims) 
</P>
<P>
 The lunar month of fasting begins today, corresponding with astronomical data 
and the Friday night sighting of the first sliver of the crescent moon. The 
approximately 28-day period commemorates the Islamic tradition that Prophet 
Mohammed began to receive divine revelations set down in the Koran, the Muslim 
scriptures, in the month of Ramadan. Most Muslims will celebrate the end of the 
fast with Eid al-Fitr, or the Festival of the Breaking of the Fast, on March 
13. 
</P>
<P>
 LENT (Catholics, Protestants) 
</P>
<P>
 The reflective period leading up to the Christian Holy Week and Easter, when 
Christians recall the gospel accounts of Jesus' trial, crucifixion and 
resurrection, begins for Western Christendom on Ash Wednesday, this year Feb. 
16. Easter is April 3. 
</P>
<P>
 LENT (Eastern Orthodox) 
</P>
<P>
 Eastern Christians, notably those with church roots in Slavic countries and 
the Middle East, begin the observance of Great Lent on a Monday. This year, it 
will be March 16. Easter is May 1. 
</P>
<P>
 PASSOVER (Jews) 
</P>
<P>
 The eight-day Jewish holiday, commemorating the deliverance of the ancient 
Hebrews from bondage in Egypt, will begin at sundown March 26.

FORMER TRUSTEE RETURNS TO FILL VACANCY ON CASTAIC SCHOOL BOARD; EDUCATION: JACK 
JOHNSON, WHO SERVED SIX TERMS BEFORE HIS DEFEAT IN '91, IS APPOINTED OVER TWO 
OTHER APPLICANTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A venerable former trustee is back on the Castaic Union School District board, 
filling a post vacated two months ago by a trustee who moved out of the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Johnson, 70, was appointed by a 4-0 vote Wednesday night and will return 
to the board where he served six terms before being defeated in 1991. He will 
be sworn in at the board's March 17 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what he will bring to the board is history, stability," said Supt. 
Scott Brown. "If the Castaic school board can have what is called an elder 
statesman, Jack is it." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said he was eager to return and hoped to avoid personality clashes 
that have occurred in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Feuding among trustees culminated in the November election with a slate of 
candidates blasting the district for low test scores, inadequate bus 
maintenance and Brown's use of a district credit card for personal items he 
later repaid. The slate, led by former Trustee Gloria Mercado, lost the 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like the way things have been going in the years since I've been 
gone," said Johnson. "The school board is not a city council. It's not every 
person for themselves; it's a team." 
</P>
<P>
 Two other Castaic residents applied for the seat as well -- Tom Caesar, an 
adult-education teacher who instructs at Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho for the 
Hacienda La Puente Unified School District, and Rika Wakelin, a parent and 
graduate student at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Dirk Gosda said all three candidates were qualified, but that he was 
especially impressed by Johnson's participation in volunteer events in Castaic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jack has been a guy that's always there to help out," Gosda said. "I place a 
lot of value in that. I like the guys that get in there and get their hands 
dirty." 
</P>
<P>
 Gosda said he was disappointed more people did not apply for the post. 
</P>
<P>
 The seat was vacated Dec. 17 by Bruce Fox, who quit after moving from Castaic 
to Santa Clarita's Valencia community to be closer to his in-laws and to raise 
his son there. Trustees are required to live in the school district they serve. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson will serve the remaining two years of the four-year term.

TEAMSTERS FILE 2ND COMPLAINT AGAINST FIRM IN TRANSIT STRIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The union representing employees striking against the operator of the Antelope 
Valley's public transit system has again accused the bus company of unfair 
labor practices. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Labor Relations Board late last year dismissed the first charge. 
Ralph Phillips, an Encino attorney representing the Teamsters, said a request 
for a review of that decision has been filed with the labor board's office of 
appeals in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're keeping up the battle," Phillips said. "Hopefully, this one will 
stick." 
</P>
<P>
 Some 85 bus drivers, mechanics and other employees who had voted to join the 
Teamsters went on strike in late October. Although the work stoppage 
temporarily disrupted service, replacement workers were hired within weeks. The 
workers continue to picket outside the DAVE Transportation offices in 
Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest complaint, filed Jan. 28, accuses DAVE Transportation of 
"misrepresenting its financial conditions to (the union) during contract 
negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips said that during negotiations, the company claimed that it was unable 
to pay the wages requested by the union because its revenues from operating the 
public transportation system for the Antelope Valley Transit Authority were 
insufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 A review of the company's financial records by the union, according to 
Phillips, found the claim to be false. 
</P>
<P>
 John Helm, a regional manager with DAVE Transportation, said he is confident 
that the latest complaint will also be dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't believe there's any basis to this unfair labor practice (charge) 
just as the National Labor Relations Board found no basis for their previous 
charge," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We stated during the negotiations that we were unwilling to meet their 
requests because of our financial performance, and we offered to allow their 
auditors to look at our books. And that took place." 
</P>
<P>
 Other than receiving a notice from the NLRB that a complaint had been filed, 
Helm said he has heard nothing from the union. 
</P>
<P>
 The first complaint involved allegations of failing to bargain in good faith.

TAILORED TO THE AREA; DISCOUNT MEN'S CLOTHIERS DO WELL IN SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 The men's tailored clothing business has been unraveling for years, 
particularly in Los Angeles. The flagging economy and Southern California's 
dress-down attitude have made it a graveyard for many sellers of men's suits. 
</P>
<P>
 That didn't stop George Zimmer, chairman of Men's Wearhouse, a Fremont, 
Calif.-based discount suit retailer. Zimmer entered the Los Angeles market by 
opening 10 Southland stores in the past four months, and he plans to open a 
dozen more in the region this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of our employees expressed concern when we decided to move into the Los 
Angeles market," Zimmer said. "Some analysts on Wall Street questioned our 
decision, but we think we have a huge opportunity in the Los Angeles area." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, while many companies are closing apparel stores amid Southern 
California's economic gloom, discount suit sellers are expanding rapidly. By 
taking advantage of a drop in the cost of floor space and a rise in the demand 
for value, discount clothiers have become a rare retailing success story in the 
Southland.  
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles has been the most difficult area for conventional store chains," 
said Alan Millstein, a New York-based apparel industry analyst. "Some stores 
would like to pull out of Los Angeles, which makes it all the more remarkable 
that Men's Wearhouse has decided to double its presence. It's a sign that price 
is more important to men. This is becoming the decade of the bargain hunter." 
</P>
<P>
 Other apparel retailers are rushing in: Harris & Frank, known for decades as 
an upscale chain, now offers discount prices. C&R Clothiers, which strayed from 
its original value-pricing strategies, is now back to its former format. And 
Suitmasters, a discount suit retailer that opened its first shop in Glendale 
last year, plans to open 10 more stores in the next two years.  
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, Southland clothiers are responding to well-established trends. 
Industry analysts say price is an increasingly important incentive because 
American men buy half as many suits as they did a decade ago. Price is 
especially important in the Southland because consumers are concerned about the 
state's economic slump and because more men  
</P>
<P>
 are dressing casually at work in California.  
</P>
<P>
 "Dressing down is a trend in California, Texas and Florida," Millstein said. 
"You won't sell a lot of suits in those states if your prices are high, because 
men have more options." 
</P>
<P>
 Men's Wearhouse, which sells designer label suits, appears to have learned 
these lessons best. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales from its 183 stores -- including those in the Los Angeles area -- 
totaled $240.4 million, an increase of 41.1%, for the 12 months ended Jan. 29. 
Same-store sales -- revenue from Wearhouse stores open at least a year -- rose 
17% for the period.  
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, the men's tailored clothing business experienced a 5% decrease in 
sales industrywide in 1993, and several major retailers and manufacturers are 
also trying to cope with financial snags. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Chicago-based Hartmarx, a major apparel manufacturer and 
retailer, filed for bankruptcy protection in December. GFT, a New York and 
Turin, Italy-based manufacturer of licensed designer label lines -- Armani and 
Calvin Klein among them -- lost an estimated $59 million in 1993. Its creditors 
may put the company on the auction block.  
</P>
<P>
 While many chains have been closing some of their stores -- Kuppenheimer and 
Richmond Bros. among them -- Men's Wearhouse has expanded rapidly in recent 
years. The chain, which has quadrupled in size since 1988, added 40 stores in 
1993. The company's Northridge store -- one of the 10 Southland stores opened 
late last year -- was severely damaged by the earthquake, but the retailer 
plans to reopen in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Zimmer has followed the same strategy in each of the 50 cities Men's Wearhouse 
has entered. The company avoids malls and locates its stores on streets because 
"men don't like huge parking lots and like to get in and out of stores 
quickly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company attracts customers with low prices on brand-name clothing with a 
strong cachet -- recognizable brands such as Pierre Cardin, Givenchy, Halston 
and Yves Saint Laurent. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which has stores in 21 states, also touts its service, including 
free pressing and follow-up calls to determine the level of satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Zimmer has also used television advertising to raise the company's profile, 
appearing in commercials in which he invokes his low-price "I guarantee it" 
slogan. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the apparel industry will be watching the performance of Men's 
Wearhouse as it expands in the Los Angeles area because of the market's 
perilous history. For example, Silverwoods, a chain that operated in Southern 
California for 70 years, closed its 18 stores in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The former owner of Harris & Frank, another money-losing seller of upscale 
tailored clothing in the Los Angeles area, sold the chain to Miami-based 
clothier Alan Glist in 1992. Glist bought 12 of the 17 stores and saved them by 
changing the format. 
</P>
<P>
 "We now offer the same kinds of prices that you find at discount chains, 
because Los Angeles is a very tough market," Glist said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight for the discount suit buyer intensified when Suitmasters opened its 
first store in Glendale in September. The company plans to open its next store 
in Burbank this year, said Joe Cheon, the company's general manager.  
</P>
<P>
 Culver City-based C&R Clothiers, a longtime leader in the market, slid into 
bankruptcy in 1992 largely because it began to offer customers more expensive 
and more cutting-edge fashion, Chief Executive Paul Reisbord said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which has 34 stores in Southern California, now offers more 
mainstream fashion at lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
 C&R saw double-digit increases in the number of suits sold during the final 
three months of 1993, Reisbord said. The Rise of Men's Wearhouse

<P>
 While many men's tailored clothing retailers are in trouble, Men's Wearhouse 
is building sales and expanding rapidly.

REPORTS EASE INFLATION FEARS; ECONOMY: FALLING FOOD COSTS KEEP WHOLESALE PRICE 
RISE TO JUST 0.2%, AND RETAIL SALES DROP. INTEREST RATES SHOULD STAY DOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Wholesale prices rose a scant 0.2% last month and retail sales dropped 0.5%, 
the federal government said Friday, easing fears that inflation is heating up 
and taking some of the pressure off the nation's central bank to raise interest 
rates again soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Falling prices for food partially offset rising prices for gasoline in 
January, leaving wholesale price inflation at a modest 2.9% annual rate, the 
Labor Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the 0.5% drop in January retail sales that the Commerce Department 
announced in a separate report was larger than expected, analysts said much of 
the decline could be blamed on the Northridge earthquake last month and 
unusually harsh weather in the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is nothing in these reports to make me think that interest rates are 
going to have to be bumped up again soon," said Robert Dederick, chief 
economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. "At this point, inflation is simply 
a non-issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Most other analysts agreed that Friday's reports had quelled their fears that 
the Federal Reserve Board would have to raise interest rates again in the next 
few weeks to cool down the economy and ease long-term inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Fed raised its federal funds rate -- the rate banks charge each 
other for overnight loans -- to 3.25% from 3%. It was the first such increase 
in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, some experts said the increase would be the first of several in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
 But analysts said Friday's reports could allow the Fed to wait until the 
spring or even summer before raising rates again. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Department tracks wholesale prices through its monthly producer 
price index. The index's 0.2% increase in January indicates that consumers 
won't be paying much more at the checkout counter or gas pump when the goods 
get to market in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month's increase in the index was fueled by a 6.5% jump in the cost of 
gasoline. Overall energy costs, which also include the cost of natural gas and 
heating oil, climbed a smaller 0.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 Tobacco and auto prices also rose, helping to wipe out the benefits of a 0.3% 
drop in food prices -- the biggest one-month decline since last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts had said retail sales in January would slow from their feverish 
Christmas pace, but the 0.5% drop reported by the Commerce Department was much 
larger than most had expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of big-ticket durable goods, such as appliances and other items built to 
last at least three years, dropped 1.6% last month after jumping 2% in 
December. Total sales slipped to a seasonally adjusted $181 billion, the first 
month-to-month decline since March. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, few analysts were worried about the sales drop. 
</P>
<P>
 They noted that unusually bad weather in the Northeast kept many shoppers at 
home last month, while the earthquake closed several large shopping centers and 
many small businesses in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, consumer confidence remains relatively high. Although its overall 
reading of confidence fell for early February, the University of Michigan said 
a preliminary reading of its consumer expectations index -- which some analysts 
use to estimate future consumer spending -- rose.  
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, it appears the drop in sales primarily was due to the weather 
as opposed to any downturn in consumer confidence," said Lynn Reaser, chief 
economist at First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles. Producer Price Index
