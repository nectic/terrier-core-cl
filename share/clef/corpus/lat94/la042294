 BONING UP: The American Red Cross, long known for its blood drives, now 
collects bones. . . . Today is the last day of National Organ and Tissue Donor 
Awareness Week. But even if you've been a faithful blood donor, there's no need 
to rush right over with your contribution. Bone tissue is collected only after 
you die, and these donations can help others walk again, said county Red Cross 
Director Brian Bolton. He urges families to consider tissue donations well 
before a death occurs: "The gift of life comes in many forms."

 DREAMS OF FIELD: If we build it, they will come. A minor league baseball 
official says several teams are looking for new homes, and one likely will come 
to Ventura County if community leaders can build a stadium (B1). At least three 
cities are considering it. . . . This is the first serious effort to attract a 
ballclub since the Ventura Gulls flopped in 1986. But the Gulls never had a 
chance: The team had no stadium, no lights and no beer sales. 
</P>
<P>
 NIXON WAS HERE: Richard Nixon is triggering memories across Ventura County 
this week. . . . Kay Haley of Ventura remembers an Oxnard dinner party for 
Nixon in 1962, when he was running for governor. And longtime supporter R.D. 
Nesen, the Thousand Oaks car dealer, recalls helping Pete Wilson, then a Nixon 
presidential campaign aide, set up a rally here in 1960. "I received a nice 
note from him a little while ago," Nesen said, "thanking me for all I had done 
for him during his great career."

 COWABUNGA! Rain or shine, Ventura will hold its annual California Beach Party 
this weekend to celebrate the early days of surfing and '50s beach culture. You 
can look forward to a long-boarding contest at Surfers Point, but don't expect 
to visit the nearby C Street Surfing Museum. The museum has moved from the 
city-owned building to make room for a new restaurant and stores. It's not a 
total bummer, though. Said Ventura Surf Shop's Stan Fujii: The museum may 
reopen as part of the restaurant. Donating Bones

RWANDA DEATH TOLL AT 100,000, RED CROSS SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The International Committee of the Red Cross said Thursday that more than 
100,000 Rwandans may have been killed in the last two weeks of ethnic slaughter 
and called it a "human tragedy on a scale we have rarely witnessed." 
</P>
<P>
 The report coincided with a recommendation by U.N. Secretary General Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali to sharply scale back the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Rwanda, 
and with news accounts that the African nation was edging closer to a deadly 
outbreak of disease and famine sparked by growing fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Human rights groups charged that any withdrawal of U.N. forces would put at 
risk of massacre more than 20,000 Rwandans who have sought U.N. protection in 
hospitals and a stadium in Kigali, the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tanzania, President Ali Hassan Mwinyi said Thursday that the warring sides 
would meet in the town of Arusha to try to end the bloodshed.

WIND TESTIFIES KOON URGED HIM TO STRIKE KING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA DEUTSCH, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While a convicted policeman sought to avoid the witness stand, one of those 
acquitted in Rodney G. King's beating testified that after King had been struck 
in the face, a sergeant shouted: "Hit him! Hit him!" 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy E. Wind, who was a rookie with the Los Angeles Police Department on 
the night of King's notorious beating, acknowledged in a calm voice that he 
struck King with his baton nine or 10 times and kicked him six times. He said 
he was trying to keep King on the ground and believed the force used on King 
was not excessive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to get this man down so I could get him into custody," said Wind, a 
defendant in King's civil lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time in three trials that Wind has told his version of events 
under oath. He was called as a hostile witness by one of King's lawyers, John 
Burris, who had the officer demonstrate for jurors the kicking and baton 
techniques he used and had him analyze the beating videotape. 
</P>
<P>
 Wind said he saw one of the baton blows by his partner, Officer Laurence M. 
Powell, strike King in the face. It was after that, he said, that he moved in 
and began using his baton and foot on King. 
</P>
<P>
 "You did kick him, did you not?" asked Burris. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used my foot to try to push him back on the ground," said Wind. Asked if 
anyone told him to strike King, Wind said, "I recalled looking at Sgt. (Stacey 
C.) Koon. I glanced up at him and he said, "Hit him! Hit him!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Was that before or after Mr. Powell had struck him in the face?" asked 
Burris. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe it was after," Wind said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time anyone has attributed such an order to Koon, who was not 
in court during the testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Wind acknowledged that although he was a rookie with the LAPD, he had seven 
years of police experience in Kansas. But he added, "I don't think any 
experience really prepares you for what you see in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Powell's lawyers moved to invoke his 5th Amendment protection against 
self-incrimination in King's civil damage trial. They said anything he says 
could be used against him if federal appeals courts grant him a new criminal 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell and Koon, convicted last year of violating King's civil rights, are 
serving 30-month prison sentences. Powell's lawyers argued that he cannot be 
compelled to testify until all appeals of his civil rights conviction are 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge John Davies said some areas of questioning may be off 
limits, but agreed to rule on each area of inquiry after Powell takes the stand 
and invokes the privilege, probably Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, opening statements began with a King lawyer blasting the Police 
Department for racist and brutal tactics and promising to show through expert 
witnesses and the Christopher Commission report that King's beating represented 
standard operating procedure for violence prone officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Federico Sayre, addressing the same jury that awarded King $3.8 
million in compensatory damages, said the only difference between King's 
beating and the LAPD's normal practice of brutality was that "someone was there 
filming it." 
</P>
<P>
 Davies told jurors they will now face the task of deciding who pays and how 
much they pay in punishment for the March 3, 1991, beating that stunned the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The city was the only defendant in the trial's first phase. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the 15 named defendants were seated in the courtroom front row as 
opening statements began. Former Police Chief Daryl F. Gates was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 The city, held liable in the first phase, is not a defendant, but its lawyer, 
Deputy City Atty. Don Vincent, is representing the bystander officers accused 
by King of failing to stop his beating. 
</P>
<P>
 The punitive damage phase began with no new efforts to settle the case out of 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawyer for Powell said his client and other officers accused in the case are 
broke and cannot pay King any money. 
</P>
<P>
 King's lawyer, Milton Grimes, disagreed. "I believe their net worth is going 
to be over $1 million," he said. The city still needs to determine whether it 
will financially back the current or former city employees.

SUBWAY TUNNEL CONSTRUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * As a former Los Angeles resident now living in Switzerland, I was appalled 
(but not surprised) when I read about the Los Angeles subway tunnel 
misalignment debacle (April 14). The Swiss can build a four-lane 17-mile-long 
freeway tunnel (the St. Gotthard Pass) through a mountain (the Alps!) in all 
kinds of weather, on budget, on time, in alignment. We can't build a 4.5-mile 
subway that isn't over budget, over schedule, and is as much as two feet 
misaligned! The Swiss are now building a 50-mile-long freeway tunnel through 
the Alps and there is no doubt it, too, will be built on budget, on time, in 
alignment. The Swiss will accept nothing less! 
</P>
<P>
 Are the Shea-Kiewiet-Kenny engineers, budget planners and geologists all 
inept? Maybe they should speak to the Swiss, or better yet, how about to the 
man (Clinton Myers) who just had such tremendous success in putting the Santa 
Monica Freeway back into operation! 
</P>
<P>
 CHARLOTTE DIAL 
</P>
<P>
 Lugano, Switzerland 
</P>
<P>
 * The city's payment of a $200,000 bonus for every day that the Santa Monica 
Freeway repairs were completed ahead of schedule has been justified on the 
theory that it was costing the city approximately $1 million per day, in lost 
time and business, for every day this particular bridge remained closed (April 
13). Thus, we all presumably come out ahead by $800,000 per day if taxpayer 
funds are used for this purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 By this logic, Los Angeles officials should consider the costs of each day of 
delay in the completion of such projects as the Red Line subway system. When 
the subway is completed, it is expected to save us millions by reducing travel 
time for both subway riders and drivers, alleviating air pollution, and saving 
many of us the substantial expenses of car payments, insurance premiums, 
gasoline and parking. Every time we are stuck in traffic, we are reminded that 
our dependence on the freeway system costs us money even when the bridges are 
all standing. Whenever a vital link in the chain is broken, the benefits of 
having an efficient public transportation system in place to provide an 
alternative to being stuck in traffic become even clearer. 
</P>
<P>
 It would therefore seem a worthwhile expenditure to offer the contractors who 
are diligently digging subway tunnels incentives to complete the job sooner. In 
addition to saving us substantial amounts in the long run, speeding up the 
progress of this project would also go a long way toward minimizing the 
short-term disruption of such important thoroughfares as Wilshire Boulevard and 
Hollywood Boulevard during the period of subway construction.

SEN. DAVID ROBERTI

<TEXT>
<P>
 * Congratulations to state Sen. David Roberti (D-Van Nuys) for his win 
("Roberti Defeats Recall Effort by Solid Margin," April 13). As for the 
National Rifle Assn. lobby, its gloating over "wounding" Roberti has this 
effect on me: Can I have the address to send campaign contributions for 
Roberti? A man with that much grit and courage deserves my support.

 * What a great night! Starting from nothing and against Roberti reputedly 
spending over $590,000 and all the media parroting his fairy tales, we got 
twice the vote he predicted we would and we made sure this was the last time a 
charlatan like him will ever hold public office. And we, a pack of rank 
amateurs, did it all on a shoestring. Next time we won't be learning on the 
job, we will be better financed and we will win.  
</P>
<P>
 Please, please, everybody now sign the ballot initiative to outlaw political 
contributions and loans from outside the constituency to cut off the special 
interest money that is so corrupting the system. Let's make sure it's on the 
November ballot so that the political cleanup really can begin in earnest!

 * I'm unalterably opposed to Roberti's stand on gun control and just about 
everything else, yet I voted against his recall. Why? Because differing views 
should not be considered justification for a recall attempt. Talk about 
slippery slopes and unwarranted precedents. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course gun control is a "hotter" issue than mine; but isn't it time we 
begin to use our brains and not our emotions, and put emphasis on the true 
issues rather than escalating the false just because we want to arouse those 
emotions to have our own way?

IMMIGRATION AID: AT LAST, A BIT OF FAIRNESS; HOUSE SETS A PRECEDENT, BUT THE 
FEDERAL MYOPIA PERSISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At long last, California is going to get more federal aid to deal with the 
impact of some of the illegal immigrants residing here -- specifically those 
few who commit crimes that land them in state prisons. That's encouraging. 
What's decidedly discouraging is that Congress, in addressing this single, 
law-enforcement-related facet of immigration, was looking at the complex issue 
through a distorted lens. If Washington insists on such a myopic approach it 
will never find solutions. Certainly Californians will be gratified by 
Wednesday's overwhelming 402-22 House vote to help this state, and a handful of 
others, pay for the cost of incarcerating immigrant felons. The funds would be 
available starting in 1998. That's a problem: California needs the money now, 
so every effort should be made by our congressional delegation to move up the 
effective date of the legislation, preferably to the start of the next federal 
fiscal year in October. 
</P>
<P>
 That defect notwithstanding, the precedent that has been set must not be 
underestimated. Congress now has acknowledged that the federal failure to 
properly control U.S. borders has an adverse financial effect on certain states 
and has conceded that those states are entitled to help as a result. We hope 
this portends future federal aid to pay for other governmental services that 
are impacted by immigrants, such as public health care and education. However, 
dealing with the fundamental cause of these problems -- the continued illegal 
flow of foreigners to this country from abroad -- will take more than generous 
federal spending. It will take smart spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, in another crime-bill vote the House on Thursday showed little 
creativity in its thinking about border control. In almost knee-jerk fashion, 
it voted 417 to 12 to spend more than $900 million over the next five years to 
hire 6,000 new Border Patrol agents. That would more than double the patrol's 
manpower, now at 4,100 agents. 
</P>
<P>
 A beefed-up Border Patrol may sound good to those who fear the nation's 
frontiers are being overrun by illegal immigrants, but in fact the change would 
create as many problems as it would solve. The last time the Border Patrol was 
rapidly expanded, by the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, it wound up 
hiring too many agents too fast. Some proved incompetent, others brutal, a few 
corrupt. And, collectively, the new agents barely put a dent in the flow of 
illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 What Congress must do before dramatically expanding the Border Patrol again is 
to rethink precisely what the nation's border control problems, and labor 
needs, will be in the 21st Century, then focus on finding the modern 
technologies that can most effectively monitor the flow of people in and out of 
this country. 
</P>
<P>
 If it considers the issue carefully, rather than reacting emotionally, 
Congress is likely to come to the same conclusion its General Accounting Office 
reached years ago: that control of U.S. borders can be better achieved with 
computers and other high-tech devices than with more officers. At the very 
least, Congress owes it to the taxpayers to weigh that possibility before 
tossing more money at the Border Patrol in the forlorn hope that this somehow 
will make the immigration issue go away.

A PROMISING BUDGET OF MEASURED STEPS; IN LETTING GO OF MOST DIVISIVE IDEAS, 
MAYOR RIORDAN GROWS AS A POLITICAL LEADER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his proposed 1994-95 budget, Mayor Richard Riordan has come up with a basic 
"livability" quotient for Los Angeles: more police, better-paved streets, less 
graffiti, parks and libraries that remain open and functional. These are good 
goals. Riordan would achieve them through a series of governmental shake-ups, 
some welcome, some not so well thought out. But the best thing about the budget 
is what's not in it: a Los Angeles International Airport sale or lease scheme, 
which undoubtedly would have proved futile, or a contracting out of city 
sanitation jobs, which surely would have been the most socially divisive issue 
to hit City Hall in a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan wisely has taken a more measured step in privatization, recommending 
an experiment on the Westside in which firms would bid on issuing parking 
tickets, thus freeing city parking enforcement officers to perform other 
traffic duties. He proposes to raise more than $100 million by selling some 
assets of the Department of Water and Power, and by shifting expenses from the 
city general fund to some accounts of the well-funded Harbor and Airport 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest fight the budget will face in the City Council will be over sacred 
cows. Riordan recommends merging several city departments and eliminating one. 
Some of this makes sense: As important as is the work of agencies on aging, 
human relations and the status of women, is there no way for the city and the 
county to share information and staffs -- and costs -- in these areas? Turf 
protection alone is no rationale for maintaining separate city and county 
departments for everything. 
</P>
<P>
 Some city departments have unique functions -- the Community Redevelopment 
Agency and the Board of Public Works come to mind -- so major change might 
adversely affect the work they do. The proposed elimination of the full-time 
Public Works Board would save the city $1.1 million, but how much would be lost 
in terms of the board's dogged attention to illegal dumping and to ensuring 
that multimillion-dollar city contracts are fairly awarded? 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Riordan was elected on the promise that he would find a way to "turn 
L.A. around." That pledge meant different things to different people. It was 
reassuring to those who saw Los Angeles as a more dangerous and less friendly 
place than it used to be; it was disturbing to those who perceived a 
determination to turn back the clock on social and political gains for the 
growing minority populations. While Riordan's budget proposal shows his strong 
business leanings, it also demonstrates he's no ideologue hellbent on pushing 
pet proposals no matter what cost and what alienation might result. With this 
budget, the venture capitalist-lawyer is turning into a real politician. And 
for the mayor of 3.5 million people, that's no insult.

PROGRESS, DESPITE THE MIDEAST'S CHAOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Palestinian radicals try to blow up Israeli civilians and Israeli security 
forces make mass arrests of suspected radicals in sweeps through the West Bank 
and Gaza Strip. Palestinian youths attack Israeli soldiers and right-wing 
Israeli politicians denounce peace talks with the Palestine Liberation 
Organization as a threat to Israel's national life. This is the stuff of 
headlines and graphic pictures. But while the harsh and often deadly drama of 
daily confrontation goes on, so -- quietly and persistently -- does the 
infinitely complicated work of peacemaking. And peacemaking, it's now clear, 
has made great progress. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the repeated warnings of crises and impending breakdowns, Israel and 
the PLO could be within days of concluding an agreement for Palestinian 
self-rule in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho. Given the mutual 
concerns and suspicions that have led to every minor point in their talks being 
endlessly debated and minutely codified, that agreement bodes to be the 
approximate length of the U.S. tax code or the NAFTA accord. No matter. Soon -- 
perhaps by the end of next week, both sides say -- it will be ready. With that 
a monumental step in the history of the modern Middle East will be taken. And 
then, of course, will begin the next round of negotiations, launching a 
diplomatic enterprise whose duration probably will be measured in years. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Israel seems to be moving to broaden opportunities for progress. In 
an important statement Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said he was ready "for the 
sake of peace" to evacuate all Jewish settlements on the Golan Heights, 
captured from Syria in the 1967 war. That stops well short of meeting Syria's 
demand that Israel commit to a full withdrawal. But it sends a signal of such 
clear implicit intent that Syria, if in fact it wants a land-for-secure-peace 
agreement with Israel, can't afford to ignore. Next week Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher plans to tour Middle Eastern capitals to assess current 
moods and, undoubtedly, serve as the conduit for some sensitive communications. 
If an Israel-PLO agreement comes by then, it will put a lot of momentum behind 
his journey.

'SEX AND SIN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to "Sex and Sin: There Is a Difference," by Rabbi Michael Gotlieb, 
Commentary, April 14: 
</P>
<P>
 How can Rabbi Gotlieb preach the morality of premarital sex without mentioning 
the millions of children (and immortal souls) thus created? The possibility for 
creating children without two committed parents makes the act immoral. How can 
Gotlieb admit that "premarital sex is unholy," yet require our public schools 
to teach our children how to engage in this unholiness without risk?

WATER FOR THE HOPI

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thank you for your editorial on the plight of the Hopi tribe (April 16). To 
think that the Peabody Western Coal Co. continues using ground water to 
transport its coal when it may destroy a culture that has existed for almost a 
thousand years. And conservatives wonder why people still consider Big Business 
to be immoral!

...BUT GORAZDE DESPERATELY NEEDS AN ANTIDOTE; SIEGE: A RESIDENT IN A TOWN 
SUFFERING RELENTLESS SERB SHELLING DESCRIBES THE UNFOLDING TRAGEDY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By An international aid worker in the besieged Bosnian town of Gorazde sent 
this letter by satellite fax Thursday to colleagues in Zagreb, Croatia: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Greetings from early-morning Gorazde, where I am doing my watch and counting 
shells and small-arms fire. 
</P>
<P>
 By now, all of us are chronically frightened and break into acute anxiety 
several times each day. The BSA (Bosnian Serb army) gets special violent 
frenzies each day between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. Yesterday at 6 p.m., four shells 
landed in the locality of the United Nations Military Observers (UNMO) 
building, with two of them rocking it and spreading debris into the rooms 
upstairs where the refugees shelter. One blew a huge hole in the side wall of 
the building adjacent to us and a little boy lost both his legs. 
</P>
<P>
 We cannot go to the assistance of such cases, as it would be suicidal to face 
direct fire, but the local people used the U.N. car to bring him to the 
hospital. How many others were injured, we do not know but the fire raged in 
that building all night as a grim reminder to us of how close we came to direct 
hits. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the U.N. lads was passing the front door at the time and was blown 
across the hall but thankfully, uninjured. None of our little clan of refugees 
was injured either. 
</P>
<P>
 It is hard to hit this building directly as it is partially surrounded by 
others, but they are being demolished one by one. If this lasts long enough, it 
will be our turn. 
</P>
<P>
 We rarely leave the cellar now except to go to the toilet, which is on the 
first floor. The thought of meeting an artillery shell while on it has spread 
an epidemic of acute constipation among the cellar residents. A diet of 
crackers and cheese from ration packs will ensure the above is sustained. We 
have buckets in the back of the cellar if the worst comes to pass and house to 
house fighting forces us to lock ourselves into the sleeping room. It is the 
only secure place without any windows, but the door could be forced easily 
enough and there is no other exit. The horror of dying like rats trapped in a 
cellar is not far from all our thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
 The conditions for the refugees and residents in town is appalling. They have 
no food and have to risk their lives to get water. Most of them shelter in 
badly damaged buildings. The wet, foggy weather is no help. But worst of all is 
the constant shelling of the town; few have cellars suitable to protect against 
this.  
</P>
<P>
 One of the U.N.'s local workers and his wife were killed yesterday evening by 
a direct shell on their house in the right bank of the Drina. His two young 
children, a daughter, 12, and a son, 6, were not home at the time. They were 
brought to the UNMO building by neighbors last night. Their grief was 
heartbreaking to see. He is the second person we shared time with here to be 
killed this week. We feel so helpless in the face of the great tragedy for the 
people of Gorazde. Not a family has escaped death. One of the U.N. interpreters 
has just arrived here now and told me his brother-in-law was killed at 7 p.m. 
last night by a direct shell impact to his house right beside the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The only bright spot was the news last night that the Serbs are releasing 
their U.N. hostages and have returned some of the guns they seized back in 
Sarajevo. Maybe the Russians are putting severe pressure on Belgrade and Pale 
(site of the rebel Serbs' "Parliament"). Certainly, the only solution is a 
political one. 
</P>
<P>
 That is all from me as I am about finished duty now and will crawl back in the 
sleeping bag to kill a few more hours in sleep. All the very best.

PERSPECTIVE ON HISTORY; TV CAN BE A TEACHER WHEN IT GETS IT RIGHT; THE 
DOCUDRAMA 'WHEN LIONS ROARED' FAITHFULLY REFLECTED THE RECORD FOR A NATION 
LARGELY IGNORANT OF THE PAST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT DALLEK, Robert Dallek is a professor of history at UCLA and the 
author of several books, including studies of Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon 
B. Johnson. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thirty-five years of teaching U.S. history in major American universities has 
taught me that bright undergraduates, like most people in the country, don't 
know a lot of history. "What's this thing called the New Deal you keep 
referring to?" a genuinely interested student asked me a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 A national survey of 17- and 18-year-olds in the late 1980s showed that my 
student wasn't the only historically illiterate youngster on high school and 
college campuses. Forty percent of the sample didn't know what U.S. war had 
involved the issue of states' rights; 43% had no idea which side Russia had 
fought on in World War II; 45% couldn't identify Joseph Stalin's nationality; 
only 40% knew what NATO is, and an undisclosed number thought that Mexico and 
Canada were the last two states admitted to the Union. 
</P>
<P>
 This knowledge gap surely has something to do with the emphasis on race and 
gender rather than more traditional subjects in history courses. It is also the 
result of "popular" history, articles and books more concerned with sensational 
revelations than faithful reconstructions of the complexities that beset human 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Television, the medium through which most people continue to learn some 
history after their mandatory school courses, is a less than perfect way to 
educate Americans. PBS documentaries like "The Civil War" and "LBJ," one of 
several biographies sponsored by the American Experience, reach the 10% of the 
country already interested in and knowledgeable about the national experience. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the other 225 million Americans, they learn or relearn the country's 
past from docudramas, dramatizations of historical events and portrayals of 
famous personalities more intent on entertaining than informing. Most of these 
films reveal the producers' unspoken assumption that history is of small value 
alongside the need for a riveting story, however reductionist and distorted in 
the service of "reaching an audience." 
</P>
<P>
 What then are we to make of "World War II: When Lions Roared," a two-part 
documentary with actors -- Ed Begley Jr., Michael Caine, Bob Hoskins, John 
Lithgow and Jan Triska -- who are better known to the public now than the likes 
of Harry Hopkins and Vyacheslav M. Molotov? Cordell Hull, the longest-serving 
U.S. secretary of state, is so obscure a figure that he goes unmentioned in the 
film. But why should Hull have any part in a drama about World War II that 
includes nothing about Chiang Kai-shek or Charles de Gaulle or George Marshall 
or Dwight Eisenhower or the domestic struggle with the isolationists or the 
argument over whether Pearl Harbor genuinely surprised F.D.R. or the decision 
to build an atomic bomb or the tensions over industrial mobilization or the 
Holocaust or the incarceration of Japanese Americans? 
</P>
<P>
 It is easy to poke fun at "When Lions Roared." Hoskins, Caine and Lithgow are 
"trapped in impersonations that come perilously close to a not-very-inspired 
sketch on 'Saturday Night Live,' " the New York Times critic complained. 
</P>
<P>
 But whatever the film's limitations, it has some large virtues. It offers a 
healthy dose of historical realism -- about the wartime conflicts between 
Britain, Soviet Russia and the United States, and the burdens of leadership 
shouldered by Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin. David Rintels, the writer and 
producer, effectively captures Stalin's depression and immobilization 
immediately after Hitler's invasion of Russia in June, 1941. He accurately 
presents Churchill's determined efforts to draw Roosevelt and the United States 
into the fighting. And he clearly describes F.D.R.'s receptivity to joining the 
struggle against Hitler's assault on the Four Freedoms and civilized standards 
of behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 To his credit, Rintels has meticulously built his docudrama on the 
correspondence and conversations between the five leaders portrayed in the 
film. Their words faithfully reflect what they wrote and said to each other and 
demonstrate the contest of wills between the Big Three for what they believed 
would advance not only their mutual struggle against the Axis powers but also 
the postwar well-being of their respective nations. Rintels' Churchill, 
Roosevelt and Stalin, for all the makeup and contrived accents, come close to 
the real men now revealed in the rich historical record. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Lions Roared" probably does more to inform most Americans about aspects 
of that great struggle than anything else they are likely to read, hear and see 
in their lifetimes. I wish the film had done more. But as someone who 
passionately believes in the value of putting as much historical realism as 
possible before the mass of Americans, I am grateful to the film's producers 
for a job well done.

TO READERS OF HISTORY, BOSNIA IS POISON . . . ; FOREIGN POLICY: LYNDON JOHNSON 
WAS DESTROYED BY A WAR ENTERED WITH TOO LITTLE THOUGHT. CLINTON SHOULD RESIST 
THE CLAMOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK VALENTI, Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Assn. of 
America, was a special assistant to Lyndon Johnson. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It isn't necessarily so that one should pay attention to history lest one 
repeat it. But, as Damon Runyon would have commented, "That's the way to bet." 
</P>
<P>
 To my eye, tutored by intimate White House experience, President Clinton 
should be admired and supported for being reluctant to get this nation bogged 
down in excursions far from home, in unwholesome terrain amid uncongenial folks 
armed with guns and anger, however misguided we fathom them to be. Clinton 
obviously is a devoted reader of history. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who declare we have a world responsibility to incite democracy where 
none exists or to face down disruptions and disorders of the human spirit on 
whatever continent they occur should understand that the sum total of America's 
interests and obligations is much bigger than our capacity to defend them all 
simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
 I am one who lived through the dismal grind of Vietnam. I was there at the 
side of a President who found himself caught in an unwinnable mess that lost 
the support of the American people. Because he didn't heed the warnings of his 
inner political instincts but instead followed the counsel of those who urged 
him on, his presidency unraveled and his grasp on greatness softened and 
slipped. 
</P>
<P>
 President Lyndon Johnson learned that Americans soon grow tired of a confusion 
whose end is not in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 What is so hypnotic is that the cries about Bosnia pelting against the 
presidential chambers this very hour are the same sounds that caromed off the 
walls of the Cabinet Room during L.B.J.'s presidency. "We can't cut and run" . 
. . "Our credibility is at stake" . . . "We have obligations as the world 
leader" . . . and on and on. There is an absence of memory among the shouters 
and too many reminders of the Bourbon kings -- who never understood where they 
had been, which is why they never knew where they were going. 
</P>
<P>
 To what end do we aim in Bosnia? Geography and history illuminate it as a 
collection of societies inhabited by ancient feuds and the surliest of 
landscapes. No wonder that in World War II, 20 crack Nazi divisions were still 
stumbling over Yugoslavia in futile frustration when the war ended. 
</P>
<P>
 We weep at the brutal inhumanity being inflicted on innocent people. Our 
hearts break at the sight of suffering. But what shape will our hearts be in 
when the body bags of young American warriors start coming home? We cannot 
adjust the world to our frame of reference. We have neither the resources as a 
nation nor the tenacity as a people to absorb the pain required to settle all 
the global brawls, to staunch all the ethnic bloodletting, to repair all the 
imperfect governments, to pour spoonfuls of Uncle Sam's democratic elixir 
through the clenched teeth of unwilling societies. Does that mean we haul up 
the drawbridge, as good isolationist burghers are wont to do? Not at all. 
</P>
<P>
 What it does mean is if ever there appears a compelling need to intervene 
somewhere, the President has to make publicly clear the objectives we seek and 
why these objectives are in the long-range security interests of this country. 
Then he must make certain that whatever he does has the support of a majority 
of our people. Absent the last, the adventure is doomed. 
</P>
<P>
 One alternative is to quickly arm the Bosnians. And then sooner rather than 
later, enlist the world community to supply and fund the United Nations' 
blue-helmeted divisions, whose deployment would be authorized by the Security 
Council and under its command, and populate that force not with the armies of 
the various members but with volunteers from all countries, trained by 
professionals from member countries. Otherwise, the United States becomes the 
world policeman, dispatching its legions to faraway places and filling airport 
ramps with flag-draped coffins. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton's judgment is sound; he is far wiser than those who admonish 
him. Foreign policy is too important to be left to the experts. President 
Clinton was elected by the people. Let him exercise that responsibility. With 
great caution.

CAFE SOCIETY / HOLLYWOOD MOGULS: LONG LIVE THE '70S! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELE SEIPP 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Place: Hollywood Moguls (an art space, performance space, screening room 
and cafe), 1650 N. Hudson Ave., Hollywood; (213) 465-7449. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Atmosphere: Arty. This huge converted warehouse exudes a loftlike feel. 
Original artwork adorns the walls. Vintage lamps light cliques huddled in 
cushioned booths or couples perched on tall bar stools. They might order 
Italian sodas, coffees, artichoke dips, mashed potatoes or garlic bread. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Serving Up Style: Male servers with neat ponytails or messy neo-hippie hair 
wear sweet, open expressions, plaid lumberjack shirts, jeans and heavy boots. 
Female servers adopt a '70s retro look: bead and shell chokers, long navy tops 
pulled over hip-huggers, long tresses parted down the middle and, in a nod to 
the early '80s, streaked with blond in the front. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Customer Themes: Arty earnestness prevails. Reverent film buffs emerge hushed 
from screenings, blinking quietly behind the thick-framed, thick-lensed "nerd" 
glasses that are now hip. Others emerge speaking fervently in foreign accents 
and wearing brown leather jackets and black jeans. Acoustic-instrument fans in 
squashed '50s rain hats (with plaid bands) and dusty thrift-shop trench coats 
devotedly listen to the atonal rhythms of duets. French-waif types sit solo at 
the counter in their neat berets; striped, snug sweaters, and trim "Laura 
Petrie" pants. Or keep their distance from verbally assaultive performance 
artists while wearing puffier berets, '70s-style palazzo pants and long halter 
tops. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hair Apparent: Gleaming, shaved-clean bald heads; long, tangled tresses parted 
in the middle (men and women) and topped with little knit caps; tightly wound, 
teensy dreadlocks worn only on the crown and sometimes dyed yellow -- as in the 
case of longtime scenester and semi-permanent Moguls denizen Tequila 
Mockingbird. Neatly trimmed goatees. Lacquered bobs for the painted mannequin 
look. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Accessories: Chokers; Latin American fabric "wish" bracelets tied loosely; 
knit caps; oversized opal rings -- to flash while pointing out the continuity 
discrepancies between cult films "Eegah" and "Face of Terror"; African good 
luck shells in bracelets, necklaces and hair clips; events programs, 
cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cardinal Rule: If thou trieth to enter on the night of a private party, thou 
shalt nervously approach any person in the lobby and sayeth: "I'm on the list" 
-- even if thateth person doth not know whateth you're talking about. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Observations: A multifacetedness spills over from the space's eclectic events 
to the employees. The curly locked, sweet-faced young man who runs one of the 
film series also mans the projector, oversees espresso, tinkers with the sound 
system and even fixes customers' broken jewelry. "Here," he said one night, 
handing back a young woman's troubled faux pearl bracelet. "It was the flexing 
-- it should work now." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Overheard: "I don't want to interrupt you guys -- but when that guy sneezed, 
he simultaneously pulled his earlobe."

 Earth Day, Schmearth Day. We blame this season's mania for Metamucil-colored 
clothing on an ecological correctness movement run amok. It's not enough that 
we recycle -- we have to look bad, too? 
</P>
<P>
 A spring shopping spree this week found us wandering from one end of our 
favorite department store to another, lost in a sea of wheaty separates. 
</P>
<P>
 One too many pairs of drawstring pajama pants sent us screaming to the shoe 
department, where we found . . . wheaty espadrilles. Ugh.

 Photographer Terrible: Have we heard the last from Oliviero Toscani, whose 
images of HIV tattoos and blood-splattered soldiers' uniforms are used -- 
ostensibly -- to sell Benetton clothing? 
</P>
<P>
 Not likely. But Toscani did resign this week as creative director of the 
Italian company in a very public dispute with the publisher of Benetton's new 
magazine, Colors. "To understand business management, you need an education, 
you need to read books," said the magazine's managing director, Aldo Palmeri, 
"but Toscani's cultural level is simply subhuman." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the Vatican, several European nations and other offended parties would 
no doubt agree. Toscani told Reuters news service that his adversary, "like all 
accountants, knows nothing of creative work." 
</P>
<P>
 A Benetton spokeswoman said Toscani's resignation has neither been accepted 
nor rejected. Stay tuned.

 Can We Talk?: Before we had our own cel phone, we smirked at those obnoxious 
creatures who prattled on in public, especially in restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Now we find ourselves blathering along with the best of them. And so can the 
patrons of the new Chit Chat cafe (formerly the China Club) in West Hollywood. 
Patrons can talk amongst themselves on phones thoughtfully provided by the 
management. You'll need your cel phone for outside calls, though -- this is 
strictly a table-to-table network. 
</P>
<P>
 And if you like what you hear, you can send over a drink along with any one of 
three messages: "Are you single?" "Call me," or "Ditch your date." Hello!?

 This week, L.A. fashion insiders are buzzing about the appearance of our own 
Mayor Richard Riordan at Saturday night's California designers' show of their 
fall collections. The affair, at Downtown's Variety Arts Center, honors the 
30th anniversary of the CaliforniaMart and the 50th anniversary of California 
Apparel News, a trade publication. Among the 11 designers whose clothes will be 
shown are Van Buren, ISDA & Co. and Imaginary Concepts. No word yet on what the 
mayor will wear.

 A Salt-Free Diet: A New York research group has found that nearly 80% of 
Americans take tub baths instead of showers. And half of all bathing Americans 
add something to their bath water. (Use your imagination, but know that the 
survey was sponsored by the Epson Salt Industry Council.) 
</P>
<P>
 Women, not surprisingly, are twice as likely to add to their bath as men. But 
it was the regional breakdown that took us aback. While 68% of Chicago bathers 
and 40% of Eastern Seaboard bathers use additives, only 25% of us out West use 
anything beyond the tap. Guess we're not such sybarites after all.

 Making Hay the Cable Way: In his debut on the Home Shopping Club last 
Saturday, Rodeo retailer Fred Hayman wowed 'em in the heartland. For the cable 
TV shopping crowd, Hayman made less expensive versions of the jewelry and 
purses he makes for his store, and offered a new fragrance, Personal Selection 
FH. He sold 6,000 bottles of scent at $29.95 each. The 1,000 leather handbags 
(top price: $99.95) sold out. 
</P>
<P>
 On-air callers praised him erroneously for the fragrance Red (he'd sold the 
Giorgio fragrance business to Avon years before Red debuted), but the 
gentlemanly Swiss-born retailer took it in stride. He invited some of the 
callers to lunch if they were ever in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a different audience, certainly, than who we've catered to," he said 
before going on camera. "We're reaching people we've never reached." 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, but then there was that on-air call from Gloria DeHaven, retired 1940s 
movie star, who'd been a customer. "Still a Size 4?" Hayman pulled from his 
memory. Yes, she said, she still was.

 Model Talk: Amber Valleta, one of the prettiest of last season's waif crop, 
recently wed her photographer boyfriend at the appropriately pious New York hot 
spot, Club USA . . . Saks Fifth Avenue's Mother's Day catalogue showcases 
several models with their equally attractive offspring (or godchild, as in the 
case of Marisa Berenson). None is so striking as Rod Stewart's daughter and 
doppelganger, Ruby, by ex-flame Kelly Emberg . . . Well, as Linda Evangelista 
said, excusing herself from a fashion party recently, we've got to go and have 
our roots done.

MOVIE REVIEWS; 'CRONOS' ALIVE WITH CHARMS ETERNAL; MEXICAN WRITER-DIRECTOR 
GUILLERMO DEL TORO TURNS A FAMILIAR HORROR STORY INSIDE OUT TO CREATE A FRESH 
AND HUMOROUS TALE STRAIGHT FROM THE CRYPT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bela Lugosi may have made it look easy, but being one of the undead, "Cronos" 
insists, is hardly a simple thing. It can be a lonely state, painful but also 
crazily comic in a charming if grotesque way. It's all on view in this pleasant 
and spooky film that gives surprising new life, so to speak, to a genre that 
won't die. 
</P>
<P>
 The first feature by 29-year-old Mexican writer-director Guillermo del Toro, 
"Cronos" exemplifies the good things that can happen when adventurous 
filmmakers choose to investigate traditional forms. Winner of both the Critics 
Week competition at Cannes and nine Ariels, Mexico's Academy Awards, "Cronos" 
surprises with its sophisticated and spirited look at a tale straight from the 
crypt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cronos" opens with a prologue, detailing the strange history of an alchemist 
who fled the Spanish Inquisition to Veracruz in 1536 in order to continue 
working on his plans for a machine that granted eternal life, a machine he 
called the Cronos Device. Four hundred years later, the alchemist dies in a 
freak accident and though his mansion and its contents are sold, the portentous 
narrator informs, no mention was ever made of this device and "as far as anyone 
knew, it never existed." 
</P>
<P>
 Existing as well without any knowledge of all this is Jesus Gris (Frederico 
Luppi), a gray-haired antiques dealer in today's Veracruz who lives perhaps too 
quietly with his wife (Margarita Isabel) and his mostly silent granddaughter 
Aurora (Tamara Shanath). 
</P>
<P>
 One day, his attention drawn to a figure of an archangel in his shop, Jesus 
discovers a wondrous mechanical gold egg inside, an impressively elaborate 
mechanism that makes a fine, creaky sound when it's wound up and also does 
strange and insidious things to its owner once it is fully operational. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he can figure out quite how it works, Jesus and the device attract the 
attention of the sinister De la Guardias. Though concerned, in one of the 
film's many oddball touches, with a forthcoming nose job, nephew Angel (Ron 
Perlman) is basically the muscle, following the orders of his obsessed uncle 
Dieter (Claudio Brook). 
</P>
<P>
 A Howard Hughes type, Dieter lives in a germ-free environment, listening to 
opera and dreaming of life eternal. Forty years earlier, Dieter found the 
Cronos Device's instruction manual and now he wants the item itself, which he 
warns Jesus, should never be used without proper guidance. But Jesus, already 
addicted to the machine's frightening, hypnotic actions, cannot turn back. 
</P>
<P>
 With this as the buildup, "Cronos" goes on to tell the story of how Jesus 
deals both with the De la Guardias and the device, which, we gradually and 
deliciously come to understand, is turning him into a vampire. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a mark of what makes this old-fashioned story so clever that this 
realization does manage to sneak up on us. Director Del Toro takes pleasure in 
turning the familiar horror story inside out, dispensing with the evil vampire 
of legend and concentrating on how an understandable desire for youth leads an 
average citizen into decidedly irregular paths. 
</P>
<P>
 One of "Cronos' " most characteristic features is its fondness for 
over-the-top Grand Guignol scenes that both graphically and comically 
illustrate the wear and tear of vampiredom, how bad it is for the complexion, 
for instance, how grueling and tiring it can be not to die even when 
circumstances make you wish for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Though veteran Latin American star Luppi gives a poignant and amusing 
performance as a man trapped by his obsession, the real centerpiece of this 
film is writer-director Del Toro, who's made a droll film out of what is often 
exploitation material. Edgar Allan Poe with a sense of humor, Del Toro not only 
has fun mixing genres, he knows how to convey his enjoyment and make the result 
distinctly his own. With any luck he'll have a creative life as long as any 
vampire's. 
</P>

horror variety as well as scenes of physical violence.

FIRST STOP, LONDON; BARBRA STREISAND OPENS TOUR WITH SENTIMENTAL STINT AT 
WEMBLEY ARENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF KAYE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Barbra Streisand told a fanatical crowd of well-heeled Brits on Wednesday 
night that had she been nicer to Prince Charles when she met him on a film set 
in 1972, "I might have been the first real Jewish Princess." 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand opened her six-city tour in jam-packed 12,000-seat Wembley Arena, 
offering a virtual duplicate of a show she tried out in Las Vegas. In a 
sentimental performance -- the first of four here -- she talked about life, 
love and politics, taught a little Yiddish and offered velvety renditions of 
songs spanning her career. 
</P>
<P>
 It was kind of like Woodstock for people in suits and stylish dresses -- a 
convergence of those who feel "The Way We Were" and "You Don't Bring Me 
Flowers" speak directly to them. 
</P>
<P>
 The British fans, who had swamped box-office phone lines to pay a top price of 
nearly $400 for tickets, sat quietly and respectfully during the patter and 
whooped with abandon as they recognized each new song, often rising to their 
feet in cheers. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday morning's press reviews of Streisand's show were nearly all 
favorable. "People . . . people who had tickets were the luckiest people in 
town," said the Daily Express. But a reviewer in the Daily Mail panned the show 
under the headline "The Great Lady Fails to Impress." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all reviews poked fun at Streisand's reliance on giant TelePrompTers 
hanging from the ceiling. These scrolled not only song lyrics, but stage chat 
that would have otherwise seemed ad-libbed. 
</P>
<P>
 A reporter for Britain's most notorious tabloid, the Sun, said his newspaper 
was thinking of heading its report "Karaoke Babs." In the end, though, it 
called her "Princess Babs" and said that she "stunned a star-studded audience 
with a world-beating performance." 
</P>
<P>
 After the London shows, the tour moves to the United States May 10 and 12 in 
Washington for the start of a five-city U.S. swing that includes six dates at 
the Anaheim Pond starting May 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand had not performed in Britain since 1966, when she appeared in the 
West End cast of "Funny Girl." Tickets then sold for 2.25 -- about $3.40 at 
today's conversion rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Her Wembley show, which lasted just over two hours with an intermission, also 
featured clips from her films and photo montages of her son and goddaughter. 
She was backed by a 68-piece orchestra conducted by Marvin Hamlisch. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the show she joked with the crowd, "People have been asking me, 'Why 
are you touring after 28 years?' and I tell them that if they came from 
California, between the earthquakes, the mudslides and the fires, they would 
end up on tour too." 
</P>
<P>
 Babsmania has gripped Britain since tickets for her four concerts here went on 
sale last month. The newspapers were indignant at first about the extravagant 
ticket prices -- the highest for a non-charity concert in British history. But 
they quickly joined in the hoopla with bubbly features about Streisand's 
amazing appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Middle-of-the-road radio stations put her albums into high rotation. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports of scalpers getting astronomical prices for tickets appear to have 
been overblown, though. For weeks, newspapers have reported that top-price 
tickets were changing hands for 800 ($1,200), a figure reported so frequently 
and so confidently it seemed to have come from a government accounting office. 
</P>
<P>
 But just before Wednesday night's concert, scalpers were desperately hawking 
tickets at a fraction of their face value. The 260 ($390) tickets were being 
offered for 50 ($75), while the 105 ($157.50) tickets were going for 20 ($30) 
each. 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand's British fans proved to be as slavishly devoted as their American 
counterparts. Among them was Brenda Inwards who, suffering from tonsillitis and 
the flu, ignored her doctor's advice and made the journey from distant Leighton 
Buzzard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thirty years I've waited," she said, gasping for breath. "I'm not going to 
miss this." 
</P>
<P>
 In the front row sat Linda and Stewart Coburn of Hertfordshire, who scored 
their prized seats through a clever and strenuous plan that involved driving to 
London one night to get the early edition of the newspaper printing the special 
box-office phone number. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a lifelong ambition to see her," said Linda Coburn. 
</P>
<P>
 Added her husband, who paid nearly $1,600 for four tickets, "I'm looking 
forward to my next holiday in the year 2002." 
</P>
<P>
 * Streisand's Anaheim Pond concerts are sold out, but tickets are available 
through selected charities: May 25, National Resources Defense 
Council/Pesticide Campaign, (310) 996-1188; May 27, Alliance for Children's

LATE-NIGHT WAR: WHO GETS HALL'S TIME SLOTS?; TELEVISION: ARSENIO HALL'S FINAL 
ORIGINAL SHOW AIRS MAY 27, AND NEW SERIES ARE JOCKEYING FOR POSITION AND 
PROMINENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jon Stewart, the host of a 6-month-old midnight talk show on MTV, received an 
early morning wake-up call from his manager Wednesday. The New Yorker was fast 
asleep in a Santa Monica hotel, where he has been staying while shooting scenes 
as an in-line skater in a comedy film being directed by Nora Ephron. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Secunda told Stewart that he had made the front pages of Daily Variety 
and the Hollywood Reporter. They were touting him as the hip replacement for 
late-night talk-show host Arsenio Hall, who pulled the plug the day before on 
his low-rated, syndicated program after five years for Paramount Domestic 
Television. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jon was just dumbstruck," Secunda related in an interview later. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart does have a meeting scheduled next week with Paramount -- which was 
recently acquired by Viacom Inc., the parent company of MTV Networks -- but it 
had been arranged before Hall announced his bailout. Secunda said there have 
been no discussions -- and certainly no deal -- with Paramount to take over for 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet TV station groups report that Paramount was talking to them Wednesday 
about plans for a new talk show starring Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely," said Jack Fentress, programming vice president for Petry 
Television, which consults a group of 115 stations on programming decisions. 
"Paramount is out on the street now, with certain station groups, trying to put 
deals together to hold on to Arsenio's time slots. I got a call from Paramount 
a couple hours ago about it. They don't have a tape of the show yet, but they 
say they will in a week or 10 days." 
</P>
<P>
 After months of relative calm in late-night television, where nearly $500 
million a year is spent in advertising, Hall's abrupt decision to leave -- 
announced Monday -- has stirred up a new storm. Hall, once a dominant force in 
the field, will broadcast his final original show on May 27 before going to 
reruns through the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, two late-night syndicated entries scheduled to debut in the fall are 
stepping up their efforts to secure Hall's time slots on 160 stations across 
the country. "Last Call" and "The Newz" are both half-hour comical takeoffs on 
the day's headlines, aimed at young adults and designed to serve as 
counter-programming to local news and talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have already received six or eight new markets since Arsenio's 
announcement," said Barry Thurston, president of Columbia TriStar Television 
Distribution. Propelled by the momentum, he gave a firm production commitment 
this week for 90 episodes of "The Newz," featuring an ensemble cast performing 
sketch parodies of news events. "About 30% of our lineup of stations now carry 
Arsenio Hall. So this will affect us quite dramatically." 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that he's gone out of business, it never hurts to have an extra customer 
available in the markets to which we're selling," said Shelly Schwab, president 
of MCA TV, which is syndicating "Last Call." "Many stations now have an hour 
hole to fill, and those stations will naturally contact those distributors who 
have developed shows for late night." 
</P>
<P>
 Created by Brandon Tartikoff, the former president of NBC Entertainment, "Last 
Call" features panelists in a studio offering humorous commentary on current 
events and interviewing celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
 Other syndicated programs competing for time in late night include the new 
magazine series "Entertainment News Television," "Top Cops," "Real Stories of 
the Highway Patrol" and a host of existing magazine, tabloid and talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall's contract with Paramount was up at the end of the year, and most in the 
syndication industry expected his show to be canceled then because of a steady 
decline in ratings and profits. But his decision to leave now, on his own 
timetable -- "He wasn't going to ride a sinking ship," one insider explained -- 
seems to have caught the industry off guard -- including Paramount, where 
executives have refused to comment on the situation all week. 
</P>
<P>
 Secunda and others said they were amazed to hear that station groups were 
speaking to Paramount about a syndicated talk show hosted by Stewart for 
September. Normally, a new syndicated show might begin development nearly a 
year before its debut. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the show was that good, or if this guy was that hot, Paramount would have 
done either one of two things," said a competing syndicator. "They would have 
(either) designed a show for him before this, or they would have held him for 
January, 1995, in order to give him a complete shot. What they're doing is 
damage control, no matter who they choose to succeed Arsenio. I defy anyone to 
mention a successful show when someone has force-fed a personality to keep the 
time periods tied up." 
</P>
<P>
 A Paramount talk show featuring Stewart would be a natural evolution, 
following Viacom's $10-billion acquisition of Paramount Communications Inc. in 
February to form a global colossus. "Obviously this is the first step in the 
Viacom-MTV-Paramount synergy, of which we will see a lot more," said Dick 
Kurlander, an executive with Petry Television. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Paramount does not have an instant replacement for "Arsenio," 
observers in the industry said stations would be wise to foster a good 
relationship with the new entertainment giant. KCOP-TV Channel 13 in Los 
Angeles has already purchased both "The Newz" and "Last Call" for late night, 
but station manager Rick Feldman said: "We have a very close relationship with 
Paramount, and I'm eager to listen to anything they have to say." 
</P>
<P>
 Secunda insisted that he knows nothing about a Paramount show. Stewart's 
contract with Viacom, which runs through this year, includes "The Jon Stewart 
Show" on MTV and a couple of Showtime comedy specials. Stewart has plans to 
return to New York the first week of May to resume shooting the third six-week 
block of his talk show, which premiered last October to solid reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the moment, we're committed to MTV," Secunda said. "As far as knowing 
anything else, or being involved in any discussions, there haven't been any. 
And that's the bottom line." 
</P>
<P>
 There has been speculation that Fox, which failed miserably last year with its 
own late-night entry, "The Chevy Chase Show," might now try to push up its 
search for a replacement in order to prevent its affiliated stations from 
signing binding contracts with other syndicated shows once "Arsenio" winds 
down. About 70 of the 160 stations airing "Arsenio" are Fox affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is no such rush, said Adam Ware, Fox's vice president of affiliate 
relations on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Late night is not a priority right now at Fox, which is starting a sports 
division from scratch to air NFL National Conference football for the first 
time. "The focus here in the near future is the NFL, and that will take us 
through the fall at least," Ware said. 
</P>
<P>
 In their affiliation agreements, the Fox TV stations signed a commitment to 
run all the programming Fox provides them for certain time periods, including 
weekdays 11 p.m. to midnight. When Fox stations sign up for new syndicated 
programs in late night, most of them are drafting a "Fox first" clause, 
allowing them to bump whatever program they've bought once Fox comes up with a 
late-night franchise of its own, probably in early 1995.

MOVIE REVIEWS; 'BAD GIRLS': A HIGH-FASHION WESTERN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They swear and carouse and kick up dust. They charge across the crimson 
horizon on their trusty steeds. They blast grown men right out of their 
skivvies with their pistols. They wear color-coordinated outfits. They're the 
Bad Girls of "Bad Girls" but they're really Good Girls, or at least Good Bad 
Girls. Whatever righteous wrath they expend, however smudged their cheeks, they 
always manage to look as stylish as a fashion catalogue layout for Hot Nights 
in the Old West. 
</P>
<P>
 The timing for this film is right: This is the movie era for women with guns 
and an attitude. "Bad Girls" combines the renascence of the Western with 
post-"Thelma & Louise" syndrome. It displays four of our busiest and most 
popular actresses -- Madeleine Stowe, Andie MacDowell, Mary Stuart Masterson 
and Drew Barrymore -- in a vehicle as form-fittingly tailored for them as "The 
Magnificent Seven" was for its actors. The high concept is preposterously 
low-slung and amusing -- even more so because director Jonathan Kaplan plays 
the material straight. He's trying to be John Ford in designer jeans. 
</P>
<P>
 Audiences may not enjoy this movie in quite the way it was intended -- as some 
kind of revisionist feminist spree -- but that's all right. Sometimes movies 
are enjoyable for all the wrong reasons. What's ticklish about "Bad Girls" is 
how it shoehorns feminist anger into a plot that amply provides for stylish 
sashaying. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bad Girls begin the movie as prostitutes in a Bible-Belted Colorado town, 
which they flee after their leader, Cody Zamora (Stowe), plugs an unruly 
customer. Chased by two Pinkerton detectives into Texas, the girls set their 
sights on a sawmill that Anita (Masterson) thinks could be turned into a 
thriving business. (She had planned to purchase the homestead with her husband 
before he died of cholera and she became a prostitute.) 
</P>
<P>
 The sawmill idea meets with surprisingly little resistance. "We sold our 
bodies," says one of the girls. "Why can't we sell some wood?" This is the 
spirit that made the West. (A friend referred to this part of the film as 
"Fried Green Tamales.") But en route to the mill complications ensue. Cody's 
grubstake gets swiped by the scurvy, stubbly bandido (James Russo) she used to 
run around with. (He flourishes a whip and, in a modest skinny-dip scene, we 
see the lash marks on her back.) Eileen (MacDowell) gets captured and jailed 
but makes googly eyes at her jailer, William Tucker (James LeGros), and escapes 
into the night. 
</P>
<P>
 A handsome stranger (Dermot Mulroney) keeps popping up for Cody at the most 
opportune moments, helping to treat her back wounds and heartaches. He's quite 
possibly the most Liberated Guy in Western movie history -- a Shane with 
sensitivity training. He could care less that Cody is characterized on the 
reward posters as the Honky Tonk Harlot. 
</P>
<P>
 It helps, of course, that, with the exception of Tucker, all the other men in 
this movie, most notably Robert Loggia's Frank Jarrett, seem to be out of a Sam 
Peckinpah road company. This reinforces the film's feminist point: Times were 
tough for single women on the range. As a breed, men were sadistic scamps. The 
Bad Girls bring them into line with pistol and Gatling gun. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason you can't take the revisionism in this movie all that seriously -- 
besides the have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too fashion prancing -- is because Kaplan 
keeps hauling up buckets of hoary Western cliches. If you're going to rework a 
genre, a good place to start is with the dialogue, and there are far too many 
lines in this movie like the one where Cody looks longingly at her old lover 
and says, "We had some times, didn't we?" (At least we're spared seeing those 
times in flashback.) The film could use more scenes like the dirty-nasty one 
where the girls skin snakes for dinner and Cody says, "Can't tell one meat from 
another -- just like men." Screenwriters Ken Friedman and Yolande Finch may 
have had more interesting ideas than the ones that ended up in "Bad Girls." The 
scenario seems hemmed in by the usual Hollywood honcho fears that the women 
might actually show some rough edges, some rage -- might actually be (gasp) 
unsympathetic . 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the life-is-tough stuff, all the Bad Girls, save Cody, seem oddly 
untouched by the mayhem. MacDowell's beatific smiles are the same ones she's 
been proffering in movie after movie -- she's starting to seem more than a bit 
ga-ga. Barrymore could be posing for a new perfume -- Hellcat, perhaps? 
</P>
<P>
 Stowe, however, invests so much passion in her role that she single-handedly 
keeps the film honest -- at least whenever she's on screen. Her rage in this 
film is the real thing. It's an extraordinary performance, but then Stowe is 
often extraordinary. When will she get a starring role in a movie that really 
challenges her? She has the ability to transcend pulp even as she exposes it. 
It's a great gift to have in a cruddy movie era but putting Stowe behind a 
Gatling gun is not, to put it gently, the best use of her talents.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: THE MEDIA'S WHITEWATER RIDE SINKS; TELEVISION: AS THE PRESS 
WEIGHS IN ON COVERAGE OF THE SCANDAL, MORE PIZAZZ THAN TRUTH EMERGES. ABC'S 
'VIEWPOINT' TURNED OUT TO BE A FIASCO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 And the Lord said, "Forget light. Let there be pizazz." 
</P>
<P>
 The mainstream media often operate like a daytime talk show that devotes 75% 
of an hour to exposing and slopping around in the dysfunction of its guests, 
then brings on an advice-giving therapist to clean up the mess. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to Whitewater coverage, this is now the mess-cleaning phase. 
</P>
<P>
 Coverage of the Whitewater hubbub is now getting to be almost as controversial 
and is receiving almost as much attention as Whitewater itself. Has there been 
too much? Too little? Has the reporting been fair or unfair? You know the 
terrain. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, C-SPAN carried a Washington print journalists' forum on the topic, 
moderated by Steve Roberts of U.S. News & World Report. With him were 
Washington Post columnist Mary McGrory, Alan Murray of the Wall Street Journal, 
Francis Coombs of the Washington Times, Stan Crock of Business Week, Ellen Hume 
of the Annenberg School of Communications, media specialist Larry Sabato of the 
University of Virginia and Jody Powell, who was press secretary under President 
Jimmy Carter. A pretty fair mix, though Powell's credentials as an objective 
observer wobble like gelatin. 
</P>
<P>
 You get the impression that journalists who participate in these televised 
self-awareness clinics -- offering occasional mea culpas and nodding knowingly 
about the foibles of media -- afterward return to their jobs and robotically 
get back to business as usual. Yet this one was reasoned and informative, all 
in all a relatively calm, introspective and arresting session that may have 
given viewers some insight into the process of spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
 Media coverage of it, media making of it. 
</P>
<P>
 The verdict on Whitewater coverage was sort of split down the middle, with the 
media-attacking Powell making an especially valid point about the press being 
much less diligent about regularly covering its own missteps than those of 
other great and powerful institutions. Fascinating. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of missteps, though, later that same evening ABC News weighed in on 
Whitewater coverage, with Ted Koppel chairing a wee-hours "Viewpoint" 
discussion at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa. On paper, it was a good 
idea. As information, though, it turned out to be a fiasco. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel (whose initial salvos were later followed by mostly partisan 
questions from the studio audience) included ABC News correspondent Brit Hume; 
Bob Bartley, editorial page editor of the Wall Street Journal; Geneva 
Overholser, editor of the Des Moines Register; attorney and First Amendment 
specialist Floyd Abrams and Max Frankel, outgoing executive editor of the New 
York Times. Reasonable choices, though heavily tilted in support of aggressive 
Whitewater coverage, with the exception of Abrams. 
</P>
<P>
 Deployed as centerpieces of this round-table, however, were shrill, knee-jerk, 
hyperbolizing political partisans James Carville and Rush Limbaugh, the latter 
participating by satellite. Sweet, lovable guys? Of course. Do you even have to 
ask? 
</P>
<P>
 Except that Carville is the Democratic Party eel who steered President 
Clinton's White House campaign and who now functions as a presidential adviser. 
Whatever his boss and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton do, he publicly 
endorses. Bank on it. 
</P>
<P>
 And Limbaugh is the conservative comedian/radio and TV personality who never 
met an anti-Clinton slur he didn't like. Whatever the President and First Lady 
do, he publicly opposes. Bank on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, what great choices to headline a dispassionate, illuminating tour of the 
ins and outs of Whitewater coverage. Inevitably, "Viewpoint" essentially became 
a partisan war between the predictable Carville and Limbaugh -- including a 
shrill fight about Clinton policy -- with ABC at times seeking to maximize its 
two stars by presenting them on split screen. 
</P>
<P>
 What did all of this point/counterpoint burlesque have to do with media 
coverage? Often times nothing, unless you count what it said about the way some 
in the media examine media coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 That included Overholser concluding, in effect, that the studio audience's 
interest in Whitewater exemplified the general public's curiosity about the 
subject, which, in turn, validated the intensity of Whitewater reporting. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a classic. In other words, it goes this way: The press creates and 
nourishes a story. Once in the public arena, that story proceeds to take on a 
life of its own. Then the press uses the controversy it created as 
justification for its coverage, regardless of the story's disputed news value. 
</P>
<P>
 If that has the ring of exotic doublespeak, then consider Limbaugh's 
"Viewpoint" denial of any responsibility for helping spread wild rumors 
concerning the suicide of White House attorney Vincent Foster. It was on March 
10 that Limbaugh told his millions of listeners to "brace yourselves" for the 
contents of a fax he'd received saying a Washington consultant firm was about 
to charge that Foster "was murdered in an apartment owned by Hillary Clinton, 
and the body was then taken to Fort Mercy Park." 
</P>
<P>
 Following a commercial break, Limbaugh repeated what he now said was "rumor," 
that a report would be published saying Foster's "suicide was not a suicide." 
</P>
<P>
 Much later in his broadcast, he attributed the "rumor" to an item in a 
newsletter from the Washington firm of Johnson Smick, which he said claimed 
that Foster had taken his life in an apartment owned by White House associates, 
and that his body was later moved to the park where it was discovered. Thus, 
the newsletter had not mentioned an alleged murder or the First Lady. And what 
it did charge -- a body-moving conspiracy -- has never been substantiated. 
</P>
<P>
 Even giving Limbaugh the benefit of the doubt and crediting him for ultimately 
moderating the various versions of his "brace yourselves" bulletin, sending 
such wild speculation across the airwaves under any label was reckless. After 
all, many of his listeners accept everything that comes from his lips as fact. 
</P>
<P>
 More importantly, meanwhile, was "Viewpoint" throbbing, electrifying 
television or what? "One of the reasons we asked you on," Koppel acknowledged 
good-naturedly to Carville and Limbaugh during a break in the din, "was that we 
knew you'd bring a little pizazz to the program." 
</P>
<P>
 Compared with C-SPAN, much pizazz, little light.

 'seaQuest' Renewed: Capping a banner year for Steven Spielberg, NBC on 
Thursday renewed its Sunday night underwater adventure series, "seaQuest DSV," 
co-produced by Spielberg's Amblin Television, for next season. The series, 
which goes head-to-head with the indomitable "Murder, She Wrote" at 8 p.m., 
ranks only 83rd in the year-to-date national Nielsens. But NBC on Thursday 
called the show a "self-starter," noting it has done well with young-adult 
viewers and was one of three new drama series nominated this year for a 
"People's Choice Award."

 * No Boost for 'Tom': If the marital rift between Roseanne and Tom Arnold is a 
publicity stunt, as some suspect, it does not seem to be prompting added 
interest in Tom Arnold's struggling CBS series, "Tom." The show came in last 
again in its 8:30 p.m. Wednesday time slot, and drew almost identical ratings 
to the previous week's episode. "Tom" last week drew 10% of the available 
audience, as it did Wednesday. Roseanne Arnold on Monday filed for divorce, 
alleging emotional and physical abuse. PEOPLE WATCH

 DeLuise Charged: Actor Dom DeLuise has been charged with criminal sexual 
contact based on a complaint from a male casino employee in Atlantic City, 
N.J., who alleges DeLuise touched him in a sexual way. DeLuise was charged 
Friday, Atlantic City police said. The incident allegedly occurred March 26 
while DeLuise was a guest at Merv Griffin's Resorts Casino Hotel. The employee 
was not identified, and police declined to elaborate. DeLuise, 60, denied any 
wrongdoing and wasn't taken into custody.

for AIDS Project Los Angeles and other AIDS groups. The annual event, held at 
the Los Angeles Sports Arena, is expected to draw about 7,000 participants, who

 Arts Funding Update: Mayor Richard Riordan's $4.3-billion municipal budget, 
presented Wednesday to the City Council, includes no significant new reductions 
in allocations for the city's Cultural Affairs Department, according to a 
department spokeswoman. However, because the department suffered a substantial 
cut last September -- as well as the ongoing problem of declining arts revenues 
from the city's "bed tax" -- Cultural Affairs will see its 1993-94 budget of 
$9.4 million drop to $8.1 million for 1994-95, she said. Meanwhile, at the 
state level, members of a Senate subcommittee have recommended elimination of 
the California Arts Council budget, which has been targeted for elimination in 
the past but has so far retained its funding. A Senate budget hearing on the 
issue is scheduled for Wednesday.

 New Coronet Programming: New York producer James Freydberg is taking a lease 
on the 279-seat Coronet Theatre, one of L.A.'s most prominent mid-sized 
theaters, beginning Sept. 1. He plans to use the La Cienega Boulevard theater 
for imports from New York, as well as exports to New York, probably beginning 
with his current New York show, "Blowin' Sideways Through Life." He was one of 
the producers of "Wrong Turn at Lungfish," which played the Coronet in 1992. He 
also co-produced "Fool Moon" and "Burn This."

30-minute documentary, to be called "Citizen Stern: The Road to Albany," debuts 
Monday. The cable network is billing coverage of Stern's campaign as "the most 
serious thing we've ever done." . . . Fox's sketch comedy series "In Living 
Color" holds an open audition for new cast members on Saturday, from 10 a.m. to 
5 p.m. at the Sunset Gower Studios (1415 N. Gordon St.). . . . "Fox Morning 
News" anchor Tony McEwing expands his duties today to become co-anchor of Fox's 
7-9 a.m. program, "Good Day L.A." McEwing, who joins co-anchors Susan Lichtman 
and Mark Thompson, replaces Antonio Mora, who left the program in February for 
a position with ABC's "Good Morning America." . . . That final "L.A. Law" hour 
May 19 might not be its last after all. The show's production company, 
Twentieth TV, is trying to persuade NBC to air a really final two-hour "L.A. 
Law" TV movie next season. . . . Sinbad and Vanessa Williams will host the 1994 
Essence Awards, an annual special celebrating the achievements of outstanding 
African Americans. Honorees include Eddie Murphy, Spike Lee, Quincy Jones, 
Denzel Washington and the Rev. Jesse Jackson. The special airs June 6 on Fox.

KMPC MOVES FROM LOCKER ROOM TO NEW TALK FORMAT; RADIO: THE SPORTS STATION WILL 
SWITCH NEXT MONTH TO FAMILIAR VOICES AIMED AT A YOUNGER AUDIENCE. IT WILL 
COMPETE WITH KFI FOR LISTENERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sports station KMPC-AM (710) will change to a talk format the first week of 
May and will feature several voices already well known to Southern California 
radio listeners. 
</P>
<P>
 Dubbed "710 Talk," the station will fill its morning slot with Peter Tilden 
and Tracey Miller, who currently have an afternoon talk show at KABC-AM (790), 
and the afternoon drive-time slot with former KFI-AM (640) talk host Tom 
Leykis. 
</P>
<P>
 KMPC was recently bought from Gene Autry by Capital Cities Communications, 
which owns KABC-AM and KLOS-FM (95.5). The station had adopted its 
sports-oriented format in April, 1992, but the move turned out to be a ratings 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 The new format will begin in waves. On Monday, May 2, Leykis goes on from 3 to 
7 p.m. Filling in the remaining hours will be a variety of "produced vignettes" 
that preview the kind of programs to be heard on the station, as well as open 
auditions for talent. The auditions are intended largely as a publicity stunt, 
but station officials said dynamic performers may be hired for weekend slots. 
</P>
<P>
 The remainder of the weekday lineup will begin May 9. It will include the 
married couple of Leslie Pam and Ann Christie from 10 a.m. to noon, talking 
about relationships and sexuality; Republican and Latino activist Xavier 
Hermosillo from 7 to 9 p.m.; and from 9 to midnight, Tavis Smiley and Reuben 
Navarrete, both of whom have appeared on KABC-AM. Hermosillo also has had a 
weekend show on KABC-AM. 
</P>
<P>
 Still unfilled Thursday was the noon-to-3 p.m. weekday slot. 
</P>
<P>
 KMPC will continue to broadcast games of the California Angels, Los Angeles 
Clippers and Los Angeles Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, KABC reportedly plans to replace Tilden and Miller in the afternoon 
with either a sports talk show or a general-interest show with regular fill-in 
hosts Steve Edwards and Joel Roberts. KMPC afternoon-drive host Joe McDonnell 
has also been interviewed at KABC, according to sources.  
</P>
<P>
 The new KMPC, with its talk format aimed at a younger audience than now sister 
station KABC, will be competing with KFI, which ranked fourth among all Los 
Angeles-area stations in the quarterly Arbitron ratings released this week. 
(KABC was in fifth place.) 
</P>
<P>
 KFI officials said they are ready for another competitor and downplayed the 
possibility that fans of Leykis may tune out KFI and tune in KMPC. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ratings of the whole radio station have about doubled starting the month 
Leykis left, so I guess that speaks for itself," said KFI program director 
David Hall. "We at the station have soared to new heights and never looked 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 Leykis' first guest will be former Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, 
who replaced Leykis when he was fired from KFI in September, 1992. (Two months 
later, Gates' show was scaled back and the team of John Kobylt and Ken Chiampou 
was put into Leykis' former slot.)

WITH OR WITHOUT PARENTS: 'REINA' TELLS ABOUT EXPRESSING FEELINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What if there were a country where people weren't allowed to be happy or sad, 
and another where citizens veered from laughter to woe in an instant? In the 
Bilingual Foundation of the Arts' new musical comedy "Reina," Teatro Para Los 
Ninos latest educational touring show, children get the message: It's important 
to know how to express your feelings and respect the feelings of others.  
</P>
<P>
 Performed by a multiethnic cast and written by Desiree and Stefane Zamorano, 
with music and lyrics by Terry Hastings, the musical is an inclusive mix of 
English and Spanish, movement, music and dance aimed at grade-school-age 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every concept is repeated in both languages in different ways," said Carmen 
Zapata, the foundation's artistic director. "So a child who is monolingual can 
understand the show. The idea is that nobody feels left out." 
</P>
<P>
 The show's theme is important, Zapata said. "Children very often are inhibited 
and afraid to express what they feel because they're told, 'You mustn't cry, 
you mustn't make noise, you mustn't do this and that,' so communication is 
enormously important in this piece." 
</P>
<P>
 But the show's message is "not just about talking," she added, "it's about 
listening as well." A lesson for grown-ups too, she noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reina" will be performed for the general public at the Los Angeles Public 
Central Library's Mark Taper Auditorium next Tuesday at 7 p.m.

 Fossil Thrills: A new video, "I Dig Fossils," for ages 5 to 12, captures the 
magic of exploring the Earth's abundant past. Fossil experts and 
paleontologists have their say, but it's young Sam Saletta, as a boy on a 
fossil hunt with his dad (Ken Metz), who infuses the film with the thrill of 
discovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Saletta enthusiastically and articulately guides viewers through the language 
and methods of fossil hunting (with lots of "don't try this alone" warnings and 
other safety tips). Tramping over brush and climbing rocky slopes, the pair 
fill buckets with ordinary-looking rocks from the Mazon Creek fossil treasure 
trove area in Illinois. Later, the wet rocks are cracked open like eggs to 
yield delicate fossils of plants and animals millions of years old. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end, viewers and parents are directed to books and organizations for 
further study and hands-on dig information.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; GOOD SOUND, BAD JOKES FROM PRONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 New York's Prong had fans gyrating to its groove-smart grind on Wednesday at 
the Whisky, giving metal a danceability beyond fist-pumping and headbanging. 
The quartet mixes dark and heavy thrash with synthesized, industrial noise and 
slightly funky bass lines, then pares it down to simple but solid grooves. 
</P>
<P>
 The blend is strong and original -- not surprising, considering that the 
group's members come from the seminal and daring underground bands Killing Joke 
and the Swans. Singer-guitarist Tommy Victor added to the groove with 
rap-meets-metal roars, but he nearly negated the unique sound with his attempts 
to become Andrew Dice Clay or Howard Stern between the songs. 
</P>
<P>
 He constantly rambled on in a heavy Brooklyn accent, proudly declaring himself 
"non-PC" and alienating half the small audience with the old New York vs. L.A. 
shtick and a particularly cold joke about the suicide of Kurt Cobain. Audience 
members groaned and shouted back obscenities, and some left early.  
</P>
<P>
 Prong's thick and gritty music was able to pull the remaining fans back in for 
most of the show, but by the set's close, Victor's quips had become unbearable. 
Prong's music is probably best experienced on album, where Victor's loud mouth 
is confined to singing. LORRAINE ALI

MOVIE REVIEW; 'INKWELL': WHEN BLACK CLASSES CLASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Inkwell" takes its title from a Martha's Vineyard beach, an African 
American enclave since the turn of the century. The film is at once a 
coming-of-age story, set in the summer of 1976, and a satire on the 
affectations of the black bourgeoisie. That's a conceivably viable mix, but 
unfortunately it proves too great of a stretch for director Matty Rich, who 
created a stir with his raw, powerful debut film, "Straight Out of Brooklyn," 
made when he was only 19, and for his writers, Tom Ricostronza and Paris 
Qualles. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is simple enough: The writers and the director cannot resist 
caricaturing black conservatives to ludicrous extremes, thus botching a rare 
instance in which we're able to witness a believable conflict of values between 
classes within black society. Worse yet, the film, which tends to drag, ends up 
pouring a syrupy sentimentality over both its emotional and social issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Incredible as it may seem, an attractive wife and mother (Suzzanne Douglas) 
insists she did not anticipate trouble when she urges that she and her husband 
(Joe Morton) and their 16-year-old son (Larenz Tate) spend two weeks with her 
sister (Vanessa Bell Calloway) and brother-in-law (Glynn Turman) at their place 
in Martha's Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
 Morton is a former Black Panther and Turman is so ardent a Republican that he 
has oil paintings of Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford on his living-room wall. Not 
helping matters is that Douglas' mother (Mary Alice), who lives with Calloway 
and Turman, addresses Douglas with cruelty and contempt apparently only because 
of her husband's past Panthers affiliation, something that is never explored. 
</P>
<P>
 Against this tense background the shy, troubled Tate, urged on by his playboy 
cousin (Duane Martin), commences to spread his wings ever so tentatively. Where 
the film is at its most deft and subtle is in the way in which it credibly 
involves the awkward (but handsome) Tate, first with the imperious queen of the 
beach (Jada Pinkett), a beauty whose frosty and cynical veneer hides 
considerable vulnerability, and then with a gorgeous woman (Adrienne-Joi 
Johnson), married to a compulsive philanderer (Morris Chestnut). (In a way, the 
film is a black "Tea and Sympathy.") 
</P>
<P>
 The film is on sufficiently sure ground in depicting Tate's gradual, sometimes 
funny, sometimes painful, path to maturity that it's a shame that it otherwise 
misfires so badly. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone in the large cast is game but understandably only Tate, Pinkett and 
Johnson are fully persuasive. Let's hope that the talented Rich will get back 
on track the next time around. 
</P>

<P>
 The Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts and architects Barton Myers 
Associates have won raves from two organizations recognizing the center for its 
architectural design.

<P>
 The center was one of five theaters nationwide to receive a 1994 Honor Award 
for excellence from the United States Institute of Theater Technology, which 
hailed it as "the most sophisticated project we've seen in terms of 
architecture, technology and urban design."

MOVIE REVIEW; ADAPTATION OF KAFKA'S 'TRIAL' BETTER SUITED TO THE STAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Trial," which reopens the NuWilshire after earthquake repairs, is 
precisely that for the viewer, for this new adaptation of the Franz Kafka novel 
could scarcely be more of an ordeal. Within minutes you're wishing you were 
instead watching Orson Welles' 1963 version with Anthony Perkins -- not that it 
was all that great, but it was far more absorbing. 
</P>
<P>
 One would think that Harold Pinter, master of ambiguity and implication, would 
be the perfect choice to adapt this prophetic warning of the advent of the 
faceless totalitarian state with its accompanying paranoia. The trouble is that 
Pinter's surprisingly talky treatment is lots more suitable for the stage than 
the screen. Not helping matters is David Jones' relentlessly prosaic and 
impersonal direction. In such circumstances authentic Prague locales, shot in 
realistic color, simply underline the artificial theatricality of the entire 
undertaking. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't seem possible that a film with a cast headed by Kyle MacLachlan and 
including Anthony Hopkins, Jason Robards and David Thewlis could be all bad, 
but it is: They have all been directed as if they're performing under a 
proscenium instead of a camera. Since "The Trial" never comes to life, they 
always seem to be acting rather than becoming their characters. 
</P>
<P>
 As the hapless Josef K, MacLachlan would be ideal in a more imaginative 
version. He captures the bourgeois smugness of Kafka's senior bank clerk who 
meets his arrest on charges never defined with a mixture of exasperation and 
disdain. Indeed, he refuses to consider the danger of his plight at just about 
the same time that countless intelligent people who ought to have been taking 
Hitler seriously were regarding him as a joke.  
</P>
<P>
 Robards plays K's bedridden lawyer, Hopkins an enigmatic priest and Thewlis 
one of the warders who tells K he's under arrest. Hopkins at least gets to 
underplay, but everyone else has been directed to bluster about, as if Jones 
were straining to inject some vitality. But this "Trial" is embalmed from start 
to finish. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: Unrated. Times guidelines: It includes some violence, and heavy 
treatment of complex political and philosophical themes.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; YET ANOTHER REASON TO GO TO OLD TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Does the Southland need yet another small, mid-priced Italian restaurant? In 
Pasadena's Old Town, at least, the saturation point clearly hasn't been 
reached. Lines are already forming at the airy new La Risata in the old Cafe 60 
North space. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner, Varo Angeletti, opened the hugely popular Il Sorriso more than a 
year ago right around the corner on Colorado Boulevard. Il Sorriso means "the 
smile" in Italian. Angeletti's second restaurant, La Risata, translates as "the 
laugh." One can't help but speculate what his next place will be called -- Il 
Parossismo, "the paroxysm," perhaps, or Il Singhizzo, "the sob"? 
</P>
<P>
 It seems fated that Angeletti will keep escalating the humor and opening these 
modest and modestly priced Italian restaurants. For the money, they're among 
the best Pasadena has to offer. 
</P>
<P>
 The patio of Cafe 60 North has been enclosed in Angeletti's renovations, yet, 
oddly, La Risata seems brighter and fresher than the former lunch spot. The 
walls are brick, the ceiling gloriously high. In the afternoons, open windows 
admit a lively breeze. Sage-green cafe chairs feel light and a bit flimsy, but 
once we're in place, who notices? 
</P>
<P>
 Meals unfold pleasantly here without many glitches, although the kitchen tends 
to send out entrees before we are finished with our starters, and sometimes 
what's on our plate is not exactly what we ordered. The staff is competent and 
friendly -- very friendly: One waitress compliments me on my jewelry, a friend 
on her hair color and my friend's husband on his hat. 
</P>
<P>
 The dinner menu is large and varied; starred items are those available at 
lunch. The food is straightforward, direct, not particularly subtle, but 
definitely competent and flavorful. Bread arrives with a warm, pea-studded 
marinara for dipping. 
</P>
<P>
 The vegetable antipasti -- marinated mixed vegetables, grilled artichokes and 
sauteed radicchio with smoked mozzarella cheese -- are all unusual and 
delicious. The grilled artichokes are actually artichoke hearts with only a 
fringe of delicate inner leaves, as crispy and fun as potato chips. The thin 
strips of smoky, marinated eggplant alone are worth the whole price of the 
mixed vegetable platter. 
</P>
<P>
 Swordfish carpaccio draped over juicy cantaloupe is luscious. Caprese salad, 
fortified with anchovies, will be better when tomatoes improve later this 
spring. A generous portion of New Zealand mussels and clams come with toast, in 
approximately the same sauce in which we've already been dunking our bread 
(minus the peas).  
</P>
<P>
 A delicious country soup with zucchini, tomatoes and the short macaroni called 
ditalini has a full-bodied broth thickened with potatoes. A special asparagus 
soup surprises us with its strongly tomato base and large percentage of 
macaroni -- it's almost a pasta. 
</P>
<P>
 Risotto is done well here: not too rich, and stirred to the precise point of 
pleasurable graininess. An herbed risotto comes topped with six perfectly 
grilled sea scallops, so thick they look like tree trunks. A risotto with baby 
artichokes is also pretty good, but contains funny little globs of melted 
cheese and no hint of the green peppercorns promised on the menu. 
</P>
<P>
 I order trenette , a long, thin pasta, but get a bowl of bows -- farfalle , or 
bow-tie pasta -- with pesto and potatoes. While I appreciate the wordplay, I'd 
not only been looking forward to trenette , but am disappointed to find the 
pesto thinned with cream, which considerably dulls the flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 The entrees tend to be big, generous plates of food. I especially enjoy the 
grilled salmon with fennel and a skinless chicken breast in a nice, light sauce 
spiked with balsamic vinegar. Special lamb chops served with a porcini mushroom 
sauce are tasty but overcooked, barely pink. 
</P>
<P>
 The staff seems to push the house-made cheesecakes, with crusts that taste not 
unpleasantly like burnt cookies. But the banana cream pie, cold and fresh with 
a great flaky crust, is much better. 
</P>
<P>
 * La Risata, 60 N . Raymond Ave., Pasadena, (818) 793-9000. Lunch Monday 
through Saturday, dinner seven nights. Beer and wine. All major credit cards

THEATER REVIEW; 'ANATOMY': GOOD FOR WHAT AILS YOU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD STAYTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Spalding Gray's a sick man. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucky us. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Gray's Anatomy," his funniest and most profound monologue since "Swimming 
to Cambodia," the middle-aged crazies take possession of America's first 
neurotic and No. 1 storyteller. 
</P>
<P>
 This self-described WASP Woody Allen has hit 50 and his body is slipping into 
"the Bermuda Triangle of Health." Gray's first sign of physical decay is a 
"macula pucker" -- a growth on the retina of his left eye -- and his search for 
a miraculous cure sends Gray on increasingly bizarre pilgrimages, from New 
Jersey's New Age nutritionists to the Philippines' psychic surgeons. His trips 
become a howl of high anxiety and hilarity. 
</P>
<P>
 But they're trips without slides, maps or props. This tour guide's exquisitely 
refined actor's voice takes us there. Wearing a plaid flannel shirt and jeans, 
Gray meanders onto the stage and sits at a simple table. His only props are a 
notebook and a glass of water. He cozily leans into a microphone, like a friend 
in a bar about to confess a secret. We can barely hear his first words: "I 
think it all began when. . . ."  
</P>
<P>
 Thank the entertainment gods that Gray wasn't diagnosed with Alzheimer's. 
Gray's minimalist stage art depends on remembrances of things past. He's a 
Proustian camera and his memory works as film. He calls this technique "poetic 
journalism," a mixture of autobiography and sociology and comic improvisations, 
but his 14th monologue is a creative breakthrough from previous stories. It 
goes beyond the eccentric confines of "Monster in a Box," which explored 
writer's block, or the Hollywood-insider observations of "Swimming to 
Cambodia." 
</P>
<P>
 "Gray's Anatomy" is about the Big Fear: Death. How do we live with it? Do we 
fight it? Do we accept it? Is there a faith that a cynic like Gray can embrace? 
For the first time, Gray's obsessions aren't a freak show. We share his anatomy 
so we identify with his sadness. "Gray's Anatomy" is his most accessible and 
his most romantic. It's also the first one with a truly happy ending. 
</P>
<P>
 But that ending isn't a Hollywood happily-ever-after fade out. Gray's search 
for alternative therapies begins in an ophthalmologist (rhymes with 
monologuist) office, where he's encouraged to get "a little macula scraping." 
</P>
<P>
 Minor surgery? Gray is off-and-running for a cure, a cause, a clinic -- 
anything to avoid that eye-scrape. Maybe the ailment surfaced because he writes 
in the first-person: " . . . too much I, I, I, I, I!" Maybe it was caused by 
his novel "Impossible Vacation," with the detached examination of his mother's 
suicide? 
</P>
<P>
 Gray grew up in a Christian Science home, where "correct thinking" offered the 
only cure. His poignant memories of childhood underscore the desperation. His 
therapist, "an existential realist and graduate of Auschwitz," offers little 
consolation: "All things are contingent and there is also chaos." So Gray 
pursues radical nutritionists, a Native American sorceress, and "the Elvis 
Presley of psychic surgeons." 
</P>
<P>
 He tries everything. Raw vegetables. Gestalt screams. Gives up alcohol and 
amino acids. Takes out a personal ad: "Let's share puckers." He even returns, 
briefly, to Christian Science prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a lull when we assume that the piece's climax is the eye operation. 
But Gray is a trickster, and the goal of his "Anatomy" is not physical but 
spiritual healing. "I believe in magic," confesses the life-long ironist and 
cynic. "I believe that there has to be real magic if there are tricks in the 
world. And what is a trick if not an imitation of real magic?" 
</P>
<P>
 Gray's a magician of words whose enchanted "Anatomy" is the best cure for what 
ails him -- and us. See it. 
</P>
<P>

MUSIC REVIEW; EFFICIENT OUTING FROM MARLBORO GROUP AT BING THEATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite the skills of its individual members and the cohesiveness of their 
joint effort, workaday efficiency marked much of the playing of the traveling 
Musicians From Marlboro ensemble that appeared on Wednesday at the Bing Theater 
of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
 Violinists Todd Phillips and Mark Steinberg, violist Steven Tenenbom and 
cellist Marcy Rosen created a semblance of a seasoned string quartet in Haydn's 
Quartet in E flat, Opus 50, No. 3 (more interesting for its harmonic 
inventiveness than for any particular thematic distinction) and the beuilingly 
fresh and folksy Quintet in G, Opus 77, of Dvorak, in which they were joined by 
bassist Peter Lloyd. 
</P>
<P>
 Both were delivered with energy and shapeliness, but also with a loudly 
aggressive sameness that failed to project the vast stylistic differences 
between the two. Dynamic subtlety was a marked presence only in the ecstatic 
Dvorak slow movement. 
</P>
<P>
 The Schoenberg Trio, Opus 45, hard work for the relatively few players brave 
enough to take up its esoteric cause, proved far more involving. 
</P>
<P>
 In the expert hands of Steinberg, an exciting new talent, and the veteran, 
hugely savvy Tenenbom and Rosen, Schoenberg's half- century-old finger-buster 
showed that it still had the power to thrill and astonish with its frenzied 
intensity, its shatteringly tense pauses and gnarled lyricism. HERBERT GLASS

JAZZ NOTES: ABOARD KLON'S CARAVAN TO CLUB SCENE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When veteran Bay Area tenor man Vince Wallace and his colleagues -- 
keyboardist Kent Glenn and bassist Mark Proctor -- were performing last Friday 
at Legends of Hollywood, only a handful of customers sat in the room with a 
zesty '50s look. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the place was packed, as well over 100 fans listened to the ardent 
modern music of pianist Cecilia Coleman's quintet. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for the difference: the KLON Spring Jazz Caravan, which found close 
to 2,000 fans riding on buses to hear music at 16 clubs, including the World 
Cafe in Santa Monica, the Jazz Bakery in Culver City, La Ve Lee in Studio City, 
the Baked Potato in Pasadena and the Cat and Fiddle Pub in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the caravaners, like Eleanor and Phil Martinez of Montebello, were 
regular jazz buffs who saw the occasion as a chance to help KLON -- the event 
was a fund-raiser for the station -- and to hear a number of bands. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started out with Anita O'Day at Vine Street Bar & Grill. She was great," 
said Eleanor Martinez. "Now we want to go hear Conte Candoli," who was 
appearing with Sid Jacobs' quartet at the Club Brasserie. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, like Kerby Kuntsler and Jeff Caudill of Newport Beach, had never been 
to a jazz club before. "We want to find out which clubs might be good," said 
Caudill, as the pair sat waiting for Jack Sheldon to start his third set of the 
night at Cinegrill in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners had mixed feelings about such heavy turnouts on a Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great. I love it," exclaimed Kim Gardner, owner of the Cat & Fiddle, 
where the Pat Britt-Wilbur Brown band, a Sunday mainstay at the club for eight 
years, held forth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to have it like this every night," said Bob Marks, the 
drummer-singer who runs Legends, which, despite a strong lineup, has had 
difficulty drawing good crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Berenstein, owner of Vine Street, was more philosophical. Looking at his 
packed club as O'Day prepared to launch into her third set, Berenstein said, 
"This type of success proves that there is an audience willing to hear jazz. 
The sad thing is that people don't go out that frequently and they have to be 
pushed by an institution like KLON to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 The event grossed approximately $25,000, according to a KLON spokesperson. 
</P>
<P>
 New Venues: Noted blues/jazz guitarist Roy Gaines has opened Gainesville, a 
club/restaurant located in the mid-Crenshaw district at 5716 Crenshaw Blvd. The 
spacious, well-appointed room, which boasts a "non-smoking, non-alcohol 
ambience," debuts tonight and Saturday with singer Oscar Brown Jr., 
percussionist Mayuto Correa, Gaines' blues band and others performing shows at 
9 and 11 p.m. Brown et al. appear indefinitely; Joe Sample and Hubert Laws are 
tentatively scheduled, but no dates have been confirmed. Cover charge is $15, 
two drink minimum. Gainesville, which sports a varied Southern-style menu, will 
also offer a gospel showcase, Sundays, 2 p.m., and and a blues night on 
Mondays. Information: (213) 293-2551. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Jazz can now be heard Sundays, 4 to 8 p.m., on the patio of the L.A. 
Equestrian Center, 480 Riverside Drive. The venue, being booked by Dennis Duke 
-- who also handles nearby Chadney's -- will feature a full bar, a special 
Sunday jazz buffet, and will charge no admission. Artists on tap include Abe 
and Sam Most on Sunday, organist Bill Heid, with guitarist Frank Potenza and 
drummer Sherman Ferguson on May 1, and Jack Sheldon's quartet on May 8. 
Information: (818) 840-1313. 
</P>
<P>
 Critic's Choice: Bill Cunliffe, the decidedly talented, multidirectional 
keyboardist, offers his take on post-bop-flavored acoustic jazz Sunday at the 
Jazz Bakery, Monday at Randell's in Santa Ana and Wednesday at the Baked Potato 
in Pasadena. Cunliffe's trio will deliver selections from his recent "A Rare 
Connection" Discovery album.

MUSIC REVIEW; LISZT AND CHOPIN FROM FIALKOWSKA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Janina Fialkowska has been playing major works by Franz Liszt in regular 
appearances here since her first Ambassador Auditorium recital, in 1975. But 
never with more authority and conviction than she displayed at her latest 
Pasadena concert Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Polish Canadian pianist offered an entire half-recital of Liszt pieces, 
five technical and musical hurdles testing not only bravura and endurance, but 
imagination and emotional projection as well. Fialkowska conquered all. 
</P>
<P>
 She lit the inner fires of the "Dante" Sonata as effortlessly as she dominated 
its mechanical intricacies, reminding us that this is a work of delicacy and 
poetry as much as it is a potboiler. 
</P>
<P>
 Before that, she produced irresistible ripples and cascades in "Au bord d'une 
source," sang out the tender rhetoric of "Senza lentezza quasi allegretto" 
(from "Apparitions") and delivered all the Romantic enchantment in "Valse 
impromptu," after opening the group, and the recital, with the heroic fanfare 
of the Polonaise No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 This demonstration of comprehensive virtuosity continued after intermission 
with masterpieces by Polish composers. 
</P>
<P>
 Szymanowski's clangorous but mystical "Metopes," Opus 29, showed us 
contrasting facets in the 42-year-old pianist's musical makeup. Chopin's 
B-minor Sonata brought to mind the old saw, "You don't have to be Polish to 
play Chopin, but it doesn't hurt." Indeed, Fialkowska made every bit of this 
familiar score her own, individual statement, in particular the wondrous 
soliloquy of the third movement, the heart of the work. 
</P>
<P>
 Her first two encores turned out to be relics of an era before her birth: Myra 
Hess' transcription of "Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring" and the "Caprice 
Espagnole" by Moritz Moszkowski.

LONDON CRITICS LIKE THE REVAMPED 'SUNSET BOULEVARD'; THEATER: THE SHOW WAS 
CLOSED FOR THREE WEEKS, THE LEAD PLAYERS REPLACED, THE PRODUCTION BROUGHT INTO 
LINE WITH THE L.A. VERSION. MOST SAY THE EXTRA $1.5 MILLION WAS WORTH IT.

<P>
 Andrew Lloyd Webber's high-risk relaunch of "Sunset Boulevard" appears to have 
paid off -- in the eyes of theater critics here, at least. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month Lloyd Webber closed the show for three weeks, replaced leading 
players Patti LuPone and Kevin Anderson, and changed the production to bring it 
into line with the successful version of the show now playing in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We opened before we were ready," Lloyd Webber said last week about the 
original London production. "We didn't spend enough time in rehearsal. We were 
overconfident." 
</P>
<P>
 But the revamped version, which cost an extra $1.5 million to stage, was 
unveiled to critics Tuesday night. Most found the new version of "Sunset 
Boulevard" an improvement, with new leads Betty Buckley (as the fading silent 
movie star Norma Desmond) and John Barrowman (playing her younger lover, the 
cynical screenwriter Joe Gillis) singled out for praise. 
</P>
<P>
 Mid-market tabloid newspapers, whose readers form the core of audiences for 
Lloyd Webber musicals, led the praise. Nicholas de Jongh in the Evening 
Standard went overboard for Buckley, waxing ecstatic over her "million-dollar 
voice." 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot remember a single performer so transforming and making a show," 
wrote De Jongh. "Miss Buckley, taking over the role of Norma Desmond, the 
silent movie star whose comeback never comes, is overwhelmingly poignant." 
</P>
<P>
 "Lloyd Webber's great gamble has already paid off with the richest dividends, 
artistically speaking," said the Daily Mail's Jack Tinker. The show was 
"visually far more tasteful, far more taut in its narrative and far, far more 
intense emotionally." 
</P>
<P>
 The upscale broadsheet papers were more restrained, but generally 
enthusiastic. "Tighter and sharper," wrote the Guardian's Michael Billington, 
who applauded an "infinitely better chemistry" between the new leads. Jeremy 
Kingston in the Times noted the changes gave "a greater momentum to the story." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Taylor of the Independent played a little one-upmanship with his 
colleagues by stating he was the only British critic to have seen the L.A. 
version as well as both London productions. His verdict? The new show was 
"darker, tauter . . . a great deal better." He found Barrowman the most 
effective of all the Joe Gillises, but much preferred Glenn Close, the Norma 
Desmond of the L.A. production, to Buckley. 
</P>
<P>
 The Daily Telegraph's Charles Spencer alone disliked the new production: "The 
result is the same: an overblown though often lushly melodic musical that does 
less than full justice to Billy Wilder's black masterpiece of a film."

HOME TECH / CD CORNER: CAPITOL DELIVERS A GEOGRAPHY LESSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Why would anyone want an album with a version of "Georgia on My Mind" by the 
Four Knights rather than the hit recording by Ray Charles . . . or "I Left My 
Heart in San Francisco" by Nancy Wilson rather than Tony Bennett . . . or "Old 
Cape Cod" by Susan Barrett rather than Patti Page? 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, why would someone want to buy a collection featuring Dean Martin's 
"Canadian Sunset" instead of Andy Williams' hit version . . . or "On a Slow 
Boat to China" by Kay Starr rather than any of three Top 10 renditions of the 
song (by Kay Kyser, Freddy Martin and Eddy Howard)? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is that they are simply looking for an engaging concept or theme. 
</P>
<P>
 At least that's what Capitol Records is counting on with the latest releases 
in its "Capitol Sings" retrospective series. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Georgia," "San Francisco" and "Cape Cod" selections are part of "Capitol 
Sings Coast to Coast: Route 66," a 20-track CD featuring songs that salute U.S. 
cities, states or regions. Among the other offerings: Dean Martin's "When It's 
Sleepy Time Down South," Judy Garland's "Carolina in the Morning" and Johnny 
Mercer's "San Fernando Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 "Canadian Sunset" and "Slow Boat" are featured in "Capitol Sings Around the 
World: Far Away Places," whose 20 tracks offer a more international flavor. The 
other selections range from Lena Horne's "I Love Paris" and Bobby Darin's 
"Sunday in New York" to June Christy's "A Night in Tunisia" and Vic Damone's 
"The Moon of Manakoora." 
</P>
<P>
 Given the continuing consumer interest in CD retrospectives, the Capitol 
series tries to tempt pop fans with attractive themes, drawing from the label's 
own vaults for material rather than using the more costly practice of leasing 
the definitive versions of certain songs from other labels. 
</P>
<P>
 While the absence of some of the hit versions is likely to be distracting to 
serious pop fans, these packages are clearly aimed at casual fans, and they are 
appealing on that relaxed level. 
</P>
<P>
 Another sign the packages are designed for the casual pop fan: There are no 
liner notes detailing the history of the tracks -- only the names of the 
artists, the writers and the dates the songs were recorded. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other recent releases indicate that locales aren't the only themes in the 
"Capitol Sings" series. 
</P>
<P>
 "Capitol Sings Duke Ellington: Mood Indigo" features Ellington material 
performed by such artists as Nat King Cole, Lou Rawls and Dinah Washington. 
"Capitol Sings Rodgers and Hammerstein: Hello Young Lovers" features 
performances by such artists as Peggy Lee, Al Martino and the Andrew Sisters.

POP ALBUM CHART; FLOYD'S 'BELL' RINGS IN ANOTHER NO. 1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pink Floyd's album "The Division Bell" may have a longer Top 10 life than some 
detractors expected. In its second week on the chart, "Bell" continues to toll 
at No. 1. The thinking was that the veteran group couldn't attract enough young 
record buyers to keep the album among the bestsellers. But the excitement 
surrounding the group's tour has been a big sales boost. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim McGraw's "Not a Moment Too Soon" can't slip down the chart a moment too 
soon for the Native Americans who have criticized "Indian Outlaw," the hit 
single that's driving album sales. But the album is going in the other 
direction, climbing three notches to No. 4. Imagine all the furor that will be 
generated if it becomes the nation's No. 1 album--which isn't out of the 
question. All-4-One's first album, "All-4-One," entered at No. 44--all on the 
strength of the group's hit ballad single "So Much in Love." R. Kelly's "Bump 
'n' Grind" is still the No. 1 pop single. 
</P>
<P>
 * The album by Hole, Courtney Love's group, entered the chart at No. 55, 
somewhat lower than expected given all the publicity surrounding both the death 
of her husband, Kurt Cobain, and her own drug problems. It doesn't help, 
though, that this isn't a radio-friendly album. But that publicity, as well as 
positive reviews, may still generate good word of mouth, which could help keep 
the album going. 04,51,06,08,08 Rank Rank 2 Weeks Last Weeks on the Week Ago

NATIONAL VIDEO RENTALS ; 'FUGITIVE' STILL AHEAD OF THE PACK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Retailers are reporting that "The Fugitive" is still outdistancing its rental 
competition by a wide margin. None of the current crop is likely to overtake it 
but the upcoming "Mrs. Doubtfire" will surely run it down. Due out next week, 
"Mrs. Doubtfire" should be the spring's biggest hit. "What's Love Got to Do 
With It," the Tina Turner biography, is making a strong showing--climbing three 
notches to No. 3. Clearly, the Oscar nominations for stars Laurence Fishburne 
and Angela Bassett boosted the profile of this drama. "Carlito's Way," a 
gangster movie starring Al Pacino and directed by Brian De Palma, debuted at 
No. 8 and should break into the Top 5. It attracted a fair-sized audience in 
theaters ($36.5-million gross) and should benefit from the huge cult following 
of another Pacino-De Palma collaboration--the violent "Scarface." "The Age of 
Innocence," which grossed $31.9 million in theaters, debuted at No. 10 and 
could be a solid Top 10 rental. The big lure of this romantic drama is star 
Daniel Day-Lewis, who has an enormous female audience in the rental market. 
Other debuts: "A Bronx Tale" (No. 15) and "Fearless" (No. 20). 
</P>
<P>
 * Critics battered this film version of the old TV series, but a lot of 
moviegoers still liked it--to the tune of $42.2-million gross. It should do 
good video business too, appealing both to fans of low-brow comedies and those 
who like the eternally popular series. It opened at No. 13 but should crack the 
Top 10 next week. 03,30,16,08 Rank Weeks Last on the Week Chart 1."The

HOME TECH / VIDEOS: FOX RESTORES BLUSH TO TEMPLE'S FACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What's been keeping Shirley Temple, the curly-haired child star of the 1930s, 
from being a heroine to a whole new generation of kiddies? 
</P>
<P>
 FoxVideo, which already has 20 of Temple's movies on video, thinks it has come 
up with an answer: color and marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 If a movie is not in color, many of today's tots lose interest in it after a 
few minutes. And the movie has to be marketed to them -- and their parents -- 
in such a way as to make it a must-see. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the wholesome but black-and-white Temple movies such as "Heidi," 
"Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm" and "Wee Willie Winkie" have been largely geared 
to the classic-film market, not to children. But starting Tuesday, that's 
changing. 
</P>
<P>
 The first of Fox's colorized and repackaged Temple movies hits the market -- 
"Heidi" (1937), "Bright Eyes" (1934) and "Dimples" (1936). A new one will come 
out on the first Wednesday of every month until all 20 are released. 
</P>
<P>
 The list price will be $15 (though the black-and-white versions are still 
$20). But many stores undoubtedly will offer discounts in hopes of stimulating 
impulse buying. 
</P>
<P>
 The shrewdest marketing ploy, though, is hitching Temple's star to "Mrs. 
Doubtfire," which FoxVideo is also releasing on video Tuesday. There's not only 
a rebate program linking the Temple movies to "Mrs. Doubtfire," but the Robin 
Williams comedy also includes a trailer for the colorized series. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind all this Temple sunniness lurk some storm clouds. 
</P>
<P>
 In today's kiddie-oriented videos, painstaking care is taken to make sure that 
children see only images of racial equality. In the Temple movies, though, 
that's not the case. Black actors such as Stepin Fetchit, Willie Best and Bill 
Robinson are routinely presented in roles that, by today's standards, are 
demeaning stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Pfander, senior vice president for marketing at FoxVideo, says the 
company has received no complaints about racism in the Temple movies, which 
have been very profitable on video in the black-and-white versions. 
</P>
<P>
 "After all these years, no one has complained to us that the movies are 
offensive," he said. "If there had been complaints, we would never repackage 
and re-promote these movies. The last thing we want to do is offend anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Anticipating a problem, though, FoxVideo had the movies rated. So if you buy 
the Temple movies, check the ratings. "Heidi," for instance, is a G, which 
means there's nothing deemed potentially offensive in it. But "Dimples," which 
features Stepin Fetchit, gets a PG -- for historical racial stereotyping. 
"Bright Eyes" also has a PG rating. 
</P>
<P>
 Special Interest Videos 
</P>
<P>
 If Madonna's infamous appearance on a recent "Late Show With David Letterman" 
didn't totally turn you off, you might check out her new video, due Tuesday, 
"The Girlie Show-Live Down Under." It's her two-hour HBO special, on Warner, 
priced at $30. . . . Despite a long-winded title, "1071 Fifth Avenue, Frank 
Lloyd Wright and the Story of the Guggenheim Museum" is an intriguing 
documentary about the architect's remarkable creation (Home Vision, $30). 
</P>
<P>
 Tech News 
</P>
<P>
 If you're tired of grainy, fuzzy pictures in the EP mode on your VCR, you 
might try Toshiba's new M-760. This is a six-headed VCR, with two extra heads 
for recording and playing in the EP mode -- an industry first. You get an EP 
picture that's very close to the one in the standard play, or SP, mode. The 
retail price is $550, which means that many stores will discount it in the 
$450-$475 range. 
</P>
<P>
 What's New on Video: 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Jones" (Columbia TriStar). A charming manic-depressive (Richard Gere) is 
treated by a repressed psychiatrist (Lena Olin) and a love affair blooms, 
"Prince of Tides"-style. The stars are miscast and the script is bad.  
</P>
<P>
 "Flesh and Bone" (Paramount). When this came out, industry insiders dubbed it 
"Flesh and Bore." It's about an uptight Texan (Dennis Quaid) whose father 
(James Caan) murdered a farm family. The Texan gets involved with a woman (Meg 
Ryan) who is strangely linked to his past.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Saint of Fort Washington" (Warner). Realistic, informative look at the 
homeless scene set in a buddy-movie format. A wily Vietnam vet (Danny Glover) 
takes a gentle schizophrenic (Matt Dillon) under his wing and teaches him how 
to live on the New York streets. This fairly simple tale of their relationship 
is somewhat Hollywoodized but is still a decent drama -- though a real downer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Another Stakeout" (Touchstone). Nowhere near as entertaining as the 1987 
original. Richard Dreyfuss and Emilio Estevez again play buddy cops, this time 
trying to find a fugitive federal witness (Cathy Moriarty). A novice assistant 
district attorney (Rosie O'Donnell) is added to the undercover operation. Only 
mildly funny. 
</P>
<P>
 "It Happens Every Spring" (FoxVideo). A chemistry professor (Ray Milland) 
develops a substance that repels wood. Because it makes a baseball unhittable, 
he uses it to become a star pitcher.

THEATER REVIEW; 'THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE': IS IT A BOOK, PLAY OR MOVIE?; 
CARRIE SNODGRESS ABLY EXPLOITS HER ROLE IN A STAGING THAT UPDATES THE NOVEL AND 
CULT FILM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD STAYTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Similar to its brain-washed Korean War veterans, "The Manchurian Candidate" 
suffers from an identity crisis. Is it Richard Condon's 1959 novel that 
satirized Cold War hysteria? Is it John Frankenheimer's 1962 chilling film 
version that eerily prophesied the Kennedy assassination? Or is it John Lahr's 
1991 stage adaptation blending fiction and screenplay into a cautionary fable 
about media manipulation? 
</P>
<P>
 West Coast Ensemble's production can't make up its mind. Although this 
"Manchurian Candidate" begins in bold Kabuki style, with extras assembled 
ceremonially in black kimono robes, director Jules Aaron and company gradually 
lose confidence in such theatrical storytelling. Distracting subplots from 
fiction's leisurely pace start to possess our imaginations. Minimalism's 
artifice is soon replaced by crowds and numerous locations, futile attempts to 
duplicate cinema's visual scope. This stylistic schizophrenia finally 
undermines its dramatic impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, there is much to recommend here. Lahr is arguably the nation's 
best drama critic; his reviews for The New Yorker magazine demonstrate a 
rigorous intellect and a unique understanding among critics for the 
nuts-and-bolts of theater-making. Such knowledge gets applied to this 
adaptation, which is much more than mere movie homage -- it's a legitimate 
stage translation. If nothing else, such understanding makes "The Manchurian 
Candidate" a provocative, if flawed, intellectual exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 With Condon's encouragement, Lahr has updated the setting from the 1950s to 
"sometime in the near future." Now the kidnaped American soldiers aren't in 
Korea but are members of a Mideast peacekeeping force. Instead of the Red 
Menace, Washington extremists are paranoid about a "menace" from Japan. But 
North Korea remains an ominous player on the global stage, just as in Condon's 
original. And the concept of a hit man under the control of a foreign 
government, assassinating politicians? No need to update that nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor does Lahr need to tamper much with Condon's finest creation, a 
contemporary Lady Macbeth named Eleanor Iselin who devours her senator husband 
and war-hero son in the pursuit of political power. Initially, Carrie Snodgress 
seems slightly intimidated by Angela Lansbury's classic screen portrait of the 
Machiavellian mother. But Lahr shrewdly allows the character's incestuous 
obsession for her son to be more obvious on stage than it is in the film. 
Snodgress exploits the perversions, transforming Iselin into an all-too-human 
monster. Making audiences forget Lansbury is no minor accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Barber is less fortunate as returning war hero Raymond Shaw. He seems 
petrified by Laurence Harvey's icy screen brilliance. Unlike Snodgress, Barber 
isn't freed from the film by Lahr. Had Lahr brought Shaw's repressed 
homosexuality to the surface, Barber's tortured Momma's boy might have found 
more compelling acting choices. 
</P>
<P>
 However, John Marzilli's work as the nightmare-driven, veteran Ben Marco is 
actually more believable than Frank Sinatra's, who was miscast in the film. And 
Frank Ashmore as a right-wing xenophobe is the perfect stereotype of a 
politician-for-hire. 
</P>
<P>
 Under-heralded designer John Iacovelli once again masters a complex stage 
design, reproducing the story's Chinese puzzle-box structure in a series of 
Kabuki screens. Musical accompaniment by percussionist Sandy Kaye should also 
duplicate the sense of a classic Kabuki play, but the chimes tinkle like a 
soundtrack each time a character is gripped by hypnosis. Each irritating chime 
reminds us how unnecessary it is for theater to emulate movie effects.

MUSIC REVIEW; SOLID OUTING FROM CROATIAN ENSEMBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I Solisti di Zagreb, the chamber ensemble from Croatia, has been together 
since 1953 and has criss-crossed the globe countless times since then. Never 
before in its history, though, has the very mention of its homeland stirred up 
such loaded associations, of unrest and uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
 Friction -- political or aesthetic -- was the furthest thing from anyone's 
mind when the 15-member group came to perform at the Smothers Theatre at 
Pepperdine University in Malibu on Tuesday. If there were a political theme to 
be extracted here, it might be one of democracy in action. For almost 25 years, 
this has been an ensemble without a conductor, drawing on only the subtlest of 
cues from concertmaster Tonko Ninic. 
</P>
<P>
 The sight of a long row of formally dressed string players in a semi-circle, 
with no one at the helm, is almost disorienting. Yet the players seem no worse 
for the lack of a maestro. The string ensemble, with the occasional addition of 
a keyboard, is a tight, cohesive unit, with a fat, resonant sound. 
</P>
<P>
 The no-surprise program focused on such familiar pleasures as Bach's Concerto 
for Three Violins, a work of Pergolesi and Grieg's Baroque-leaning "Holberg" 
Suite for the first half. To close, the group served up some audience-friendly 
Britten, a la "Simple" Symphony, Opus 4, a piece from his pre-rebellious youth. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not a shy, retiring, or even especially subtle group. The players 
plunge into musical matters at hand with a collective bravura, a boldness of 
attack and ensemble texture that borders on coarseness.

<P>
 But the galvanic energy force proved to be infectious, especially when the 
group attended to the robust, post-romantic contours and Slavic flavor of 
Martinu's Sextet for Strings. Here, the players seemed right at home, locating 
the sympathetic middle ground between Eastern and Western European 
sensibilities. JOSEF WOODARD

 *** Dianne Reeves, "Art and Survival," EMI/Capitol. This multitextured 
experiment, with its frequent spiritual-based stories, is Reeves' most 
ambitious effort. Her lyrics and/or music for several of the songs were 
collaborations with her producer, Eddie Del Barrio.The words range from 
touchingly evocative ("Old Souls" and "Come to the River") to slightly 
pretentious ("Endangered Species"). "Body and Soul" undergoes an excessive 
harmonic transformation, but "Bird Alone" captures the spirit of Abbey 
Lincoln's lyrics and music. *** Ralph Moore, "Who It Is You Are," Savoy. Though 
Moore is a pleasant, capable tenor player, it is pianist Benny Green who lights 
up his life here, particularly in the gospel-tinged "Testifyin'." Other strong 
cuts are Moore's own "Samba," "Esmeralda" and a welcome revival of "Recado 
Bossa Nova." The double-up version of "Skylark" simply doesn't work, reducing 
the tune's melodic impact. Moore, for the moment, seems to be unsure who it is 
he is. EONARD FEATHER

 ** David Benoit/Russ Freeman, "The Benoit/Freeman Project," GRP. There's a lot 
more pop than jazz in this musical joining of two well-known contemporary 
stylists, who play piano and guitar, respectively.With the exception of one or 
two feisty works such as "Swept Away" and "Smartypants," most of the originals 
float through space so easily that they quickly slip into the category of 
pleasant background music. Ironically, it is two vocal numbers -- sung by Phil 
Perry and Vesta ("After the Love Has Gone") and Kenny Loggins ("When She 
Believed in Me") -- that give the album its most intriguing moments. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent). DON HECKMAN

COUNTRY GENTLEMAN; TONY LONGVAL IS CHANGING HIS RESEDA CLUB'S MUSIC AS WELL AS 
CREATING A CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE FOR IT IN THE COMMUNITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE APPLEFORD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Steve Appleford writes regularly 
about music for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tony Longval has been backstage since he was 14. He's been hanging out, 
hauling sound and lighting equipment, checking tickets and passes in venues big 
and small, and for artists unknown and as massive as the Rolling Stones. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he left those Atlanta clubs and arenas in 1990 for the West Coast, 
Longval had begun dreaming of opening his own club, maybe a little jazz bar, or 
a refurbished warehouse for rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted a little 300-seater bar," said Longval, now 29. It seemed like 
a reasonable step, a way to pay the rent for him and his daughter, without 
needing to work construction jobs on the side. Most of his youth had been spent 
as a roadie, after all. "That was my college, my high school." 
</P>
<P>
 Now Longval is running Reseda's embattled, controversial and once-glorious 
Country Club, the 1,000-seat venue that in the late 1980s fell on hard times, 
alienated the local community, and even lost its crucial liquor license. He 
heads a corporation that bought the hall in 1991 with the plan of returning it 
to its earlier status, when such popular acts as Chuck Berry, Waylon Jennings, 
Elvis Costello and X helped fill a crowded entertainment roster. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the club has worked to present live music again regularly, 
including a recent performance by the neo-rockabilly act Reverend Horton Heat, 
sponsored by Goldenvoice Productions, and a series of blues shows organized by 
Randy Chortkoff. And the club has regained its license to sell liquor. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the club has announced plans to have live country music three nights a 
week, beginning a full schedule in May with performances by the local acts 
Larry Dean and the Shooters, Geary Hanley and others. Which is fitting, since 
the late original owner Chuck Landis actually opened the club as a country 
venue in 1980 with a performance by Merle Haggard. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, Longval has created about 3,000 square feet of dance floors, 
installed two pool tables and video poker machines, and countrified the decor 
with wagon wheels, old chandeliers, bearskins, a moose head and steer horns. 
DJs spin hit country records between live bands, and the club offers free dance 
lessons (for line dances, waltzes, etc.) on concert nights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to revitalize or save something," Longval remarked. "This was about 
to be one of the largest Blockbuster video stores in the Valley, from what I 
heard. I fought and scraped for it. Everybody told me I was out of my mind, 
there was no way in the world I was going to pull this off." 
</P>
<P>
 At the grand opening March 24, City Councilwoman Laura Chick arrived for the 
ribbon-cutting in a covered wagon, demonstrating a renewed faith by the 
community leadership in an establishment that had long ago become a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Local residents had complained about and videotaped the unwelcome behavior of 
certain members of the Country Club's pop music clientele. "People were making 
love in their front yards," Longval said. "People were urinating in their 
gardens. It was not a very pretty scene. The out-of-line crowd just wasn't 
handled. No respect was shown to the community whatsoever. If you bring 1,000 
people into a community, you've got to be part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 His predecessors, with the exception of Landis, had tended to isolate 
themselves from the local business leaders. After Longval took control of the 
Country Club in July, 1991, "It took a good five months to get to know the 
folks, to get them to know me," he said. "From then on, we had full support. We 
just handle the gigs and try to do what's right, that's all. You can have any 
kind of show here that you want, as long as you handle it right, and do what's 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 He's gone on to become one of the 18 regular board members of the Reseda 
Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Longval, who lives at the club with his 12-year-old daughter, Jade, in an 
apartment he created there, is also involved in the community-based program 
Keep Youth Doing Something, a program for at-risk children that offers softball 
games and other sports activities at Reseda and Lanark parks. "I plan to stay 
for a while. That's who I am," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rayna Gabin, envoy to the Reseda community during Chick's first nine months in 
office, said of Longval, "He's very much involved in the community and wanting 
to help in any way that he can." 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence of that, she said, includes his making the Country Club available at 
no charge for community events, including dances and Halloween parties for the 
Keep Youth Doing Something program. After the Northridge earthquake, the 
Country Club also hosted meetings for Federal Emergency Management Agency, the 
police, the Small Business Administration and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Kinzle, executive director for the Reseda chamber, suggested Longval "is 
older than his years. He's really becoming one of the pillars of the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the once-contentious battles between the club and neighbors, Gabin 
said, "I have had no complaints since I got here last July." 
</P>
<P>
 The hall has sometimes been rented out as a film and video location. In recent 
months, En Vogue and Maurice White have shot music videos there; scenes for a 
kick-boxing movie have been filmed there, and one day a car was exploded for 
cameras in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The next scheduled entertainment event comes this morning, when "Mike the 
Maintenance Man" participates in a 9 a.m. boxing match live on "The Kevin and 
Bean Show" on KROQ-FM (106.7). Then, from May 3 to 8, the male exotic dance 
troupe Man Power performs. And more boxing events are expected by late June. 
</P>
<P>
 But on May 19 and 20, country music returns with Larry Dean and the Shooters. 
"It's always healthy to have another venue to play," said Dean, whose five-man 
band has played on the local country scene since 1981. "They have an excellent 
stage, and excellent sound system, and excellent dance floor." 
</P>
<P>
 Dean remembers seeing a few live shows at the Country Club in its early days, 
and opening for Don McLean and a few other artists there. It now helps make up 
for the loss of the Longhorn Saloon, the 300-seat North Hollywood country venue 
that closed in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is more of a big concert atmosphere. A honky-tonk has a different 
flavor. I like honky-tonks; I play in a lot of them. But this is just a 
different atmosphere, bigger and more open. A really great place for concerts." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Marilyn Crispen, who booked talent at the Longhorn and who now helps 
Longval at the Country Club: "Once the word gets out about the Country Club, I 
think the younger people will come out and see what this venue is like, and see 
what it's like with the live bands and the people. I really do. 
</P>

THEATER REVIEW; 3 FABLES RUINED BY ADULTERATION; A BANAL PREMISE AND BAD SITCOM 
ACTING MAR 'THE POLITICS OF FAIRY TALES,' A GROWN-UP'S LOOK AT THE UGLY SIDE OF 
CHILDREN'S STORIES.

 Kids have enough problems today without adults mucking up their fairy tales. 
The notion behind "The Politics of Fairy Tales," at NoHo Studios, is that fairy 
tales are really serious stuff, suitable for adults. Whatever innocence there 
may be in them is fouled by the odors of intrigue, mendacity, lying, egotism 
and hypocrisy. So, leave the kids at home, folks, and let's explore. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the results, director Stephen Moore's production has some more 
exploring to do. It might even be discovered that this show wasn't a very good 
idea to begin with. 
</P>
<P>
 It's sorry enough that the evening's thematic mainspring is banal, comparable 
to announcing that the Bible is a wonderful literary work full of human 
stories. But what Moore and company actually deliver on stage should get the 
kiddies steaming mad. 
</P>
<P>
 On paper, "Politics" seems promisingly eclectic. The opener is George Hauger's 
"Augustus," adapted from French authors Jean Anouilh's and Jean Aurenche's 
"Humulus le Muet." We then proceed to A. A. Milne's "The Ugly Duckling," sans 
animals, and finish in the big, bad modern world with Dennis E. Noble's fable 
play, "A Game." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever thinking went into the programming, though, short-circuited along the 
way. Moore forgot to tell his actors that they're not on a sitcom, and sooner 
than you can say working L.A. actor , they lapse into the sitcom-ese of overly 
indicated comedy, overly done gestures and undercooked wit. If this is 
someone's idea of a showcase, he or she had better think twice about whom it's 
shown to. 
</P>
<P>
 "Augustus" begins with the simple premise that Augustus (Michael Matthys), the 
Duchess' shy grandson, can speak only one word per day. It concludes with the 
symmetry and irony of the best fairy tales -- Helen (Kitty McNamee), whom 
Augustus loves so much that he starts talking, is hard of hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Nice, except that the playing is so charmless, broad and inept, it feels like 
Shelly Duvall's "Faerie Tale Theatre" made over for the Fox Network. The TV 
allusion is apt, for besides some winning moments from Matthys as the innocent 
lad and McNamee on her bicycle, the cast is more camera-ready than stage-ready. 
</P>
<P>
 They appear no more ready in "The Ugly Duckling." Bring back the ducks, 
please; the humans in Moore's numb staging behave with all the expressive sense 
of marionettes. The switch is that a princess (Jennifer Rade) is viewed as ugly 
by everyone except herself and the prince (Smith Forte) who wishes to marry 
her. Further switches involve disguised identities and whatnot, all inherently 
theatrical, though none of it actually theatrical here. 
</P>
<P>
 As execrable as it is dramatically, Noble's "A Game" at least provides a 
creative director some interesting stage pictures. Dr. Henning (Forte) recruits 
three guinea pigs (Rade, William Knight and Katharine Noon) for, he says, "an 
experiment in mind order through participatory slogans." The trio stand in, and 
must not leave, demarcated rectangles, and make a nationalistic chant every 
time a red light appears. 
</P>
<P>
 Noble begins with a trim though risky metaphor for global politics and mind 
control (Moore has alluded in an interview to Bosnia, though the piece long 
predates that current conflict). He forgot, though, to make his game players 
interesting as archetypes; instead, they're squabbling, overgrown juveniles 
(except for Rade, whose Val Girl delivery makes her sound merely juvenile). The 
process by which they become willing to kill for territory is so hopelessly 
speeded up, with no sense of time passing, that any lab doctor would toss this 
experiment out the window. 
</P>
<P>
 And as for the politics of fairy tales, let's call this caucus to a close.

GO WITH THE FLOW; SUSAN CLOVER'S CURRENT WORK OFFERS TRANQUIL AND SENSUAL 
SCENES OF PEOPLE IN WATER, REPRESENTATIVE OF THE CLASSIC CALIFORNIA LIFESTYLE.

<P>
 Fires, floods and earthquakes have not stopped Susan Clover of Seal Beach from 
painting scenes that convey the joys of living in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Her latest series of 12 paintings at Orlando Gallery carry on a theme that has 
captivated her for more than 20 years: figures in delightful water 
environments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love water, the way it splashes and sparkles, the way light plays on it. 
Water is a very sensual symbol," Clover said. Being in water "is an experience 
that everyone has had, so I don't feel like I'm painting something that isn't 
understood." 
</P>
<P>
 Using her sister, her son and daughter and their friends as models, Clover 
photographs them sunbathing, walking along the beach, lollygagging in the surf, 
dipping a foot into a secluded stream. With a color pallet that conveys the 
coolness of late-afternoon ocean breezes and the intensity of an atmosphere 
drenched in sunlight, she turns those photographs into richly textured, vibrant 
paintings of good-looking people in the most seductive of California 
environments. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has a luminosity to her work and an inner light that she creates through 
the use of color," gallery director Bob Gino said. "It's just not water per se; 
it's what the water says to her. There's where she creates the sensuality in 
the water." 
</P>
<P>
 "The water reflects back into the skin," Clover said. To re-create the effects 
of light and shadow on the body, she "uses more color in skin," Gino said, than 
any other artist he knows. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of its translucence and color, a painting such as "Water and Light" 
seems almost three-dimensional to Gino. In this picture, two women float about. 
"She creates a roundness in the body -- what the body is all about. It's like 
you can go in and around them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clover strives to create "an environment you feel you can walk into. When you 
paint, you're not painting some thing. You're painting color and shape and 
direction." 
</P>
<P>
 Clover works indoors but under light that duplicates sunlight. Using brushes, 
a pallet knife and her fingers for blending, she does strokes that are loose 
and free. Stand close to her paintings and they appear more like abstract 
compositions. Move back, and the bold, realist images emerge. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Wading at Jetty," we see a man and woman from the back. She wears a bright 
print skirt in primary colors, but we can also see the shadow of her leg 
underneath the skirt. We seem to be following the couple as they pass the jetty 
rocks covered with a rich, green moss. The soft color of the sky and water 
indicates the sun is on its way down. "She transports you to tranquillity," 
Gino said. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Water Reflections," a young woman nonchalantly plays with her long, wet 
hair after a dip. The vividness of the image stirs memories of how content one 
can feel after an exhilarating swim. The attention to details, such as the 
numerous appealing rings on the woman's fingers, enhances the personal nature 
of the picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Clover's sister, artist Joyce Wisdom, is at the center of "Green 
Fern-Topanga." Wearing a big sun hat and a sheer print skirt, she sits by a 
stream soaking up the lush surroundings. Clover prefers to paint people she 
knows "because I have an emotional response to the people I know. There's 
detachment there if you don't know" your subjects, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She also enjoys depicting the intimacy of couples as in "Cozy," where a man 
hugs a woman close. "It puts a sexual play between the two people. You 
introduce another factor," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clover, a Los Angeles native, said she will continue to paint the people most 
dear to her living the California lifestyle she finds so compelling. "I see the 
beauty of what's around me all the time," she said. Where and When 
</P>
<P>
 What: "Susan Clover: Paintings."

TALES THEY LIVED TO TELL; THE VALLEY STOREFRONT POETRY GROUP FOR SENIORS 
FEATURES WAR STORIES FROM THE BATTLEFIELD OF LIFE. IT ALSO PROVES THAT YOUNG 
HIPSTERS DON'T HAVE A MONOPOLY ON AUTHORING VERSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

readings for The Times.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Like a lot of things in our tight-skinned, bright-eyed culture, the L.A. 
poetry scene tends to revolve around the young. The occasional septuagenarians 
do climb onstage to read at local coffeehouses -- and are admired for their 
guts as much as for the quality of their work. By and large, though, the poetic 
airwaves belong to the newly voting set. 
</P>
<P>
 One exception to the rule is the twice-monthly poetry discussion group at 
Valley Storefront senior center, part of Jewish Family Service in Van Nuys. 
There, on stiff-backed chairs in a no-frills conference room, half a dozen or 
so writers age 60 and older, and not necessarily Jewish, come together to share 
their verse -- and their war stories from the battlefield of life. 
</P>
<P>
 "In poetry, there's no such thing as age," reflected the group's moderator, 
Isaac Shlein of North Hollywood, who declined to give his own age. "Maybe your 
feet aren't as good as they used to be; your face has more wrinkles, your hair 
is gray. What's under the hair is the same as it was 35 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 What's under the hair, however, includes a storehouse of memories not readily 
available to the average coffeehouse poet.  
</P>
<P>
 During a recent session, Dorothy Lawton of North Hollywood, who also preferred 
not to reveal her age, drew applause and murmurs of recognition when she read a 
poem about the emptiness of a mother's house once the children have gone.  
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys resident Abraham Lenkawicki, 79, nearly reduced his audience to tears 
with an autobiographical work about being a Jew in Poland during World War II. 
Mel Menkin of Arleta wrote about old age, "the Last Resort, the end of the 
Line"; Yetta Wolfe of North Hollywood about isolation and the desire to reach 
out to strangers; Shlein about the comfort of his dog,Zsa Zsa, for whom "I am a 
knight in shining armor." 
</P>
<P>
 Humorous, nostalgic, full of hard-earned wisdom, the work of the Valley 
Storefront poets -- many of whom have been meeting together for two years -- is 
more concerned with emotional truth than perfect diction.  
</P>
<P>
 "In feelings, you don't have grammar. When you build a temple, not every stone 
is in a line," said Lenkawicki, who speaks in heavily accented English and 
admits that he has a lot to learn about sentence structure. 
</P>
<P>
 While the group does offer criticism (Lenkawicki himself left with a heavily 
copy-edited poem), their mission is more to support than to correct each other. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "We make comments," said Shlein, "but we don't tear anyone down. We're here to 
give people courage to write." 
</P>
<P>
 Eudice Feder, 75, of Arleta, who has been a part of the group for two years, 
admitted that "it's a nice ego trip" when colleagues like her work, but if they 
don't, "I don't pay attention!" She keeps coming because she enjoys hearing 
other people's verse and because, she said, "It's important to be a doer, a 
participant, to engage in give and take." 
</P>
<P>
 Wally Richards, 71, of Chatsworth, who has read at San Fernando Valley 
coffeehouses such as the Cobalt Cafe in Canoga Park, welcomes the gentleness of 
the feedback from Shlein and others. "This group gives me a chance to try work 
out," he reported. "Here, if I fall on my face, I don't have to pick myself off 
the floor." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone, of course, shares the same level of literary accomplishment. 
North Hollywood resident Edythe Bechersky, who joined the group a year ago, 
acknowledged that she hasn't even started writing yet. But, she said, "I'm here 
because I want to start. I want to be able to express things that are hard to 
talk about." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the seasoned writers, there is no rancor or impatience for beginners. 
Sulamith Proctor, 67, of Panorama City, explained that part of the reason she 
participates is for the fun of being with people. "I go to meet adventures," 
she admitted. "Everyone is a unique person and an adventure, to the extent that 
they share themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 At each session, the sharing begins with the circulation of a sign-in sheet 
and a can with a slit for a "50 cents or more suggested donation" to cover the 
center's expenses. From there, Shlein calls on writers individually to read 
whatever work they've brought.  
</P>
<P>
 According to Shlein, an impassioned advocate of literature, "Anyone can write 
on any subject, in any style. We're a liberal group. Whichever way they write, 
we listen and we accept." 
</P>
<P>
 This is not to say the writers always listen quietly. The tone of their 
meetings runs from restrained glee to raucous debate to wholehearted applause. 
People sometimes talk over each other in their haste to get their opinions out. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice a month, in this room, their opinions matter. Their judgments, albeit 
tactful, are important. "Do Not Disturb Poets at Work," says the sign outside 
their door. Their work is the work of all writers, whatever their age. In the 
words of Lenkawicki: "I leave politics to crooks. From my feelings, from my 
heart, I write poetry." Where and When 
</P>

Hollywood.

 Blenda J. Wilson, president of Cal State Northridge: "Schindler's List" by 
Thomas Keneally 
</P>
<P>
 "The book is written as a novel but is based on interviews with people who 
knew Schindler. This is an interesting approach. As I read it, I am reminded 
that people do courageous and good things, not so much out of structured 
morality, but out of a basic, intuitive sense of humanity." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Anthony Beilenson, (D-Woodland Hills): "The Maine Woods" by Henry David 
Thoreau 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a compilation of Thoreau's journals from three journeys he took by canoe 
in the area of Mount Katahdin (in Maine). It's an area that I've known since I 
was quite young and therefore it brings back a lot of memories. Also, Thoreau 
is a favorite author of mine." 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Acuna, mayor of San Fernando: "Rain of Gold" by Victor Villasenor 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a Mexican-American 'Roots.' It follows three generations of the author's 
family and how they started out in Mexico and all the challenges of raising a 
family and surviving the revolution and then coming to California. You're drawn 
into the story and can visualize what it was like." "Rain of Gold," an excerpt 
</P>
<P>
 It was noon. The shooting had ceased and the people were coming out of hiding. 
Victoriano and Old Man Benito were skinning out the dead mother goat.  
</P>
<P>
 "Lupe," said Dona Guadalupe, "I think it's safe now for you to go get fresh 
water."  
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," said Lupe.  
</P>
<P>
 Cautiously, she made her way down the steep hillside through the 
still-smoldering huts to get water at the creek at the bottom of the canyon. 
Getting to the tall foliage alongside the bubbling brook, Lupe glanced all 
around before bending over to fill her clay pot. She felt nervous, tense, 
exhausted.  
</P>
<P>
 The main part of the village lay burning behind her and across the creek, up 
the slope a few hundred feet, she could see the piles of yellow chalk-like 
waste from the mine and she could hear some of the soldiers further up the 
slope at the American enfencement laughing and joking, truly enjoying 
themselves.  
</P>
<P>
 Senor Jones, who ran the American mine, had prepared a feast for them. This 
was how the Americans always dealt with the soldiers who came shooting into the 
canyon. They fed the soldiers, made them welcome, and then calmed them down by 
promising them weapons from the United States.  
</P>
<P>
 Lupe was bent over between two huge ferns, concentrating on filling her pot, 
when suddenly she felt a dark shadow fall over her.  
</P>
<P>
 Instantly, Lupe knew it was a soldier and he was going to grab her.

COVER STORY; ART OF SHARING; THE CITY ASKS DIVERSE CULTURAL GROUPS TO JOIN AND 
MANAGE SPACES TOGETHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Stricken by budget cuts that could shut down three community arts centers in 
the San Fernando Valley and three more near downtown, Los Angeles officials 
recently sent up a distress signal. They were hoping that a few private arts 
groups would come to their rescue and help run the centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, heartened by a strong response, officials are going a step further. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Cultural Affairs Department is hoping to place not one, but several 
groups in each facility. They are asking such varied entities as jazz 
ensembles, theater troupes and visual artists to combine and manage the spaces 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't make marriages," said Earl Sherburn, the city's community arts 
director. "But we are trying to lead them to the altar." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a romantic notion. Instead of merely surviving, a given center might 
flourish with dance one night and drama the next, with paintings exhibited on 
its walls seven days a week. But the courtship could prove awkward. Arts 
administrators say considerable obstacles can arise when 46 organizations of 
different sizes and disciplines seek to match up. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of these consortia haven't worked in the past," said Robert Caine, 
managing director of Actors Alley, one of the groups that has answered the 
city's call. "It's a matter of being able to schedule and not step on each 
other." 
</P>
<P>
 For years, only one entity -- the Cultural Affairs Department -- has operated 
the community arts centers. The McGroarty Arts Center in Tujunga focuses on 
visual arts, with exhibits ranging in topic from AIDS to immigrant labor. The 
Lankershim Arts Center in North Hollywood was opened in 1990 with performance 
in mind. Halfway across the Valley, the small Encino Photography Center offers 
a low-cost haven to photographers. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the William Grant Still Arts Center, the William Reagh Los Angeles 
Photography Center and Art-in-the-Park provide a variety of cultural activities 
to neighborhoods near downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the city's budget has shrunk in recent years, the Cultural Affairs 
Department has suffered cutbacks. Its larger operations at Barnsdall Park, the 
Watts Towers and the Los Angeles Theater Center remain intact. But funds to 
staff and to present art at smaller facilities have run dangerously low. 
</P>
<P>
 So, last December, the city offered its six community arts centers, rent-free, 
to private groups willing to fill them with exhibits, performances and classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't aware of any other cities aggressively pursuing this kind of 
partnership," said Al Nodal, the department's general manager. "But we needed 
to bring in partners to energize things." 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty-four nonprofit organizations applied. During the first stage of the 
process, they were not asked to name which center they wanted, only to 
demonstrate that they possessed the experience and funding necessary to handle 
the task. Forty-six were deemed qualified. At that point, city officials 
broadened their goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had all these groups doing theater only or dance only," Sherburn said. 
"Our concern became, why can't they all come together?" 
</P>
<P>
 Such cooperation would not be unprecedented, according to California Arts 
Council officials. It exists to a lesser degree at such places as the Fort 
Mason Center in San Francisco and Los Angeles' Music Center, where resident 
companies -- including the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the Music Center Opera and 
the Center Theatre Group/Mark Taper Forum -- share the same cultural tract if 
not the same building. 
</P>
<P>
 But a situation in which several art groups must hammer out the day-to-day 
operation of a single space is unusual and fraught with difficulty, said Henry 
Hopkins, the new director of the Armand Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural 
Center in Westwood. Hopkins explained that artists tend to communicate in ways 
that aren't always suited to meetings and scheduling. 
</P>
<P>
 "And we don't all understand each other's fields completely," Hopkins said. 
"At a very basic level, there is a difference in the needs of a (theater) arts 
group as opposed to a dance group." 
</P>
<P>
 Actors Alley, for instance, could easily fill a center with performances, 
rehearsals and classes nearly every day. The troupe was forced to apply for a 
city center after its home, the refurbished El Portal theater in North 
Hollywood, suffered $1.5 million in damage from the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our plate was full," Caine said. "Then someone broke our plate." 
</P>
<P>
 At the other end of the spectrum, the tiny Los Angeles Printmaking Society 
couldn't manage to run a center for more than one day a week. The society 
operates out of members' houses. Founded to promote lithography, etching and 
silk screening, it mounts occasional exhibits at college galleries. 
</P>
<P>
 "This sounded like a great opportunity for a group like ours that doesn't have 
the money or the staff," said Dona Geib, the society's president. "If we were 
part of a consortium we could share space, and staff the center at various 
times." 
</P>
<P>
 That's where Sherburn comes in. He has cajoled, suggesting to applicants that 
consortia will get a warmer response than single entities. He has played 
matchmaker, inviting group leaders to a series of get-acquainted meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Actors Alley got the message, joining with the Los Angeles Jazz Society, the 
San Fernando Valley Arts Council and Everywoman's Village, a Van Nuys learning 
center that offers a variety of arts classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you go in there and try to get the whole thing for yourself," Caine said, 
echoing the party line, "it's not in keeping with what the city wants." 
</P>
<P>
 Other groups have similarly combined. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, these new consortia must sit down to the nuts-and-bolts work of 
programming and scheduling. 
</P>
<P>
 At some centers, programming is particularly relevant. Residents in the 
downtown neighborhoods surrounding the William Grant Stills Center have urged 
that the facility continue to focus on African-American art. Similarly, 
photographers who rely on the Encino Photography Center hope it won't be 
converted to another use. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won't know until we find out who gets this place and see if they'll let us 
use it sometimes," one of the regulars said. 
</P>
<P>
 Again Sherburn has exerted his influence, suggesting to applicants that they 
implement some of the center's previous programming. 
</P>
<P>
 Applicants must identify which center they want and submit a detailed 
programming proposal by May 16. Panels composed of city administrators, 
government officials and residents are scheduled to render decisions by July 1. 
Selected groups would have until Oct. 1 to occupy their centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Competition is likely to be fiercest for the Lankershim facility, Sherburn 
said. That space boasts Art Deco architecture with Streamline Moderne features. 
It was built in 1939 for the Department of Water and Power, then abandoned in 
the mid-1970s. Arts officials came along in 1990 to renovate and reopen the 
ground floor. Work is under way on upstairs classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's far and away the most popular location," Sherburn said. 
</P>
<P>
 At McGroarty, the center's longstanding support group has formed its own 
consortium and is hoping to keep the facility in familiar hands. Photographers 
at Encino mounted a similar effort but were one of the groups deemed 
unqualified during the first stage of the application process. 
</P>
<P>
 If the effort to combine private groups in each of the centers does not appear 
to be succeeding, the city has left itself the option of rejecting all 
applicants and starting again from scratch. But for all the difficulties the 
ambitious attempt has created, the potential rewards are great. Sherburn clings 
to his vision of diverse programming. Even the applicants can see a light at 
the end of the tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
 "A big challenge has been handed to us," said Laura Selwyn, executive director 
of Everywoman's Village, which has joined three different consortiums vying for 
three different centers. "But there is definite excitement." 
</P>
<P>
 And a tight economy may spur the process. Arts groups have watched their 
funding and exhibit space disappear at a distressing rate. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the survival techniques is through group action," Hopkins said. "That 
is part of what being an artist is going to entail in the next decade." 
</P>
<P>
 Geib, of the printmaking society, is willing to try. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who can be elitist in this day and age?" she asked. "We all need the space."

SEEKING A GALLERY SAVIOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The ARTSPACE gallery in Warner Center is once again in need of a savior. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, the city Cultural Affairs Department stepped in and took 
control of the faltering gallery, turning it into a respected and popular 
exhibit space. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with the city scheduled to move out July 1 because of budget cuts, a 
consortium of arts groups headed by the San Fernando Valley Arts Council is 
hoping to take the reins at ARTSPACE. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to keep an art gallery alive in the West Valley," said Jerry Domine, 
the council's president. "That's our primary motive." 
</P>
<P>
 ARTSPACE opened across from the Warner Center Marriott in 1987 as a showpiece 
for the Cultural Foundation -- a group of San Fernando Valley business people 
and art patrons who hope to build a multimillion-dollar arts center in the 
Sepulveda Basin. 
</P>
<P>
 But the gallery suffered from a disappointing debut when a Rufino Tamayo 
exhibit fell short of expected ticket sales and donations. The space remained 
open only sporadically during its first year. Eventually, foundation leaders 
decided they could not handle both fund-raising for their arts center and the 
day-to-day work of managing a gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 So, in 1988, the foundation subleased the space to the Cultural Affairs 
Department. Over the ensuing years, ARTSPACE featured a variety of exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
 The consortium now interested in managing the gallery would probably continue 
that diversity. In addition to the arts council, the other members are 
Everywoman's Village, the Los Angeles Jazz Society and Actors Alley. This 
consortium is vying for control of the city's Lankershim Arts Center as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "The programming would be slightly different in each location," Domine said. 
</P>
<P>
 Foundation officials have received interest from other groups as well and are 
waiting for detailed proposals before making their decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "A little down time in the summer would not be such a bad thing," said Ross 
Hopkins, the foundation's executive director. "But we want to be running by 
fall." DAVID WHARTON

 San Fernando Valley connoisseurs of classical fare will have a rare, full 
plate of concerts and events to choose from in the next week or so. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Supervisor Ed Edelman will lend his musical talents to the 
16th annual spring concert of the Topanga Philharmonic Orchestra on April 30 at 
the Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum, 1419 N. Topanga Canyon Blvd., Topanga. 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman, who has announced that he will not seek reelection, will play the 
cello with the orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this the beginning of a new career for the soon-to-be-former supervisor? 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's a new career, I'm not going to do too well," Edelman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman has played cello since 1977, primarily for personal satisfaction, 
although he did once perform with the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the Hollywood 
Bowl. He joked that he had declined many past offers to perform publicly 
because he thought that his playing would adversely affect his reelection 
chances. But not this time. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, he said: "I'm getting the music in advance, so I'll have a little head 
start." 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman will be honored at the event for his support of canyon residents in 
their lengthy negotiations with the Disney family trust over the Canyon Oaks 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 Music Director Guido Lamell has compiled an eclectic program, including 
Borodin's "Polovtsian Dances," Copland's "Fanfare for the Common Man" and 
Respighi's "Pines of Rome," plus works by Moncayo and Vivaldi. The concert will 
start at 2 p.m. Tickets are $12.50 advance, $15 at the door, $5 for children 6 
and older and senior citizens, and free for children under 6. Proceeds will 
benefit the Topanga Co-Op School. Call (818) 340-1675. 
</P>
<P>
 Musical Ambassadors: The Croatian chamber music ensemble, I Solisti Di Zagreb, 
will perform works by Mozart, Vivaldi, Handel and Bach at 8 p.m. Saturday at 
the Lancaster Performing Arts Center, 44933 N. Fern Ave. The ensemble, founded 
in 1953, has performed at major music festivals around the world. This is its 
18th North American tour. Tickets are $17 and $15. Call (818) 723-5950. 
</P>
<P>
 American Boychoir: The Angeles Chorale will present the American Boychoir of 
Princeton, N. J., in concert at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday at Northridge United 
Methodist Church, 9650 Reseda Blvd. The 30-voice choir, formerly the Columbus 
Boychoir, has sung with major orchestras and at Lincoln Center, Carnegie Hall 
and Boston's Symphony Hall. The choir, whose members range in age from 11 to 
14, has toured in 22 countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The ensemble will perform a program of choral pieces composed for boys' 
voices. The 50-voice Angeles Chorale Children's Chorus, made up boys and girls 
from the San Fernando Valley and other areas of Los Angeles, will perform with 
the boys' choir on two pieces: Audrey Snyder's "Skylark and Nightingale" and 
John Rutter's "For the Beauty of the Earth." Tickets are $6. (The Angeles 
Chorale itself will not perform.) Call (818) 885-3365. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley Classics: The Valley College Philharmonic Choir and Orchestra, directed 
by George Attarian and Robert Chauls, respectively, will perform at 7 p.m. 
Sunday at the Congregational Church of the Chimes, 14115 Magnolia Blvd., 
Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the concert will be Beethoven's "Mass in C Major" and "Coriolanus 
Overture, Opus 62." Two 20th-Century works featuring a soprano soloist and 
strings will also be performed: Timothy Blickhan's "Five Songs for Soprano and 
String Orchestra" and "Insomnia," composed by Chauls. The featured soprano will 
be Valley resident Tricia Grey. Tickets are $5. Call (818) 781-1200, Ext. 347. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Cal State Northridge's Solo Guitar Students Recital will begin at 8 p.m. 
Thursday at Sepulveda Unitarian Universalist Society, 9550 Haskell Ave., North 
Hills. Admission is free. Call (818) 885-3500. And the New Directions Composers 
Group will perform works by CSUN student composers at 8 p.m. April 30 in Music 
Room 3400 of Pierce College, 6201 Winnetka Ave., Woodland Hills. Admission is 
$6.50, $3.50 students and senior citizens. Call (818) 885-2488. 
</P>
<P>
 Best of the Bard: "The Many Faces of Shakespeare" is different from most 
productions of the poet's work in that the actors in this show are Valley 
schoolchildren. More than 30 students, ranging in age from 6 to 14, from 
Woodland Hills School, Hale Junior High and El Camino High, all in Woodland 
Hills, have sacrificed their MTV time and social lives to rehearse the 18 
selected scenes that make up this production. This independent extracurricular 
activity won the mayor's 1992 Golden Apple Award for educational programs and 
received a grant from the Arts Recovery Fund in 1993 in coordination with 
Rebuild Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Included are scenes from "Henry V," "Julius Caesar," "Romeo and Juliet," "The 
Taming of the Shrew," "Hamlet," "Twelfth Night" and "A Midsummer Night's 
Dream." 
</P>
<P>
 Hale teacher Dwight Protho, a CSUN graduate, has directed more than 30 of 
these shows during the past 12 years. He started the program while teaching at 
Mayall Junior High in Sepulveda in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 "Initially, I was appalled at the lack of opportunity for children to 
participate in the performing arts and to experience Shakespeare," Protho said. 
"In Europe, the cultural fabric is more woven into the educational system." 
</P>
<P>
 Protho says his motivation comes from "the satisfaction of exposing thousands 
of children to Shakespeare and making them fans of Shakespeare, instead of 
despising it." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Many Faces of Shakespeare" will be performed at 7 p.m. Fridays and 
Saturdays at Woodland Hills School, 22201 San Miguel St., through April 30. 
Admission is free. Call (818) 908-1655.

BARGAINS / GERI COOK: THE SAVINGS IN HAND; STORE SELLS EXPENSIVE BAGS AT 
WHOLESALE AND IS AN OUTLET FOR THE BIJOUX MEDICI LABEL. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Several years ago, a local talk show host and television actress let me in on 
her secret source for expensive handbags at wholesale prices. I've been buying 
there ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 The Italian Handbag Showroom is precisely what the name says, but the word 
outlet should be added for a more complete description. The showroom also acts 
as an outlet for the Bijoux Medici label, where owner Jerry Blumenthal sells 
the overage of his inventory and where the fashion-conscious and price-savvy 
shopper can always find a good deal. The inventory at this shop is small but 
very select. 
</P>
<P>
 Blumenthal's handbags are seen in shops up and down Rodeo Drive and in 
specialty shops and boutiques all over the western United States. He makes two 
or three trips to Milan each year to select the skins and the clasps, or 
findings, for his bags, and goes over his designs with the manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
 After he has sold the bulk of his inventory, what is left goes to a small shop 
on the edge of Beverly Hills, where it is marked at wholesale and below prices. 
</P>
<P>
 One group of handbags -- including some small beige envelopes -- retailing 
from $129 to $159 are tagged to close out at $59. The merchandise in an $89 
grouping (retail $195 to $229) caught my eye: A black patent leather with 
ornate findings and chain, some white and beige baby lamb leather bags embossed 
to achieve a lacy look, and a very mod sports bag in a cognac shade were 
outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's in the very high-priced bags that the deals are the best. Stunning 
Caiman crocodile bags sell at one boutique in Beverly Hills for $1,600 to 
$2,000. Blumenthal is closing out the same bags at $450. My favorite: a 
book-like rectangular bag about 12 inches by seven inches in black with a 
shoulder chain. 
</P>
<P>
 In another room across the entry hall is the women's belt collection. Check 
the pricey boutiques, and you'll find that these belts run from $105 to $159. 
Hand-cut, some hand-stitched, with findings of 24-karat gold plate over 
composition metal, they are indeed handsome and, to many, worth the high cost. 
But at the Italian Handbag Showroom, they are $39 and $59. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of us sniff leather products to be sure that we're not buying a man-made 
product. "That will tell you if it's leather, but not if it's good leather," 
Blumenthal said. Sometimes, he says, there may be a slight chemical smell, and 
that's not indicative of good quality. The thing to look for, Blumenthal says, 
is an even thickness, . . . a continuous feel. "It should be the same texture 
all the way through. The leather in poor-quality bags is often uneven, and the 
thin spots tend to tear." WHERE TO SHOP

A SOFTWARE STRATEGY; THERE ARE WAYS TO BUY FOR CHILDREN WITH CONFIDENCE, AND 
MUCH OF THE RESEARCH CAN BE DONE AT HOME.

<P>
 Computer games should be experienced before they're bought. But how? 
</P>
<P>
 Short of playing a game at a friend's house, your children can't pretest a 
game -- educational or otherwise -- to see whether they like it. Software 
retailers don't, by and large, demo computer games. And Blockbuster doesn't 
rent them (except for cartridge games, which are 99% non-educational). 
</P>
<P>
 But there are options -- join Club Kidsoft, use Software Dispatch or enroll 
them in Futurekids classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Club Kidsoft is a home-shopping service that offers short demonstrations of 
the best "edutainment" for kids from 4 to 12. For $17.95 a year, you receive a 
colorful quarterly "magazine" with thumbnail descriptions of 140 top-tier 
edutainment titles. A CD-ROM disk comes with the magazine. Snippets of all 140 
titles are on the disk. Forty of those demos are set up interactively -- your 
kids can play these games for a few minutes to get a feel for them. The other 
85 titles are demonstrated automatically, with no interaction. 
</P>
<P>
 After your children have seen the games and you've found one or more suited to 
their tastes, you can order the product through an 800 number, paying by credit 
card. 
</P>
<P>
 Another CD-ROM shopping service has just arrived on the scene, Software 
Dispatch, a new division of Apple Computer that has 80 programs on its first 
disk. The ordering process works the same way as Club Kidsoft. For a free trial 
disk, call (800) 937-2828, Ext. 600. 
</P>
<P>
 CD-ROM demonstration disks are convenient -- you never have to leave home and 
you've got all the best edutainment at your fingertips. They're close to 
instantaneous (some of the software can be downloaded into your hard drive 
while you're relaying your credit card number). And there's no question that 
even a brief demonstration of a game is vastly more informative than standing 
in a software store eyeballing boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's one major pitfall: The software field has its share of ephemeral 
hits -- those great titles that everybody gets hot over when they arrive on the 
scene but that fade into oblivion moments after they've crested. 
</P>
<P>
 One way to avoid such software is through strategic use of Futurekids. 
Futurekids is a chain of kids' computer-training centers. (There are several in 
the San Fernando Valley.) They offer computer literacy classes for kids from 3 
to 16. For parents looking to start a software library, they are places where 
your child can play with the best software available and find out which games 
are keepers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge Futurekids has an excellent software library with high-rated 
classics and the latest offerings from top-tier companies. Parents could sign 
up their children for lessons, ask to have them trained on software appropriate 
for their age, and add a special request that the teachers track which titles 
engage them most. The resulting list would yield an almost foolproof start on a 
home library. 
</P>
<P>
 But Futurekids is expensive. Prices run about $20 a session, and a four-week 
course is usually the minimum you can sign up for. However, the $80 you might 
spend on a month of Futurekids classes needs to be weighed against the 
absolutely boggling expense of software mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Right after buying my daughter a computer, I bought six edutainment games I'd 
seen on "best" lists. My daughter tried them all, immediately pronounced five 
"boring" and never looked at them again. I watched $250 worth of good 
intentions evaporate into cyberspace. 
</P>
<P>
 But what about the parent grapevine, that word-of-mouth consumer's guide built 
brick by brick upon other parents' expensive boo-boos? You can zero in on 
edutainment classics just by asking your friends what their kids use, but the 
parent grapevine is not necessarily up-to-date. In the fast-changing computer 
world, you need cutting-edge information. Old software standbys, worthwhile as 
they are, lack the pizazz of the best new models. 
</P>
<P>
 To locate the best new programs, you need a reviewing source. It should be 
impartial -- a magazine with editorial input and no advertisers. One truly 
impartial source is Children's Software Revue. Its evaluations of edutainment 
titles are precise, scientific and information-filled. Each issue contains a 
list of "All-Star Software" divided into three age categories, as well as 
"Software Spotlight," which lists the top 20 titles in a particular curriculum 
category. Where to Go

IT'S NOT ALL IN YOUR HEAD; CONTRARY TO POPULAR BELIEF, ULCERS ARE THOUGHT TO BE 
CAUSED BY BACTERIA RATHER THAN EMOTIONS AND STRESS. ANTIBIOTICS MAY HOLD THE 
CURE.

<P>
 Talk about stigma: Ask any ulcer patient. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometime after saying hello, the average person asks someone with stomach 
pain, decreased appetite, heartburn and nausea a psychological questions: "Have 
you been under a lot of stress lately?" "Have you been tense?" 
</P>
<P>
 People often worry that their stomach problems are caused by their fast-track 
jobs or busy schedules, and some are embarrassed that they have not yet learned 
to deal with the rigors of their lives, said Dr. Gerald Green, an Encino-based 
gastroenterologist and chief of staff at Encino / Tarzana Regional Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 But the latest research blames bacteria -- not attitude, coping skills or 
personality. Scientists have learned that a bacterial organism called 
Helicobacter pylori is almost always the cause of stomach and duodenal ulcers, 
said Green, who is also a clinical professor of medicine at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 "Evidence that stress is related to ulcers is not there," Green said. "People 
under stress may develop a variety of gastrointestinal symptoms, such as 
dyspepsia or irritable bowel syndrome -- but not ulcers." 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers at a wide range of medical centers have shown that antibiotics, 
either given alone or in combination with a bismuth agent -- such as 
Pepto-Bismol -- can cure ulcers by eliminating the Helicobacter infection. 
</P>
<P>
 Green said that, before this discovery -- since the 1970s -- people with 
uncomplicated peptic ulcers were typically put on a drug such as cimetadine 
(Tagamet), which would resolve about 90% of the ulcers within four to eight 
weeks. But as many as 70% of the ulcers would recur, which would force the 
patients to go back to the $30-a-month drug regimen, often indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 Patients would often blame their psychological status rather than the 
treatment plan for their protracted illness, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When antibiotics are given instead of Tagamet, ulcers return in only 10% of 
the cases, Green said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although this information has been widely published in the medical literature, 
many people are unaware of the new approach, said Lois Pound, a registered 
nurse and coordinator of the GI / Endoscopy Center at Northridge Hospital 
Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Patients have no idea; they think it's all about stress or diet," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are several simple ways to check for the presence of the bacteria, 
including a blood test and a breath test that checks for a complex chemical 
reaction that occurs when Helicobacter is present, said Green. The organism is 
found in 90% of the people with duodenal ulcers and in as many as 80% of those 
with stomach ulcers, according to some studies. 
</P>
<P>
 The presence of Helicobacter in the stomach tends to be more common as people 
get older, said Green. "In certain populations, more than 50% of those over age 
50 have the bacteria present, yet less than 10% of children are found to have 
the bacteria," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The vast majority of people eventually develop the infection but no symptoms, 
according to Green. Those who have the bacteria and also smoke or take 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs -- such as Motrin or aspirin -- have a 
greater risk of developing an ulcer than do others.  
</P>
<P>
 Ulcers are common. In the United States, about one in 10 people at some time 
in their lives will develop a duodenal ulcer, and one in 30 will get a gastric 
ulcer, according to the American Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Neil Fagen, a gastroenterologist in Northridge, suggests that people with 
stomach symptoms first try over-the-counter remedies and then see their health 
practitioner if symptoms persist or if there is a family history of ulcers.

A BRIEF HISTORY OF ULCER TREATMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA BRONSON GRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Throughout the century, treatment for ulcers has varied widely, ranging from 
diet therapy alone to stomach surgery and drugs. Here's a quick review of the 
major trends over time:  
</P>
<P>
 * 1920s: The use of milk through a naso-gastric tube (a tube inserted through 
the nose, into the stomach) was recommended to neutralize the acid.A bland diet 
with frequent, small meals was also suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1930s to 1960s: Surgery was often performed to cure peptic ulcer disease, 
often removing large portions of the stomach. This was considered a standard 
treatment for those for whom antacids were ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1970s to 1980s: Cimetadine (Tagamet) and ranitidine (Zantac) were introduced 
to decrease the acid production of the stomach and reduce symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1990s: Helicobacter pylori was found to be a common cause of ulcers; 
treatment includes antibiotics, bismuth, and sometimes acid blockers. BARBARA

A WALK ON THE DARK SIDE; NIGHT HIKERS ENJOY A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE OF THE 
MOUNTAINS AND CANYONS NEAR THE VALLEY.

 Night had fallen in the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 A dozen or so hikers paused on a craggy overlook at Charmlee Natural Reserve 
in Malibu to watch the sun set in a blaze of crimson over the ocean. Now, under 
the light of the full moon and serenaded by a cacophonous melody of frogs, they 
picked their way back to the trail head. 
</P>
<P>
 A rustle pierced the darkness, and the walkers stopped in their tracks. What 
was that? 
</P>
<P>
 "Could be a deer," observed ranger Matt Kouba, who accompanied the group. 
"Could be a bobcat. Could be a coyote. Or it could be our imagination." 
</P>
<P>
 Giggling, the hikers continued on their way. "The kids will sleep good 
tonight," Dorothy Black of Chatsworth said in a satisfied voice as her 
children, Selina, 9, and Joe, 8, completed the three-mile walk. 
</P>
<P>
 Such encounters with nature take place almost every night on organized evening 
hikes in the mountains and canyons in and near the San Fernando Valley. Walkers 
who venture out after sunset will find a welcome respite from workday woes, 
congenial company of fellow hikers and a chance to become acquainted with local 
wilderness areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "These walks are for people who get 'four-wall-itis,' " said Jill Swift of 
Tarzana, who leads regular night walks through Caballero Canyon. "The hikes 
give people the opportunity to get away from their structured environment and 
smell the wonderful damp evening air and hear the lovely natural sounds. 
Walking through chaparral is like walking in an herb garden. And people hear 
the coyotes howling and the birds singing their sweet little songs as they 
settle down for the night. People are delighted with the great sense of 
well-being and freedom they have after a hike." 
</P>
<P>
 While day walkers marvel over colorful spring wildflower displays, night 
trekkers observe a whole different set of natural wonders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the wildlife comes out in the evening. Because we are under cover of 
darkness, we can get closer to them," said Kouba, the ranger. "And we can watch 
the sun set and the moon rise, which is really neat." 
</P>
<P>
 As our ability to see diminishes, our other senses become more acute, Kouba 
added. Sagebrush smells spicier, the damp air feels cleaner on our skin, the 
animals' wild howls sound nearer and clearer.  
</P>
<P>
 There's another sound heard on the trail after dark -- bongo drums. 
</P>
<P>
 Musicians, including harpists, violinists, bongo players and folk singers, 
regularly join the night hikers at Charmlee Natural Reserve. Evening hikes in 
other areas are likely to feature storytellers, bird watchers or meditators. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very interesting people show up," said Carolyn Greene, a Thousand Oaks 
environmental planner who leads regular evening walks through Rancho Sierra 
Vista near Newbury Park. "You can imagine what kind of people are brought out 
by the full moon." Paths to Relaxation

Sierra Club, (213) 386-4287. A Few Suggestions 
</P>
<P>
 Some suggestions for a safe and comfortable walk after the sun sets: 
</P>
<P>
 * Carry a flashlight. While you may not need it on moonlit paths, you'll feel 
better having it with you. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bring a light jacket or sweat shirt. The weather may be comfortable when 
your hike begins, but evening temperatures can drop many degrees, especially 
near the ocean. Long pants and long sleeves protect you from poison oak and 
scratches from chaparral. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wear sturdy shoes. Lightweight, mid-ankle hiking boots with a good tread are 
best. Break them in before hitting the trail. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fill your canteen. At least one quart of water per person is recommended. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stay on the trail. You'll avoid brushing against poison oak, and you'll 
reduce your chances of getting lost.

CLEANUP TEAM; THE AUDUBON SOCIETY AND TILLMAN RECLAMATION PLANT WILL JOIN 
FORCES FOR EARTH DAY, INVITING THE PUBLIC TO PICK UP LITTER, WATCH BIRDS AND 
TAKE GARDEN TOURS.

 You might think the Audubon Society -- one of the first environmental 
organizations in the United States -- and the Tillman Water Reclamation Plant 
-- the city-operated facility that processes the stuff that San Fernando Valley 
residents run down their drains and flush down their toilets -- wouldn't have 
much to do with each other. 
</P>
<P>
 You would be wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 The Audubon Society and the Tillman Plant are getting together to throw an 
Earth Day celebration and cleanup from 8 a.m. to noon Saturday at the Sepulveda 
Basin Wildlife Area in Van Nuys. The agenda for the day includes picking up 
litter -- which will be recycled or composted as much as possible -- along the 
paths, followed by bird-watching, nature walks and tours of the Japanese Garden 
and Tillman plant. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a great opportunity for the public to learn, to help take care of this 
wonderful nature area, and make a difference in their environment," said Muriel 
Kotin, president of the San Fernando Valley chapter of the Audubon Society. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning at 10 a.m., easy, one-mile bird-watching walks through the wildlife 
reserve will be led by Audubon Society volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Kotin, waterfowl such as herons and egrets are likely to be 
spotted in the lake, and orioles, blue grosbeaks and red-winged blackbirds will 
probably be singing from the trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who can't bring binoculars can borrow them, and bird-watchers must be at 
least 8 years old, Kotin said. Sunscreen, broad-rimmed hats, gardening gloves 
and sturdy shoes are suggested for participating in the cleanup and nature 
walks.  
</P>
<P>
 One-hour tours of the Tillman Water Reclamation Plant will begin at 10 a.m. 
for anyone at least 12 years old. Treated waste water from the Tillman Plant -- 
which filters, chlorinates and dechlorinates more than 40 million gallons of 
raw sewage every day -- is used to fill the lakes and irrigate the wildlife 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 Docents also will lead tours through the Japanese Garden next to the Tillman 
plant. Fashioned after 18th-Century Japanese estates, the 6.5 acres are 
composed of three distinct areas -- a dry, Zen garden with stone and gravel 
arrangements, bonsai and a wisteria arbor; a strolling garden with waterfalls, 
lakes, streams, bridges and hand-carved stone lanterns, and a tea garden, 
including a teahouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Azaleas, willows, magnolias, cherry trees, iris and lotus are planted in the 
garden, and reclaimed water treated at the Tillman Plant is used for irrigation 
and to create the lakes, streams and waterfalls. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want the public to make the connection between reclaimed water, the 
beautiful garden and wilderness lake," said Lynne Goldsmith, a spokeswoman for 
the city's waste-water program. "Treated water can be safely reused for 
people's enjoyment, to create beautiful areas and to benefit the environment." 
Where and When 
</P>
<P>
 What: Earth Day Celebration and Cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 Location: Sepulveda Basin Wildlife Area, 17015 Burbank Blvd., Van Nuys. Park 
in lots off Woodley Avenue, north of Burbank Boulevard.

<P>
 Hours: Cleanup 8 a.m. to noon Saturday, bird-watching and nature walk, 10 a.m. 
to noon. Tillman Water Reclamation Plant and Japanese Garden tours, every 
half-hour from 10 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Who's invited: Anyone at least 8 years old for cleanup and bird-watching 
nature walks; 12 years and older for Tillman plant and Japanese Garden tours. 
</P>
<P>

OUT FOR THE COUNT; VALLEY BIRDERS WILL HELP THE AUDUBON SOCIETY CONDUCT A 
CENSUS OF TRICOLORED BLACKBIRDS, WHICH FLOCK TO CHATSWORTH RESERVOIR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Valley birders will count tricolored blackbirds Saturday as part of the first 
single-date statewide census of the species. 
</P>
<P>
 Coordinated by the western re gional office of the National Audubon Society, 
working with the California Department of Fish and Game, the survey will try to 
determine the number of tricoloreds -- a species native to California -- and 
the status of their breeding and foraging grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The census, Fish and Game biologist Lyann Comrack explains, is part of a 
coordinated effort to make sure that the blackbird, whose numbers appear to 
have dwindled dramatically over the past 50 years, doesn't go bye-bye. 
</P>
<P>
 Comrack estimates there are between 200,000 and 400,000 of the birds in 
California. Those numbers sound large, but, as she points out, tricolored 
blackbirds, unlike redwings, nest in colonies and seem to thrive only when they 
are surrounded with vast numbers of other tricoloreds. 
</P>
<P>
 Loss of habitat is the major reason for the tricolored's decline, according to 
Arthur Langton, who will be looking for them at Chatsworth Reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to have a lot more marshlands once upon a time," says Langton, a past 
president of the San Fernando Valley Audubon Society and a physical sciences 
teacher at Sutter Middle School in Canoga Park. Tricoloreds need wetlands dense 
with bulrushes, cattails and other aquatic vegetation in order to breed, 
Langton explains, and most of those have vanished in the increasingly urbanized 
San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the more common redwings, which are often spotted in pairs, tricoloreds 
fly around with their fellows. "Great flocks of them disappear into the 
bulrushes," says Langton. Tricoloreds can also be distinguished by their 
markings. Redwings have red and yellow epaulets on their wings, while the 
tricolored's markings are red and white. How white? "About as white as you're 
going to get on a bird," Langton says. 
</P>
<P>
 The two species also have distinctive warbles. According to Bob Barnes, who 
coordinates Audubon's Birds in the Balance program in Sacramento, the redwing 
has a melodic call, while the tricolored has a braying, non-musical cry that 
sounds (depending on who's listening) like mi-a. "It's like a redwing that's 
had its vocal cords messed up," Barnes says. 
</P>
<P>
 Langton has spotted about 200 adult tricoloreds at the Chatsworth Reservoir, 
which has been allowed to become a 40-acre pond full of cattails and other 
vegetation ideal for sheltering the breeding birds. Owned by the Los Angeles 
Department of Water and Power, the reservoir is now a "de facto wildlife 
refuge," Langton says. But he fears the blackbirds will be threatened if the 
city's chronic fiscal problems lead to the reservoir's being sold for private 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 The birds travel as far as five miles from their breeding grounds to foraging 
grounds -- usually drier grassland areas -- where they "eat any small, crawly 
insects they can find," Langton says. 
</P>
<P>
 Ornithologists say there are relatively few tricoloreds left in Southern 
California, especially in the dry inland valleys. Local birders will also count 
beaks in the Sepulveda Basin and at several sites in the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The census was scheduled after a one-day count of the mountain plover Jan. 29 
proved to be a great success, tallying more than 3,000 mountain plovers 
statewide and revealing useful new data on how the birds behave. 
</P>
<P>

Barnes, NAS Regional Office, 555 Audubon Place, Sacramento, CA 95825, phone

RESTAURANT REVIEW; SENMI IS A TASTY SECRET; * RESTAURANT IS ACCESSIBLE, 
AFFORDABLE, AND SATISFYING, BUT LITTLE KNOWN, EVEN TO NEARBY CAL STATE 
NORTHRIDGE STUDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Friday in Valley Life!

<TEXT>
<P>
 Here's a howdy-do. Around the Cal State Northridge campus, chain restaurants 
usually fill to capacity, while great little ethnic haunts only a few 
building-lengths away may sit two-thirds empty. Who said life's fair? 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the CSUNies don't know what they're missing in Senmi, an extraordinary 
Japanese noodle house along the lines of the one in the Juzo Itami film 
"Tampopo." Convenient as it is to the campus (and cheap: nothing over $7), 
apparently only the Japanese students eat there. Curiously, Senmi's owner, 
Yoshihiro Yokochi, a go-getter with just enough English to take your order, 
looks like a student himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Senmi's decor is minimalist in the strict Japanese sense: white chairs, black 
tables, a couple of paper lanterns. It's so authentic-looking, the only way you 
can tell you haven't space-warped right into Japan is that there are Kikkoman 
and Tabasco bottles on all the tables; an odd cross-cultural effect. 
</P>
<P>
 I find this style of Japanese food far more accessible than sushi, and a much 
more efficient road to quick satisfaction. Noodles are the staff of life in 
Japan, where sushi is really considered either a delicacy or a snack, depending 
on the type.  
</P>
<P>
 The aptly named Senmi ramen is probably the best thing on the menu. It's an 
enormous bowl of long, thin flour noodles in a broth infused with the essences 
of ginger, bamboo and garlic. You can order it as spicy as you want. Yokochi 
throws in a handful of ground pork and sauteed vegetables for good measure, but 
the dish would be soulful enough without them. With them, it is a virtual 
epiphany for under $5.  
</P>
<P>
 One evening I made a meal of the delicious bacon spaghetti. Something looked 
familiar about it -- something non-Italian, I mean. Suddenly I realized that 
the topping was shredded nori , a kind of dried seaweed. Underneath, the tastes 
of mushrooms, Canadian bacon and butter predominated, making for a richer 
supper than you might expect. 
</P>
<P>
 The plump flour noodles called udon are delicious in a fish-flavored broth; 
the sansai , or dried mixed vegetable, is a topping. Gomoku literally means 
"five flavors"; here, the soup is flavored with shrimp, carrots, bamboo, corn 
and mushrooms. Miso tanmen is a broth based on fermented beans, rounded out by 
pork and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who prefer that their noodles not come floating in soup should go for 
the buckwheat flour noodles called soba , which are cooked on a griddle. The 
best-known version is called yakisoba , here fried with chicken and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 Yokochi has recently expanded his menu to include some appetizers and 
Chinese-influenced stir-fries, and even a few setto -- set dinners including a 
quirky cabbage salad with Thousand Island dressing, miso soup, pickles and 
rice. My favorite appetizer is the delicious gyoza , which comes six to an 
order. These tiny, delicate pot-stickers have a meaty filling mixed with a 
little minced bamboo. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the stir-fries, mabo tofu consists of cubes of bean curd in a spicy meat 
sauce. In origin, this is a staple of northern China, but the Japanese have 
improved upon it (better tofu, more subtly spiced). The tasty pork and spicy 
vegetable stir fry is, I suspect, the same thing as the topping that is tossed 
into your bowl of ramen. It goes well with rice, too, and here you get a lot 
more of it. 
</P>
<P>
 The setto entrees are rather plain, but fresh and good to eat. The fried 
chicken -- small chunks wrapped in a light, golden batter -- tastes of fresh 
cooking oil. When you order broiled mackerel, you get a whole fish with a firm 
flesh and strong flavors, the perfect companion for its accompanying mound of 
fresh ginger. 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't order the Japanese hamburg steak, because it dawned on me that 
something akin to that would always be available at the Chili's across the 
street. But I couldn't help wondering whether at Chili's you can get a burger 
with soy, ginger and miso soup. Somehow, I didn't think so. Where and When

 WIND RIDER: You'll see more than sailboats racing today in the 
Newport-Ensenada Yacht Race (B1). Lanee Butler, 23, of Dana Point, a windsurfer 
in the 1992 Olympics, will be windsurfing the 125-mile distance. She's doing it 
to raise money to go to the 1996 Olympics. . . . "It's probably going to take 
20 to 30 hours," she says. "I can't keep up with the best boats, but some won't 
make it until Sunday, so hopefully I'll beat a few of them." 
</P>
<P>
 HAPPY TRAILS: When aerospace engineer Ken Croker started mountain hiking 22 
years ago, there were just two Orange County trails. Now, thanks to Croker and 
others in the Sierra Club, there are 20 trails. . . . Saturday, the club makes 
its 200th trail maintenance trip -- repairing damage from storms or neglect -- 
by working the Morgan Trail just off Ortega Highway. Anyone healthy is welcome 
to come along. Says Croker: "We think if people can use the land, they might 
care about it more." 
</P>
<P>
 NEW BARBIES? Golden West College spokeswoman Wendy Weber knows about roles 
changing for women: "When I was little, my Barbie doll went shopping. My 
4-year-old daughter has a Barbie doll, but she says hers is going to a 
meeting." . . . Weber is one of seven women speaking on the subject at a Women 
in Leadership Conference today at South Coast Plaza Village. Weber says the 
challenge is to juggle a career, motherhood and community service: "We don't 
use the term 'superwoman' anymore. Now we just do it." 
</P>
<P>
 FAMILY TIES: It was Kathleen E. Faley who suggested to her brother Dan in 1986 
that he propose special games for the developmentally disabled as a class 
project at Cal State Fullerton. It started with 90 youngsters. Today's campus 
event -- named for Kathleen, killed in a car accident in 1987 -- will draw 840. 
. . . "It's become a family affair for us," says John Faley of Placentia, Dan's 
father. "But a lot of great people are helping." One is Rams quarterback T.J. 
Rubley, who hosts the barbecue to follow.

 EARTH DAY: It's time once again to praise the only planet we have and do some 
things that might help it stick around a little longer. Yes, Earth Day is here, 
which means a whole slew of activities around the Valley today and Saturday 
(Valley Life! Page 33). . . . You can help out by cleaning up beaches, planting 
trees or recycling (B2). 
</P>
<P>
 WELCOME BACK: Something was wrong this spring: no Girl Scout cookies. Blame it 
on the quake, which put our sugar binge back a month. Well, relief is finally 
here. Starting today, Girl Scouts will be selling cookies all over the Valley. 
. . . "We got calls from people who thought they missed it," a San Fernando 
Valley Girl Scout Council spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 PARENTAL DECISIONS: A special section on parenting in today's paper provides 
helpful information and advice for everyone who struggles with raising a 
family. How do you teach children to deal with bullies? How do you get the 
little one to sleep? Also, how to handle birthday parties, how to choose a 
summer camp and teaching adolescents to dance -- and behave (Valley Parenting). 
</P>
<P>
 FOREIGN LEGEND: He may be the most popular German import to hit Northridge 
since Beck's beer. He's Oliver Heitmann, a CSUN volleyball star who gives the 
Matadors a chance for the Final Four (C8). . . . "We don't have a great team," 
a teammate said. "But we have a good team, and we have that one guy -- Oliver 
-- who can take over a game." 
</P>
<P>
 OFF THE COURT: But things aren't so hunky-dory with the CSUN women's 
basketball program. In fact, they're not very good at all. Now comes word that 
the dismissal Wednesday of two players came after a feud that began with "a 
severe violation" of team policy, according to Coach Kim Chandler (C8). . . . 
"I won't jeopardize the principles of this program no matter who is involved," 
she said. Michael Arkush

DANA PARSONS : REFLECTIONS ON A LARGER-THAN-LIFE ENIGMA, RICHARD NIXON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first presidential vote I ever cast was for George McGovern. 
</P>
<P>
 Check that. The first presidential vote I ever cast was against Richard Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 McGovern for president? No way, but my unbridled contempt for the Nixon-Agnew 
ticket and for the four years of the Vietnam War under their Administration was 
such that I would have voted for Fidel Castro had he run. 
</P>
<P>
 As a 23-year-old, I projected onto Nixon and Agnew all the hypocrisy, 
pettiness and political evil that I thought resided in a large segment of their 
"Silent Majority." And yet, I was not one of those inveterate Nixon-haters that 
his supporters dismissed out of hand. As a Midwestern boy uninterested in 
politics until college, I had no reservoir of ill will toward Nixon. In fact, 
he seemed plenty Midwestern himself and I probably would have voted for him in 
1968. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1972, I despised him. Agnew's forced resignation in 1973 only confirmed my 
suspicions about both of them. Meanwhile, as a young reporter in Omaha, I was 
spellbound by the stream of Watergate disclosures and then almost drunkenly 
giddy when my newspaper, long one of Nixon's staunchest backers, called for his 
resignation after editors spent hours reviewing transcripts of the newly 
released Watergate tapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Contemplating Nixon now, as of this writing in a coma and perhaps near death, 
it occurs to me I haven't had that kind of passion, good or ill, for any major 
political figure since. 
</P>
<P>
 On one level, I must have known he might die before me, but the prospect of it 
has an air of unreality and pathos. Not even the most public disgrace 
imaginable kept him down forever. He was ultimately invincible and 
impenetrable, the embodiment of something or someone that stretched way beyond 
his own identity. As such, how could we not help but think of him as immortal? 
</P>
<P>
 At a time like this, I'm happy that my onetime pathological need to vilify 
Nixon has long since passed. As the memory of Vietnam and Watergate faded, so 
did the rancor. I'm in favor of rehabilitation for everybody. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, then, I tried to get a more realistic fix on him. Where his 
admirers saw a great man, though, I saw an average man who by dint of some hard 
work and a lot of happenstance got to where he was. Where his admirers credited 
him with vast political acumen, I saw nothing extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, I couldn't cite anything but his survivability. He seemed like the 
quintessential "Man in the Gray Flannel Suit," driven to succeed and to be 
somebody but without much humanity behind it. 
</P>
<P>
 For a long article on Nixon four years ago, I interviewed Stephen Ambrose, a 
scholar and biographer of both Nixon and Dwight D. Eisenhower. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes him tick, I asked Ambrose. "I don't know what makes him tick," he 
said. "You put it all together and it doesn't come out with 2 plus 2 equals 4. 
With him, 2 plus 2 equals 5. He's bigger than his life, bigger than his 
background. He's a unique human being. In a way, we're all unique, but you and 
I aren't Dick Nixon. He can't be explained, it seems to me." 
</P>
<P>
 I guess I liked Ambrose's quote because it reflected my own ambiguity about 
Nixon. We could understand Kennedy's charm, Eisenhower's towering wartime 
stature, Truman's populist appeal, LBJ's can-do swagger . . . but what was it 
that Nixon brought to the dance? 
</P>
<P>
 Ambrose went on to say that Nixon's legendary insecurity didn't make sense. 
"He was nominated by his party five times for national office. Four times he 
won and still he feels mistreated and unappreciated by the American people. How 
do you put that together? Henry Kissinger has a line, not often quoted, that I 
think is worth pondering: 'Think what this man could have done if anyone had 
ever loved him.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Many people now are saying, of course, that they love Nixon. Even given the 
delicate nature of his condition, the thought of the public loving Richard 
Nixon still doesn't ring true. How can you love someone you never came to 
understand? 
</P>
<P>
 But weep not, because none of that may matter to the enigmatic native son of 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm often asked if I've come to like Dick Nixon," Ambrose told me in 1990, 
"and my reply is, 'I don't think he wants to be liked. I think he wants to be 
admired and respected, and I have come to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 If the end is, in fact, nigh for Nixon, he must have taken solace in knowing 
that so many millions around the world accorded him that admiration and 
respect. And even the enemies he loved to hate must pay homage to this highly 
public man who still somehow pulled off the amazing feat of remaining at least 
partly unexplained, right to the end.

TEAM PROMISED FOR COUNTY IF STADIUM IS BUILT; BASEBALL: CAMARILLO, OXNARD AND 
VENTURA OFFICIALS AGREE TO TAKE THE OFFER FROM A MINOR LEAGUE PRESIDENT TO 
THEIR CITY COUNCILS.

<P>
 A minor league baseball official Thursday promised Ventura County a team if 
communities agree to build a stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they go ahead with the project, I can deliver a ball club here," said 
Joseph Gagliardi, president of the California League, a class A league with 10 
teams statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got about four or five clubs that probably will have to move in the next 
two years: No ifs, ands or buts." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from Camarillo, Oxnard and Ventura agreed to take the concept to 
their city councils in the weeks ahead and look for ways to fund the stadium 
project jointly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are interested in getting a sports complex in Ventura County, I mean a 
first-class one, that will house a minor league baseball team and keep it," 
Camarillo Mayor Ken Gose told about 100 supporters at a meeting Thursday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the three cities have already visited other minor league 
stadiums and identified about 10 potential sites in the west county. They 
invited mayors and public officials from the east county to attend Thursday's 
meeting, but received no response. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just didn't tickle anybody's fancy as a real priority right now," said 
Greg Stratton, mayor of Simi Valley. "If people want to go to a ball game, you 
can go down to Dodger Stadium." 
</P>
<P>
 He also questioned the cost of building a stadium and the return on the 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need to spend a lot of money on a stadium . . . and we have a lot of 
things we need in this community more than a baseball stadium," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The three west Ventura County communities hope to explore using redevelopment 
bonds or public-private partnerships to fund the project, which could cost $3.5 
million to $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the stadium and the team would not make up the money invested in 
them, a consultant warned the group Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Minor league teams cannot pay the mortgage. It won't happen," said Don Young, 
who developed a stadium in Lake Elsinore southeast of Los Angeles. "You will be 
lucky if they pay the ongoing operating expenses." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he said, the community should look at the team as a quality-of-life 
investment. West Ventura County's demographics -- 136,000 families with 
children live in a 20-mile radius of a central site -- makes it an ideal 
location for minor league ball, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's last experience with class A baseball ended after only one year, 
when the Ventura Gulls moved to San Bernardino in search of a stadium. Forced 
to play at Ventura College, the Gulls had neither professional locker rooms nor 
lights for night games. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, west county leaders hope to line up the stadium before the team 
arrives. An Oxnard businessman, Stanley Moorman, expressed interest last year 
in buying a minor league franchise. Thursday, Moorman declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 New league rules, requiring bigger and better stadiums, have prompted many 
ball clubs to look for new homes. Some of the older cities have neither the 
money nor the inclination to upgrade their stadiums, said Gagliardi of the 
California League. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, communities such as Lake Elsinore and Rancho Cucamonga have 
found a growing audience for the game. Rancho Cucamonga, in San Bernardino 
County, drew 330,000 fans last year and sold out 90% of its games. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Elsinore in Riverside County drew 6,700 fans to the opening of its 
6,000-seat stadium last week, and brought in a total of 30,000 fans in less 
than a week, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new stadiums can also be used for concerts, soccer matches and other 
events, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials in Ventura County began talking about a cooperative effort last 
fall and have already drawn up a list of sites that fit the specifications -- 
at least 20 acres of privately owned land, which does not fall in the county's 
greenbelt. 
</P>
<P>
 The sites include land near the Auto Center in Oxnard, sites off Victoria and 
Valentine roads in Ventura and property in Camarillo Springs and near Adolpho 
Camarillo High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Before considering a site, however, the communities must develop a business 
plan and study the feasibility of a stadium, Gose said. He will seek approval 
for further study from the Camarillo City Council next week. Oxnard and Ventura 
are expected to consider the matter in two or three weeks, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks Councilman Frank Schillo said he could not attend Thursday's 
meeting, but planned to refer the issue to a new committee, the Conejo Sports 
Federation.

OWNERS OF OXNARD RADISSON IN DEFAULT; TOURISM: FORECLOSURE LOOMS FOR THE 
250-ROOM HOTEL BUT CITY OFFICIALS DON'T EXPECT THE BUSY RESORT TO CLOSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Owners of the Radisson Suite Hotel in Oxnard face bank foreclosure after 
failing to repay $18.8 million on time, but city officials say they do not 
expect Oxnard's busiest hostelry to close. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials confirmed that Manufacturers Bank last month declared Westland Co. 
of Ventura in default on $14 million in loans and $4.8 million in interest 
payments on the 250-room hotel at the River Ridge Golf Course. 
</P>
<P>
 The 7-year-old hotel is the site of the Los Angeles Raiders' summer training 
camp. Its construction was partly underwritten by the city to lure the football 
team and gain favorable publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 But the hotel's current problems raise new questions about whether owners will 
ever repay the cash-strapped city for its $1-million-a-year bond payment on the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 The final deadline for paying the owners' bank debt passed early this month, 
but the bank has not yet proceeded with foreclosure, said lawyer Alan Holmberg, 
who represents the city, which owns the land beneath the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next move is the bank's," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank lawyers declined comment. Westland general partner Glenn Hartman could 
not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact of foreclosure is uncertain. But Oxnard officials said the hotel 
probably would stay open even with a change of ownership, because closure would 
hurt all parties. 
</P>
<P>
 The city would lose bed and sales taxes estimated by the hotel at $300,000 a 
year, and the hotel would lose some of its resale value if shut down, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's in the bank's interest to maintain a hotel there, at least until they 
can sell it," said Steven Kinney, president of Greater Oxnard Economic 
Development Corp., a city-funded agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with the hotel is not its current performance, but its past 
construction debt, Kinney said. The hotel has performed well since a change in 
operators in 1989, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It had a solid 70% occupancy rate last year and 81% occupancy for the first 
quarter of 1994, operators said. And its income per available room was up 
substantially last year, General Manager Vern Heitzenrader said. 
</P>
<P>
 Occupancy is high partly because of discounts, with the average room rate of 
only about $61 a night last year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Heitzenrader, an employee of operator Sterling Hotels Corp. and not of 
Westland, said he knew nothing of the foreclosure.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know that the enterprise is not doing well," he said. "A lot of 
hotels in this area are only running around 60% occupancy." 
</P>
<P>
 But the project is victim of its shaky financial history, Kinney said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a poorly constructed deal on behalf of the city when it was first put 
together in 1985," Kinney said, "and we haven't been able to escape the 
consequences. The only way to turn it around is to scrape it financially down 
to zero, to offload all the debt, and to rebuild from the ground up." 
</P>
<P>
 The series of events that led to the Radisson's construction began in 1985, 
when the Raiders announced that they were looking for a new training field for 
their six-week summer camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing a chance to polish the city's image and boost tourism, Oxnard officials 
promised the Raiders a field and hotel rooms by June, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders agreed, and the city quickly struck a deal with a development 
group now reorganized as Westland Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The city bought the hotel site and built a sprawling parking lot by issuing a 
$9-million bond. The hotel was to offset the city's $985,000 yearly bond 
payment, but it had no money left after payments on construction loans. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The city renegotiated the Radisson deal in 1989, allowing Westland to pay only 
a minimal annual rent of $30,000 the first year and calling for steadily 
increasing payments until again reaching $985,000 in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 Hotel owners have made their minimal payments -- totaling $300,000 over the 
last five years -- as required by the new contract, city financial analyst Jim 
Fabian said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city, meanwhile, continued its $985,000 annual payments until refinancing 
lowered the payment to $875,000 last fall, Fabian said. The 20-year bonds not 
will not be paid off until 2005. The city's overall budget is about $60 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering the past, Kinney said he does not think the pending foreclosure 
will hurt the city unless the hotel closes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably not damaging for the city," he said. "I mean, how much worse 
off can we be?"

VENTURA TO SALUTE '50S BEACH ERA; RECREATION: THE WEEKEND CELEBRATION WILL 
INCLUDE BANDS, ART EXHIBITS AND FOOD BOOTHS ALONG PROMENADE.

<P>
 Ventura will kick off its biggest special event of the year this weekend with 
the ninth annual California Beach Party, a two-day celebration of the early 
days of surfing and 1950s beach culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Rock bands, art exhibits and food booths will line the mile-long beachfront 
promenade from Surfers Point to the Ventura Pier, while sporting events such as 
a volleyball tournament and the Longboard Surfing Championships will take place 
on the beach itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "The beach party is sort of a signature event for Ventura, the one that we're 
known for throughout the state," said Faye Campbell, the city's special events 
coordinator. "The city is very keen on spotlighting our beachfront. We're a 
beach town." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's event drew more than 25,600 people over the weekend. With 
Metrolink providing train service to the festival this year for the first time, 
the city hopes to top that this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we have good weather we feel like we could have 15,000 a day this year," 
Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 But forecasters warn that cloudy skies and possibly showers could dampen the 
festivities. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're looking at for the moment is a slight chance of rain for 
Saturday," said Clay Morgan, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service 
in Oxnard. "At the very least we're going to have cloud problems." 
</P>
<P>
 But beach party organizers are optimistic it won't rain on their parade. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's got to pour pretty heavy to have it stop (the event)," said Jean 
Thompson, a volunteer with special events. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never had poor weather," Campbell added. "It's usually the first time 
(spectators) get to wear their shorts -- they may just have to wear a jacket 
this year." 
</P>
<P>
 For the third year in a row, festival-goers will have to pay to enter the 
festival. Fences have already started going up on the promenade area. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to last year's popular events, such as the classic car show and 
swimwear fashion show, beach party organizers have added a few new acts to the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Frisbee-catching canines will make their professional debut on the Ventura 
sand Saturday and Sunday in the World Beach Flying Disc International, 
competing for more than $2,000 in cash and prizes. 
</P>
<P>
 Rock 'n' roll deejay Wolfman Jack is the official "meeter and greeter" of this 
year's classic car show, where more than 200 vintage autos will be on display. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The beach party will also celebrate the newly restored Ventura Pier, which was 
reopened in October after 13 months and $3.5 million worth of renovations. 
Children can ride a miniature train that will cruise the pier to one of five 
stages where party-goers can enjoy live entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink trains will run both days from Simi Valley to Ventura, stopping in 
Moorpark, Camarillo and Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets from Simi Valley and Moorpark will cost $6 round trip and $3 one way. 
From Camarillo and Oxnard, tickets will cost $4 round trip and $2 one way. 
Metrolink monthly pass holders and children 5 and under ride free. 
</P>
<P>
 Parking will cost $3 and is available at San Buenaventura State Beach Park, 
the fairgrounds and the parking garage near the pier. Free shuttle service from 
the park will be provided. California Beach Party Events 
</P>
<P>
 The California Beach Party will run from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday and Sunday 
on the beach promenade near downtown Ventura. Some sporting events start 
earlier. Admission is $5.50 for adults, $3.50 for senior citizens and free for

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; DEVELOPER HAS BIG PLANS FOR WAGON WHEEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Plans to expand the intersection of the Ventura Freeway and Pacific Coast 
Highway have prompted Oxnard developer Martin V. Smith to redesign the Wagon 
Wheel, the Western-motif resort that once sparkled as a playground for 
Hollywood's elite. 
</P>
<P>
 While state transportation officials are designing an interchange to handle 
thousands more drivers, consultants for Smith are drawing up blueprints for a 
21st-Century entertainment complex to rival the best in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we're done, we want to see a fairly intense office, residential and 
commercial mix all on one piece of property," said Walter Calhoun, a vice 
president with Smith & Associates, one of Oxnard's largest landowners and 
developers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard City Council on Tuesday is scheduled to review initial plans for 
the Wagon Wheel development. 
</P>
<P>
 Calhoun envisions a sprawling complex that would house residences, office 
buildings, commercial businesses and entertainment centers -- much like the 
original Wagon Wheel that opened 45 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no timeline on it," he said. "We could do it in five years or we 
could do it in 20 years. But it has to be master-planned now (because of the 
freeway expansion)." 
</P>
<P>
 The 47-acre resort across from The Esplanade mall is dotted with dozens of 
businesses with names like Debra's Wig Fashions and Grandes barbershop. The 
handles on the front door of the 88-room motel are crafted out of branding 
irons, and wooden-spoked wheels line the patios and landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
 Old-timers reminisce fondly of the resort's glory years, when movie stars like 
Jack Nicholson and Ernest Borgnine quenched their thirst at the bar. Even 
today, autographed photos of stars like Ann-Margret, Clint Eastwood and Roy 
Clark hang on the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's going to be a lot of us who are going to miss this place," said 
Richard Burns, who for years has worked as a piano player in the Wagon Wheel 
cocktail lounge. "There aren't a lot of places like this around." 
</P>
<P>
 But Sue VanCamp, another executive with Smith & Associates, said they would 
try to build the new complex with the same sense of attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was unique in its time when it was built," VanCamp said. "It was the only 
thing of its caliber in Oxnard. But whatever we put there will be of the best 
quality and in keeping with the times." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Weithofer, the Oxnard city engineer working with the California Department 
of Transportation on the highway expansion, said the state plans to begin the 
road improvement project in 1996 or 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 The existing interchange "was designed for a smaller community than what it is 
serving today," he said. "The city of Ventura, Oxnard and the entire county has 
changed since it was put in." JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; SMOKING PETITIONS HAVE SOME FUMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY SAILLANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Austin Oakwood's pitch for signatures on a Phillip Morris-sponsored smoking 
petition outside a Ventura grocery store Thursday was decidedly low-key: "Would 
you like to make it more difficult for minors to get cigarettes from vending 
machines?" he asked a visitor who inquired about the ballot petition. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakwood also said the proposed statewide ballot initiative asks voters to give 
the state authority over smoking, including banning smoking in some public 
places, instead of local government. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakwood was telling the truth: An explanation of what the smoking initiative 
would do includes those qualifications. But it's what he didn't say that has 
officials from the local chapter of the American Lung Assn. fuming. 
</P>
<P>
 They say they are receiving complaints that petition gatherers such as Oakwood 
are being deceptive by not telling voters that the petition drive is sponsored 
by tobacco giant Phillip Morris. 
</P>
<P>
 To draw attention to their ire, two spokeswomen from the American Lung Assn. 
notified several newspaper and radio reporters Thursday, and then confronted 
Oakwood face to face with their complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is that this initiative (would put) decisions about smoking into 
the hands of the state Legislature instead of local governments," said Barbara 
Weinberg, associate director of the Ventura County chapter of the American Lung 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "And it doesn't say Phillip Morris anywhere and that is what is deceptive to 
the voter." 
</P>
<P>
 Oakwood, looking slightly bemused about suddenly being surrounded by seven 
reporters and photographers, claimed ignorance of Phillip Morris' backing of 
the petition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, I'm just a volunteer," he said. "This petition has been immensely 
popular with smokers and nonsmokers alike." 
</P>
<P>
 Oakwood, 33, of Santa Paula, said he supports Phillip Morris' attempt to wrest 
control over where and how tobacco can be used from local politicians to the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 "All this petition does is get the initiative on the ballot," Oakwood said. 
"People can decide . . . whether they want to support it." 
</P>
<P>
 At times, the debate between Oakwood and Weinberg seemed almost moot. At least 
two-thirds of the people who stopped at Oakwood's small table were more 
interested in a petition that would make illegal immigrants ineligible for 
public services than in the proposed smoking initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Graf, 73, waded through the thicket of reporters surrounding Oakwood to 
find a petition relating to the illegal-immigrant issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care about smoking," he said. "But illegal immigration is affecting 
my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn Kretschmer, however, stood near Oakwood's table for at least 10 minutes 
to give her opinion on why smoking should be banned completely. 
</P>
<P>
 "This petition is really to promote smoking," she said. "We have a ban on 
smoking in certain public places in Ventura, and we don't need this." KAY

 A mile-long, 30-foot-wide strip of dirty foam mixed with oil that was hanging 
offshore from an Oxnard beach early Thursday was probably the refuse of a ship 
that illegally pumped its bilge too close to land, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The mixture was about a mile offshore from Silver Strand Beach, but 
authorities said the amount of oil it would bring ashore would be negligible.No 
cleanup was planned. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked like the output from the dirtiest load of laundry," said Dale 
Carnathan, program administrator for the county's Office of Emergency Services. 
"Every couple of yards for a mile, you get a little glob of oil about the size 
of a large marble." 
</P>
<P>
 The largest patch of oil at sea was a square foot, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carnathan said he determined that the substance was already too broken up and 
there was not enough of it to warrant a cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 "You reach the point of diminishing returns," he said. "By the time you could 
get anybody out there to do anything about it, most of it would be on the 
beach, and you get that much oil from a natural seep." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Coast Guard took samples of the mixture Thursday, along with samples 
from a nearby ship that was due to dock at Port Hueneme in the next day or two, 
said Petty Officer Roger Fuller. He said the samples would be compared, but he 
had no estimate on how long the tests would take. He said the sample would also 
be compared to oil that was spilled at McGrath Lake shortly before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Carnathan said illegal bilge pumping close to shore is still a common 
practice, but "at least it's not as common as it used to be." JOANNA M. MILLER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; D.A. CLEARS POLICE IN FATAL SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A district attorney's report released Thursday cleared police in Oxnard and 
Port Hueneme in the shooting death of Santos Anders Arias, calling his death a 
justifiable homicide that occurred in self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
 The report concludes that all seven officers confronting Arias, 23, of 
Camarillo outside a Port Hueneme gas station early Nov. 11 had reasonable cause 
to believe their lives were in danger because of his actions. 
</P>
<P>
 After initially complying with orders to lie down and relinquish his shotgun, 
Arias stood up, grabbed the shotgun, pumped it once and leveled it at officers, 
the report says. 
</P>
<P>
 Police responded with a fusillade of bullets, hitting Arias 21 times, five 
times in the head, an autopsy report says. Arias did not fire back, and police 
later discovered that his weapon was empty, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blaine Owens, a friend of Arias, told officers at the scene that the gun was 
empty, but they had no reason to believe him, the report says. Arias had 
earlier used the same weapon to fire two shots through the back door of the Top 
Deck, a Port Hueneme bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Arias got into a fight earlier the same evening at the Top Deck and returned 
after it closed, arguing with the bar's owner, the document says. He fired the 
shots through the closed door after the owner refused to open the bar, the 
report says. 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy reports shows Arias was drunk, with a blood-alcohol level of 0.29. 
A person with a blood-alcohol level of 0.08 in California is considered too 
intoxicated to drive. KAY SAILLANT

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; CONCERNS TOLD OVER HOMES IN GREENBELT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Developers who took advantage of a new early-look policy in Oxnard by floating 
plans for a massive subdivision before the City Council met with skepticism 
from officials this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Priske-Jones Development of Ventura wants to build 720 homes with Affordable 
Homebuilders of Oxnard on 120 acres at Channel Islands Boulevard and Rice 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20% of the homes would sell for less than $100,000 -- an 
affordable-housing incentive that developers hope will help win approval for 
the project when the application process is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 But the property is in the middle of a newly established greenbelt dedicated 
to preserving farmland and open space in and around Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a new "pre-review" policy, building applicants can describe development 
plans to City Council members before they ask for formal approval. 
</P>
<P>
 But while two council members said the proposal sounded interesting and 
deserved more discussion, another was adamantly opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Michael A. Plisky wasted little time in telling the builders that 
he could not approve the project because it was inside the greenbelt and would 
probably spur more leapfrog development. 
</P>
<P>
 The builders said Wednesday that they probably could not afford to build the 
project elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're concerned with that (open space) issue, living here and working here 
ourselves," developer Joe Priske said. "But if you really want to get a true 
affordable housing project, that's the only way to do it." JEFF McDONALD

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; APPEAL COURT VOIDS AWARD IN LIBEL CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A state appeal court Wednesday overturned a Ventura County judge's decision 
and threw out a jury award of $186,000 to a Moorpark College art teacher who 
said he was libeled after being accused of sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2nd District Court of Appeal in Ventura ruled unanimously that the jury in 
Kirk D. Aiken's lawsuit against colleague Pamela Zwehl-Burke had been given 
erroneous instructions on which to base its verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 Aiken sued Zwehl-Burke for defamation after she alleged that he pressed his 
body to hers in an art class in 1989 and whispered: "I'm so horny. I want you 
so much," according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury in August, 1992, ordered the woman to pay $1,000 in damages to Aiken 
and levied damages of $92,500 each against the college district and a district 
official. 
</P>
<P>
 But the appeal court ordered a new trial Thursday, saying former Ventura 
County Superior Court Judge Edwin M. Osborne erroneously instructed the jury 
that sexual harassment had to be severe enough to sue in order for it to be a 
defense against defamation. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense only needed to show that sexual harassment occurred, the court 
ruled. DWAYNE BRAY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; PARK DISTRICT WANTS TO PLANT 5,000 OAKS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District hopes to plant 5,000 oak trees 
this spring during its third consecutive volunteer planting program. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, instead of planting saplings raised in a nursery, the district 
wants to encourage residents of Simi Valley and Oak Park to simply gather and 
bury acorns. 
</P>
<P>
 Because squirrels and other animals are likely to smell the buried acorns and 
dig them up, the park district is purchasing 10,000 biodegradable tubes that 
push into the ground around the acorn. Participants will be asked to put two 
acorns in each tube. 
</P>
<P>
 The total budget for the program is $4,180, including shipping and freight for 
the tubes. Thousand Oaks-based Amgen recently pledged $1,000 toward the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are many mature oak trees in and around Simi Valley and Oak 
Park, park officials said the growth of new trees has been hampered by 
overgrazing, drought and development. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last two years, volunteers working with the park district have planted 
nearly 2,000 small oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Hamilton, volunteer coordinator for the park, said the district hopes 
to work with area middle schools in tracking the success of this year's 
plantings. MARY F. POLS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Next week will be the final chance for the curious to see the intricately 
detailed model of the White House that has drawn more than 75,000 visitors to 
the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The nearly exact replica of the three-story landmark measures 60 by 20 feet 
and stands 4 feet high. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a tremendously successful exhibit," said library spokeswoman 
Stefanie Salata. "But we don't plan to have it return in the immediate future." 
</P>
<P>
 After a brief stop in Anaheim, the model will be taken overseas for an 
extended show called "American Treasures" in Tokyo.  
</P>
<P>
 May 1 will be the last day for visitors to see the model at the Reagan 
library. The library is open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday to Saturday and from 
noon to 5 p.m. Sunday. For more information, call 522-8444. SCOTT HADLY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; VOLUNTEERS SOUGHT TO RE-CREATE TRAIL

 Volunteers are needed Saturday to help the Rancho Simi Recreation and Park 
District's Trail Blazer group cut, clip and dig as it re-creates a half-mile 
stretch of the old stage coach route from Los Angeles County into Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're encouraging anyone and everyone to come," said Sharon Hamilton, 
volunteer coordinator for the Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District."Hikers, 
mountain bikers, scouts, nature lovers, photographers and history buffs are all 
welcome." 
</P>
<P>
 Rain is forecast for the weekend, but the effort will not be called off unless 
precipitation is torrential, Hamilton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers will start the trail at Lilac Lane on the Ventura-Los Angeles 
County line and work their way down half a mile, almost into Corriganville 
Park, trying to follow the old stage coach route as closely as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to humbly admit that we're taking a higher road, since part of the 
route has already been paved," Hamilton said. "But basically we're following 
the route." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's effort, which corresponds with California Trail Days on Saturday 
and Sunday, is the first phase of a longer route that the park district hopes 
eventually will connect into trails in Corriganville Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The trail will be four feet wide. Workers are asked to bring water, food, 
gloves and tools, including rakes, picks, clippers and shovels. Sunscreen and 
hats are recommended. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers do not have to preregister. Work will begin at 7 a.m. at the trail 
head, located a quarter of a mile down Lilac Lane off Santa Susana Pass Road.  
</P>
<P>
 For more information, call Hamilton at 584-4400. MARY F. POLS

<P>
 Organizers of an event that would give disabled children exclusive access to 
the Conejo Valley Days carnival for one morning still need more than 200 
volunteers to sign up as attendants. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, called Special Kids Day, allows children with disabilities or 
special needs to visit the booths and sample the rides at the Thousand Oaks 
carnival site before the carnival opens to the public.The event will be held 
from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. April 29. The carnival opens to the public at 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The decade-old program has always matched the children with volunteers who 
accompany them throughout the day, according to Martha Desch, one of the 
coordinators. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 400 and 450 volunteers are needed for the event and, as of Wednesday, 
186 had signed on to help. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need enough volunteers -- aged 16 and up -- to allow one-on-one pairing 
with each child," event chairwoman Julie Inglis said. 
</P>
<P>
 People interested in volunteering to accompany a child should call Betty 
Norton at 492-2238 by April 28. MATTHEW MOSK

 Thousand Oaks City Council members are looking for residents older than 59 and 
younger than 20 to serve on two advisory committees: the Council on Aging and 
the Youth Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Both groups meet regularly to plan programs for their target constituents.From 
organizing dances to seeking funds for a subsidized taxi service, the 
committees undertake several projects a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Council on Aging members, who serve two-year terms, must be residents of 
Thousand Oaks and at least 60 years old. Applications for the five available 
seats are due May 5, but the deadline may be extended, City Clerk Nancy Dillon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Youth Commission has six vacancies, to be filled by students representing 
Thousand Oaks' three public high schools plus private schools and intermediate 
schools. The deadline for applications is May 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Applications are also available for six seats on the Conejo Substance Abuse 
Prevention Authority Advisory Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel works to educate residents about drug and alcohol abuse and to 
provide resources for people seeking help. The group reports to an independent 
board of directors, not to the Thousand Oaks City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 An early May deadline for substance abuse committee applications has been 
extended indefinitely, Dillon said. Members serve three-year terms. STEPHANIE

HOME SALES IN COUNTY UP 18.3% IN FIRST PERIOD; REAL ESTATE: OBSERVERS SAY IT IS 
THE LARGEST QUARTERLY BOOST SINCE THE LATE 1980S. BUT AVERAGE PRICE DROPS 1%. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Ventura County home sales for the first quarter of 1994 rose 18.3% compared 
with the same period last year, signaling an upturn in the local economy, a 
report released Thursday said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is definitely a good sign," said Nima Nattagh, a market analyst with TRW 
REDI, which publishes the report. "I think this is the largest quarterly 
increase we've seen since 1988 or 1989." 
</P>
<P>
 Since January, 1,907 houses have been sold in the county, 279 of them new. 
However, mirroring a trend across Southern California toward more modestly 
priced homes, the average sales price countywide dropped by about 1% to 
$225,845, compared to the first quarter of last year, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen a lot more smaller and cheaper homes being sold," Nattagh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Southern California counties posted higher sales increases than Ventura. 
Orange County showed the most improvement, up 37.9% from the same time last 
year. Of the six counties surveyed, only Los Angeles County registered a 
smaller increase than Ventura -- a still significant 14.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second March in a row, Oxnard posted the highest number of sales in 
Ventura County, with 161 houses sold last month compared to 114 in March, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Realtor Bob Krakover, owner of Pacific Shores Realty and vice president of the 
Oxnard Harbor Assn. of Realtors, said the city has some of the lowest prices in 
the county, a big draw for first-time buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost like somebody turned on the faucet full blast," Krakover said. "I 
haven't felt this good about the market since 1990." 
</P>
<P>
 The number of homes sold in Oxnard's beach and harbor areas showed a steep 
increase, from two in March last year to 54 last month, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got some of the finest beach communities in Southern California," 
Krakover said. "It's been virtually a secret, but people are finding out about 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura, March home sales showed a 50% increase over March, 1993. Realtor 
Gordon Campbell, with Coldwell Banker, said homes in the $205,000 to $240,000 
range are the quickest sellers and that owners are getting their asking prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I've noticed at our multi-listing meetings each Thursday is that we used 
to get a lot of price reductions," he said. "People would be knocking the 
prices down because they weren't selling. But lately I've noticed far fewer." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley showed a smaller increase from March, 1993, about 18%. But realtor 
Susie Hill, with Century 21 Hilltop, said her office has been crowded with 
buyers in the last month. She said she expects sales to rise based on the 
numbers of customers she is working with now. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're just continually going up. We thought everything would have come to a 
screeching halt after Jan. 17," Hill said, referring to the Northridge 
earthquake. "But that hasn't been the case at all." 
</P>
<P>
 However, analysts said the effect of the earthquake is showing up in Los 
Angeles County, particularly in the new homes market, where sales dropped 
14.5%, the only decrease registered in the report.

COURT CANDIDATE LOAN DIDN'T VIOLATE LAW, STATE PANEL SAYS

<P>
 A Ventura County candidate for Superior Court judge did nothing wrong when she 
accepted a $2,500 campaign loan from her son, state election officials said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Declaring that the June 7 judicial contest is not a special election -- and 
thus not subject to limits on campaign contributions -- the California Fair 
Political Practices Commission concluded that Assistant Dist. Atty.Colleen Toy 
White did not violate the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a special election," said Jeanette Turvill, a spokeswoman for the 
commission. "This is in fact the regularly scheduled primary for the judges' 
election." 
</P>
<P>
 White's opponent, defense attorney James M. Farley, raised the issue Wednesday 
when he accused White of exceeding the state's $1,000 limit on personal 
contributions. But that restriction applies only in certain circumstances and 
this is not one of them, the state commission decided. 
</P>
<P>
 White's supporters trumpeted the decision as an embarrassment for her foe in 
the county's only contested judgeship race. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Farley has always been a sloppy lawyer," said White's boss, Dist. Atty. 
Michael D. Bradbury. "This is just another example of that sloppiness. There is 
nothing anyone can do about that. The voters of this county can, however, make 
sure he does not become a sloppy judge." 
</P>
<P>
 "Bradbury's got a sloppy mouth," Farley retorted. "What is he doing running 
the campaign of and supporting a person for the bench in a county where he 
brings his cases before the bench?" 
</P>
<P>
 Farley still believes the race is a special election, since it is being held 
to fill the post vacated when Superior Court Judge Edwin M. Osborne retired 
from the bench.

PROSECUTOR CALLS BOY IN STABBING MALICIOUS KILLER; COURTS: DEPUTY DISTRICT 
ATTORNEY DENIES DEFENSE CONTENTION THAT VICTIM WAS A BULLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A deputy district attorney prosecuting a 14-year-old Simi Valley boy in the 
stabbing of a classmate on Thursday called the defendant a malicious killer who 
deserves to be convicted of murder and vehemently denied the victim was a 
bully. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. James D. Ellison took exception to the defense's contention 
that the victim, 14-year-old Chad Hubbard, regularly picked fights with 
defendant Phillip Hernandez while they attended Valley View Junior High School. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said the two boys had several altercations, but insisted that 
they were equally to blame for initiating the confrontations. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellison said the defense is trying to portray Hubbard "as a lurking bully, 
which he was not." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez is charged with fatally stabbing Hubbard on Feb. 1, after Hubbard 
punched him in the chest and challenged him to a fistfight at a school bus 
stop, according to court testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 A classmate of Hernandez also testified Thursday that the defendant had 
bragged about a willingness to kill. 
</P>
<P>
 Medra Burt, 14, testified that Hernandez once told her that he would have no 
trouble killing some boys who had threatened to beat him up. Hubbard was not 
one of the boys. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked him if he would really kill somebody," Burt said on the stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "And what did he say?" asked Ellison. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," she answered. 
</P>
<P>
 Burt was the third prosecution witness who testified that Hernandez had told 
them he could kill someone. The other two witnesses with the same testimony 
were also Valley View Junior High students. 
</P>
<P>
 An assistant principal at Hillside Junior High School, where Hernandez was 
enrolled at the start of the school year, and Hubbard's father also took the 
stand as the final prosecution witnesses Thursday. More than a dozen other 
witnesses, most of them students, have testified for the prosecution during the 
4-day-old trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Pam Carter, the assistant principal, testified that Hernandez was transferred 
to Valley View Junior High in October, but did not say why the change was made. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Hernandez attended an assembly during the first week of classes in 
which he and the school's other students were warned against bringing knives 
and other weapons to school. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution has contended that Hernandez knew better than to carry a knife 
at school. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Hubbard testified that his son was 5-foot-9 and 160 pounds. The father 
sobbed during his brief testimony as he held a picture of his son's baseball 
team that was taken before the boy's death. Several other observers in the 
courtroom -- including his wife, Jackie -- cried as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Donna L. Forry said Hernandez was the smaller of the 
two boys, but did not state her client's size. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Thursday, Superior Court Judge Allan Steele ruled that Hernandez did not 
plan the fatal stabbing and therefore cannot be convicted of first-degree 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
 But Steele also ruled that Hernandez knew the difference between right and 
wrong when he allegedly stabbed Hubbard. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Steele's ruling, the most serious conviction Hernandez faces is 
second-degree murder. Prosecutors said they are satisfied that the judge found 
that Hernandez knew what he was doing, otherwise the case against him would 
have been dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 They also said the ruling not to allow a conviction of first-degree murder is 
insignificant, saying Hernandez would still have to remain in custody until age 
25 if convicted of the lesser offense of second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez is expected to testify when the trial resumes Monday.

6 SUSPECTED GANG MEMBERS HELD IN THOUSAND OAKS SWEEP; CRIME: RAIDS AT 10 HOMES 
CAME AFTER STREET FIGHTS BY RIVAL GROUPS OUTSIDE A NEWBURY PARK HOUSE LAST 
WEEK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies swept through a Thousand Oaks neighborhood Thursday 
arresting six suspected gang members in the aftermath of a series of 
gang-related street fights. 
</P>
<P>
 The gang sweep was a part of a follow-up investigation of some fights that 
erupted between rival gangs in front of a Newbury Park house last week, 
authorities said. Two suspected gang members were arrested in connection with 
the fights, and four others were arrested on probation violations, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been having a problem with increasing gang activity," said Ventura 
County Sheriff's Cmdr. Kathy Kemp, who acts as the chief of police for Thousand 
Oaks. "Sooner or later one of these kids is going to get killed. We have to 
send a message that that level of conflict and resolution is not going to be 
tolerated in Thousand Oaks." 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 deputies, probation officers and police officers from Ventura and 
Oxnard police departments divided into teams and raided 10 homes at 7 a.m. as 
residents were getting out of bed. 
</P>
<P>
 No search warrants were necessary because all of the suspected gang members 
were on probation, said Sheriff's Sgt. Bruce Hansen. As a condition of their 
probation, they must agree to be searched at any time by probation officers or 
police officers, Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one resisted arrest, Hansen said, and the raids in the quiet residential 
neighborhoods took place simultaneously so that no suspected gang members could 
warn others. 
</P>
<P>
 Gang sweeps are part of a regional push by area police agencies that began in 
1992 to crack down on the growing strength of street gangs in Ventura County. 
Most of the sweeps have historically occurred in western Ventura County, where 
the gangs tend to be more numerous and violent, Kemp said. 
</P>
<P>
 But even white-collar communities like Thousand Oaks are not immune to gang 
activity, said Thousand Oaks Councilman Frank Schillo. He noted that the 
multi-agency task force has conducted several similar neighborhood sweeps since 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thousand Oaks does have a gang problem, and you have to make people see that 
this won't be tolerated," said Schillo, who has tagged along to witness a gang 
sweep in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo said he believes a rude morning awakening and unexpected arrests send 
a strong message to gang members. And he said Thousand Oaks residents strongly 
support gang sweeps because they want to see gang activity curtailed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people move here from the San Fernando Valley and they want to get 
away from crime," Schillo said. "When they hear about gang activity, it's the 
start of something they don't want to deal with again. There is no such thing 
as a slight bit of gang activity." 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's gang sweep followed several fights that broke out April 14 on Wendy 
Drive in Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The fights involved three different rival gangs, and occurred within 30 
minutes of each other, authorities said. The first quarrel started when a 
carload of suspected gang members drove past the Newbury Park house and saw 
some rival gang members loitering in front. 
</P>
<P>
 They exchanged words and shouted at each other before the carload of gang 
members drove away. Then another group of rival gang members happened to drive 
by and got out of their van to confront the gang members in front of the house, 
authorities said. After a brief scuffle, the rival gang members climbed back 
into their van and drove away. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the first group of rival gang members returned with a gun and fired 
at least one shot at the group in front of the house. No one was hurt by the 
gunfire, but some gang members suffered minor injuries during the scuffle, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 A few hours after the fight, deputies arrested Brady Willmon, 18, and a 
16-year-old, both of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Willmon was arraigned Thursday in Ventura County Superior Court on charges of 
conspiracy to commit assault stemming from the Newbury Park fight last week. 
</P>
<P>
 He had been free in lieu of the $5,000 bail, but was rearrested Wednesday and 
accused of bursting into into a teen-ager's home and beating him. No charges in 
that second case have been filed, but a judge set bail at $60,000 for both 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Willmon's attorney, Richard T. Ferko, denied his client has any gang 
affiliations, saying his client spurned the gang efforts to recruit him and had 
been targeted by them because of that. "Gang members like to go after big guys 
and get them to join their gang," Ferko said of Willmon, a former football 
player at Westlake High School.  
</P>
<P>
 The 16-year-old suspect is at Juvenile Hall awaiting a court hearing, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two other suspects in the gang fights who were picked up during Thursday 
morning's raids, were Tam Nguyen, 22, and Michael Jay, 18, both of Thousand 
Oaks. They were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit assault with a 
deadly weapon. Nguyen is also suspected of shooting at an inhabited dwelling. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay made bail at Ventura County Jail on Thursday afternoon and Nguyen was 
being held on $5,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Other suspected Thousand Oaks gang members arrested during the sweep for 
probation violations were: 
</P>
<P>
 Caesar Roldan, 18, on suspicion of felony battery and burglary; James Balch, 
21, on suspicion of possessing marijuana; David Hernandez, 24, on suspicion of 
possessing of a dangerous weapon, and one juvenile for violation of probation.

MOORPARK HOUSING PLAN REJECTED; DEVELOPMENT: CITY TURNS DOWN PROJECT CALLING 
FOR 87 HOUSES AFTER NEIGHBORS CRITICIZE THE RESIDENCES AS TOO SMALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A $20-million housing project was rejected by the Moorpark City Council early 
Thursday after neighboring homeowners complained that the houses planned for 
development were too small and would hurt their property values. 
</P>
<P>
 After a five-hour hearing during which dozens of people spoke, the council 
voted 3 to 2 to turn down the plan to build 87 single-family houses in the 
Campus Hills section of Moorpark. Councilmen John Wozniak, Pat Hunter and Scott 
Montgomery voted to reject the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The houses were planned for a section of the housing project left unfinished 
since 1992 when Griffin Homes, the original developer, went bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman and Broad, which submitted the proposal under consideration at the 
meeting, said its agreement with Griffin Homes' creditors to take over the 
project was contingent on getting city approval by midnight Thursday, said 
Kaufman and Broad President Mark Beisswanger. 
</P>
<P>
 "For all intents and purposes, the deal is dead," Beisswanger said in an 
interview immediately after the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Beisswanger said homeowners could not be persuaded that building larger houses 
in the development was economically unfeasible. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt we went as far as we could go," Beisswanger said. "We talked for 
what, four or five hours here with people? We wanted to build the project, but 
they weren't willing to compromise."  
</P>
<P>
 Beisswanger said the houses, which would range from 1,700 to 2,400 square 
feet, are on average just 14% smaller than the existing houses in the 
development. He argued that the residences would not diminish property values, 
and said the project would allow the development company to complete a 
long-awaited community recreation center and pool for Campus Hills homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 "By no means are these entry-level homes at $200,000 and up," he said. "If we 
could build bigger homes there and sell them we would, but it is not 
economically possible. I don't think you could find a builder anywhere that is 
going to build the size homes that these people want. It's not feasible." 
</P>
<P>
 In their speeches to the council, homeowners were adamant that the city not 
allow Kaufman to reduce the size of the houses from what was planned when 
Griffin was building the project.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm tired of the development being unfinished, but I'd rather it stayed that 
way than see these homes built," homeowner Tim Saivar said. "For most people, 
their home is their most precious possession. We want to protect that. When we 
bought our homes we trusted that the homes built up there would follow the 
original plan. Don't cave in to outsiders interested in short-term profits. 
Think of the people who live here who will lose if those homes are built." 
</P>
<P>
 Of more than 40 speakers who came before the City Council, only six spoke in 
favor of the Kaufman proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Several council members, including Scott Montgomery, offered compromises to 
the proposal. Montgomery suggested changes that would increase the overall size 
of a few houses but would still keep the limit under 2,400 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 But Montgomery quickly withdrew his motion after audience members shouted 
their disapproval. "I don't know what I can do," Montgomery told the audience. 
"I was hoping we could work out a compromise, but the people just don't want 
it. The chasm is too great." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council has agreed in the past to allow other builders to reduce the 
size of housing units in their developments to encourage sales during the 
economic downturn. On Thursday, Councilmen Paul Lawrason and Bernardo Perez 
said they would have supported Montgomery's compromise with Kaufman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a crystal ball so I couldn't say if property values would drop," 
Perez said in an interview after the vote. "I just know that they haven't when 
we've done this in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the council members agreed that the opportunity with Kaufman and Broad 
to develop the site would not be repeated soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't suspect anyone will want to build there for a number of years," Perez 
said. "But even saying that, I'm not shedding any tears for Kaufman and Broad 
or this deal. I'm proud of the way this worked out. It was a good process. 
People who were concerned came down and voiced their opinions -- strongly -- 
and they won. That's the way it works."

<P>
 Tom Pratte, who helped found the San Clemente-based Surfrider Foundation and 
became its first executive director, died April 6 after battling cancer, a 
family member said Thursday. He was 44. 
</P>
<P>
 Pratte's condition had been diagnosed as cancer last August, his mother, Betty 
Jean Pratte said. He died at home, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pratte followed the active life of surfer and environmentalist. He was 
Surfrider's director from 1985 to 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "His life was dedicated to coastal environmentalism," said Dr. Gordon LaBedz, 
a Seal Beach resident and former member of Surfrider's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Pratte joined a handful of surfers who established the Surfrider organization 
in 1984 as a vehicle to protect popular surfing areas from pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 The informal group incorporated Surfrider and set out to prevent dredging of a 
creek spilling into Malibu Surfrider Beach that would have ruined the famed 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Jake Grubb, Surfrider's executive director, said Pratte, who traveled in a 
beat-up van, was a well-known figure up and down the coast. 
</P>
<P>
 "Protection of the waves and beaches was his obsession," Grubb said. "He rode 
them, studied them, wrote about them, and fought fiercely for their survival 
two decades before most surfers even began to worry and wonder what was 
happening to our waves and coasts." 
</P>
<P>
 Malibu and Manhattan Beach were two of Pratte's favorite surfing beaches, said 
Pratte's mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just loved the ocean," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pratte graduated from Marina High School in Huntington Beach and Humboldt 
State University in 1982 with a bachelor's of science degree in natural 
resource planning in coastal environmental studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Pratte helped negotiate a settlement with Chevron Oil Co. in El Segundo that 
helped set a legal precedent, LaBedz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (state) Coastal Commission ordered Chevron to figure out how to give a 
popular beach break that they took away by building a jetty," LaBedz said. "It 
formally established a surf break as a coastal resource, and Tom worked on an 
artificial reef idea to help rebuild the lost surf zone." 
</P>
<P>
 A private memorial service will be held at the home of his parents Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the South Bay Surfing Assn. will sponsor a "paddle out" at 8:30 
a.m. Sunday from Redondo Beach and lay a wreath on the ocean in remembrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Pratte is survived by his parents, Eugene and Betty Jean Pratte of Huntington 
Beach; sisters, Kathy Andruss of Huntington Beach, Janis Heller of Lake Forest, 
Cheryl Pratte of Provo, Utah, and Susan Iveans, of Seattle, and a brother, Jim 
Pratte of Huntington Beach.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; HIGH PRICE FOR SCHOOL DISTRICT SCANDAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What happened in the Newport-Mesa Unified School District is now a part of 
Orange County history: In a remarkable and gut-wrenching saga of embezzlement, 
the district's chief financial officer, Stephen Wagner, diverted about $4 
million to his personal accounts between 1986 and 1992, and bought cars, real 
estate, gems, even mink-lined bathrobes. He is currently in prison and has been 
ordered to pay restitution. 
</P>
<P>
 The handwriting may have been on the wall in the district long before the 
scandal broke. There was no system of checks and balances to keep anyone person 
from having complete control of the books, and complaints about arrogance at 
the top went unaddressed. 
</P>
<P>
 The district, now under the leadership of Supt. Mac Bernd, who took over last 
summer, appears to have made a course correction. However, a newly released 
Orange County Grand Jury report on the scandal spells out in painful specifics 
what the handwriting on the wall actually said. The report offers a lesson in 
consequences for Newport-Mesa and other school districts so that they might 
take extra steps to avoid similar pitfalls in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 The report says the district has been forced to reduce the number of classroom 
aides by 50% and lay off 59 teachers and 150 other employees as a result of the 
embezzlement. Moreover, the district has been forced to increase its class size 
from 28.5 students per teacher to 31 students per teacher. The extent of some 
of the changes attributed to the embezzlement has been disputed by Bernd, but 
he acknowledges enough to make clear the significant disruption and costs that 
resulted. All this comes at a time of tight finances for school districts 
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem in retrospect seems simple enough. The report notes that an 
anonymous district employee contacted the grand jury about a check that had 
only one signature on it instead of the two required by district. It pointed 
the finger of blame at the right place -- a failure to exercise "more vigilance 
in the first place to prevent the theft of funds," as grand jury spokesman Jim 
Cooper put it. 
</P>
<P>
 The district since has placed an internal control system in all district 
accounts and expanded the scope of an outside auditor to include bookkeeping.  
</P>
<P>
 The hiring of Bernd promised a new era of openness and accountability. The 
district's first-ever Education Summit in November charted a fresh course for 
ensuring the quality of teachers and administrators and for strengthening the 
curriculum, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has learned some broad lessons already, and has begun to act on 
them. The new report is a cautionary tale; it shows the extent to which the 
devil can lie in the details.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES: REDESIGNING WELCOME MAT TO PROJECT AREA'S DEPTH, 
DIVERSITY TO WORLD; ECONOMY: INDUSTRY LEADERS WILL FORM GAME PLAN AT TOURISM 
SUMMIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

County Board of Supervisors.

 Ever since Walt Disney transformed some Anaheim orange groves into the 
Happiest Place on Earth, Orange County has happily profited from being one of 
the top tourist destinations in the United States, if not the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Orange County attracted 38 million visitors who pumped an estimated 
$4.8 billion into local coffers, helping to employ more than 125,000 people -- 
a tremendous economic payoff from an industry with few negative side effects. 
</P>
<P>
 It is no secret, however, that our tourism industry has struggled these past 
few years as a number of unanticipated forces -- economic, environmental and 
social -- have conspired to keep visitors away and revenues down. Additionally, 
we are facing new, unprecedented competition for the tourist dollar from nearby 
destinations that have dramatically stepped up their efforts to capture a 
larger share of this lucrative market. 
</P>
<P>
 While it is easy to identify the various reasons why tourism has faltered, it 
is much more challenging to identify ways to restore the strength and vigor 
that has made it a consistent growth industry. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to address this concern, County Supervisor William G. Steiner, 
Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly and I have proposed a tourism summit next Friday to 
bring together more than 30 key leaders in the industry. Our goal is to focus 
not only on ways to expand existing tourism ventures, but also to devise new 
strategies that will showcase and benefit all of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, Orange County's tourism industry has largely been shaped by the 
efforts of a handful of visitors and convention bureaus as well as various 
local chambers of commerce and city offices. Although these entities have been 
highly successful at marketing specific attractions, destinations and locations 
within Orange County, we need to take a broader marketing approach to include 
all that our unique community has to offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County is not only Disneyland and Knott's Berry Farm. It stretches from 
the La Habra Children's Museum to the Mission San Juan Capistrano, from the 
Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace in Yorba Linda to the Huntington Beach Pier, 
from our picturesque coastline to our idyllic mountains. It is home to 
world-class art and theater centers, luxurious hotels, fine restaurants and 
convenient shopping. 
</P>
<P>
 To fully project the depth and diversity of our attractions, we need to 
coordinate our marketing efforts on a countywide level to position Orange 
County as the complete tourist and convention destination; one that is sharply 
distinct from, yet complimentary to, our neighbors in Los Angeles and San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply put, we have plenty of reasons why visitors should stay longer and 
spend more dollars in Orange County; we just have to make sure the rest of the 
world knows about them. 
</P>
<P>
 This concept seems to have struck a chord. Since announcing plans for the 
summit, dozens of representatives in our local tourism community have called or 
written to pledge their support and commitment for a more regional, cohesive 
undertaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Specific ideas are already being offered. Among them: establishing a 
countywide tourism council, developing cross promotions among existing tourist 
attractions and creating a task force to help sell major conventions. These 
ideas, and more like them, should make for productive discussion when presented 
at the summit. 
</P>
<P>
 And where will this tourism summit eventually lead? Frankly, we're counting on 
the industry experts to point the way. For while we believe government can 
provide the framework for this new endeavor, it is the private sector that 
ultimately must show the desire and chart the course. 
</P>
<P>
 Tourism is referred to as a "clean industry" because it creates tremendous 
economic benefit with little harmful impact on quality of life. Now, we are 
poised to renew tourism's vitality with a coordinated, cooperative, and 
regional effort to ensure that all of Orange County reaps its substantial 
rewards.

ANDERSON PITCHES ANGELS TO THE TOP; BASEBALL: HE TURNS IN EIGHT SOLID INNINGS, 
AND TEAM IS ALONE IN FIRST PLACE AFTER 11-8 VICTORY OVER ORIOLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Brian Anderson was treated like an outcast last season. He was shunned by his 
teammates, ostracized by the veterans and belittled at almost every 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 His mistake was being a first-round draft pick who was called up to the big 
leagues only five weeks after signing with the Angels. The September call-up 
was stipulated in his contract, but the players resented his presence. 
</P>
<P>
 Funny how quickly sentiments can change. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, suddenly becoming everyone's best friend, continued his rescue 
mission Thursday night by carrying the Angels to an 11-8 victory over the 
Baltimore Orioles at Camden Yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The team that was supposed to collapse when starter Mark Langston underwent 
elbow surgery is being saved by a 21-year-old kid, leading them into first 
place in the American League West. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm making sure I'm hanging around him now so I can get my name in the 
paper," left fielder Bo Jackson said, calling him 'Super Rookie.' "He can do 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson indeed has provided the Angels much more than they ever imagined. He 
gave up only six hits and three runs in eight innings, raising his record to 
2-0 with a 2.42 earned-run average. More important, the Angels (8-8) have won 
all three games he has pitched. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reception from the guys is a whole lot different than a year ago," 
Anderson said. "They're talking to me this time. They actually said something 
to me the first day." 
</P>
<P>
 Said teammate Phil Leftwich: "It was tough on him last year, but he handled it 
pretty well. Guys got on him pretty good, not only because he was a rookie, but 
because he got called up so fast. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to remember, a lot of these guys spent a lot of years in the 
minors before they got to the big leagues. Brian was called right up. There 
were veterans that resented that." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, who received a congratulatory call from Frank Robinson, Oriole 
assistant general manager, two hours before the game and pitched in front of 
his parents who traveled from Ohio, never lost his composure. He didn't have 
his usual fastball, but he kept the Orioles off-balance the entire evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when he left after the eighth inning, he never was perturbed when Angel 
relievers Mike Butcher (four runs) and Scott Lewis (one run) made nervous 
wrecks out of the rest of his teammates. He casually walked out of the 
clubhouse to find his mother hugging Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, Mom," he said. "Glad to see you guys finally met." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, who telephoned Anderson's mother from the team bus after her son's 
first victory in Milwaukee, was instrumental in Anderson's latest feat. He hit 
a three-run homer in the fifth inning and drove in a season-high four runs. 
</P>
<P>
 First baseman Eduardo Perez, who produces his finest games on days his 
roommate pitches, hit two home runs and drove in four runs. Perez is hitting 
.364 with four homers and seven RBIs in Anderson's three starts; .196 with one 
homer and six RBIs when everyone else starts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope he pitches every day," Perez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, who was supposed to be spending this season at triple-A Vancouver 
until Langston underwent elbow surgery, already performs as if he has been in 
the big leagues for a decade. Catcher Greg Myers still can't believe his savvy, 
saying that he already reminds him of former teammate Jimmy Key. 
</P>
<P>
 The only giveaway to Anderson's limited experience is that he continues to 
wear No. 56, a uniform that customarily is furnished to guys who don't have a 
chance in spring training. While the Angels have asked Anderson if he wants to 
exchange the uniform for a lower number, he steadfastly has refused. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they gave it to me last year, I asked them, 'Hey, don't I get some 
shoulder pads and a helmet to go along with this number?' They didn't think it 
was so funny," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But, hey, it's grown on me now. I kind of like it. It's me."

DODGERS BOMB THE METS; BASEBALL: BALL PROMOTION BACKFIRES, BUT THAT'S ALL THAT 
GOES WRONG FOR L.A. IN 13-3 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 It was a nice idea, giving baseballs to the fans on "photo ball night" at 
Dodger Stadium, until the fans started throwing them back at the players.  
</P>
<P>
 In the midst of a Dodger rally in the fourth inning, after they had scored two 
runs to move ahead 2-1, baseballs, which had likenesses of Mike Piazza and Eric 
Karros, inexplicably started dropping onto the field. The first few landed in 
left field, then a few more landed in the infield, then a couple in right. 
</P>
<P>
 The players looked around, puzzled. Karros, who was at the plate, backed out 
of the box. Nothing in particular had happened to cause the stir, but the 
umpires weren't taking any chances -- they cleared the field. 
</P>
<P>
 When play resumed a few minutes later, the Dodgers picked up where they left 
off. Karros drove Dwight Gooden's first pitch into left field to score Henry 
Rodriguez, sending the Dodgers on their way to a 13-3 rout in front of 34,717. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Dodgers' third consecutive victory and moved them two games behind 
the San Francisco Giants in the National League West, the closest the team has 
been to first place in a week. Orel Hershiser (1-0), who had given up three 
runs or fewer in each of his previous three starts and had nothing to show for 
it, finally earned his first victory of the season. He held the Mets to one run 
and eight hits before leaving for a pinch-hitter in the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Raul Mondesi went three for five, including a three-run homer, and scored 
three runs. Karros had three hits, including a double, and scored two runs and 
Jose Offerman had a two-run triple. The Dodgers scored three runs in each of 
the fourth, sixth, seventh and eighth innings. Gooden (2-1) left in the sixth, 
after the Dodgers had scored three runs to move ahead, 7-1. 
</P>
<P>
 But the standout of the game was Delino DeShields, who had his best 
performance as a Dodger. Wearing his pants baggy and stirrups pulled up to his 
knees for the second consecutive game, DeShields figured into every Dodger 
rally. He went three for four, scored two runs, knocked in two runs and stole 
three bases. His three stolen bases tie a career high and give him seven this 
season. The last time he stole three bases was three years ago against 
Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shows how important it is for me to be out there," DeShields said. "I just 
haven't been getting the job done, and I have to carry this with me until 
tomorrow. I got out there tonight and the guys just followed." 
</P>
<P>
 DeShields, who wore the baggy look last season out of respect for the old 
Negro Leagues, stopped doing so in spring training because he said the high 
stirrups impaired his circulation and elicited too many questions. He decided 
he wanted to be known for what he did on the field, not what he wore. But 
DeShields has been in a slump both at the plate and, periodically, in the 
field. He has been troubled physically by a weakened thigh muscle and stressed 
about his poor start -- he was batting .176 before the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody has been telling me I'm going to come out this slump," DeShields 
said. "I was the only one who was worried. I think it's because I wanted to 
come over here and do such a good job and make such a good impression that I 
think I was trying too hard." 
</P>
<P>
 When the team was in Philadelphia, DeShields went to see family members, who 
said they were upset he had changed his uniform style and told him to wear it 
the way he did last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know it upset them so much," DeShields said. "I realize that this is 
important, this is something I started, and now it's part of me." 
</P>
<P>
 So, he changed back. And Thursday night, so did his game. With the Dodgers 
trailing, 1-0, in the fourth inning, DeShields singled deep to Jose Vizcaino in 
the hole at shortstop and easily beat the throw. With DeShields at first, Brett 
Butler walked. On the first pitch to Piazza, Butler and DeShields successfully 
pulled off a double steal. Piazza was caught looking a third strike, but 
cleanup hitter Tim Wallach grounded through the hole at short, and DeShields 
and Butler scored standing up to put the Dodgers ahead, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Rodriguez's line drive to center put Wallach at second, and with Karros 
batting, Wallach, one of the least likely candidates to steal, was caught 
stealing third. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when the baseballs began to fly.

 The Extreme Games, which will feature competition in at least 27 events and 
nine sports, will make their debut in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants in the made-for-television event will compete in bungee jumping, 
in-line skating, mountain biking, orienteering endurance, skateboarding, sky 
surfing, sport climbing, street luge racing, board sailing, kite skiing and 
barefoot ski jumping. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrote Ray Frager of the Baltimore Sun: "Medals will be awarded in gold, silver 
and plaster." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: What pitcher lost the most games in the major leagues last 
season? 
</P>
<P>
 The Expendable One? Wrote Kevin Paul Dupont of the Boston Globe: "Doesn't it 
make all the sense in Wayne's World for the Kings to trade Wayne Gretzky? For 
starters, they could dump his $8-million salary and still get a couple of good 
players and probably some draft picks. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, the Kings are dead in the water, proof that 1992-93 was a mirage. 
Dealing Gretzky could be their only way to keep fans happy in the long run." 
</P>
<P>
 Whole lotta love: In a complete-the-sentence interview with Sun magazine, Pete 
Sampras said the rock band he most wished he had been in was Led Zeppelin. 
</P>
<P>
 The world's No. 1 tennis player has left many more than one opponent trampled 
underfoot. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a start: Asked to assess the play of Olympic figure skater Nancy 
Kerrigan, who played a round of golf recently at White Cliffs Country Club in 
Plymouth, Mass., pro Mark Buell told the Boston Globe, "She hit it every time 
she swung at the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Head-turner: Said right fielder Jim Eisenreich of the Philadelphia Phillies 
after the Dodgers' Mike Piazza hit a three-run home run Monday night with an 
awkward, one-handed swing: "I couldn't believe he hit it that far with that 
swing. At first, I thought it would be foul, but it had a backspin and still 
went a good 10 feet past the fence. He's incredibly strong." 
</P>
<P>
 Bad boy wanna-be: Michael Moorer, who will fight Evander Holyfield for the 
heavyweight championship tonight, said he would have been good for the Detroit 
Pistons. 
</P>

 "I can knock guys out on the court as well as I can in the ring," he said.

 Trivia answer: Scott Erickson of the Minnesota Twins, who was 8-19.

 Quotebook: Dan Wilkinson, a defensive tackle who is expected to be among the 
top picks in Sunday's NFL draft after giving up his final two seasons of

 For the first time in 17 years, and only the third time in Chick Hearn's 34 
seasons as the voice of the Lakers, the team isn't going to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "A disappointing season?" Hearn said, repeating the question. "No, that's not 
strong enough. Totally disappointing is a better way of putting it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate to say I'm glad it's over, but . . . well, I'm glad it's over. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really thought they'd be a decent team, but then came a mixture of 
injuries, the young players not coming through and some tough losses." 
</P>
<P>
 Hearn is confident that owner Jerry Buss and General Manager Jerry West will 
right the ship. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have to," Hearn said. "The fans won't stand for anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 Hearn foresees a total rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only seven or eight of the 14 players now on the roster will be back," he 
said. "The immediate needs are a power forward and a team leader, a Charles 
Barkley type. Someone like a Dominique Wilkins, a Kevin Willis, a Horace Grant, 
a Danny Manning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Another immediate need, of course, is a coach. That's something that has to 
be taken care of right away. I think you'll see a coach from the college 
ranks."

 Regarding Magic Johnson's decision not to return as the Lakers' coach, Hearn 
said, "I never expected him to come back." 
</P>
<P>
 But, he said, he was still disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Magic learned he just didn't want to be tied down. Coaching is a 
14-15 hour-a-day job, and that's just not for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think, though, the youngsters learned a lot from him. He proved to be a 
great teacher." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 It hasn't been fun this season for Hearn, but he is proud that his 
consecutive-games streak is intact. 
</P>
<P>
 It will reach 2,692 by Sunday's finale. He hasn't missed a game since 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been some close calls over the years, and this season was no 
exception. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Lakers had returned from a four-game swing in early March, Hearn 
contracted pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
 He was in bed for two days, and on March 10, with a home game that night 
against Dallas, couldn't talk. 
</P>
<P>
 Around noon, he went to a Beverly Hills specialist, Joseph Sugarman, who told 
him he wouldn't be able to work that night. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearn, of course, didn't take the doctor's advice. He went to the Forum 
anyway, and thanks to the medication prescribed by Sugarman, was able to talk, 
or at least mumble. 
</P>
<P>
 The streak stayed alive -- barely. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the tough season, Hearn isn't thinking about retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 For a decade or so, Hearn answered questions about retirement by saying 
something like, "Maybe in three or four years," or "I'll retire when Magic 
retires." 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, Marge, who knows him best, has said, "Chick will never retire. What 
would he do, play golf? He doesn't play golf."

 The Laker finale Sunday will be unusual for a reason other than the club's not 
going on to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The home game against Utah won't be televised, making it the first Laker game 
not carried by Prime Ticket, Channel 9 or a network in two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Ticket passed because it is an afternoon game; NBC passed because the 
game isn't as significant as was expected.

 Between NBC and TNT, all but 10 NBA playoff games were televised nationally

TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's Evander Holyfield-Michael Moorer heavyweight title fight should be a 
good one, but the $35-$39 asking price is a bit steep. TVKO, for the first 
time, will use HBO's award-winning broadcast team of Jim Lampley, Larry 
Merchant and George Foreman. Boxing judge Harold Lederman will be on hand to 
score the fight, and CBS' James Brown has been hired as the host. The two-fight 
undercard begins at 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox has been on a roll and scored a coup Thursday by landing Jimmy Johnson as 
a studio host. But Pat Haden, one of the top NFL analysts in the business, will 
be staying with Turner Broadcasting. He has agreed to a new four-year deal. . . 
. Deion Sanders, a guest of Ann Liguori on her "Sports Innerview" show tonight 
at 9 on Prime Ticket, has this to say about baseball: "It's hard to market 
baseball players. You see them out there with chew in their mouth and spitting 
every minute. You can't market that to kids. I mean there are some things you 
just can't market, and grabbing their crotches (is one of them). Baseball is 
boring. You could fall asleep up there in the stands." 
</P>
<P>
 KMPC employees have been told that Capital Cities will take over the station 
on May 2. The station's new non-sports talk format will feature Peter Tilden 
and Tracey Miller in the mornings and Tom Leykis in the afternoons. Tilden and 
Miller currently have an afternoon show on KABC and Leykis was with KFI. (For a 
complete list of the new lineup, see today's Calendar section). . . . Joe 
McDonnell has been hired to be a part of the new morning show, filing reports 
and commentaries. He will also file reports after Dodger games when warranted. 
McDonnell will continue to use the vacation time he is owed by the old KMPC 
until May 2 but said he will return for one segment to say goodby to his 
afternoon listeners. . . . Bill Walton is scheduled to be on KMPC on Monday 
about 2 p.m. to discuss, among other things, his new CD, "Men Are Made in the 
Paint."

<P>
 With KMPC limping along, XTRA passed it in the Los Angeles winter rating book, 
which covers January through March. KMPC got an 0.7 share to an 0.5 in all 
people, 12-plus. In men 25-54, XTRA beat KMPC in Los Angeles, 0.6 to 1.5 in the 
midday slot, and 0.8 to 1.5 in the afternoon slot. In San Diego, XTRA, with 
significant increases for all shows, is now third in the market in men 25-54 
with a 5.4 share of the audience.

 ABC's "Monday Night Football" this week won an Emmy for best live sports 
series, and ratings released this week for the 1993-94 television season showed

for four consecutive years. Before 1990, it made the top 10 only once -- in 
1983. . . . ABC's Al Michaels did a nice job filling in for Charlie Gibson on

 The Dodgers and Montreal Expos are featured on ESPN's "Sunday Night Baseball" 
this weekend. Because of NFL draft coverage, the game will be on at 6 p.m. 
instead of the usual 5. . . . ESPN will use the "base cam" for the first time 
on a regular-season game. The base cam is a miniature camera embedded in second

 On the "UCLA Sports Magazine" show on Prime Ticket on Wednesday night, 
quarterback Wayne Cook was interviewed by Chris Marlowe. Edited out was a 
segment in which Marlowe, tongue in cheek, goads Cook by calling him "Wendy," a 
take-off on Jim Rome's calling Jim Everett "Chris." UCLA nixed it. "We didn't 
feel it was appropriate," said Marc Dellins, UCLA's sports information 
director. . . . TNT asked fans watching Tuesday night's Houston-San Antonio NBA

STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS; RANGERS TAKE OVER SERIES WITH 5-1 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rangers have turned "The Battle of New York" into a rout. 
</P>
<P>
 With another strong goaltending effort from Mike Richter, the Rangers defeated 
the New York Islanders, 5-1, on Thursday night at Uniondale, N.Y., and took a 
3-0 lead in their first-round playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is to eliminate your opponent as soon as possible," Ranger forward 
Glenn Anderson said. "Any good team has a killer instinct." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers, who won the first two games by identical 6-0 scores, can finish a 
sweep Sunday at the Nassau Coliseum. The Islanders won the season series from 
their rival, 2-1-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're playing very well defensively, with confidence and poise," Ranger Coach 
Mike Keenan said. "We've played some of our most intelligent games." 
</P>
<P>
 The Islanders have never been swept in a seven-game series. Only two teams in 
NHL history have come back from 3-0 deficits in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 2, Buffalo 1 -- Martin Brodeur stopped 29 shots and the Devils 
killed off five of six power plays at Buffalo to take a 2-1 lead over the 
Sabres in the Eastern Conference quarterfinal series. 
</P>
<P>
 For the third time in the best-of-seven series, the game turned on a defensive 
lapse. This time, it was Petr Svoboda's turnover 15:43 into the second period 
that gave the Devils a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-goal lead seemed insurmountable, considering that neither team could 
score three times in either of the first two games. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it's tight like that, that's the way it's going to be," Sabre Coach John 
Muckler said. "Whoever gets the break, whoever makes the mistake, (that's the 
way) it will go." 
</P>
<P>
 The teams had the NHL's two toughest goaltenders during the regular season and 
gave up only five goals in splitting the first two games. Buffalo won the 
opener 2-0, and the Devils won the second, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington 2, Pittsburgh 0 -- Don Beaupre stopped 27 shots and Joe Reekie had 
two goals as the Capitals handed the Penguins their first shutout in 95 playoff 
games to take a 2-1 lead in their first-round series at Landover, Md.

BASEBALL ROUNDUP; FROM EITHER SIDE, MURRAY'S A SMASH

 Eddie Murray hit home runs from both sides of the plate for a major league 
record 11th time and moved into 20th place on baseball's home run list 
Thursday, leading the Cleveland Indians past the Minnesota Twins at 
Minneapolis, 10-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray, 38, who signed with the Indians as a free agent in the off-season, hit 
a three-run homer batting left-handed in the first inning and added a two-run 
shot from the right side in the seventh, ending a 5-5 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's one of those records you don't think about a lot but you appreciate 
more when you retire and reflect back," Murray said. "I've been struggling this 
year, and it was only yesterday I found my batting stance again. I was 
uncomfortable up there of late." 
</P>
<P>
 Murray's first home run moved him past Dave Kingman on the homer list with 
444. His shot in the seventh moved him past Mickey Mantle's record for home 
runs from both sides in a game, 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Plunk (2-0) worked 3 2/3 innings of three-hit relief, striking out seven 
for the victory. Larry Casian (0-2) allowed Cleveland to score four runs in the 
seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 4, Seattle 2 -- Melido Perez pitched the Yankees' first complete game 
this season, a six-hitter, and Danny Tartabull hit a two-run homer at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez (2-0), who gave up only one hit over the first five innings, walked two 
and struck out two. It was Perez's first complete game since a loss to Toronto 
on Sept. 25, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the way I want to feel all season," Perez said. "I felt real strong 
in the last inning and that's why they sent me out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Tartabull hit his homer, his fourth, off Chris Bosio (0-3) in the fourth 
inning after Don Mattingly had walked. Bosio gave up four runs and 10 hits in 
eight innings. He walked five and struck out three. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 6, Oakland 5 -- Otis Nixon's run-scoring double in the ninth off Dennis 
Eckersley led the Red Sox at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinch-hitter Andre Dawson doubled off Eckersley (0-2) to tie the score, 5-5, 
with one out in the ninth. He drove in Scott Cooper, who had singled and 
continued to second when right fielder Ruben Sierra failed to field the ball 
cleanly. 
</P>
<P>
 With Scott Fletcher running for Dawson, Nixon doubled past first base. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Bankhead (2-0) pitched the final two innings for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Eckersley, who leads major league relievers with 256 saves in the previous six 
seasons, has failed in his three save opportunities this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 6, Chicago 4 -- Dave Nilsson homered and Turner Ward hit a two-run 
double at Milwaukee as the Brewers ended the White Sox's four-game winning 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Eldred (2-1) held Chicago to six hits for eight innings and Graeme Lloyd 
pitched the final two innings to gain his second save of the season. NATIONAL 
LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 6, San Francisco 1 -- Danny Jackson pitched a four-hitter, and 
Dave Hollins and Darren Daulton homered to lead the Phillies at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson (2-0), who had retired 22 of 24 batters before the ninth, struck out 
six and walked three. The complete game was the 39th and first since July 31, 
1993, against Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, 0-3 with a 9.60 earned-run average against the Giants last year, 
blanked them after yielding a first-inning run. The Phillies scored three runs 
in the third off Salomon Torres (0-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 5, San Diego 4 -- Rookie Cliff Floyd and Marquis Grissom hit 
consecutive home runs and Moises Alou drove in two runs at San Diego, as the 
Expos held on for their third consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Expo pitcher Ken Hill (3-1) gave up four runs and eight hits, including two 
homers, in 7 2/3 innings. He struck out eight and walked one. Wally Whitehurst 
(1-3), who allowed Floyd and Grissom to hit consecutive pitches for homers in 
the fifth inning, suffered the loss.

HANSEN STARTS LATE, THEN EXITS EARLY AT OJAI; TENNIS: USC PLAYER FROM NEWPORT 
HARBOR, JUST OFF A SUSPENSION FOR NCAA RULES VIOLATION, IS OUSTED IN FIRST 
ROUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ojai Valley tennis tournament began three hours late Thursday for USC's 
Brett Hansen, and ended about three days too early. Hansen waited through 
several long matches at Libbey Park for a court to open up, then went out and 
lost in 90 minutes to Stanford's Chris Cocotos, 6-3, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss, Hansen's first of the season after 19 dual-match victories, was 
almost predicted beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I play like I've been playing, I have a chance to win the (Pac-10 singles) 
tournament," he said. "But 19-0, I'm due to lose sometime." 
</P>
<P>
 But these days, Hansen, who played for Newport Harbor High, is simply thankful 
to be playing again. Two weeks ago, Hansen and three USC teammates received a 
two-match suspension by the NCAA for accepting too much prize money in 
professional tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the NCAA rule, players cannot receive more expense money than they would 
receive as prize money for a first-round loss. The USTA says amateur players 
can receive expense money for as many rounds as they remain in a professional 
tournament, as long as the money is documented. Hansen, who played on the pro 
tour for nine months, apparently accepted too much money. 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen said the rule is too confusing to understand. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one really knew the rule for sure," he said. "So every player and coach 
assumed that if it costs you a thousand bucks to get somewhere and you won a 
couple rounds, you could take a thousand dollars prize money. In all the time I 
traveled, I might have won some money. But overall, I know I was way down, 
thousands of dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen said he is not the kind of player the NCAA should be pursuing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anywhere I had to sign, I signed as an amateur," he said. "These European 
players have been playing the tour since they were 14, I only played for nine 
months and I came back." 
</P>
<P>
 USC Coach Dick Leach said if the NCAA begins stricter enforcement of its 
rules, fewer talented players will be able to attend college. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way it is now allows kids to see if they're good enough to move on," he 
said. "They might be more inclined to stay in school now, because when they go 
and play those tournaments, they realize they're not ready for that level." 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen is a perfect example. He left UC Irvine after two years to try the 
professional circuit and never made anything more than expense money. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got his butt kicked for a year and he realized that he's not good enough," 
Leach said. "And now, he's coming back to school with a great attitude and he 
realizes that he's got a lot to learn." 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen decided this summer that he wanted to learn from Leach, so he contacted 
UCI Coach Steve Clark and asked for a release from his scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was kind of stunned when he asked for the release," Clark said. "I really 
like Brett and I thought he was good player and nice kid. I was kinda hurt and 
I guess I took it personally. But I guess you can't blame somebody who wants to 
play for a team that won the NCAA the previous year." 
</P>
<P>
 With Hansen's help, the Trojans might repeat. They won the Pac-10 for a fourth 
consecutive time and lost only three matches all season, two of them being 
forfeits when Hansen and his teammates were suspended. 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen couldn't be happier with his decision to return to school. 
</P>
<P>
 "My confidence is up," he said. "I'm playing smarter. I'm not going for the 
low-percentage shots. Confidence has helped me know I can stay in the point and 
I don't have to go for a winner straight off." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Leach: "When Brett first came here, he was playing stupid," Leach said. 
"So I asked him what were his two strengths. He said his volleys, then he 
didn't have a second. So I told him it was his legs. I told him you're not 
using either of those, because you're trying to hit winners from the baseline. 
We got him to be more patient and use his assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Cocotos, Hansen never had much of chance to use his legs or his 
volleys. Cocotos smothered the net throughout and never gave Hansen room to 
breathe. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least Hansen is still breathing. 
</P>
<P>
 "What if he couldn't have come back to school?" Leach said. "Then he's just 
another fatality. He can't get his degree. He doesn't have any money and he's 
not good enough to play. But because of the rules the way they should be, he 
kept his amateurism and he can come back and finish."

CHATSWORTH GUNS DOWN GRANADA HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL LAZARUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jimmy Landress takes pride in his throwing arm. The Granada Hills High center 
fielder demonstrated his prowess by gunning down Chatsworth's Mike Amado in the 
sixth inning of a Northwest Valley Conference baseball game with a perfect 
strike to the plate.  
</P>
<P>
 But later, Landress was dealt some of his own medicine. Trying to score the 
winning run from second base on a single in the bottom of the ninth, he was 
thrown out at the plate on a nearly identical throw from Chancellor center 
fielder Brian Wittman. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth escaped the inning without allowing a run, then scored twice in the 
top of the 10th to beat the Highlanders, 8-6, Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second consecutive extra-inning game between the teams. Chatsworth 
won in eight innings, 3-2, on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth (17-3, 8-0 in league play) was in danger several times before 
Wittman's ninth-inning throw. The Chancellors held a one-run lead after six, 
but reliever Tony Montiel hit three batters in the seventh inning and loaded 
the bases with nobody out. Helped by a botched squeeze play, Montiel got out of 
the jam after surrendering the tying run. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's just the way he is," Chatsworth Coach Tony Meusborn said. "He comes 
out and does great, or he doesn't. We had a little of both and he came 
through." 
</P>
<P>
 Montiel (4-1) struck out four batters -- one reached first on a dropped third 
strike -- in his first inning of work in the sixth, and pitched well after the 
seventh. He retired the side in order in the bottom of the 10th. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chancellors scored their two runs in the final inning without a hit, 
taking advantage of two Highlander errors. 
</P>
<P>
 Amado, aboard on a fielder's choice, stole second. Pitcher Mark Mandell (2-1) 
fielded Wittman's grounder cleanly but in an attempt to nail Amado threw the 
ball over the head of third baseman Eddie Kinzler. 
</P>
<P>
 "After what happened last time (when Landress threw him out at the plate), I 
had to make sure, so I just slid even though the ball wasn't there," Amado 
said. "That's what we're taught to do." He then loped home with what proved to 
be the winning run.  
</P>
<P>
 Granada Hills (8-5, 4-4) scored three times in the first inning, taking 
advantage of control problems by starter Ray Daryabagi. Daryabagi lasted only 1 
2/3 innings before being replaced by Oscar Bocanegra. Bocanegra allowed three 
hits and one run over 3 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Granada Hills starter Josh Goldberg kept the Chancellors in check until the 
top of the sixth, when Chatsworth rallied from a 5-2 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinch-hitter Danny Phillips' ground-rule double into the bushes at the foot of 
the left-field fence led to a three-run rally that tied the game.

COLLEGE BASEBALL ROUNDUP; NASTER PITCHES NO-HITTER FOR MOORPARK, 8-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeff Naster pitched a no-hitter in Moorpark College's 8-0 victory over Oxnard 
in a Western State Conference game Thursday at Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 Naster, a sophomore right-hander from Thousand Oaks High, took a perfect game 
into the sixth inning before issuing one of his three walks. He struck out 
five. 
</P>
<P>
 The no-hitter was saved in the seventh by shortstop Ryan Briggs, who made a 
nice play on a ground ball behind second base. Briggs also had three hits and 
four runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 Naster (7-2) pitched for the 1992 Newbury Oaks American Legion team, pitching 
a shutout in the World Series final. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Nykoluk hit his fifth home run to highlight a six-run second inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Northern added two doubles for the Raiders (16-14-2, 9-7-1 in conference 
play). 
</P>
<P>
 Bakersfield 17, Glendale 7 -- The Vaqueros (10-18-1, 8-10-1) walked 19 batters 
and hit four, leading to 10 runs in a WSC game at Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Gillis led Bakersfield with three hits and two RBIs. Nate Baez, Rob Turner 
and Randy Vickers had two hits apiece for Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica 5, Pierce 2 -- Robert Brennan scattered seven hits as Santa 
Monica upset Pierce in a WSC game. Robert Cox of Santa Monica hit a two-run 
home run in the sixth inning to break open a scoreless game. After Pierce 
scored one run in the seventh, Santa Monica responded with three runs in the 
eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss dropped Pierce into a first place tie with Bakersfield with 12-7 
conference records. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley 13, Canyons 11 -- Will Skett was four for five with a home run, three 
RBIs and four runs, leading the Monarchs (12-16-1, 10-9) in a WSC game at 
Valencia. Skett has hit safely in 10 of 13 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 Ozzie Areu was three for three with three RBIs for Valley. Jorge Dorado's 
two-run single in the fifth inning capped Valley's comeback from an 8-2 
deficit. Kevin Szymanski picked up the victory and Juan Velazquez recorded his 
first save. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley 9, Mt. San Jacinto 3 -- Eric Cole was two for three with a run 
and an RBI, leading the Marauders (13-14, 7-11) in a Foothill Conference game 
at Hemet. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Cox homered and Will Wallace had two RBIs. Earlier, the Marauders played 
the final three innings of a 21-10 victory against Mt. San Jacinto. That game 
was suspended March 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Biola 5, The Master's 0 -- Brian Schmidt pitched a complete game for Biola in 
a NAIA District III game at La Mirada. Curtis Marsh broke open a scoreless game 
in the sixth inning with a run-scoring single.

PREP SOFTBALL ROUNDUP; LAGUNA HILLS' LEE PITCHES NO-HITTER BUT CAN'T BEAT 
TRABUCO HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Therese Lee had just pitched a no-hitter, but there was no celebration. There 
was no victory, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee did her part for Laguna Hills, but the Hawks had other troubles and 
Trabuco Hills scored a 1-0 Pacific Coast League victory Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills (8-9-1, 3-1 in league) had a runner in scoring position in five 
of the seven innings -- and had the bases loaded with one out in the fifth -- 
but couldn't score. Two errors in the second inning were all Trabuco Hills 
(7-9, 3-1) needed to stop the Hawks' 31-game league winning streak. Jennifer 
Griffiths reached on an error by shortstop Misty Thompson, advanced on Natalie 
Galasso's sacrifice bunt and scored on third baseman Jennifer Arzola's throwing 
error. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather win a no-hitter than get 10 hits and lose," Trabuco Hills Coach 
Noel Smith said. "We came in and played for one run, but realistically, I 
didn't think one run would be sufficient." 
</P>
<P>
 It was for Galasso, who hasn't allowed a run in 24 innings against league 
competition. She was backed by the Mustangs' best defensive performance of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Galasso (7-7) struck out only four but three came with runners in scoring 
position. The most important came in the fifth when a single, fielder's choice 
and walk loaded the bases with one out. Alycia Stevens -- who struck out only 
twice last season and none this season before Thursday -- struck out, and then 
Amber Journell lined to second baseman Ann Marie Froysaa. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really thought they were going to score," said Galasso, one of seven 
sophomore starters. "After we got out of the fifth, I knew we would win." 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills had a runner at third in the sixth inning, but Galasso got 
another strikeout and another liner to second; and had a runner at second base 
in the seventh but Stevens, batting .522 entering the game, grounded to second. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee (5-5) walked only two and struck out one. Laguna Hills committed three 
errors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a hollow feeling," Lee said of her no-hit performance. "You feel you 
gave it your best and it's not enough, and it should be." MARTIN HENDERSON

GOLF; SPRINGER FIRES NEAR-RECORD 64 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four weeks of steady improvement turned into one day of near-record golf for 
Mike Springer on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to regain some consistency after elbow and wrist problems hindered him 
in 1993, Springer shot an eight-under-par 64 for a one-stroke lead over Hale 
Irwin and the first-round lead in the Greater Greensboro Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Springer became the third golfer to shoot a first-day 64 at Forest Oaks 
Country Club, joining Tom Purtzer in 1980 and Jeff Sluman in 1988. He was two 
strokes short of the course record shot by Davis Love III in the final round 
two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been driving the ball pretty good, hitting irons in there pretty good. 
The putter hasn't been all that great," Springer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Jordan, a graduate of the Nike and T.C. Jordan tours, had seven birdies 
and one bogey on the way to a 66. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Janzen, Bill Glasson and Brad Faxon were among six golfers at 68. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning on the back nine, Springer three-putted from 50 feet for bogey. He 
got back to even par with a wedge shot to 10 feet on the 13th hole and a 
35-foot putt at 14. One more birdie came at 16 on a 20-footer. 
</P>
<P>
 Springer's assault on the course picked up on the back nine, where he had six 
birdies.  
</P>
<P>
 Springer has been seeing a chiropractor to relieve the pain that caused him to 
miss 16 cuts and also forced him out of all but five of the last 19 
tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 Irwin nearly overtook Springer on the last two holes. His 40-foot putt for 
birdie at 17 stopped five inches short. His chip from the fringe at the 18th 
green rolled to about three inches.

 W e're cashing in our tax returns and taking off to Europe for 10 glorious 
days and nine fun-filled nights, but the budget, we've found, won't allow for a 
big pre-trip clothes binge. But what the heck, we say, why not make a challenge 
out of it? Instead of stuffing a two-suiter with everything in the closet, why 
not pick up a few nifty essentials and take along only one piece of luggage 
each: a carry-on bag?  
</P>
<P>
 Can it be done? With style?  
</P>
<P>
 HE: Stop that screaming. Get a grip. You can do this. Think of it as an urban 
safari. Besides, the only people who are going to know that we're wearing a lot 
of the same stuff is us. By the time we start recycling, we'll be in a 
completely different locale. We do this right and everyone we run into will 
think we're Nick and Nora Charles. 
</P>
<P>
 OK. First of all, let's remember that our space isn't limited entirely to the 
bag. We also get to take the clothes on our backs when we get on the plane. To 
that end, I intend to wear a blue blazer over a sweater, along with a pair of 
dress shoes and maybe a hat or cap. All that stuff is bulky and doesn't pack 
very well into a small space. So that outfit will be my traveling ensemble. 
When we're on the move, I wear that. When we come to a halt in a hotel 
somewhere, I change. And if it gets too warm, I just take off the coat and 
drape it over an arm. Simple. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: Will they let me on the plane wearing five dresses, three blazers and as 
many pants? This is tough. For me, part of the fun of traveling is the chance 
to wear my favorite things -- the silk embroidered sweater I got on sale over 
the holidays, my old wool gab trench coat, my Garbo-esque felt hat, the 
three-piece walking suit with enough pockets for both of us, and my little 
black knit wool dress and matching coat. Not to mention my '70s slicker -- the 
fire-red number that makes me look like a candy apple in motion. 
</P>
<P>
 All right. All right. Look for me at the airport in black gabardine slacks, 
turtleneck sweater, blazer, trench-coat, scarf, medium-heel shoes and a hat. 
It's a start.  
</P>
<P>
 HE: Right, then. Onward to the bag proper. And quit that whimpering. This'll 
work.  
</P>
<P>
 First, essentials. That means underwear and socks. Three changes. Figure on 
doing a little en suite sink laundry about twice. We buy the soap when we need 
it. (I know, you think a nightgown is essential. But not this time.) 
</P>
<P>
 Next, minimal toiletries and cosmetics (Put down that knife.). For me, a 
toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, comb, deodorant, microscopic travel bottles of 
after-shave and shampoo and a tiny bottle of aspirin for all the headaches 
you're thinking of giving me. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: I have to take a robe and gown. Not to worry. They're polyester (look 
like silk) and, rolled up, take up about as much space as two fists. I love to 
wear this combo when I have breakfast or dinner in a room. 
</P>
<P>
 Next: tennies -- each stuffed with two pairs of socks. Underwear? A set of 
black (which I'll be wearing) and nude tone. I'll do my own laundry and bring 
along a vial of Woolite. Makeup? Lipstick, foundation, eyebrow pencil, mascara 
and powder will do it. Toiletries? Deodorant stick, dental floss, toothbrush. 
I'll borrow your razor, toothpaste and shampoo. I won't need any aspirin. 
Traveling gets rid of my headaches. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: You'll have a really big one if you try to borrow my razor. Besides, those 
are items that can be bought anywhere in disposable form and tossed before 
leaving for home. 
</P>
<P>
 You're right about the walking shoes, though. Essential, and easily packed. 
Also Levi's. One pair. From the waist up, for me, two polo shirts, one sport 
shirt, one dress shirt, one tie, one handkerchief. That combo, along with a 
good pair of slacks, will go anywhere from a picnic in the Bois du Boulogne to 
an evening at the Covent Garden Opera House. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: Keep your rusty old razor! And don't ask to borrow my dental floss. What 
the heck is it about men and razors anyway? 
</P>
<P>
 No Levi's for me. Too un-trendy. Too bulky. Too tight after only three days of 
dining. I'll tuck in one pair of loose black polyester trousers (they also look 
like silk) with a gathered waist and a scoop-neck shell with cap sleeves. 
Perfect for the opera -- or any evening restaurant scene. The rest of the time, 
I'll be in my slacks and turtleneck. If it's too warm, I'll wear slacks (the 
ones I wore on the plane) with a black or white T-shirt. Hey, I still have 
loads of room. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe I should bring my . . . You fill in the blank. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: Let's put this razor war to rest once and for all. Men go ballistic when 
women swipe their razors because when you rake that delicate little blade over 
two entire legs it tends to get about as dull as a butter knife. This makes for 
a nasty surprise when you start dragging it across your face first thing in the 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 And about that blank I'm supposed to fill in: Bring a compass. You're going to 
need it to find your way home in a rowboat when the airline gives you the boot 
for trying to stuff a steamer trunk into the overhead luggage rack. If you can 
get all the junk you mentioned into a single legal carry-on bag -- without 
using an auto wrecking press -- I'll get us an upgrade to first class. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: In that case, I'm wearing a formal.

 Urban Survival 
</P>
<P>
 The barrage of working-class uniforms adopted by hip urbanites continues with 
the return to soldier suiting. This time around, however, survivalists are 
taking a sexier strike at camouflage, like the mini skort (skirt and short, 
$52) and vest ($44) from New York-based Living Doll. "It's another take off 
menswear," says designer Amanda Uprichard. "But it's street inspired as well." 
In contrast to the ill-fitting Army surplus gear usually adopted, the current 
trend "is more accessible than ever for the junior market," she adds. Sock Hop 
</P>
<P>
 With every skirt length available this season, hosiery lengths have replaced 
hems as the trend to watch. As hems rise, so do socks, with three options to 
consider: anklets, knee socks and thigh highs. The second choice looks ideal 
with short skirts for a schoolgirl look, says Milagros Cucuta of Hot Sox. And 
"anything over the knee is a very hip, young look with minis," she says, 
instead of a full covered leg. "With the economy the way it is, people are 
buying leg wear to change the look of an outfit they already have." Dino Might 
</P>
<P>
 Sports sandal maker Teva has seen monumental success with its Terradactyl 
model (about $70). "It's the whole concept of a lighter-weight foot bed, with 
trail lug sole that gives a grip and bite on varied terrain," notes vice 
president Peter Link, who also sits on the design team. Among other new 
technology incorporated, the shoe features a polyurethane heel cushion that 
absorbs shock better than other materials. "The textured top sole feels good 
against the naked foot -- and it keeps the foot in place." Its texture reminded 
the team of dinosaur skin, hence the name, with a play on terra for the earth. 
Time to Reflect 
</P>
<P>
 Among the few pieces the fashion- and cost-conscious should include in their 
wardrobes this year is something -- anything -- metallic. L'wren Scott of Bisou 
Bisou recommends at least one item mixed with other items you already own for 
"a look that's very chic." The Los Angeles label offers a slew of items made of 
a special satin jersey fabric, she says, in silver, bronze and even a black 
metallic. Pieces are priced from $36 to $70. "One ingenious factor about this 
fabric is that it looks great for day or night." ROSE APODACA JONES

SCREEN STYLE / BETTY GOODWIN: RING AROUND THE COLLIERS

<BYLINE>

 The Movie: "Germinal." 
</P>
<P>
 The Setup: Emile Zola's tragic story of French coal miners -- particularly 
Maheu (Gerard Depardieu), wife Maheude (Miou-Miou) and their seven children -- 
circa 1880s. To qualify for the Oscars, the French film played a one-week 
engagement here in December. (Pictured is Jean-Roger Milo and Judith Henry). 
</P>
<P>
 The Costume Designers: Sylvie Gautrelet, Caroline de Vivaise and Bernadette 
Villard. 
</P>
<P>
 The Look: Frayed and filthy -- and terribly odd-looking -- uniforms and street 
clothes accentuate the miners' pitiful lives. The sumptuousness of the silks 
worn by the mine owners is a visible dagger. 
</P>
<P>
 Men and women wear identical white cotton uniforms consisting of shirts with 
Chinese collars and button-up, sailor-style pants. Their lamps hang from their 
waists on wide leather belts. Their "hard hats," made of boiled leather, 
feature wide brims that keep out dust and falling stones. Underneath, cotton 
caps capture perspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, the clothing of the mine owners seems blindingly bright. Women 
wear blue, pink and red silk dresses; men don black or steel-blue jackets and 
colorful silk cravats. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia: To achieve the proper grayish cast of coal dust, the fabric for 
hundreds of uniforms was stone-washed, then cut and sewn into garments before 
another washing with coal powder and more stones. Finally, they were put 
through a machine that mixes concrete, and made to look worn with cuts and 
patches. The process took more than three months. Even the baby's clothes do 
not look white in this world -- bonnet, jumper and blanket were dyed in tea. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "I was told that (director) Claude Berri would make this film seven 
years ago, and I thought, "What would be nice?" Black or grey, maybe with spots 
of color. Then I thought this story was already so sad, to put sad colors would 
be worse. It would be completely stupid," De Vivaise says, explaining why she 
chose softer earth colors for the miners' street clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspiration: Musee de la Mine in Wallers, France, as well as Musee d'Orsay in 
Paris for period paintings showing the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources: Most costumes were made at Angels and Bermans in London or rented 
from Cosprop in London.

YOUR WHEELS / RALPH VARTABEDIAN: OWNERS NOT IN ON SECRET WARRANTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California's new secret warranty act, intended to provide added protection for 
automobile owners, has been in effect since January, but the results so far 
have been less than impressive. 
</P>
<P>
 Few consumers understand the law -- and even the agency administering the law 
in Sacramento appears to be confused about exactly what legislators intended. 
</P>
<P>
 The law addresses the practice of auto makers who create secret warranties or 
goodwill adjustment programs to fix defects -- but extend them only to 
motorists who complain about those problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers who have their cars serviced at independent garages or whose dealers 
are poorly informed about the warranties are out of luck and typically pay full 
freight to have factory defects fixed. 
</P>
<P>
 California became the fourth state to enact a law requiring written disclosure 
of these secret warranties to automobile owners and to the state government. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the law, auto makers must also post notices in dealer showrooms 
disclosing to consumers how they can obtain service bulletins that contain 
information about defects, special repair procedures and extended secret 
warranties. 
</P>
<P>
 But consumer advocates contend that California's law lacks teeth. The law 
contains no penalties for auto makers or dealers who violate it and does not 
specifically allow consumers to sue companies that fail to disclose secret 
warranties. 
</P>
<P>
 Auto makers have long asserted that they do not have secret warranties, but 
rather have policies that give dealers flexibility in satisfying customer 
concerns.  
</P>
<P>
 "We feel there is no such thing as a secret warranty," Ford spokesman Bill 
Carroll said. "We call them adjustments." 
</P>
<P>
 Major dealer groups contacted declined to comment on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarence Ditlow, director of the Center for Auto Safety, said legislators 
watered down the law after manufacturers and dealers lobbied against 
enforcement provisions. Ditlow said laws in Wisconsin, Virginia and Connecticut 
are all tougher than California's. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new law, auto makers must file notices of secret warranties with the 
California New Motor Vehicle Board, a Sacramento agency with 12 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Audrey Bemoski, manager for administrative and consumer services at the board, 
said the Legislature never consulted the board prior to voting on the new law 
and provided no funding for the agency to administer the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Bemoski said that since Jan. 1, only Suzuki has filed a notice and that the 
board has not received any public inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
 The New Motor Vehicle Board also is operating under the assumption that the 
new California law applies only to safety and emissions defects. But a staffer 
for state Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), the act's author, said the 
law covers everything but safety and emissions defects, because those two areas 
are covered under existing federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenthal's staffer acknowledged that some key provisions in the new law were 
dropped after vigorous industry lobbying, including a requirement for dealers 
to provide consumers with copies of service bulletins.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, the law only requires dealers post notices that tell consumers they can 
obtain the bulletins from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The New Motor Vehicle Board can be reached at (916) 445-1888. The Center for 
Auto Safety can help motorists obtain some service bulletins by mail. Send a 
stamped self-addressed envelope to the center at 2001 S St. NW, Washington, 
D.C. 20009-1160.

BOOK REVIEW / NONFICTION; A LOOK AT THE WORLD UNDER THE BIG TOP; NIGHT AFTER 
NIGHT BY DIANA STARR COOPER ; ISLAND PRESS $18, 192 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD McCAIG, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

 The last time I went to a circus, I was 8 and I was thrilled. As an adult, if 
I thought about circuses at all, I assumed that they were places where people 
did uncomfortable things with animals; enterprises on the aesthetic scale 
somewhere between tawdry and schlock. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to Diana Starr Cooper, I've learned that the 8-year-old's beloved 
circus was more real than my adult notions. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper's "Night After Night" is an act-by-act account of a single performance 
of the Big Apple Circus. We meet the ringmaster, the performers and the 
animals. A traditional one-ring circus, the Big Apple Circus is international 
and egalitarian. It "has nothing to do with innocence or . . . make-believe, 
but with awareness, with the delight and the pain inherent in complete 
consciousness." 
</P>
<P>
 "Night After Night" is a hymn to the virtuosity of circus animals and 
performers, but it is also a theory of how the circus fits in the world, how it 
exists for its audience and its performers.  
</P>
<P>
 In the circus, "there are myriad ways of living and moving in a human body. It 
turns out that some of us can turn inside out. . . . It turns out that some of 
us can fly." 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper believes that the "Classical circus with its dedications and masteries 
stands gallantly, idiosyncratically opposed to any vision of life that divides 
creation -- its races, ages, nationalities and religions, its species -- into 
compartments where they are inaccessible to each other." This is heady 
theorizing, and it is a tribute to Cooper's skill that we come to share her 
views. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper's prose can be too lavish and sometimes a sentence goes on a phrase or 
two after it should have stopped. But as J.P. Sartre noted, the test of good 
prose is transparency and by this test, Cooper succeeds: We do see what she 
sees. 
</P>
<P>
 About elephants -- "I have seen toddlers absolutely terrified at the sight, so 
nearby, of an elephant. They know elephants are big. This turns out to be the 
first and most important thing to know about elephants, and it's interesting to 
discover how few adults realize this and how little they respect it." 
</P>
<P>
 About camels, which -- "give off an unmistakable air of only just barely doing 
what they do -- an air of willful disorder only temporarily, and not quite, 
arranged." 
</P>
<P>
 And horses -- "What some people find passionately interesting about horses, 
other people fear: Their combined size and sensitivity; the sense of a 
consciousness both heightened and remote; what the old books used to call their 
'excitability in motion.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Although Cooper does justice to the human acts -- clowns, aerialists, the 
contortionist who demonstrates that "deformity is a false, if terrifying, 
category" -- she agrees with Ringmaster Paul Binder that "circus is the art 
form most closely involved with the relationship between animals and people." 
</P>
<P>
 Given our deep confusions about animals, it is not surprising that we are 
confused about circus animals. Cooper tells of a child who wept when he saw the 
real, contented, circus elephants. He'd been told horror stories by his 
grandfather.  
</P>
<P>
 "I felt immensely sorry for this child who had been robbed of elephants," 
Cooper says. "It seems to me that the grandfather had corrupted his grandson -- 
had ruined (the child's) ability to read the . . . living creatures before him. 
The lies about suffering were more compelling." 
</P>
<P>
 We live in a time when a good many decent people seem to think that the most 
interesting thing about animals is their (real or imagined) suffering, when the 
distrust of the human animal is so great many believe other animals would be 
better off without us. "Night After Night" is a description of one place where 
human knowledge and animal virtuosity intersect. It is a brilliant, necessary 
book.

CHILDREN'S THEATER REVIEW; DESPITE ADULTS, GIRLS ARE GOOD 'LITTLE WOMEN'; 
GROWN-UP INTERFERENCE CAN'T DIMINISH THE YOUTHFUL CAST'S ENTHUSIASM FOR LOUISA 
MAY ALCOTT'S CLASSIC, BUT THE DRAWN-OUT MUSICAL DOES NEGLECT THE NEEDS OF A 
YOUNG AUDIENCE.

 Little women to play "Little Women." Why not? 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Children's Theatre answers the question with a cast of child 
and teen actors and a musical adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's novel of how 
the four March sisters grew up during and after the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
 We might amend that to read sprawling novel -- one edition runs 542 pages -- 
and it's reasonable to wonder if any adaptation, musical or not, can possibly 
offer a faithful version of such a saga. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, these particular little acting women on the auditorium stage of the 
Westminster Cultural Arts Center do just fine, thank you very much. Led by 
Cecily Gish's headstrong, tomboyish Jo, the quartet -- including Ellen Hole's 
Beth, Darcy Mack's Meg and Abbe Loomer's Amy -- admirably re-create a family 
world mixed with tenderness and squabbling. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the adults behind this musical (Larry Blake as director, 
book writer and lyricist, Randy Woltz as composer and musical director, Jo 
Lindsay as choreographer) appear to be in way over their heads. The kids are 
having a ball, but the grown-ups turn what's intended as a show for older 
children and (perhaps) very early teens into a dull, drawn-out test of staying 
in one's seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially during an overextended Act Two, the sound of restless kids in the 
Saturday matinee audience indicated that this show wasn't really connecting. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the family relationships were too complicated. Perhaps there just 
wasn't enough fun stuff. And who was that fussy stranger with the German accent 
who took over the show? 
</P>
<P>
 That's Professor Bhaer (John Blaylock, who's not bad with the accent), who 
wins the heart of Jo, now a famous novelist we can all read as Alcott's 
self-portrait. 
</P>
<P>
 But because adapter Blake cuts a major sequence in the novel -- describing how 
Jo makes it in New York City and meets Bhaer in the process -- he has to 
introduce him and the relationship awkwardly in a family reunion setting. 
</P>
<P>
 So it goes for this adaptation, which, except for the opening scenes, strains 
in the effort to squeeze as much material into as little time as possible and 
not make it run beyond kids' endurance. It does anyway, making it not quite 
fair to Alcott, or to the kids. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the kids on stage, it's another matter. Although Woltz's tunes are 
uniformly forgettable, they never force Gish (who handles most of the singing 
chores) and her mates to sing beyond their abilities. Gish, in fact, makes a 
few songs her own, such as the first-act closer, "It's What I Want," and the 
spiritual "I Am Here, Lord." 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, most of the performers bring real individual feeling to characters 
130 years removed from their time. It's fairly startling, for instance, to 
notice Andrea Hough's age in the program (14) after you've seen her blustery, 
larger-than-life way with the nagging character of Aunt March. Clearly, 
director Blake knows how to talk to little women. 
</P>
<P>
 Other business could be much more fun, such as Lindsey's haphazard 
choreography (though the kids nicely ham it up during a skating scene). And the 
whole thing could be more fun for the kids in the audience if they were allowed 
to sit in the front rows; right now, with reserved seating, the little ones 
have to crane their necks around the grown-ups blocking their view. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a play area just outside the theater, and even a place in the lobby 
where kids can send their friends in the cast backstage telegrams, but this 
children's theater should think a bit more about the children.

JAZZ REVIEW; CYMBAL OF THE PAST: HARRIS BACK AT STUDIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was as if nothing had changed. 
</P>
<P>
 There was drummer Chiz Harris, sitting at his traps in front of the Studio 
Cafe's window, rattling away behind a be-bop saxophone solo just as he had for 
some 14 years, smiling at his band mate's flurry of notes while dropping 
tom-tom bombs, snare accents and cymbal hits.  
</P>
<P>
 Harris' return to the Studio on Wednesday was a predictable homecoming as the 
drummer's quartet ran through a list of songs by giants -- Monk, Miles, Bird -- 
in a first set that made you wonder why the Studio ever let this guy get away. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1978 to 1992, Harris and company held down the Saturday-evening slot 
here, filling the surf-side dive with straight-ahead jazz. Harris was bumped in 
1992 in favor of more contemporary sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris has been busy since, touring with Jerry Lewis -- he just returned from 
five weeks on the road with the comedian -- and playing local dates in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Studio's usual Wednesday night leader, saxophonist Eric Marienthal, 
out on tour for a couple months, Harris was called on to fill one of the blank 
dates. 
</P>
<P>
 Good move. Harris, sitting behind a bass drum decorated with the famous 
caricature of Lewis, seemed right at home, and many of his old fans turned up 
to pay their respects. Not surprisingly, the band delivered, just as it had for 
14 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris brought back Isla Eckinger, the Swiss bassist who spends part of each 
year in his native country, wedged in with his upright behind pianist Joe 
Lettieri. Out front was well-traveled saxophonist Lou Ciotti, the only change 
in the lineup of yore, replacing Jay Migliori.  
</P>
<P>
 The group opened with Miles Davis' "Four," played at an up-tempo pace with 
long improvisation sections for the soloists. Ciotti took the first turn, 
playing several choruses in a heated, pushy manner. 
</P>
<P>
 The tenor player kept to the middle range of his instrument, scooting along in 
a way that allowed Harris to embellish his rhythms with snare pops, bass-drum 
outbursts and explosions on his cymbals. 
</P>
<P>
 Ciotti's hard drive gave way to Lettieri's smooth approach, as the keyboardist 
strung long lines of narrative together between brief sections of chordal play. 
</P>
<P>
 Lettieri and Ciotti provided interesting melodic contrasts: Both play with 
well-defined lyricism, but the saxophonist's attack had more of an edge while 
the keyboardist relied more on grace to get his point across. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris' solo contained the same, persistent drive that made his playing so 
rewarding when he was a regular here. His immediately identifiable style -- 
rumbling across the tom-toms before breaking out in rat-a-tat-tat snare phrases 
-- swung in a way that Gene Krupa might have admired. And his smooth method of 
sliding back into the rhythm as the band takes up the call was polished and 
full of flare. 
</P>
<P>
 The drummer's best playing came during "Yardbird Suite" as he traded measures 
with Ciotti. Little was repeated as Harris strung one outstanding break after 
another into a considered whole, opening with a stirring roll up and down the 
toms, then dancing between snare and toms, bursting with well-spaced hits 
directly on the beat, breaking it up with bass drum pounds, then fading away 
gradually on the snare. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Eckinger (he also plays trombone in other settings) was the evening's 
most impressive soloist, using the full range of his unamplified instrument to 
turn "Blue Monk" into a fleet, light-footed workout.  
</P>
<P>
 The Studio will bring Harris back on May 18.

O.C. HOME SALES UP 38%; GAIN IS BEST IN SOUTHLAND; REAL ESTATE: BUYERS 
EXPLOITING STILL-LOW INTEREST RATES AND HOUSING PRICES ACCOUNT FOR THE 
FIRST-QUARTER JUMP. 
</P>

<P>
 Orange County home sales shot up 38% during the first three months of 1994, 
according to figures released Thursday, as buyers rushed to take advantage of 
low interest rates and still-depressed housing prices. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the biggest three-month jump since 1988, and Orange County made the 
strongest showing in the Southern California region. 
</P>
<P>
 The gain was also a dramatic turnaround from the late 1980s and early 1990s, 
when home sales stalled, real estate values plunged and construction virtually 
halted in the battered Southern California market. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County is leading the housing market recovery because we're a job-rich 
economy with some of the best housing-affordability levels since the 
mid-1970s," said David Chapman, head of real estate research for Kenneth 
Leventhal & Co., an accounting firm in Newport Beach. "People are now stepping 
forward to make a major purchase decision." 
</P>
<P>
 A recent rise in interest rates, especially for fixed-rate mortgages, is also 
nudging potential buyers off the fence and into homes across the region, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's happening is people are saying, 'I don't want to lose my chance,' " 
said Robert Barnum, president of American Savings Bank, an Irvine mortgage 
lender. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 7,691 new and existing homes were sold in the county in the first 
quarter of this year, compared to 5,577 transactions for the first three months 
of 1993, according to TRW Redi Property Data, a real estate data company in 
Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 The average price of a Orange County home sold in the first three months of 
1994 was $238,846; that is 0.8% less than the average $240,663 price of homes 
sold in the first quarter of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's briskest quarterly sales were reported in new-home developments 
where houses were priced below $250,000, according to the Meyers Group, a real 
estate consulting firm in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our sales have been fantastic so far this year, better than we expected," 
said Valerie Goudie, a sales agent for Kaufman & Broad at California Parke, a 
104-home development where prices range from $190,000 to $224,000. "We're 
seeing a lot more traffic now that rates are going up, and buyers who have been 
looking for six months are thinking now is the time to buy." 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time since 1990, would-be buyers have been camping out overnight 
to be first in line when homes in new developments go on sale, according to the 
Meyers Group. 
</P>
<P>
 At Sunset Ridge, a 141-home development planned in San Clemente, all 11 home 
lots in Phase 1 sold in two hours on Jan. 15 after some buyers waited as long 
as six days in campers, said Rick Hernandez, a sales agent for the project. And 
in the third phase of the development, Hernandez said, one buyer camped out for 
12 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Across Southern California, sales for the first quarter jumped by more than 
23% compared to the same period last year, TRW reported. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hike in interest rates in the short term can create a boost in activity. 
While I don't think we're going to have a 40% activity level for the rest of 
the year, we're going to have a great year for purchasing homes in Orange 
County," Barnum of American Savings said. 
</P>
<P>
 The interest rate for fixed mortgages is about 8.8% now, he said, up from 
about 6.6% in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of that increase has come in the past two months. The cost of a 30-year 
fixed-rate mortgage has risen by 1.5 to 2 percentage points since February. 
Adjustable loan rates have increased slightly and now average 5.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 "It remains to be seen how a continued surge in these rates would impact home 
sales," said Nima Nattagh, market analyst for TRW. "But Orange County certainly 
outperformed the other Southern California counties during the first quarter." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County, still recovering from the effects of January's Northridge 
earthquake, reported a 14.1% increase in total home sales during the first 
quarter but a 14.5% decline in new-home transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, the top-selling detached housing community was Bel Air, a 
Bramalea California Inc. development in Mission Viejo. The project sold 42 
homes for the quarter, according to the Meyers Group. 
</P>
<P>
 Close behind were the Ridge at Belmont, a Standard Pacific development in 
Orange, which sold 41 homes; and Kaufman & Broad's California Parke in Foothill 
Ranch, also with 41 sales. Homes Sales Rebound 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County home sales for the first three months of 1994 outpaced those for 
the rest of Southern California. First-quarter sales and resales:

CRITICS SEE FLAWS IN O.C. WELFARE FRAUD FINDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TAMMERLIN DRUMMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last November, the Orange County district attorney's office made a startling 
announcement: A six-month study of a sample of 216 AFDC cases found that 
recipients had committed fraud in a whopping 62% of the cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The finding struck a nerve in a state already wary of welfare cheats. Since it 
was released, lawmakers from Los Angeles to Sacramento have pointed to Orange 
County's fraud rate repeatedly in pushing for expensive fraud detection 
programs, and Gov. Wilson cited the 62% figure in advancing his own plans for 
welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, there is growing criticism over just how valid the welfare study may 
be. 
</P>
<P>
 To date, prosecutors have filed criminal charges in only six of the cases in 
the study for alleged overpayments totaling $33,529 -- a fraction of the 
$168,000 spent by the California Department of Social Services to conduct the 
study. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics maintain that the tiny number of prosecutions only shows that 
investigators grossly exaggerated the fraud rate in the first place, failing to 
take into account that people sometimes make inadvertent mistakes when dealing 
with a complex bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "For them to throw that 62% number out the way they have is intellectually 
dishonest," insisted Casey McKeever, an attorney who specializes in welfare 
reform issues in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, more than a quarter of the 135 welfare recipients whom Orange County 
officials initially accused of welfare fraud back in November are already back 
on assistance today. 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide, officials in Sacramento estimate that the fraud rate for all AFDC 
cases is only about 4%. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with the district attorney and the Orange County Social Services 
Agency, which collaborated on the project, defend their handling of the study. 
</P>
<P>
 They blame the small numbers of actual prosecutions on the difficulty in 
obtaining the evidence needed to win convictions in welfare-fraud cases, 
combined with a backlog in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 But they assert that their "aggressive" probe was responsible for another 89 
welfare cheats in the study agreeing to voluntarily withdraw from the rolls 
rather than face criminal prosecution, thus saving $1.2 million in taxpayer 
dollars over the next 33 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Two examples cited by investigators who worked on the study show the wide 
range of alleged abuses. 
</P>
<P>
 In one case, investigators said, a woman failed to report her husband's 
earnings as a fruit picker for three months in 1992. At the time, she was 
receiving a $326-per-month AFDC grant for one of her two children, who is a 
U.S. citizen. The total overpayment: $652. 
</P>
<P>
 She was charged with a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 In another instance, a woman had reportedly withheld information that her 
husband was employed and living in the same house with her and their two 
children. As a result, she received $13,939 in AFDC and food stamps, 
investigators said. Prosecutors have filed felony fraud charges against the 
woman, who was not identified. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics have questioned whether state and county welfare officials 
deliberately targeted largely undocumented immigrants as a main sample in the 
study because they suspected they might find a higher incidence of fraud among 
that group. 
</P>
<P>
 The study focused on a subset within the total AFDC (Aid to Families with 
Dependent Children) caseload that is 68% Latino -- half of whom were either 
undocumented or in the process of obtaining amnesty. Latinos in general make up 
only 38% of all aid recipients. Meanwhile, despite the fact that the authors of 
the study cautioned others against using their findings to make generalizations 
about the overall AFDC population, their research has been widely cited by 
lawmakers statewide to help justify spending millions of dollars on anti-fraud 
detection projects, including fingerprinting of AFDC and General Relief 
recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 However, analysts say the so-called Child-Only Fraud Pilot Project has obvious 
statistical flaws, including the method that investigators used to calculate 
the 62% fraud rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators stated in the report that they had rooted out 135 cases of 
fraud. Based upon the original computer-generated sample of 500, the fraud rate 
would have been calculated at 27%. Instead, investigators threw out 233 cases 
for a variety of reasons, then figured the 62% rate based upon the number of 
cases that they actually probed -- 215. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates for the poor have been especially critical of the low number of 
prosecutions -- 2% of the original sample of 500. 
</P>
<P>
 They also rejected the conclusion that the 89 people who voluntarily asked to 
be taken off aid during the investigation must have been welfare cheats, as 
suggested in the study. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials determined that fraud was present if there were any "substantial 
changes to case eligibility because of the investigation." These changes might 
include a family's failure to supply the necessary information to 
investigators, a change in the makeup of the household, a grant reduction, an 
overpayment or the discontinuation of aid. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mark Greenberg, director for the Center For Law and Social Policy in 
Washington, says there are other reasons why a person would ask to have their 
case closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is also possible that it is a frightening and stressful experience for 
anyone to be investigated in this way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Field, chief of welfare fraud investigations for the district attorney, 
maintains that in all 135 cases, the people were in fact guilty of welfare 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can tell you that in every single one of the 135 cases, it was not human 
error but intent to defraud. If you didn't tell month after month that you were 
working under an assumed name, that's fraud. That's what we found," he said. 
"You can get the wrong idea about the aggressiveness of the D.A.'s office, but 
it's certainly not our fault that the evidentiary information is not there for 
us to proceed," Field said. "The most important point is where the real savings 
are. We've got them off (welfare) and they're not cheating. That's where the 
real savings is." 
</P>
<P>
 The study states that every dollar spent on fraud investigation results in 
$7.29 in taxpayer savings. 
</P>
<P>
 However, according to the Legislative Analyst's Office in Sacramento, a 
nonpartisan research group that serves state legislators, the study overstates 
the amount of future savings. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Lucia, who analyzed the study recently at the request of a legislator, 
whom he declined to identify, said investigators inflated the average length of 
time that recipients remain on aid and used higher, outdated average grant 
levels to determine savings. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the apparent inconsistencies, Lucia said, the Orange County study 
figured prominently in a legislative subcommittee's decision earlier this week 
to recommend that the Assembly approve $330,000 for similar fraud studies in 
Alameda and Fresno counties. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeever, directing attorney of the Western Center on Law and Poverty in 
Sacramento, has been a vocal critic of what he sees as the deliberate 
manipulation of the Child-Only Fraud Pilot Project. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeever said officials used the 62% fraud rate indiscriminately and 
irresponsibly. "But it serves the purpose of exaggerating the extent of the 
phenomenon to persuade the State Legislature to devote more money to anti-fraud 
activities." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Amy Allbright, a spokeswoman for Gov. Wilson, says the Administration 
has been careful to specify when citing the Orange County study that it deals 
with a very small subset of the welfare population. 
</P>
<P>
 "Critics tend to attack people who bring up welfare fraud as a potential 
problem in public assistance programs," she said. "But the public believes that 
they are being ripped off. Everybody knows somebody who is beating the system." 
</P>
<P>
 However, officials in Orange County say they, too, are uncomfortable with the 
fact that their research has been used elsewhere to draw erroneous conclusions 
about the whole AFDC caseload. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 62% figure was for this particular study for this particular segment of 
the population -- period," said Angelo Doti, county director of financial 
assistance. "It cannot be projected on to another caseload." 
</P>
<P>
 The study dealt only with those cases in which a child was living with a 
parent who was not eligible for aid -- either because the parent is 
undocumented or in the process of receiving amnesty, or has already been 
dropped from the program for not trying to find a job. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County plans to launch another $1-million study, this time examining 
fraud in the overall caseload. Doti said.  
</P>
<P>
 This time, he said, the county will hire an outside consultant to help in 
choosing the sample -- a move designed to avoid criticism encountered after the 
November study. Fraud Found 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators reported finding fraud in 135 of the 216 AFDC cases studied in 
December, 1992. Most of these voluntarily withdrew claim to benefits. Most of 
the reported fraud involved unreported income by those seeking benefits: 
</P>
<P>
 Fraud Case Status Withdrew voluntarily: 89 Criminal charges filed: 6 Under 
investigation: 17 Referred for re-investigation: 23 
</P>
<P>
 Fraud Indicated Unreported income: 77 Absent parent in home: 23 Household 
composition: 10 Not residents: 7 Failure to cooperate: 3 Child out of home: 3 
Other: 12 
</P>
<P>
 Sample Difference 
</P>
<P>
 The sample drawn for the study differs in ethnic composition from that of the 
entire AFDC caseload: 
</P>
<P>
 Study sample White: 15.4% Latino: 64.6% Asian: 11.2% Other: 8.8% 
</P>
<P>
 All cases White: 27.1% Latino: 38.1% Asian: 19.6% Other: 15.2%

NIXON IS IN COMA; PROGNOSIS BLEAK; ILLNESS: THE FORMER PRESIDENT'S DAUGHTERS 
ARE AT HIS SIDE AS PHYSICIANS FIGHT TO CONTROL THE BRAIN SWELLING THAT FOLLOWED 
THE MASSIVE STROKE HE SUFFERED ON MONDAY. 
</P>

<P>
 Richard Nixon's condition worsened dramatically Thursday and the 81-year-old 
former President fell into a deep coma, his physicians said. His daughters were 
at his bedside and his prognosis was bleak. 
</P>
<P>
 A massive stroke on Monday left Nixon paralyzed on the right side, unable to 
speak and partially blind. The stroke was followed by very serious brain 
swelling, which specialists fought to control in an intensive care unit of the 
New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 But medical experts said the usefulness of treatments, while often having 
short term benefits, was limited in a stroke the size Nixon suffered. Swelling, 
which can compress the brain stem where breathing and heart rhythm are 
controlled, often is a major cause of death in strokes. 
</P>
<P>
 "President Richard M. Nixon's condition has deteriorated and he is now in a 
deep coma. He is resting comfortably. His family is at his bedside," the 
hospital announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Stroke patients have made remarkable recoveries when expectations were 
minimal. But language such as that used in the hospital statement generally 
signals that the chances of such a recovery are rapidly diminishing -- a fact 
confirmed by doctors at the medical center. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon was rushed to New York Hospital on Monday after suffering the stroke 
just before dinner time at his home in Park Ridge, N.J. For a time, medical 
personnel were guardedly optimistic, but as brain swelling set in, his 
prognosis steadily worsened. It was understood Nixon did not wish heroic 
life-support measures taken. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors familiar with the case said the stroke probably resulted from chronic 
heart disease, which caused the heart to beat irregularly. 
</P>
<P>
 Often patients with heart rhythm disturbances are prone to blood clots which 
can form when one of the heart's chambers is unable to pump blood forcefully, 
these physicians said. Nixon for many years had atrial fibrillation, a heart 
rhythm problem, and in an effort to avert a stroke he took the anticoagulant 
Coumadin. 
</P>
<P>
 The presence of chronic heart disease both complicated and limited the options 
available to physicians once Nixon reached the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to treat the clot that formed in his heart and lodged in the 
brain's middle cerebral artery, his doctors prescribed injections of Heparin, a 
second anticoagulant. At one point, it appeared the strategy was working. Nixon 
was taken from the intensive care unit to a private room. But about two hours 
later, his condition worsened and a CT scan revealed brain swelling. 
</P>
<P>
 World leaders from President Clinton to Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin 
sent well wishes and prayed for his recovery. The former President's office 
near his home in New Jersey was flooded by hundreds of phone calls and at the 
Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace in Yorba Linda, Calif., hundreds of 
visitors expressed hope that he would regain his strength. 
</P>
<P>
 As they have all week, many stopped to sign a large "get well" book posted in 
the library's lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Holstein, 70, a resident of Laguna Hills' Leisure World community, brought 
friends Gloria and Melvin Ramer, who were visiting from Passaic, N.J. Holstein 
said they came not only because they were thinking of Nixon but because they 
have been longtime admirers of the 37th President. 
</P>
<P>
 "I voted for him for President three times," Holstein said, adding that the 
Watergate affair that forced Nixon from office was caused by subordinates who 
did not serve him well. "I totally believed he was honest and I still believe 
it," Holstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy Ayeh of Yorba Linda, a second-time visitor to the library, said part of 
her interest in the place is its history of Nixon and Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lived in Orange County all my life and I learn a lot about him and the 
area when I come here," said Ayeh, 42. "I don't agree with everything (Nixon) 
did, but since I've been here I've found out he did a lot of things on minority 
issues. I hope he gets well because I believe there is still a lot he can do." 
</P>
<P>
 Work crews at the library spent the day setting up a stage, sound system and 
temporary bleachers for a speech this morning by Barbara Bush, which is slated 
to go on as scheduled. Because of the speech, the library grounds will be 
closed until 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Library spokesman Kevin Cartwright said Bush had been expected to talk about 
former First Lady Pat Nixon, but due to the former President's failing health, 
"perhaps she might talk about Richard Nixon as well." Cartwright said a flood 
of phone calls have come in "from around the world . . . I've been trying to 
keep up with all the messages and I'm not doing very well." 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon's illness turned national attention to strokes, the nation's 
third-leading cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
 "All illnesses are terrible, but out of attention to this problem, the public 
must learn that stroke can be devastating, can sometimes be fatal," said Dr. 
Fred Plum, the chief neurologist treating Nixon. "But there is considerable 
promise stroke may be reducible if the patient gets to the hospital in time." 
</P>
<P>
 "Hospitals have to learn acute stroke takes a priority with acute chest pain," 
said Plum, the chief neurologist at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The neurologist urged people to become as familiar with the signs of a stroke 
as they are with the signs of a heart attack and to regard such symptoms as a 
suddenly weak side or arm or paralysis or accompanying language difficulties or 
confusion "in the same terms they look at severe chest pain." 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon, the only U.S. President to resign from office, had returned from Russia 
only six weeks ago. He was in good spirits and had spent part of Monday working 
on a Republican fund-raising speech. Nixon was on the front porch of his house 
when he suddenly became ill, press aides said. He dropped a glass and went into 
the kitchen where Heidi Retter, a maid and cook was preparing dinner. She 
helped him sit down. Local police and an ambulance were summoned. 
</P>
<P>
 Respecting Nixon's longtime preference to be treated by his personal 
internist, he was taken to the medical center alongside the East River in 
Manhattan. Physicians familiar with his illness said the time between his 
stroke and his arriving at the hospital did not make a difference in his 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Several relatively short-term measures were available in an effort to reduce 
swelling in the brain, including the administration of the diuretic Manitol, 
which removes fluid from the body. Physicians also may place a patient on a 
respirator causing faster breathing, which can change blood chemistry, 
resulting in a reduction of brain volume. But it was understood that Nixon in 
the past had expressed unwillingness to be placed on a respirator in the event 
he became severely ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Swelling commonly can progress from the start of a stroke to up to 96 hours 
afterward, when it usually starts to subside. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see a lot of people with strokes and a lot of brain swelling who recover 
perfectly well," said Dr. Denise Barbut, director of the stroke center at New

 Physicians monitoring Nixon's condition paid particular attention to his level 
of consciousness. When he was taken from his private room back to intensive 
care, doctors said the former President was drowsy, but could be roused. But as 
his condition worsened, the coma deepened and he could not respond to verbal 
commands or painful stimulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of Nixon's daughters, Julie Nixon Eisenhower and Tricia Nixon Cox, rushed 
to the hospital soon after the stroke and remained at his bedside on Thursday.

HOUSE EASILY APPROVES $28-BILLION CRIME BILL; CONGRESS: MEASURE WOULD ADD MORE 
POLICE, PRISONS. IT IS SENT FOR RECONCILIATION WITH SENATE'S VERSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a major step toward final passage of anti-crime legislation, the House on 
Thursday overwhelmingly approved the most expensive and far-reaching crime bill 
ever considered by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The $28-billion measure, which has President Clinton's blessing, is designed 
to put more police on the street, build more prisons, get tough on violent 
offenders, spend billions for crime-prevention programs and expand the federal 
death penalty to 66 new offenses, although it also would open the door to more 
appeals of death sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 Adopted on a 285-141 roll call, the measure will now be sent to a Senate-House 
conference committee, which must work out the differences between it and a 
crime bill approved in November by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Jack Brooks (D-Tex.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and floor 
manager of the bill, called the House action a major victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a breakthrough to achieve a balance between hard-nosed punishment and 
forward-looking prevention," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the future of specific provisions is uncertain -- and the funding is 
subject to additional appropriation votes -- the House action virtually 
guarantees that sweeping crime legislation will be approved by Congress this 
year. In large part, the outcome has been driven by a public outcry over crime 
and the perception -- accurate or not -- that it is rampant in the streets of 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Since last fall, Clinton has pledged to work for passage of a crime bill, and 
even though members of Congress differ sharply over crime-fighting philosophy, 
opponents of the bill -- mostly Republicans -- were loath to oppose it for fear 
of disappointing constituents in an election year. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and the Democrats are expected to reap large political benefits if the 
final bill is passed -- especially if it fulfills Clinton's pledge to put 
100,000 more police officers on the streets and includes multibillion-dollar 
crime-prevention programs. 
</P>
<P>
 That the Democrats would lead the charge on anti-crime legislation heavy on 
punishment marks a sizable political turnabout. Some months ago, they began a 
serious effort to adopt for themselves an issue that has long been considered 
the province of the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
 "Politically, I think Democrats have recaptured the crime issue," said Rep. 
Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), a major architect of the bill. "For years, 
Republicans attacked Democrats as soft and mushy-headed on crime. That won't 
work anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 But Republican leaders complained that the bill is too soft on career 
criminals and undercuts the death penalty by allowing defendants in capital 
cases to allege racial bias in the imposition of death sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, 65 GOP lawmakers joined with 219 Democrats and one independent to 
adopt the measure; 107 Republicans and 34 Democrats voted against it, among 
them five members of Orange County's delegation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This bill is no trophy for us to carry back to our police officers and our 
judges," said Rep. Ron Packard (R-Oceanside). "Law enforcement officials and 
the American public support measures that will actually put and keep violent 
criminals behind bars. These measures are conspicuously absent from this bill." 
</P>
<P>
 While opposing the measure as a whole, Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R -- Garden 
Grove) succeeded in helping win an amendment he has long endorsed -- the 
creation of a police corps that would provide college scholarships in return 
for a four-year commitment to serve with a police force. Dornan proposed the 
police corps concept in 1989 and has fought for such legislation in every 
Congress since. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would provide $100 million the first year to educate and train 20,000 
recruits. Similar to the military's Reserve Officer Training Corps, candidates 
would attend four years of college, then serve for four years as fully 
empowered police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Police Corps will successfully attack crime and increase public security 
by substantially augmenting the number of college-educated police officers on 
patrol across the country," Dornan said. 
</P>
<P>
 But even that victory was not sweet enough for Dornan to support what he 
called do-nothing legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police corps is preventive maintenance way down the stream," Dornan said 
after the vote. "We are trying to give the American people relief from violent 
street crime and carjackings . . . and this bill doesn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Also voting against the bill were Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), Rep. 
Jay C. Kim (R -- Diamond Bar) and Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach.) 
</P>
<P>
 Only Rep. Ed Royce (R-Fullerton) supported it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The House bill is flawed, but Republicans have won important amendments to 
step up the fight on crime. I voted for the House bill to keep the process 
alive," Royce said, vowing to safeguard certain provisions of the measure as it 
moves on to a House-Senate conference committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The President, who stayed out of the Senate's crime-bill debate, intervened in 
the House, endorsing a popular provision -- known as "three strikes and you're 
out" -- that would require life imprisonment without parole for repeat 
offenders who commit violent crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional leaders said the President would now take the offensive on 
behalf of an assault-weapons ban, which was approved by the Senate but excluded 
from the House measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaker Thomas S. Foley has promised that the House will consider the issue in 
a separate bill to be brought to the floor within the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 GOP leaders also were expected to oppose that measure, which would prohibit 
the possession, sale or future manufacture of assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate-House conference, scheduled to start early in May, is expected to 
be hard-fought but not particularly prolonged. Key lawmakers said they hoped to 
get a bill on the President's desk by the end of next month, before members of 
Congress leave on a Memorial Day recess. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee was expected to go along with the Senate provision that would 
provide for 100,000 more police officers at a cost of $9 billion. The House 
version called for only 50,000 officers at a cost of $5.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Major differences were anticipated, however, on whether to retain the 
Senate-passed assault-weapons ban and on how to allocate the remainder of the 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The House, for example, authorized a total of $13.5 billion for states to 
build and operate prisons, more than double the $6.5 billion voted by the 
Senate for prisons and alternatives such as "boot camps" for youthful 
offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 In another major difference, the House bill includes an unprecedented $8 
billion for a variety of crime-prevention programs, including $2 billion in 
grants to local governments in high-crime areas and $525 million for job 
training. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.), who will be one of the House conferees in the 
negotiating session with the Senate, said: "There must be a better balance than 
exists in the Senate crime bill between federal spending for incarceration and 
federal spending for prevention of crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Conyers also criticized some of the get-tough provisions in the measure, 
saying: "Bumper-sticker slogans like 'Three strikes, you're out' make great 
copy but will only overload an already overburdened criminal-justice system and 
further reduce a judge's discretion." 
</P>
<P>
 There will also be pressure to allocate funds for prison construction because 
of the repeated emphasis during the weeklong House debate on the need to keep 
violent criminals behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Klaas, father of slain 12-year-old Polly Klaas of Petaluma, for example, 
urged Congress to authorize the $13.5 billion included in the House bill for 
the construction and operation of prisons. This provision would earmark 25% of 
the money to states that increase the prison time served by repeated violent 
offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day one of these guys is away is a day he can't commit a crime against 
an innocent citizen," Klaas said at a press conference. "This is the one law 
that could have made a difference in my daughter's case." 
</P>
<P>
 It appeared likely, however, that the allocation for prisons would be closer 
to the lower Senate figure because of other demands on the available funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Schumer, chairman of the Judiciary subcommittee on crime, described the House 
bill as a "centrist" measure that responds to the public's demand to stop 
political squabbling and pass an effective crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to do things that work and not things that ring our bells or press 
our ideological buttons," he told reporters. "This is one of the few times that 
Washington listened to what's going on in the streets." 
</P>
<P>
 Only 34 Democrats -- mostly liberals, but some conservatives -- voted against 
the bill. Twenty-four of the 38 members of the Congressional Black Caucus voted 
for passage despite the traditional opposition of its members to expansion of 
the death penalty. That concern was counterbalanced by the provision allowing 
death-penalty appeals to be based on statistical evidence of racial bias in 
such sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 The 65 Republicans who broke with their leadership included moderate GOP 
lawmakers. In California, for example, eight of the 22-member Republican 
delegation voted for the bill, along with 27 of the 30 Democrats from the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome indicated that a final version of the bill emerging from the 
conference committee would be approved easily in both chambers. The Senate 
legislation passed by a 95-4 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The House also voted, 402 to 22, to remove weight-training equipment from 
federal prisons on grounds that it would prevent prisoners from increasing 
their fighting abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The House also voted to bar prisoners from receiving Pell grants for college 
education by a vote of 312 to 116. Rep. Bart Gordon (D-Tenn.) contended that 
the $36 million spent on 28,000 prisoners would be better spent on students not 
behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 On a related issue, the House decided, 347 to 82, to require federal prisoners 
who have not graduated from high school to earn a general equivalency diploma 
before becoming eligible for early release. Exceptions could be made, however, 
by the director of the Bureau of Prisons.

VACANT LOTS A STARK TRIBUTE TO 2ND ANNIVERSARY OF RIOTS; AFTERMATH: RECOVERY IS 
SLOWEST IN SOUTH-CENTRAL. BUT OFFICIALS SAY REBUILDING PROPERTIES IS ONLY A 
FIRST STEP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As the second anniversary of the Los Angeles riots nears, half the 607 
properties in the city that were severely damaged or burned to the ground 
remain empty, weed-strewn lots. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the violent upheaval cut a wide swath through the city, a Times 
analysis shows that rebuilding has progressed far more slowly in South-Central 
Los Angeles and Pico-Union than in other hard-hit areas.  
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere is the contrast more striking than along the city's most seriously 
damaged commercial thoroughfare, Vermont Avenue, as it wends its way through 
Koreatown, Pico-Union and South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 North of the Santa Monica Freeway on Vermont, 80% of the retail buildings and 
mini-malls that were seriously damaged or gutted by arsonists have been 
rebuilt. For many property owners along this stretch, the main problem has been 
finding renters for their rebuilt storefronts during harsh economic times. 
</P>
<P>
 South of the freeway, two-thirds of the Vermont properties that suffered 
serious damage or were destroyed remain forlorn, fenced-off lots. At one corner 
of the once-thriving intersection of Vermont and Manchester avenues, a single, 
new Payless Shoe Source store stands sentry over the ghosts of burned-out 
clothing shops, indoor swap meets and hamburger stands. 
</P>
<P>
 Community leaders concede that the pace of reconstruction has been painfully 
slow since the three days of riots that began April 29, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate; it's kind of scary," said Roberto Barragan, director of the 
Community Financial Resource Center in South-Central. "Watts never fully 
recovered after the 1965 riots. If something is not done, we'll be the Watts of 
the 1990s." 
</P>
<P>
 Landowners and economic analysts say rebuilding efforts have been hampered by 
financing and insurance woes, fear of crime and renewed civil strife, 
speculation by absentee landlords, the depressed economy and community groups' 
opposition to the return of liquor stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not satisfied with the progress," said recently appointed RLA President 
Linda Griego. "The longer these sites are vacant, the harder for these 
neighborhoods to be revitalized." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, significant rebuilding has occurred in some primarily black and 
Latino neighborhoods of South-Central and Southwest Los Angeles. Moreover, a 
handful of retail chains led by Chief Auto Parts and Smart & Final have 
returned to the inner city with more outlets than before. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, community leaders say that even if all vacant properties were 
rebuilt immediately, it would only be a first step toward providing adequate 
services in chronically impoverished neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was already a challenge before the upheaval, and it was compounded so 
significantly as to be overwhelming at a certain level," City Councilman Mark 
Ridley-Thomas said. "It can't be built like it was before. It has to be built 
back better." 
</P>
<P>
 In all, about 1,100 properties suffered more than $500 million in property 
damage during the civil unrest that followed the not-guilty verdicts returned 
in the case of four Los Angeles police officers in the first beating trial of 
Rodney G. King. Most of them were mini-malls and free-standing commercial 
buildings housing Korean American-run retail businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the nearly 500 structures that suffered less than 25% damage, most were 
back in operation within 18 months, according to data from the city's 
Department of Building and Safety. 
</P>
<P>
 However, city reports have not been up to date on the 607 properties -- many 
of which contained several businesses -- that were damaged at least 25% or 
destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 To determine the state of rebuilding efforts, a Times reporter surveyed each 
of these seriously damaged properties. 
</P>
<P>
 North of the Santa Monica Freeway, 63% of the properties that were seriously 
damaged or destroyed have been rebuilt or are under construction, compared to 
only 44% south of the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The computer-assisted study also shows that in Koreatown, 82% have been 
rebuilt or are under construction; in Pico-Union, 45%; in South-Central Los 
Angeles, 41%, and in Southwest Los Angeles, 52%. This analysis does not include 
riot-affected areas outside Los Angeles city limits, where far fewer buildings 
were severely damaged or destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although city officials have often pledged special consideration for riot 
victims, many of them say they have received more hassles than assistance from 
city code inspectors. Most businessmen, with the exception of major retail 
chain operators, said that they received absolutely no help from RLA, the 
private agency formed as Rebuild Los Angeles at the behest of former Mayor Tom 
Bradley and Gov. Pete Wilson to oversee revitalization efforts.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is an example of how it's not happening," said Bill McKee, executive 
vice president of Rexus Properties, the owner of the Taste and Style Plaza at 
Vermont Avenue and 1st Street. 
</P>
<P>
 McKee, whose efforts to rebuild were initially slowed by the bankruptcy of his 
insurance carrier, said that it was not until his two-story building was 
virtually completed that he was told he would need a separate city water meter 
for a new fire sprinkler system. 
</P>
<P>
 In mid-January, McKee wrote a $10,000 check to the city Department of Water 
and Power to pay for the installation. But he said the DWP wouldn't accept the 
check until he submitted lengthy documentation of the sort that he had already 
presented to city building officials before the project began. "The departments 
don't talk," McKee said. "It's like different countries." 
</P>
<P>
 Installation of the meter was delayed for additional weeks as the city 
Department of Transportation and the DWP prepared plans for diverting traffic 
around a construction trench. 
</P>
<P>
 Along Vermont Avenue through the heart of Koreatown, many other rebuilt 
storefronts remain without tenants because of the weak economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking for almost anything now," said Clifford Eng, whose rebuilt 
structure at 8th Street and Vermont lies vacant. His former tenant, a dry 
cleaner, moved on rather than waiting for the rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 Eng said he spent more than $300,000 from a federal Small Business 
Administration loan and his own finances on the project, only to see rental 
rates plunge to $1.50 a square foot from a previous high of $2.25. Even at the 
reduced price, he said, "they still won't bite."  
</P>
<P>
 As trash and graffiti collect at the door, the disillusioned 65-year-old Los 
Angeles native said he is watching his dreams of a leisurely retirement fly out 
the window. "The worst mistake I made is that I had many offers to sell the 
property as is, but I thought for my best advantage, I should have an income to 
take care of me until I die." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that there have not been some successes north of the Santa Monica Freeway. 
Pharmacist David Kasen quickly found five new tenants for the storefronts he 
rebuilt next to his Key Drug Co. at 8th and Vermont. "Every aspect with the 
city was like a 10-act play," he said. "But we were booked right away when the 
building was rebuilt." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, plans for a 25-story hotel, office and commercial center in the 
midst of the riot zone received City Council approval last month despite 
opposition from homeowners concerned about the center's massive bulk. 
</P>
<P>
 In South-Central Los Angeles, a $115-million, 587,000-square-foot project such 
as Koreatown's planned Pacific Trade Center would stick out like the Empire 
State Building. 
</P>
<P>
 In many South-Central neighborhoods, new strip malls are heralded as major 
improvements. Chain groceries are few and far between here, office space is 
negligible and hotels are nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
 Absentee landlordism, on the other hand, runs high. County property records of 
unrebuilt, riot-wrecked lots along Vermont Avenue read like a directory of 
middle-class and upper-crust Southern California locales -- the property owners 
living in Rancho Palos Verdes, Pacific Palisades, Agoura Hills, Fountain Valley 
and other communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Landlords with no ties to a neighborhood have fewer concerns about bringing it 
up to snuff, said Jesse Bowman, a South-Central resident who reconstructed his 
riot-ravaged Jesse's TV Sales and Service at 84th Place and Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people use their property as a tax write-off," Bowman said. "(Or) they 
have other properties so they figure, 'We'll hold tight on this area and see 
what happens.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Needleman, co-owner of several inner-city mini-malls, agrees that some 
absentee landlords make reconstruction difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too many people are in the real estate business that shouldn't be," said 
Needleman, a partner in family-run Denmarst Ltd. "You'd be amazed the different 
groups of names on chunks of land for 20 years or more . . . where it's always 
been in the family. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, there's just not enough commitment down there. And it's not 
easy finding insurance or banks that will lend money." 
</P>
<P>
 The Denmarst firm, in contrast, concentrates on inner-city properties, 
including a mini-mall on Martin Luther King Boulevard that suffered more than 
$3 million in riot damage and lost rent but was among the first rebuilt. The 
mall is surrounded by a high, black-painted metal fence as a buffer to the 
gangs and graffiti.  
</P>
<P>
 "Most of my tenants are now doing 10% to 20% better business than before the 
riots, in part because the competition was burned out," Needleman said. "You 
don't make the Taj Mahal but a secure and pleasant environment -- I paint over 
graffiti within 24 hours,"  
</P>
<P>
 Some business owners, such as Young Shim, say they are afraid to return to 
South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 Shim, a Korean American, operated the Right On Drive-In Hamburger stand at 
75th Street and Vermont, featuring Chinese food and all-American grilled beef 
patties, until it was torched by rioters. 
</P>
<P>
 His vacant lot is for sale, and he has moved the fast-food eatery, since 
renamed Young China, to East Los Angeles, where he now prepares Chinese food 
and hamburgers for Latino customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Business was better on Vermont, but I don't want fights no more, no 
arguments. So I quit the area," he said. "A lot of bad guys used to be over 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Other merchants, primarily Korean Americans, have hit roadblocks in the form 
of zoning strictures discouraging the return of small convenience stores with a 
high volume of liquor sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the riots destroyed 224 of the 723 liquor outlets in South-Central, 
only a handful have been allowed back. 
</P>
<P>
 One is the Trojan Market at 30th Street and Vermont, operated by Don Myung for 
four years before the riots. Myung said he would never have reopened if it were 
not for the firm support of his landlord, the Wolf family, a longtime 
landholder near USC. 
</P>
<P>
 At public hearings, Myung, armed with petitions of support from customers, 
faced strong opposition from community groups that complained of drinking and 
loitering outside the mini-market. To win approval, Myung agreed to hire a 
security officer and close by 10 nightly. He also offered to sell fresh meat 
and produce in a community starved for grocery stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Government restrictions are a key to improving long-neglected neighborhoods, 
said Karen Bass, executive director of the Community Coalition for Substance 
Abuse Prevention and Treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The environment that surrounded many of these liquor stores compromised 
public safety and quality of life," she said. "If we are going to rebuild, we 
shouldn't just rebuild but improve. If you have problems, why should you put 
them back?" 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, such provisions are a burden to grocery owners, Myung said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in this country for 20 years. When I was 20, I could work for 20 
hours a day. My feet never hurt. Now I'm over 40 and starting new. I'm burned 
out and I have to start all over again. My whole life, I'll be a victim." 
</P>
<P>
 Farther south on Vermont, the commercial district centered at Slauson Avenue 
is among the emerging success stories of post-riot rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 Most shops and grocery stores that were looted were quickly restocked and 
among the businesses that burned down, a Home Savings branch and a Kentucky 
Fried Chicken were swiftly rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the outer shell of a Taco Bell restaurant has emerged in recent 
months, a new J.J. Newberry discount store is due to rise this fall from the 
ashes of one that was torched and construction of a new Vons supermarket is 
scheduled to begin in early 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Marva Smith Battle-Bey, executive director of the Vermont Slauson Economic 
Development Corp., said major chains have a much easier time than small 
entrepreneurs winning bank financing for rebuilding or new construction. Now, 
in contrast to after the Watts riots, many larger businesses have decided to 
remain in the inner-city rather than flee. 
</P>
<P>
 "We already had generated a commercial hub here," Battle-Bey said. "Several 
major places were lost . . . but the larger kind of corporate entities came 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five blocks to the south, the Vermont-Manchester business district is 
probably the worst remaining riot eyesore. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, the slew of burnt-out lots has become the focus of a 
philosophical and political dispute between Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) 
and Ridley-Thomas, two of the city's top African American elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Waters envisions remaking the wide thoroughfare into a version of 
pedestrian-rich Old Town Pasadena or Santa Monica's Third Street Promenade, 
replete with coffee shops, bookstores, bakeries and theaters. She is also 
fighting efforts to build a 130-unit, mixed-use affordable housing complex six 
blocks to the north. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridley-Thomas, on the other hand, says there is ample room along the strip for 
a variety of investments. Current plans, he said, include $30 million in 
non-commercial structures consisting of the affordable housing project, a 
senior citizens housing complex, an alternative high school and a mini-City 
Hall that would include his district office to replace one set afire during the 
riots. 
</P>
<P>
 One impediment to building a major shopping center in the area is the fact the 
lots are owned by several landlords with competing financial interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Making matters more difficult, landlords such as Johnny Chu have gone forward 
with their own plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Chu began rebuilding his men's clothing shop. But he ran out of 
cash before he could finish. As the second anniversary of the riots looms, the 
half-built structure sits like a war-scarred bunker in a sea of empty lots.

 Half of the 607 Los Angeles properties severely damaged or destroyed in the

been rebuilt. The map shows properties that have not been rebuilt, and in some 
cases a single dot represents more than one building.

WAY CLEARED FOR HATA TO BECOME JAPAN PREMIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM JAMESON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Deputies of Japan's tattered eight-party coalition finally paved the way early 
today for Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata's election as prime minister by 
approving a 10-point platform, but not before they again reached the brink of a 
breakup. 
</P>
<P>
 Party leaders said they will meet this afternoon and give final approval to 
both the policy accord and the choice of Hata, 58, the mild-mannered leader who 
helped launch a rebellion ending 38 years of rule by the Liberal Democratic 
Party last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not officially decided when Parliament's lower house will elect him 
prime minister, but the balloting is expected to take place Monday, 17 days 
after Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa announced that he was resigning over 
accusations of personal corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 Hata was expected to head a shaky -- and possibly short-lived -- 
administration that could face its first crisis as early as June. 
</P>
<P>
 Coalition deputies completed the platform at 1:17 a.m. today after a series of 
six meetings punctuated by threats from the Socialist Party to leave the 
coalition and counter-threats to form a government without them. 
</P>
<P>
 Hata, who has kept silent on policy during all the machinations that followed 
Hosokawa's resignation announcement, remained optimistic throughout the day of 
tensions. 
</P>
<P>
 "A difficult birth requires pain," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, the agreement provides a Hata-led government with a policy 
consensus that Hosokawa's government lacked. It commits the new government to 
decreasing government regulation; dispersing the central government powers; 
opening Japan's markets to foreign trade; eliminating price differences in 
products sold in Japan and abroad; promoting economic demand at home to pull in 
imports, and reducing "in stages" Japan's trade surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
 But the agreement was achieved only by six of the coalition partners, and that 
immediately raised the likelihood that the Hata government might run into a 
wall even faster than the 8-month-old Hosokawa Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the eighth party in the coalition, Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Masayoshi Takemura's New Party Harbinger, boycotted the platform talks and said 
it would not be bound by the policies. The party had announced earlier that it 
would not accept any posts in the new Cabinet. It has affirmed, however, that 
it will vote for Hata and remain in the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 With the coalition's numbers in Parliament, refusal by either the Socialists 
or the New Party Harbinger to support a bill would block its passage in the 
lower house. 
</P>
<P>
 Minoru Morita, a noted political commentator, said the final coalition 
platform did not truly represent the Socialists' beliefs. He predicted that an 
explosion over two crucial issues -- taxes and North Korea -- could precipitate 
a crisis for Hata's government as early as June. 
</P>
<P>
 The 13 1/2-hour dispute, capping seven days of policy talks, focused on 10 
words in planks dealing with those two points. Both issues are of major concern 
to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The Socialists, the largest party in the coalition, offered a major concession 
by agreeing to support a future increase in indirect taxes. Ever since 1989, 
when Socialist opposition to enactment of a consumption tax sparked the party's 
best-ever showing in an election, the party has resisted any move to raise 
indirect taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ichiro Ozawa, the coalition's chief strategist and Hata's deputy in the 
Japan Renewal Party, balked at an attached demand that "the people's agreement" 
be sought in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 After an earlier agreement over how the new coalition would deal with "an 
emergency on the Korean Peninsula" that might arise from North Korea's refusal 
to accept international inspection of its nuclear facilities, the Socialists 
posed a new demand on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Like China, one of the North Korean regime's few allies, the Socialists had 
maintained close relations with North Korea throughout the Cold War. They now 
demanded that Japan act only "in solidarity with China" in the event of a 
crisis over North Korea. Ozawa rejected the demand, saying it would tie Japan's 
policy to decisions in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, Koken Nozaka, chairman of the Socialists' lower house steering 
committee, declared that his party would not negotiate these two issues. If 
Ozawa and others refused to accept them, he added, "we will quit the (policy) 
talks. . . . After that, the question will be whether we remain in the 
coalition or not." 
</P>
<P>
 Ozawa and Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of the Buddhist-backed Komei 
(Clean Government) Party, countered with threats to form a new Cabinet without 
the Socialists. 
</P>
<P>
 After trade union leaders rushed to Socialist headquarters to urge that the 
party remain in the coalition, its leaders backed down. 
</P>
<P>
 In a compromise, they accepted language about seeking "the people's 
understanding" -- rather than "agreement" -- about raising indirect taxes, and 
they dropped their demand for "solidarity with China" in dealing with North 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 A future increase in indirect taxes is considered essential to finance a 
three-year income tax cut beginning this year. A two-year extension of this 
year's income tax cut -- a major U.S. demand -- is expected to be a pillar of 
the government's plan to open markets, lessen its own control of the economy 
and stimulate private spending. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is expected to be how Japan proposes to keep its promise of a 
"substantial reduction" in its $141-billion global trade surplus and its $60 
billion worth of black ink in trade with the United States. Hata will inherit 
Hosokawa's promise to present the new package to President Clinton when they 
meet at a summit of advanced industrial democracies in Naples, Italy, in July. 
</P>
<P>
 On North Korea, the coalition agreed to "obey" any U.N. sanctions that might 
be imposed against North Korea. But the platform failed to spell out whether 
Japan is willing to revise its laws to permit its own troops to assist and 
provide supplies to U.S. military forces that might blockade North Korea.

REBEL SERBS THREATEN TO WIPE OUT GORAZDE; BOSNIA: 65,000 CITIZENS FACE 
ANNIHILATION UNLESS CITY SURRENDERS. U.N. CONVOY IS HALTED NORTH OF 'SAFE 
HAVEN.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rebel Serbs issued a surrender-or-die ultimatum to the leaders of Gorazde on 
Thursday, threatening to annihilate the 65,000 civilians trapped in the U.N. 
"safe haven" unless the Bosnian government capitulates. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities in Gorazde disregarded the 4 p.m. deadline for surrender. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. Protection Force troops had set off for the beleaguered Muslim pocket 
earlier in the day, but the peacekeepers were halted 18 miles north of the 
enclave by a blockade of Bosnian Serb women and children in what appeared to be 
another attempt at securing a human shield against air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 U.N. troops and aid workers were taken captive by Serbian rebels 
last week after token NATO air strikes failed to halt the deadly offensive 
against Gorazde but succeeded in angering the defiant Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the hostages have been released as the rebels maneuver to deter a 
seemingly serious threat of massive air strikes after a call by President 
Clinton for determined action to stop the Gorazde carnage. 
</P>
<P>
 And the U.N. Security Council early today demanded that the Serbian forces 
pull back from Gorazde and release any remaining hostages. 
</P>
<P>
 But even the more severe warnings from Washington and NATO headquarters in 
Brussels have had no measurable deterrent effect on the Serbs: U.N. spokesman 
Maj. Dacre Holloway said they launched a major infantry attack on the southern 
flanks of Gorazde close to nightfall. 
</P>
<P>
 The Serbs demanded in the morning that all government troops and civilians 
withdraw from the enclave to within a 1.8-mile radius of the city center and 
threatened to "roll over the civilian population" with every weapon in their 
arsenal unless the Muslim-led forces complied, a senior Sarajevo official 
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 The ultimatum was hammered home to the hungry and terrified population by a 
barrage of tank and artillery shells that killed at least 47 people and wounded 
143, according to foreign aid workers hunkered in basement shelters in the 
besieged city. 
</P>
<P>
 Two tank shells tore through a makeshift first aid station near the city 
hospital that was destroyed a day earlier by wire-guided missiles. Doctors with 
the international humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders said 20 patients 
died inside the clinic, which was crowded with wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 A doctor at the ravaged facility, Ferid Tutic, told reporters here in a ham 
radio broadcast that the overwhelmed hospital staff was able to evacuate only 
seven of the 35 people pinned inside the smoldering clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could still hear screams from within the burning building," the anguished 
doctor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Well over 400 civilians have been killed by the onslaught that the Serbs began 
in late March. They have pressed on despite token NATO air strikes and threats 
of escalated attacks. Showing no inclination to retreat when the U.N. mission 
here is powerless to stop them, the Serbs instead have intensified their 
offensive. 
</P>
<P>
 The commander of the Serbs' radical Herzegovina Corps used the blocked U.N. 
convoy as bait to lure the beleaguered homeless into submission, saying the 
foreign troops and the food and emergency medical care due to follow would be 
let through only if the defenders surrender. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic called the ultimatum outrageous and 
appealed to the international community to make good on its proposals to 
strengthen the U.N. defense of Gorazde before more civilians were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Serbs are trying to buy time. I hope the world will wake up and stop the 
public execution of so many thousands of innocent people," Silajdzic said.  
</P>
<P>
 The convoy of 100 Ukrainian, British and French troops, along with 41 
Scandinavian medics, planned to bivouac for the night along the side of the 
road at the rebel stronghold of Rogatica, Holloway said. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. official who negotiated the agreement by which Bosnian Serb political 
leaders had promised to permit the deployment to Gorazde said there was nothing 
the mission could do to force its way in. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's simply unacceptable that people sign things, then change their minds," 
lamented Viktor Andreyev, U.N. civilian affairs chief. 
</P>
<P>
 Andreyev indicated disapproval of the mounting Western pressure for punitive 
air strikes if the Serbs refuse to pull back but conceded that an escalation of 
foreign intervention is likely. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he believed that the U.N. mission was about to be drawn into a 
cataclysmic clash with the Serbs, he replied: "Yes. I hate it, but it looks 
like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb political leaders in the rebel headquarters at Pale, just east of 
Sarajevo, have sought to justify their assault on Gorazde by saying that it is 
in retaliation for attacks by the encircled government forces among the 
enclave's civilians and refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 Serb nationalist leader Radovan Karadzic has also said that government troops 
used the medical facilities in Gorazde as cover to wage attacks -- a contention 
dismissed as preposterous by U.N. military observers still in the pocket, 
Holloway said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a further sign of defiance, Karadzic issued a statement through Serbian 
media warning that he would not take part in any further peace talks unless the 
United Nations lifts economic sanctions imposed on neighboring Serbia, whose 
government supports the Serb rebels in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 The deputy chief of the Bosnian Serb army, hard-line Gen. Milan Gvero, also 
issued vague threats against U.N. peacekeepers, saying "the aggressor's 
personnel would not be safe" on Serb-held territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Serb leaders have characterized the U.N. mission as an enemy force since NATO 
warplanes bombed two rebel positions firing on Gorazde last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorazde is one of six U.N.-designated safe areas, which the U.N. commander for 
Bosnia has proposed be accorded better protection through the proclamation of 
weapons exclusion zones backed by the threat of NATO air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO officials are scheduled to consider the plan today. By pretending to 
approve the peacekeepers convoy, Serbs may have lured it deep within rebel 
territory and acquired a convenient pool of potential hostages in the event 
that NATO approves wider use of air power. 
</P>
<P>
 The Serbs have conquered about 72% of Bosnian territory and expelled most 
non-Serbs since rebelling against Bosnian independence in March, 1992. At least 
200,000 people, mostly Muslim civilians, are dead or missing from the conflict.

NIXON IN A DEEP COMA; PROGNOSIS IS SEEN AS BLEAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN J. GOLDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard Nixon's condition worsened dramatically Thursday and the 81-year-old 
former President fell into a deep coma, his physicians said. His daughters were 
at his bedside and his prognosis was bleak. 
</P>
<P>
 A massive stroke on Monday left Nixon paralyzed on the right side, unable to 
speak and partially blind. The stroke was followed by very serious brain 
swelling, which specialists fought to control in an intensive care unit of the 
New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 But medical experts said the usefulness of treatments, while often having 
short-term benefits, was limited in a stroke the size Nixon suffered. Swelling, 
which can compress the brain stem where breathing and heart rhythm are 
controlled, often is a major cause of death in strokes. 
</P>
<P>
 "President Richard M. Nixon's condition has deteriorated and he is now in a 
deep coma. He is resting comfortably. His family is at his bedside," the 
hospital announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Stroke patients have made remarkable recoveries when expecatations were 
minimal. But language such as that used in the hospital statement generally 
signals that the chances of such a recovery are rapidly diminishing -- a fact 
confirmed by doctors at the medical center. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon was rushed to New York Hospital on Monday after suffering the stroke 
just before dinner time at his home in Park Ridge, N.J. For a time, medical 
personnel were guardedly optimistic, but as brain swelling set in, his 
prognosis steadily worsened. It was understood Nixon did not wish heroic 
life-support measures taken. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors familiar with the case said the stroke probably resulted from chronic 
heart disease, which caused the heart to beat irregularly. 
</P>
<P>
 Often patients with heart rhythm disturbances are prone to blood clots which 
can form when one of the heart's chambers is unable to pump blood forcefully, 
these physicians said. Nixon for many years had atrial fibrillation, a heart 
rhythm problem, and in an effort to avert a stroke he took the anticoagulant 
Coumadin. 
</P>
<P>
 The presence of chronic heart disease both complicated and limited the options 
available to physicians once Nixon reached the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to treat the clot that formed in his heart and lodged in the 
brain's middle cerebral artery, his doctors prescribed injections of Heparin, a 
second anticoagulant. At one point, it appeared the strategy was working. Nixon 
was taken from the intensive care unit to a private room. But about two hours 
later, his condition worsened and a CT scan revealed brain swelling. 
</P>
<P>
 World leaders from President Clinton to Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin 
sent well wishes and prayed for his recovery. The former President's office 
near his home in New Jersey was flooded by hundreds of phone calls and at the 
Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Birthplace in Yorba Linda, Calif., 
hundreds of visitors expressed hope that he would regain his strength. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon's illness turned national attention to strokes, the nation's 
third-leading cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
 "All illnesses are terrible, but out of attention to this problem, the public 
must learn that stroke can be devastating, can sometimes be fatal," said Dr. 
Fred Plum, the chief neurologist treating Nixon. "But there is considerable 
promise stroke may be reducible if the patient gets to the hospital in time." 
</P>
<P>
 "Hospitals have to learn acute stroke takes a priority with acute chest pain," 
said Plum, the chief neurologist at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The neurologist urged people to become as familiar with the signs of a stroke 
as they are with the signs of a heart attack and to regard such symptoms as a 
suddenly weak side or arm or paralysis or accompanying language difficulties or 
confusion "in the same terms they look at severe chest pain." 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon, the 37th President of the United States and the only one to resign from 
office, had returned from Russia only six weeks ago. He was in good spirits and 
had spent part of Monday working on a Republican fund-raising speech. Nixon was 
on the front porch of his house when he suddenly became ill, press aides said. 
He dropped a glass and went into the kitchen where Heidi Retter, a maid and 
cook was preparing dinner. She helped him sit down. Local police and an 
ambulance were summoned. 
</P>
<P>
 Respecting Nixon's longtime preference to be treated by his personal 
internist, he was taken to the medical center alongside the East River in 
Manhattan. Physicians familiar with his illness said the time between his 
stroke and his arriving at the hospital did not make a difference in his 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Several relatively short-term measures were available in an effort to reduce 
swelling in the brain, including the administration of the diuretic Manitol, 
which removes fluid from the body. Physicians also may place a patient on a 
respirator causing faster breathing, which can change blood chemistry, 
resulting in a reduction of brain volume. But it was understood that Nixon in 
the past had expressed unwillingness to be placed on a respirator in the event 
he became severely ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Swelling commonly can progress from the start of a stroke to up to 96 hours 
afterward, when it usually starts to subside. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see a lot of people with strokes and a lot of brain swelling who recover 
perfectly well," said Dr. Denise Barbut, director of the stroke center at New 
York Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Physicians monitoring Nixon's condition paid particular attention to his level 
of consciousness. When he was taken from his private room back to intensive 
care, doctors said the former President was drowsy, but could be roused. But as 
his condition worsened, the coma deepened and he could not respond to verbal 
commands or painful stimulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of Nixon's daughters, Julie Nixon Eisenhower and Tricia Nixon Cox, rushed 
to the hospital soon after the stroke and remained at his bedside on Thursday.

COLUMN ONE; TIJUANA BATTLES FOR RESPECT; THE CITY FIGHTS TO SHATTER ITS IMAGE 
AS A LAWLESS TOURIST TRAP. RESIDENTS CELEBRATE A COSMOPOLITAN CULTURE, HISTORY 
AND A FRONTIER SPIRIT THEY CLAIM OUTSIDERS FAIL TO SEE.

<P>
 Young writers haunt the gritty cantinas of this border city's historic red 
light district, the Zona Norte , soaking up material, scribbling ideas on paper 
napkins. 
</P>
<P>
 Artists find refuge at the cheerfully eclectic Cultural Center of Tijuana, 
which offers Picasso exhibits, Tito Puente concerts, a classical orchestra of 
Russian expatriates and paintings inspired by both Baja California folk 
drawings and East Los Angeles murals. The globe-shaped edifice dominates the 
downtown landscape -- but eludes the attention of thousands of U.S. visitors, 
whose knowledge of Tijuana is limited to the garish tourist strip that embodies 
the border culture of old. 
</P>
<P>
 Stereotypes about Tijuana and other Mexican border cities endure on both 
sides. They are seen as tawdry, artificial outposts whose Mexican identity has 
been diluted by a longtime bombardment of U.S. culture: television, McDonald's 
and rock music. And economic integration accelerated by the North American Free 
Trade Agreement has intensified fears that these ills are spreading south. 
</P>
<P>
 Tijuana has been further battered by the assassination of presidential 
candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio last month. The ensuing worldwide headlines 
depicted once more the traditional sinister images of lawlessness and violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tijuana does not deserve this," said the city's youthful mayor, Hector Osuna 
Jaime, 36. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the city is trying to shatter such stereotypes. Most strikingly, a 
boom in the arts celebrates a culture that residents say is cosmopolitan, not 
crass -- one that blends Mexican frontier spirit with the most vibrant parts of 
life on both sides of the border.  
</P>
<P>
 Tijuananses also say their city has a secret identity that many outsiders do 
not see: While acknowledging problems with poverty and crime, they say Tijuana 
is a lively urban melting pot stoked by migration from throughout Mexico, the 
variety of regional cultures fusing with longtime Anglo and Chicano influences. 
</P>
<P>
 On the street, this is reflected in people's politics, language and everyday 
life, in the attitudes and accents of elegant chilangos (transplants from 
Mexico City), itinerant vendors from southern Mexico and the hip clientele at 
trendy hangouts with names such as Baby Rock and Yuppie's Sports Bar. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say this city is frivolous, a way station, a no-man's-land. Nonetheless, 
we are here," said Fernando Lopez Mateos, director of the Cultural Center's new 
professional theater school, one of the few programs of its kind in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 The quest to establish a distinct identity, both for themselves and for the 
outside world, shapes the work of artists and intellectuals who are exploring 
the new culture of a frontier of change. This emerging generation is impatient 
with the old arguments about whether Tijuana is sufficiently Mexican. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a question of which culture dominates the other," said magazine 
editor Leobardo Saravia Quiroz, 36, who recently compiled "In the Line of 
Fire," a book of border crime fiction. "Each of the cultures has its value and 
they influence one another. The fear that Mexican culture is being diluted at 
the border is a tired, Byzantine discourse of government officials that leads 
nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
 The cultural offerings of the border have gained increasing prominence after 
years in which the government in Mexico City regarded northern regionalism 
suspiciously. The federally run Tijuana center, for example, is preparing a 
major exhibit dedicated to the history of the city and the state of Baja 
California, according to Pedro Ochoa Palacio, until recently the center's 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 "The history of Tijuana had been hidden, limited," said Ochoa, an urbane, 
engaging man who left the post recently for a government job in Mexico City. 
"Poetically, we are seeking to unite the two cultures of Baja California and 
Mexico, the shared histories. . . . In the past, the driving objective was to 
reaffirm the national Mexican culture at the border. The regional culture was 
ignored." 
</P>
<P>
 The center tries to nurture local artists, partly in response to years in 
which the powers that be dictated a steady diet of mariachis, charros and other 
icons of the interior. In a basement workshop that resembles an industrial 
grotto, Alvaro Blancarte paints murals that are inspired in form and content by 
the mythology and rock drawings of the Cumiai, an Indian tribe native to Baja 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the hall, aspiring writers, actors and directors attend classes in a 
rigorous professional theater program that started last year, attracting an 
internationally known faculty in what was viewed as a coup for Tijuana. The 
students hope to build a theater scene that will ultimately rival that of 
Mexico City, the country's artistic mecca. 
</P>
<P>
 Actress Norma Bustamante, 24, wants to resist the lure of the capital when she 
graduates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tijuana is a place to create a new circle, new works and ideas," she said. 
"There is a lot to say right here. At the border, there are a thousand stories 
to tell." 
</P>
<P>
 Some border stories have won national recognition. In the play "The Journey of 
the Minstrels," award-winning Tijuana playwright Hugo Salcido dramatized a 
real-life incident in which 18 illegal immigrants died in a sealed boxcar in 
the West Texas desert. 
</P>
<P>
 The writings of Rosina Conde explore a nostalgic Tijuana from a feminist 
perspective; she describes the drunken U.S. Marines and down-and-out go-go 
dancers of 1960s-era Avenida Revolucion, the heart of the city's tourist strip, 
in poetic memoirs titled "Revolutionary Vignettes." 
</P>
<P>
 "The stereotype of the city does not necessarily bother us," said editor 
Saravia, who recently oversaw the translation of "The Golden Horseshoe," a 
hard-boiled detective story by Dashiell Hammett set in 1920s Tijuana. "In fact, 
we take it as a point of thematic departure." 
</P>
<P>
 The Americanized "sin city" image persists despite the dramatic changes of the 
1980s. The rise of maquiladoras -- as trans-border factories are known -- 
construction and other industries propelled dizzying economic and population 
growth. The city now boasts more than 1 million residents. About half of the 
illegal immigration to the United States occurs in the Tijuana area. 
</P>
<P>
 The newly arrived work force represented an unprecedented cross-section of 
Mexico. The migrants included not just rural laborers hoping to cross to the 
north one day, but also business people and professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 A current-day tourist in Tijuana probably perceives the U.S. influence more 
readily than the Mexican mix. The latter manifests itself in everything from 
the variety of restaurants -- seafood from Vera Cruz, the Chinese cuisine of 
Baja's early Asian settlers -- to the popularity of the raffish cowboy music of 
Sinaloa, a prime "sending state" for migration. Although they are often 
immigrants, exasperated "natives" also blame Sinaloans for drug-related crime 
and Mexico City expatriates for undesirable customs such as parking cars on the 
sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has become a regionalist laboratory," said Saravia. "The dynamic is 
distinct from the rural migration of the past. In the 1980s, the composition of 
the migrants takes on a middle-class aspect." 
</P>
<P>
 Diversity and prosperity have fomented a hunger for arts and entertainment 
beyond nightclubs, which had mainly cultivated a music scene, said entrepreneur 
Humberto Araiza. Two years ago, he opened Frida's Chapel, a 
cafe-gallery-bookstore named for artist Frida Kahlo, to promote books by local 
authors and about regional issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a city that for 50 years was all stores and bars," Araiza said. "But 
then you have more of a middle class, more people going to the university. And 
people begin to ask, what about culture? People in Los Angeles and Mexico City 
are used to cafes, for example. Here it is something new." 
</P>
<P>
 The historically uneasy relationship between border cities and the Mexican 
capital is symbolized by the Tijuana cultural center. Although the monumental, 
12-year-old center attracts more than 1 million visitors a year, many Tijuanans 
initially stayed away, perceiving it to be an ostentatious imposition by 
imperious federal rulers. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it was built as part of a concerted federal campaign along the length 
of the border to promote traditional customs and arts, defend the correct use 
of Spanish and otherwise steep young people in nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted to teach us how to be Mexican," said a sardonic Willivaldo 
Delgadillo, a journalist in Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
 The government's motive: deep-rooted fears of cultural, and ultimately 
political, colonization. After the United States wrested California and other 
territories from Mexico, the international boundary was established in 1848. 
The remote border towns remained economically dependent on their northern 
neighbors' vices and appetites, providing gambling, prostitution, night life 
and liquor during Prohibition. 
</P>
<P>
 Tijuana's isolation from the rest of Mexico was particularly pronounced. In 
the early 20th Century, forbidding mountains and deserts prevented Mexican 
travelers from reaching Baja California by land except through the United 
States. U.S. dollars were the dominant currency until the 1970s. Fronterizos 
worked, shopped, studied and even gave birth north of the border. Like today, 
they sprinkled their Spanish with terms such as bye instead of hasta la vista , 
and hybrid concoctions such as yonke (junk) and raite (ride.) 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition politics also have prospered in the independent-minded, urban 
north. The strength of the pro-U.S. National Action Party (PAN) in Baja 
California, Chihuahua and elsewhere intensified the worries of the 
long-dominant Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). 
</P>
<P>
 "The bias was that border people would be more prone to (give in) to the U.S. 
instead of resisting," said Samuel Schmidt, director of the border studies 
program at the University of Texas at El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
 These fears have provoked a bemused and resentful response. Miguel Escobar, a 
novelist from the border state of Sonora and press attache at the Mexican 
Consulate in Los Angeles, says that the Mexican self-image at the border is 
demarcated and accentuated by the "permanent confrontation with that which is 
not Mexican." 
</P>
<P>
 "The desert culture of northern individualism prevails over the southern 
collective culture," Escobar said. "But there are few frontiers as Mexican as 
that of Tijuana." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the misperceptions of outsiders, one of the most striking features of 
the border mentality is this ability to move between two cultures without 
losing a sense of identity, said Isaac Artenstein, a filmmaker who grew up in 
Tijuana and lives in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a surprising phenomenon," he said. "People from Mexico City are a lot 
more willing to be Americanized. In Tijuana, there's a real consciousness that 
goes back to the 1930s and 1940s of defending the culture, drawing the line, 
representing the last frontier of Mexico. People go back and forth, but they 
are not as easily overwhelmed by it." Tijuana at a Glance 
</P>
<P>
 * Population: More than 1 million, based on estimates of rapid growth and 
migration. 
</P>
<P>
 * History: Developed around the Rancho de Tia Juana, the largest of six cattle 
ranches that merged into a village in 1840. In the 1920s, during Prohibition, 
it began to attract tourists from the United States with the availability of 
liquor and gambling, and a racetrack on the outskirts of town. 
</P>
<P>
 * Economy: Dominated by trans-border manufacturing plants known as 
maquiladoras , making electronics, textiles and plastics. The tourist industry 
is also a major economic force.

TELEDYNE TO PAY $112 MILLION IN 2 WHISTLE-BLOWER SUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Teledyne settled two major civil fraud suits brought by the Justice Department 
and four whistle-blowers for $112.5 million, the second-highest such settlement 
in defense industry history, the government announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a deal negotiated over recent months, Teledyne will pay $85 million to 
settle charges that its relays subsidiary in Hawthorne sold the Pentagon 
millions of improperly tested electronic relays, and $27.5 million to settle 
charges that its systems unit in Northridge padded contracts on aircraft 
electronics equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the late 1980s, Teledyne has pleaded guilty three times to a broad range 
of federal felony charges and has faced half a dozen civil fraud suits -- a 
startling series of legal problems that surpassed those of much larger defense 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
 With the two settlements Thursday, Teledyne will have made substantial 
progress in pulling itself out of the legal quagmire that has damaged its 
reputation at the Pentagon, forced it to lay off employees and reduced its 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is some sense of satisfaction and relief to have these cases resolved," 
said Teledyne President Donald Rice. "It is an important milestone getting 
these major cases resolved, having the financial uncertainty resolved and 
allowing us to focus more of our time on the business." 
</P>
<P>
 The $112.5-million settlement is just the latest fortune extracted from the 
defense industry through the federal False Claims Act, which allows 
whistle-blowers to sue contractors on behalf of the government and share in the 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 The stunning series of recent awards, including the $150 million paid by 
United Technologies earlier this month, are likely to continue, experts say. As 
with many other cases, the Teledyne suits were filed in the late 1980s, shortly 
after amendments to the federal law in 1986 strengthened the hand of 
whistle-blowers. 
</P>
<P>
 The early cases are nearing a conclusion and the resulting damages are 
dwarfing the civil settlements historically won by the federal government. The 
industry, clearly stunned, is exerting pressure on Congress to limit 
whistle-blowers by amending the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a serious problem," said LeRoy Haugh, a vice president at the Aerospace 
Industries Assn., a trade group. "It hasn't bankrupted anybody so far, but at 
some point it could be the difference of staying in business and not staying in 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 But whistle-blowers and their attorneys argue that the large awards are the 
very reason not to weaken the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "The awards are so big only because they are based on the amount of money that 
was stolen in the first place," said Phillip Benson, a Newport Beach attorney 
who represented one of the whistle-blowers in the systems unit case. 
</P>
<P>
 The large rewards also reflect the substantial resources that private law 
firms representing whistle-blowers commit to the cases, often surpassing the 
money and time that the Justice Department can commit. 
</P>
<P>
 John Phillips, who represented whistle-blowers in both of Teledyne's cases, 
said his firm had spent 20,000 hours in supporting the Justice Department in 
the cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the settlement, Teledyne will pay half of the $112.5 million 
damages before the end of this year and the balance in two equal installments 
next year. The whistle-blowers in the cases will receive between 15% and 25% of 
the awards, subject a federal judge's ruling on the award. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the $85 million civil settlement, Teledyne has previously paid 
a $17.5-million criminal fine for the illegal testing of relays and an 
additional $3.1 million in an administrative settlement with the Pentagon. 
Teledyne also must pay $4.6 million to the whistle-blowers' attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 The $112.5-million settlement will be charged against the company's 
first-quarter earnings, resulting in an after-tax loss of $55.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The allegations in the relays case were made by Emil Stache and Almon 
Muehlhausen, two employees at Teledyne's plant in Hawthorne. They alleged that 
Teledyne improperly tested 8 million to 10 million relays, which are tiny 
switches used in a variety of jets, missiles, spacecraft and other systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Rice said that there is no allegation or evidence that any relay failure has 
caused any damage in military operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The allegations in the systems case were made by Klaus Kirchhoff and Max 
Killingsworth, who alleged that executives at the Northridge plant routinely 
padded contracts by adding illegal "negotiation yields" that would provide a 
cushion in cutting prices during contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the settlement closes the book on the two cases for Teledyne, it is 
expected that the private attorneys and whistle-blowers in the case will be 
fighting in court for some time over the division of attorneys fees and the 
award.

HOUSE APPROVES CRIME BILL, 285-141; CONGRESS: $28-BILLION MEASURE WOULD ADD 
MORE POLICE, BUILD MORE PRISONS, EXPAND DEATH PENALTY. THE VOTE SENDS THE 
LEGISLATION TO BE RECONCILED WITH SENATE VERSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a major step toward final passage of anti-crime legislation, the House on 
Thursday overwhelmingly approved the most expensive and far-reaching crime bill 
ever considered by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The $28-billion measure, which has President Clinton's blessing, is designed 
to put more police on the street, build more prisons, get tough on violent 
offenders, spend billions for crime-prevention programs and expand the federal 
death penalty to 66 new offenses, although it also would open the door to more 
appeals of death sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 Adopted on a 285-141 roll call, the measure will now be sent to a Senate-House 
conference committee, which must work out the differences between it and a 
crime bill approved in November by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Jack Brooks (D-Tex.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and floor 
manager of the bill, called the House action a major victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a breakthrough to achieve a balance between hard-nosed punishment and 
forward-looking prevention," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the future of specific provisions is uncertain -- and the funding is 
subject to additional appropriation votes -- the House action virtually 
guarantees that sweeping crime legislation will be approved by Congress this 
year. In large part, the outcome has been driven by a public outcry over crime 
and the perception -- accurate or not -- that it is rampant in the streets of 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Since last fall, Clinton has pledged to work for passage of a crime bill, and 
even though members of Congress differ sharply over crime-fighting philosophy, 
opponents of the bill -- mostly Republicans -- were loath to oppose it for fear 
of disappointing constituents in an election year. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and the Democrats are expected to reap large political benefits if the 
final bill is passed -- especially if it fulfills Clinton's pledge to put 
100,000 more police officers on the streets and includes multibillion-dollar 
crime-prevention programs. 
</P>
<P>
 That the Democrats would lead the charge on anti-crime legislation heavy on 
punishment marks a sizable political turnabout. Some months ago, they began a 
serious effort to adopt for themselves an issue that has long been considered 
the province of the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
 "Politically, I think Democrats have recaptured the crime issue," said Rep. 
Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), a major architect of the bill. "For years, 
Republicans attacked Democrats as soft and mushy-headed on crime. That won't 
work anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 But Republican leaders complained that the bill is too soft on career 
criminals and undercuts the death penalty by allowing defendants in capital 
cases to allege racial bias in the imposition of death sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, 65 GOP lawmakers joined with 219 Democrats and one independent to 
adopt the measure; 107 Republicans and 34 Democrats voted against it. 
</P>
<P>
 The President, who stayed out of the Senate's crime-bill debate, intervened in 
the House, endorsing a popular provision -- known as "three strikes and you're 
out" -- that would require life imprisonment without parole for repeat 
offenders who commit violent crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional leaders said the President would now take the offensive on 
behalf of an assault-weapons ban, which was approved by the Senate but excluded 
from the House measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaker Thomas S. Foley has promised that the House will consider the issue in 
a separate bill to be brought to the floor within the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 GOP leaders also were expected to oppose that measure, which would prohibit 
the possession, sale or future manufacture of assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate-House conference, scheduled to start early in May, is expected to 
be hard-fought but not particularly prolonged. Key lawmakers said they hoped to 
get a bill on the President's desk by the end of next month, before members of 
Congress leave on a Memorial Day recess. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee was expected to go along with the Senate provision that would 
provide for 100,000 more police officers at a cost of $9 billion. The House 
version called for only 50,000 officers at a cost of $5.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Major differences were anticipated, however, on whether to retain the 
Senate-passed assault-weapons ban and on how to allocate the remainder of the 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The House, for example, authorized a total of $13.5 billion for states to 
build and operate prisons, more than double the $6.5 billion voted by the 
Senate for prisons and alternatives such as "boot camps" for youthful 
offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 In another major difference, the House bill includes an unprecedented $8 
billion for a variety of crime-prevention programs, including $2 billion in 
grants to local governments in high-crime areas and $525 million for job 
training. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.), who will be one of the House conferees in the 
negotiating session with the Senate, said: "There must be a better balance than 
exists in the Senate crime bill between federal spending for incarceration and 
federal spending for prevention of crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Conyers also criticized some of the get-tough provisions in the measure, 
saying: "Bumper-sticker slogans like 'Three strikes, you're out' make great 
copy but will only overload an already overburdened criminal-justice system and 
further reduce a judge's discretion." 
</P>
<P>
 There will also be pressure to allocate funds for prison construction because 
of the repeated emphasis during the weeklong House debate on the need to keep 
violent criminals behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Klaas, father of slain 12-year-old Polly Klaas of Petaluma, for example, 
urged Congress to authorize the $13.5 billion included in the House bill for 
the construction and operation of prisons. This provision would earmark 25% of 
the money to states that increase the prison time served by repeated violent 
offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day one of these guys is away is a day he can't commit a crime against 
an innocent citizen," Klaas said at a press conference. "This is the one law 
that could have made a difference in my daughter's case." 
</P>
<P>
 It appeared likely, however, that the allocation for prisons would be closer 
to the lower Senate figure because of other demands on the available funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Schumer, chairman of the Judiciary subcommittee on crime, described the House 
bill as a "centrist" measure that responds to the public's demand to stop 
political squabbling and pass an effective crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to do things that work and not things that ring our bells or press 
our ideological buttons," he told reporters. "This is one of the few times that 
Washington listened to what's going on in the streets." 
</P>
<P>
 Only 34 Democrats -- mostly liberals, but some conservatives -- voted against 
the bill. Twenty-four of the 38 members of the Congressional Black Caucus voted 
for passage despite the traditional opposition of its members to expansion of 
the death penalty. That concern was counterbalanced by the provision allowing 
death-penalty appeals to be based on statistical evidence of racial bias in 
such sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 The 65 Republicans who broke with their leadership included moderate GOP 
lawmakers. In California, for example, eight of the 22-member Republican 
delegation voted for the bill, along with 27 of the 30 Democrats from the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome indicated that a final version of the bill emerging from the 
conference committee would be approved easily in both chambers. The Senate 
legislation passed by a 95-4 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The House also voted, 402 to 22, to remove weight-training equipment from 
federal prisons on grounds that it would prevent prisoners from increasing 
their fighting abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The House also voted to bar prisoners from receiving Pell grants for college 
education by a vote of 312 to 116. Rep. Bart Gordon (D-Tenn.) contended that 
the $36 million spent on 28,000 prisoners would be better spent on students not 
behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 On a related issue, the House decided, 347 to 82, to require federal prisoners 
who have not graduated from high school to earn a general equivalency diploma 
before becoming eligible for early release. Exceptions could be made, however, 
by the director of the Bureau of Prisons. Crime Bill Comparisons 
</P>
<P>
 Here are major provisions of the $28-billion crime bill passed by the House, 
and comparisons with the Senate measure. The two versions must be reconciled by 
a conference committee: 
</P>
<P>
 * Life imprisonment for three-time violent-crime and drug offenders. The 
Senate bill is similar, although the House measure has an early-out provision 
the Senate did not pass. 
</P>
<P>
 * Expansion from two to nearly 70 the number of crimes eligible for the death 
penalty, including drive-by killings and fatal carjackings. Drug kingpins could 
also face execution, even when no death is involved. The Senate bill adds about 
50 death penalty crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Defendants facing the death penalty would be allowed to use racial 
statistics on capital punishment as evidence of discrimination. The Senate bill 
does not include this provision. 
</P>
<P>
 * Authorization of $7 billion for crime prevention and $2 billion for 
rehabilitation, such as drug treatment, in prisons. The Senate bill devotes far 
less money to such efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 * Authorization of $3.45 billion for 50,000 more community police officers. 
The Senate bill authorizes $8.9 billion for 100,000 such police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Unlike the Senate bill, the House measure contains no ban on assault 
weapons. 
</P>

FIRST PLANETS FOUND OUTSIDE SOLAR SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LEE HOTZ, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An astronomer has found "irrefutable evidence" of at least two planets 
orbiting a nearby star -- the first confirmed observation of planets outside 
the solar system humanity calls home.  
</P>
<P>
 What has scientists most excited, however, is that the finding suggests that 
planets can form around almost any star and that the galaxy may well be crowded 
with planets.  
</P>
<P>
 Astronomer Alexander Wolszczan at Pennsylvania State University confirmed the 
existence of the planets in orbit around an unusual neutron star located 1,200 
light-years away in the constellation Virgo. The star is one of just 21 known 
stellar objects, called millisecond pulsars, that spin thousands of times 
faster than typical stars, broadcasting powerful radio pulses as they revolve. 
</P>
<P>
 The star, known as PSR B1257+12, is an extremely small, very dense body barely 
the size of Los Angeles, that weighs as much as the sun and spins faster than a 
kitchen blender. It is the cinder from an ancient supernova that once burned 
more brightly than any other object in the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 "The proof that objects of planetary size do exist outside the solar system 
indicates that our planets are not unique and uncommon anymore," Wolszczan 
said. "The evidence is such that there is no need to question the reality of 
this."  
</P>
<P>
 Wolszczan and his colleagues determined that one planet is about 3.4 times the 
size of Earth and is orbiting the star every 66.6 days; the second planet-sized 
object appears to be about 2.8 times the size of Earth and is orbiting the 
pulsar every 98.2 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists Thursday said it was extremely unlikely that either planet could 
support life. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolszczan also reported the possibility that a smaller, moon-sized object is 
orbiting closer to the star, but cautioned that those observations were not yet 
confirmed. That object appears to circle the pulsar every 25 days.  
</P>
<P>
 More than one scientific reputation has foundered on such announcements of new 
planetary systems. 
</P>
<P>
 At least five times in the past 30 years, news of planet discoveries has been 
followed quickly by retractions when errors in the data were discovered or when 
others could not confirm the initial sighting. In 1992, for example, a 
respected British astronomer had to tell his colleagues that the planet he 
thought he had discovered the year before "just evaporated." 
</P>
<P>
 But Wolszczan's findings, which are being published today in the journal 
Science, appear to convince many skeptical astronomers. He spent three years 
confirming the existence of the planets, which he detected in the fall of 1991 
with the help of Dale Frail of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory after 
16 months of monitoring the unusual star. 
</P>
<P>
 Shrinivas Kulkarni, the Caltech astronomer who discovered millisecond pulsars 
in 1982, said Thursday that he found the evidence very persuasive, calling it 
"a wonderful thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were some healthy doubts that maybe the pulsar was doing some bizarre 
stuff that we were incorrectly interpreting as planets," he said. "But we can 
all be sure now that we are (detecting) planets." 
</P>
<P>
 The star would be considered remarkable under any circumstances, astronomers 
said, but it is an especially unlikely place for planets to form because it is 
the collapsed remnant of a supernova explosion that should have destroyed any 
existing orbiting bodies.  
</P>
<P>
 For that reason, the discovery suggests that planets may be far more common in 
the universe than any astronomer had ever dared hope, authorities said.  
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that planets have been found orbiting a neutron star is a strong 
piece of evidence that planets are easy to form," Caltech astronomer Stephen 
Thorsett said. "This is certainly the best case I've seen and I am personally 
confident things have been done right and this is correct." 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery apparently culminates a search that began with the invention of 
the first telescope centuries ago. But no one has laid eyes on the two planets 
with any optical instrument. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, to find the planets, researchers used statistical analyses and 
detailed observations of the regular radio signals the pulsar emits. Wolszczan 
was able to detect the infinitesimal wobble caused by the gravitational pull of 
the planets whirling around the central star. The star sends out a radio signal 
160 times a second with a precision greater than the most accurate atomic clock 
on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolszczan used the 305-meter-diameter radio telescope at the Arecibo 
Observatory in Puerto Rico to measure the arrival times of the pulsar's energy 
pulses. Unlike many of the other 550 known pulsars in the universe, these 
signals contained a subtle, periodic hesitation that strongly suggested that 
the position of the star was changing in response to one or more large objects 
in orbit around it. 
</P>
<P>
 Further meticulous analysis revealed the effect of the planets' changing 
orbits as they passed each other in their journeys around the strange sun, 
bearing out theoretical predictions. That was the test that other astronomers 
found most convincing. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two theories on how the planets may have formed. 
</P>
<P>
 Any planets already around that star should have been destroyed in the 
supernova blast. "It is the last place you'd look for planets," Kulkarni said.  
</P>
<P>
 But Thorsett at Caltech and Rachel Dewey at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 
Pasadena last year calculated that planets could survive a cataclysmic stellar 
explosion, depending on where they were in their orbits when the supernova was 
triggered.  
</P>
<P>
 But the supernova happened so long ago that planets could have formed since 
then. Scientists believe that in that scenario, the neutron star was orbited by 
a companion star, which eventually swelled into a red giant, a cool star 
typically 100 times larger than our sun. As it did so, it dumped matter into 
the neutron star, causing it to spin rapidly. The red giant somehow came apart, 
and from its ruins the seeds of the newly discovered planets formed, 
astronomers theorize. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to take news of the first two planets very seriously," said Stephen 
P. Maran, a senior scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in 
Greenbelt, Md. and spokesman for the American Astronomical Society. "I think we 
now have much greater confidence that there really are planets of other stars. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the confirmation comes from the person who made the initial discovery," 
he cautioned. "Everything I have heard indicates this is good work, but . . . 
he already knew what he wanted to find."

VACANT LOTS A BLEAK TRIBUTE TO 2ND ANNIVERSARY OF RIOTS; AFTERMATH: RECOVERY IS 
SLOWEST IN SOUTH-CENTRAL. BUT OFFICIALS SAY REBUILDING PROPERTIES IS ONLY A 
FIRST STEP. 
</P>

<P>
 As the second anniversary of the Los Angeles riots nears, half the 607 
properties in the city that were severely damaged or burned to the ground 
remain empty, weed-strewn lots. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the violent upheaval cut a wide swath through the city, a Times 
analysis shows that rebuilding has progressed far more slowly in South-Central 
Los Angeles and Pico-Union than in other hard-hit areas.  
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere is the contrast more striking than along the city's most seriously 
damaged commercial thoroughfare, Vermont Avenue, as it wends its way through 
Koreatown, Pico-Union and South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 North of the Santa Monica Freeway on Vermont, 80% of the retail buildings and 
mini-malls that were seriously damaged or gutted by arsonists have been 
rebuilt. For many property owners along this stretch, the main problem has been 
finding renters for their rebuilt storefronts during harsh economic times. 
</P>
<P>
 South of the freeway, two-thirds of the Vermont properties that suffered 
serious damage or were destroyed remain forlorn, fenced-off lots. At one corner 
of the once-thriving intersection of Vermont and Manchester avenues, a single, 
new Payless Shoe Source store stands sentry over the ghosts of burned-out 
clothing shops, indoor swap meets and hamburger stands. 
</P>
<P>
 Community leaders concede that the pace of reconstruction has been painfully 
slow since the three days of riots that began April 29, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate; it's kind of scary," said Roberto Barragan, director of the 
Community Financial Resource Center in South-Central. "Watts never fully 
recovered after the 1965 riots. If something is not done, we'll be the Watts of 
the 1990s." 
</P>
<P>
 Landowners and economic analysts say rebuilding efforts have been hampered by 
financing and insurance woes, fear of crime and renewed civil strife, 
speculation by absentee landlords, the depressed economy and community groups' 
opposition to the return of liquor stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not satisfied with the progress," said recently appointed RLA President 
Linda Griego. "The longer these sites are vacant, the harder for these 
neighborhoods to be revitalized." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, significant rebuilding has occurred in some primarily black and 
Latino neighborhoods of South-Central and Southwest Los Angeles. Moreover, a 
handful of retail chains led by Chief Auto Parts and Smart & Final have 
returned to the inner city with more outlets than before. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, community leaders say that even if all vacant properties were 
rebuilt immediately, it would only be a first step toward providing adequate 
services in chronically impoverished neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was already a challenge before the upheaval, and it was compounded so 
significantly as to be overwhelming at a certain level," City Councilman Mark 
Ridley-Thomas said. "It can't be built like it was before. It has to be built 
back better." 
</P>
<P>
 In all, about 1,100 properties suffered more than $500 million in property 
damage during the civil unrest that followed the not-guilty verdicts returned 
in the case of four Los Angeles police officers in the first beating trial of 
Rodney G. King. Most of them were mini-malls and free-standing commercial 
buildings housing Korean American-run retail businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the nearly 500 structures that suffered less than 25% damage, most were 
back in operation within 18 months, according to data from the city's 
Department of Building and Safety. 
</P>
<P>
 However, city reports have not been up to date on the 607 properties -- many 
of which contained several businesses -- that were damaged at least 25% or 
destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 To determine the state of rebuilding efforts, a Times reporter surveyed each 
of these seriously damaged properties. 
</P>
<P>
 North of the Santa Monica Freeway, 63% of the properties that were seriously 
damaged or destroyed have been rebuilt or are under construction, compared to 
only 44% south of the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The computer-assisted study also shows that in Koreatown, 82% have been 
rebuilt or are under construction; in Pico-Union, 45%; in South-Central Los 
Angeles, 41%, and in Southwest Los Angeles, 52%. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two Valley properties were included on the list of severely damaged or 
burned buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 One at 14705 Blythe St. in Panorama City contained a vacant house that burned 
to the ground and has not been rebuilt, according to Genny Albers, a Blythe 
Street activist. The city later demolished the home, Albers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other is at 14702 Parthenia St. Efim Flikstin, owner of a nearby 
coin-operated laundry, said a liquor store there was burned to the ground and 
has not been rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times analysis does not include riot-affected areas outside Los Angeles 
city limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Although city officials have often pledged special consideration for riot 
victims, many of them say they have received more hassles than assistance from 
city code inspectors. Most businessmen, with the exception of major retail 
chain operators, said that they received absolutely no help from RLA, the 
private agency formed as Rebuild Los Angeles at the behest of former Mayor Tom 
Bradley and Gov. Pete Wilson to oversee revitalization efforts.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is an example of how it's not happening," said Bill McKee, executive 
vice president of Rexus Properties, the owner of the Taste and Style Plaza at 
Vermont Avenue and 1st Street. 
</P>
<P>
 McKee, whose efforts to rebuild were initially slowed by the bankruptcy of his 
insurance carrier, said that it was not until his two-story building was 
virtually completed that he was told he would need a separate city water meter 
for a new fire sprinkler system. 
</P>
<P>
 In mid-January, McKee wrote a $10,000 check to the city Department of Water 
and Power to pay for the installation. But he said the DWP wouldn't accept the 
check until he submitted lengthy documentation of the sort that he had already 
presented to city building officials before the project began. "The departments 
don't talk," McKee said. "It's like different countries." 
</P>
<P>
 Installation of the meter was delayed for additional weeks as the city 
Department of Transportation and the DWP prepared plans for diverting traffic 
around a construction trench. 
</P>
<P>
 Along Vermont Avenue through the heart of Koreatown, many other rebuilt 
storefronts remain without tenants because of the weak economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking for almost anything now," said Clifford Eng, whose rebuilt 
structure at 8th Street and Vermont lies vacant. His former tenant, a dry 
cleaner, moved on rather than waiting for the rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 Eng said he spent more than $300,000 from a federal Small Business 
Administration loan and his own finances on the project, only to see rental 
rates plunge to $1.50 a square foot from a previous high of $2.25. Even at the 
reduced price, he said, "they still won't bite."  
</P>
<P>
 As trash and graffiti collect at the door, the disillusioned 65-year-old Los 
Angeles native said he is watching his dreams of a leisurely retirement fly out 
the window. "The worst mistake I made is that I had many offers to sell the 
property as is, but I thought for my best advantage, I should have an income to 
take care of me until I die." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that there have not been some successes north of the Santa Monica Freeway. 
Pharmacist David Kasen quickly found five new tenants for the storefronts he 
rebuilt next to his Key Drug Co. at 8th and Vermont. "Every aspect with the 
city was like a 10-act play," he said. "But we were booked right away when the 
building was rebuilt." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, plans for a 25-story hotel, office and commercial center in the 
midst of the riot zone received City Council approval last month despite 
opposition from homeowners concerned about the center's massive bulk. 
</P>
<P>
 In South-Central Los Angeles, a $115-million, 587,000-square-foot project such 
as Koreatown's planned Pacific Trade Center would stick out like the Empire 
State Building. 
</P>
<P>
 In many South-Central neighborhoods, new strip malls are heralded as major 
improvements. Chain groceries are few and far between here, office space is 
negligible and hotels are nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
 Absentee landlordism, on the other hand, runs high. County property records of 
unrebuilt, riot-wrecked lots along Vermont Avenue read like a directory of 
middle-class and upper-crust Southern California locales -- the property owners 
living in Rancho Palos Verdes, Pacific Palisades, Agoura Hills, Fountain Valley 
and other communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Landlords with no ties to a neighborhood have fewer concerns about bringing it 
up to snuff, said Jesse Bowman, a South-Central resident who reconstructed his 
riot-ravaged Jesse's TV Sales and Service at 84th Place and Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people use their property as a tax write-off," Bowman said. "(Or) they 
have other properties so they figure, 'We'll hold tight on this area and see 
what happens.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Needleman, co-owner of several inner-city mini-malls, agrees that some 
absentee landlords make reconstruction difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too many people are in the real estate business that shouldn't be," said 
Needleman, a partner in family-run Denmarst Ltd. "You'd be amazed the different 
groups of names on chunks of land for 20 years or more . . . where it's always 
been in the family. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, there's just not enough commitment down there. And it's not 
easy finding insurance or banks that will lend money." 
</P>
<P>
 The Denmarst firm, in contrast, concentrates on inner-city properties, 
including a mini-mall on Martin Luther King Boulevard that suffered more than 
$3 million in riot damage and lost rent but was among the first rebuilt. The 
mall is surrounded by a high, black-painted metal fence as a buffer to the 
gangs and graffiti.  
</P>
<P>
 "Most of my tenants are now doing 10% to 20% better business than before the 
riots, in part because the competition was burned out," Needleman said. "You 
don't make the Taj Mahal but a secure and pleasant environment -- I paint over 
graffiti within 24 hours,"  
</P>
<P>
 Some business owners, such as Young Shim, say they are afraid to return to 
South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 Shim, a Korean American, operated the Right On Drive-In Hamburger stand at 
75th Street and Vermont, featuring Chinese food and all-American grilled beef 
patties, until it was torched by rioters. 
</P>
<P>
 His vacant lot is for sale, and he has moved the fast-food eatery, since 
renamed Young China, to East Los Angeles, where he now prepares Chinese food 
and hamburgers for Latino customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Business was better on Vermont, but I don't want fights no more, no 
arguments. So I quit the area," he said. "A lot of bad guys used to be over 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Other merchants, primarily Korean Americans, have hit roadblocks in the form 
of zoning strictures discouraging the return of small convenience stores with a 
high volume of liquor sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the riots destroyed 224 of the 723 liquor outlets in South-Central, 
only a handful have been allowed back. 
</P>
<P>
 One is the Trojan Market at 30th Street and Vermont, operated by Don Myung for 
four years before the riots. Myung said he would never have reopened if it were 
not for the firm support of his landlord, the Wolf family, a longtime 
landholder near USC. 
</P>
<P>
 At public hearings, Myung, armed with petitions of support from customers, 
faced strong opposition from community groups that complained of drinking and 
loitering outside the mini-market. To win approval, Myung agreed to hire a 
security officer and close by 10 nightly. He also offered to sell fresh meat 
and produce in a community starved for grocery stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Government restrictions are a key to improving long-neglected neighborhoods, 
said Karen Bass, executive director of the Community Coalition for Substance 
Abuse Prevention and Treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The environment that surrounded many of these liquor stores compromised 
public safety and quality of life," she said. "If we are going to rebuild, we 
shouldn't just rebuild but improve. If you have problems, why should you put 
them back?" 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, such provisions are a burden to grocery owners, Myung said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in this country for 20 years. When I was 20, I could work for 20 
hours a day. My feet never hurt. Now I'm over 40 and starting new. I'm burned 
out and I have to start all over again. My whole life, I'll be a victim." 
</P>
<P>
 Farther south on Vermont, the commercial district centered at Slauson Avenue 
is among the emerging success stories of post-riot rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 Most shops and grocery stores that were looted were quickly restocked and 
among the businesses that burned down, a Home Savings branch and a Kentucky 
Fried Chicken were swiftly rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the outer shell of a Taco Bell restaurant has emerged in recent 
months, a new J.J. Newberry discount store is due to rise this fall from the 
ashes of one that was torched and construction of a new Vons supermarket is 
scheduled to begin in early 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Marva Smith Battle-Bey, executive director of the Vermont Slauson Economic 
Development Corp., said major chains have a much easier time than small 
entrepreneurs winning bank financing for rebuilding or new construction. Now, 
in contrast to after the Watts riots, many larger businesses have decided to 
remain in the inner-city rather than flee. 
</P>
<P>
 "We already had generated a commercial hub here," Battle-Bey said. "Several 
major places were lost . . . but the larger kind of corporate entities came 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five blocks to the south, the Vermont-Manchester business district is 
probably the worst remaining riot eyesore. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, the slew of burnt-out lots has become the focus of a 
philosophical and political dispute between Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) 
and Ridley-Thomas, two of the city's top African American elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Waters envisions remaking the wide thoroughfare into a version of 
pedestrian-rich Old Town Pasadena or Santa Monica's Third Street Promenade, 
replete with coffee shops, bookstores, bakeries and theaters. She is also 
fighting efforts to build a 130-unit, mixed-use affordable housing complex six 
blocks to the north. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridley-Thomas, on the other hand, says there is ample room along the strip for 
a variety of investments. Current plans, he said, include $30 million in 
non-commercial structures consisting of the affordable housing project, a 
senior citizens housing complex, an alternative high school and a mini-City 
Hall that would include his district office to replace one set afire during the 
riots. 
</P>
<P>
 One impediment to building a major shopping center in the area is the fact the 
lots are owned by several landlords with competing financial interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Making matters more difficult, landlords such as Johnny Chu have gone forward 
with their own plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Chu began rebuilding his men's clothing shop. But he ran out of 
cash before he could finish. As the second anniversary of the riots looms, the 
half-built structure sits like a war-scarred bunker in a sea of empty lots. 
</P>

 Half of the 607 Los Angeles properties severely damaged or destroyed in the 
1992 riots have not been rebuilt. The pace of rebuilding has proceeded more 
quickly north of the Santa Monica Freeway, where 62% of the properties have 
been rebuilt or are under construction. South of the freeway, only 44% have 
been rebuilt. The map shows properties that have not been rebuilt, and in some 
cases a single dot represents more than one building.

ANTELOPE VALLEY DISTRICT WON'T GIVE CLAS TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON MOESER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Acting in apparent defiance of the state education code, the Antelope Valley 
Union High School District has voted not to administer the Department of 
Education's controversial CLAS exam, becoming the first school district in 
California to take such a stand.  
</P>
<P>
 In a 3-2 vote, the district board of trustees opted late Wednesday night 
against administering the California Learning Assessment System test this year 
because of the secrecy surrounding it that prevents the test from being 
publicly reviewed.  
</P>
<P>
 Board members also said CLAS fails to adequately measure students' abilities 
in the basics and instead inappropriately queries them on their personal 
beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 The CLAS test has come under fire recently from some parent and political 
groups who believe the literature portions of the test contain passages that 
denigrate the family. Critics also argue, for example, that in one test 
question students are asked to defy authority by writing about a school rule 
they disagree with. 
</P>
<P>
 The secrecy issue has also raised concerns. The state Department of Education 
argues that access to the test must be limited to ensure its integrity while 
critics contend the secrecy is to keep parents from knowing the true contents 
of the exam. 
</P>
<P>
 The Antelope Valley board's action caught the state Department of Education by 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph R. Symkowick, general counsel for the department, said the education 
code is clear in its requirement that the test be given. "We need to look at 
what that requirement means and what our options are." 
</P>
<P>
 The Antelope Valley district's action is arguably one of the most defiant 
moves by a school district yet over the CLAS test. 
</P>
<P>
 Under threat of legal action by the conservative U.S. Justice Foundation, a 
number of school districts are formally or informally giving parents the 
opportunity to exempt their children from the exam. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3,400-student Beaumont Unified School District agreed earlier this week to 
pursue legal action against the state. The district wants a definitive 
statement as to what its obligation is to give the CLAS test and whether the 
exam contains information about students' personal beliefs." 
</P>
<P>
 Beaumont Supt. John Wood said the Riverside County district will administer 
the test but is planning legal action because "we believe we're caught in the 
middle."  
</P>
<P>
 Trustees for the Santee School District agreed to suspend administration of 
the test Tuesday, the same day students at three of the district's 10 schools 
had started taking it. 
</P>
<P>
 James Waters, superintendent of the 8,000-student district in San Diego 
County, said the board will decide Monday whether to resume the testing once 
members have a chance to read through the CLAS exams, something that the 
Department of Education recommends against in order to ensure the validity of 
the exam. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're looking at both the content of the literature selections and 
the questions," Waters said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the Santee district, the 8,200-student West Covina Unified School 
District has also said it will not administer the CLAS test until it has been 
reviewed by the board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does not seem reasonable to me to say that the staff of a school district 
can look at (the test), but the people who are responsible to the community 
can't," Supt. John F. Costello said.  
</P>
<P>
 The board will review the exam during a closed session meeting Tuesday and 
plans to make a decision that night on how to proceed, Costello said. If the 
test is free of questions that ask students about their personal beliefs, as 
the Department of Education says it is, the test will be administered. 
</P>
<P>
 If the board feels there are intrusive questions, it will "decide what options 
are available." One of those options may be to follow the lead of the Antelope 
Valley Union High School District and simply not administer the test. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Education has repeatedly said the questions asked in 
the test do not meet the criteria that would trigger a need for parental 
consent. 
</P>
<P>
 Susie Lange, a department spokeswoman, said she is aware of about a dozen 
districts that are allowing parents to decide whether their children should be 
tested. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear whether the department will take action against those districts 
that are allowing the exemptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no provisions for exemptions and school districts have a duty to 
administer the test," Symkowick said. "There's no specific direction to do 
anything to districts that do that but that doesn't mean there's no possibility 
of action." 
</P>
<P>
 Symkowick said it will probably be several days before the Department of 
Education determines how to respond to the Antelope Valley district's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 William D. Dawson, acting state superintendent of public instruction, was in 
Washington on Thursday and was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The high school board did not adopt a resolution stating their reasons for 
choosing not to give the test. Instead, board President Billy Pricer simply 
made a motion not to administer the test, despite the advice of district legal 
counsel against such a move. 
</P>
<P>
 After a long and sometimes raucous hearing Wednesday attended by about 200 
people, Pricer's motion was supported by Trustees Sue Stokka and Tony Welch, 
with Wilda Andrejcik and Bill Olenick dissenting. 
</P>
<P>
 Olenick urged the board to administer the test and allow parents to decide 
whether their children should take it. Andrejcik simply urged the board to "be 
obedient to the law." 
</P>
<P>
 The decision of the Antelope Valley district pleased some parents but angered 
others. On Thursday, there were parents and teachers looking into the 
possibility of seeking an injunction to have the decision reversed and others 
who were considering mounting a recall campaign against the board president. 
</P>
<P>
 "You represent all of us," Joanne Opdahl, the parent of a high school junior, 
told the board during the hearing. "Not just the people in the back of the 
room." 
</P>
<P>
 Opdahl and others believe the "silent majority" will begin to take an active 
stance in the issue now that a "vocal minority" has swayed the board into not 
giving the test. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Kreep, executive director of the U.S. Justice Foundation, said while 
districts are required to administer a statewide assessment test, the code does 
not dictate that it must be the CLAS test. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ed code doesn't say what the state department says it says," said Kreep, 
who through his foundation has threatened to file lawsuits against every school 
district in the state over the CLAS exam. 
</P>
<P>
 Kreep said CLAS violates state law by asking students questions about their 
personal beliefs without first notifying parents and seeking their written 
permission. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Foundation has already filed lawsuits against three districts in 
Riverside County and two in Santa Barbara County. In the coming days, Kreep 
said he will file suits against 10 San Diego County school districts and three 
in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, another conservative group, the Rutherford Institute, sought a 
temporary restraining order to stop six San Bernardino County school districts 
from giving the test.

 Two weeks ago, Kreep appeared at a Antelope Valley Union High School District 
board meeting with a chapter director from the Eagle Forum of California, part 
of a nationwide conservative women's group headed by Phyllis Schlafly. He 
threatened to sue the 12,600-student district if it did not seek parental 
consent before administering the exam. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the board's decision to go a step further and simply not give the test, 
Kreep said: "If they have made a decision that this test is totally out of 
bounds, that's their right." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Department of Education sues the high school district, which Kreep 
believes is likely, he said his foundation will provide an attorney to assist 
in the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherry Loofbourrow, president of the California School Boards Assn., said her 
association has offered to provide legal assistance to any district that is 
sued for administering the test. 
</P>
<P>
 "The law says the test must be administered," she said. "If lawsuits are filed 
by people who have concerns about this test, they should be filed against the 
state and not the school districts."

U.S. TRADE EXPO IN HANOI DRAWS 5,000 ON 1ST DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 More than 5,000 people flooded an exhibition hall here Thursday for the first 
trade expo to feature exclusively U.S. companies since Vietnamese Communists 
won control of the country 19 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But after pushing their way past the booths of nearly 45 exhibitors and 
sweating in a building cooled only by ceiling fans, many left the long-awaited 
event disappointed, complaining that there were too many industrial products 
and too few goods for average people to buy. 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't anything here for me," said Nguyen Thi To Anh of Hanoi. "Pepsi 
has drinks and food, but only for show. Hong Kong and Taiwan companies had at 
their exhibitions things like women's purses, which people could buy 
immediately, or they gave away samples of hand lotion, or whatever. The 
Americans didn't give anything away." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Vietnamese business professionals, hoping to buy industrial goods, said 
the selection was too narrow at "Vietnamerica Expo '94," sponsored by Vietnam 
Investment Information & Consulting of San Diego.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've been looking forward to buying construction materials directly from U.S. 
manufacturers, but there are only several of such companies here," said Tran 
David, president of APC Ltd., a distributor of construction supplies based in 
Ho Chi Minh City. He had taken a two-hour flight north just for the trade show. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our builders still prefer American products after all these years because the 
equipment lasts longer," Tran said. 
</P>
<P>
 Half an hour before the 9 a.m. opening ceremony, thousands already had 
gathered in front of the Giang Vo Exhibition Hall. Organizers had reserved the 
first two days of the four-day fair for government officials and business 
professionals, but many curious citizens filtered into the crowd, some wearing 
conical straw hats, others with children in their arms. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States' stars and stripes and Vietnam's flag of a single gold star 
on red background flew side by side at the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought this day would happen," said George Dang, an Irvine business 
consultant who attended the expo with his client, Tran. "I have to take a 
picture of the flags." 
</P>
<P>
 But Hanoi resident Nguyen Van Huynh said he had predicted that the Americans 
would return.  
</P>
<P>
 "In 1973, American soldiers left without fanfare. Several years ago, I was 
telling my friends that the Americans would come back in 1993 and we'll be 
rolling out welcoming carpets for them. You see, I was off only four months," 
Nguyen said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 Red carpets were rolled out, and dignitaries cut ribbons and received flowers 
from young women wearing pastel-colored ao dai , the traditional Vietnamese 
dress worn over flowing pants. 
</P>
<P>
 VIIC's managing director, Giang Tran, told the crowd in his opening speech: 
"You will always be a member of an exclusive club that has been present at an 
historic event." 
</P>
<P>
 When the doors of the exhibition hall opened, organizers set off firecrackers. 
</P>
<P>
 Amelia Fendell, a sales agent for Fosanna Furniture in New York, stared in 
amazement at the wall of people crowded around her booth, which featured solid 
mahogany furniture made in Vietnam and kiln-dried to withstand humidity 
anywhere in the world. The furniture attracted attention because the new 
kiln-drying technology makes it much stronger than the brittle goods the 
Vietnamese are accustomed to now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how to explain why there are so many people here. I think it's 
sheer fascination for U.S. products," Fendell said.  
</P>
<P>
 Digital Equipment Corp. International, which has a plant in Costa Mesa, 
exhibited computers and was scheduled to hold a seminar this morning to 
introduce its products. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just opened an office in Hanoi two days before the expo," said Norris L. 
Hickerson, business manager for Digital's Asia region. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers examined Gillette razors, Kraft's Cheese Whiz and Frito-Lay potato 
chips -- though none of the chips were available at the booths for visitors to 
sample. Similarly, PepsiCo representatives brought packages from the company's 
subsidiaries, Pizza Hut and Kentucky Fried Chicken, but the cardboard boxes 
were devoid of actual pizzas and fried chicken. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pizza!," Dang exclaimed as he walked by the Pizza Hut booth. "But our people 
aren't used to cheese, so it will be interesting to see how they market this." 
</P>
<P>
 Otis Elevator Co.'s booth had a sample elevator, while Vector Venture Corp. 
displayed water purification equipment for industrial companies. 
</P>
<P>
 As he passed organizers on his way out of the expo, Nguyen Van Huynh left them 
with this advice: "Next time, try to bring more U.S. products people could buy 
right away. Things like fashionable clothes. I guarantee you people will buy. 
Let us soak in goods we can use every day before bringing all this industrial 
stuff."

SCHOOL BOARD VOTES AGAINST CLAS TESTS IN ANTELOPE VALLEY; EDUCATION: DISTRICT 
IS THE FIRST IN THE STATE TO BOYCOTT ASSESSMENT EXAMS. TRUSTEES SIDE WITH 
CRITICS WHO OBJECT TO SECRECY AND SAY SOME QUESTIONS ARE ANTI-FAMILY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Acting in apparent defiance of the state education code, the Antelope Valley 
Union High School District in Lancaster has voted not to administer the 
controversial CLAS tests of student performance, becoming the first school 
district in California to boycott the exams. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 3-2 vote, the district's board of trustees sided Wednesday night with 
critics of the California Learning Assessment System, citing security rules 
that bar the test materials from being publicly reviewed. Board members also 
said the exams fail to adequately measure student abilities in the basics and 
inappropriately query students on personal beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 The CLAS exams have come under fire recently from some parents and political 
groups who contend that the literature portions of the test contain passages 
that denigrate the family. Critics argue, for example, that in one test 
question students are asked to defy authority by writing about a school rule 
they disagree with. 
</P>
<P>
 The secrecy issue has also raised concerns. The state Department of Education 
argues that access to the tests must be limited to ensure its integrity while 
critics contend that the secrecy is to keep parents from knowing the true 
contents of the exam. 
</P>
<P>
 The Antelope Valley board's action caught the state Department of Education by 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph R. Symkowick, general counsel for the department, said the education 
code is clear in requiring that the tests be given at public schools statewide. 
"We need to look at what that requirement means and what our options are," he 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Learning Assessment System was created by the state Legislature 
at the request of educational reformers in an effort to better gauge the 
performance of public school students. The exams in reading, writing and math 
measure student performance against tough statewide standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The tests were given for the first time last year, and results released in 
March portrayed California students as comparing poorly to the new standards, 
especially in math. The accuracy of the scores, however, has been called into 
questions by foul-ups involving the methods used by the state to grade the 
exams. 
</P>
<P>
 Under threat of legal action by the conservative United States Justice 
Foundation, a number of school districts, formally or informally, have given 
parents the opportunity to exempt students from the exam. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3,400-student Beaumont Unified School District in Riverside County agreed 
earlier this week to pursue legal action against the state. The district wants 
a definitive statement about its obligation to give the tests and whether the 
exams pry too far into students' personal beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. John Wood said the district will administer the test but is planning 
legal action because "we believe we're caught in the middle."  
</P>
<P>
 Trustees for the Santee School District suspended administration of the tests 
Tuesday, the same day students at three of the district's 10 schools had 
started taking it. 
</P>
<P>
 James Waters, superintendent of the 8,000-student district in San Diego 
County, said the board will decide Monday whether to resume testing once 
members have a chance to read through the CLAS exams, something that the 
Department of Education recommends against in order to ensure the validity of 
the exam. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're looking at both the content of the literature selections and 
the questions," Waters said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 8,200-student West Covina Unified School District has also said it will 
not administer the CLAS test until it has been reviewed by the board of 
trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does not seem reasonable to me to say that the staff of a school district 
can look at (the test) but the people who are responsible to the community 
can't," said Supt. John F. Costello. 
</P>
<P>
 Susie Lange, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Education, said she was 
aware of about a dozen school districts that are allowing parents to decide if 
their children should be tested. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear whether the department will take action against districts that 
are allowing the exemptions. Symkowick said it will probably be several days 
before the Department of Education determines how to respond to the Antelope 
Valley district's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no provisions for exemptions, and school districts have a duty to 
administer the test," Symkowick said. "We need to huddle on this one." 
</P>
<P>
 The Antelope Valley board did not adopt a resolution stating their reasons for 
choosing not to give the test. Instead, board President Billy Pricer simply 
made a motion "not to administer the test," despite the advice of district 
legal counsel.  
</P>
<P>
 After a long and sometimes raucous hearing Wednesday attended by about 200 
people, Pricer's motion was approved, with trustees Wilda Andrejcik and Bill 
Olenick dissenting. 
</P>
<P>
 Olenick urged the board to administer the test and allow parents to decide 
whether their children should take it. Andrejcik simply urged the board to "be 
obedient to the law." 
</P>
<P>
 The decision of the Antelope Valley district pleased some parents but angered 
others. On Thursday, some parents and teachers were looking into the 
possibility of seeking an injunction to have the decision reversed, and others 
who were considering mounting a recall campaign against the board president. 
</P>
<P>
 "You represent all of us,' Joanne Opdahl, the parent of a high school junior, 
told the board during the hearing. "not just the people in the back of the 
room." 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Kreep, executive director of the United States Justice Foundation, said 
the exams violate state law by asking students questions about their personal 
beliefs without first notifying parents and seeking their written permission. 
State officials deny that any parental consent is required for the exams. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago Kreep appeared at an Antelope Valley board meeting with a 
chapter director from the Eagle Forum of California, part of a nationwide 
conservative women's group headed by Phyllis Schlafly. He threatened to sue the 
12,600-student district if it did not seek parental consent before 
administering the exam. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Department of Education sues the high school district, Kreep said the 
foundation will offer an attorney to assist in the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Foundation has filed lawsuits against three districts in Riverside 
County and two in Santa Barbara County. In the coming days, Kreep said he will 
file suits against 10 San Diego County school districts and three in Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, another conservative group, the Rutherford Institute, sought a 
temporary restraining order to stop six San Bernardino County school districts 
from giving the test. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Dacus, an attorney and western regional coordinator for the institute, 
said the test "is a violation of parents' right to privacy and religious 
liberty."

WILSON CALLS FOR STRONGER POLICING ON STATE'S BORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson on Thursday toured a Border Patrol operation credited with 
stemming the flow of illegal immigration and called on federal officials to 
devote similar energy, if perhaps different tactics, to guard the border 
between Mexico and Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson described the operation -- a blockade along a 20-mile stretch of the 
border -- as a historic effort that has produced a new tranquillity on both 
sides of the international boundary. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican governor, who has made his fight against illegal immigration a 
centerpiece of his reelection campaign, was followed here by a California 
Democratic Party operative who accused him of hypocritical grandstanding and 
was met at one point by a small band of local demonstrators. And a Border 
Patrol official told him that the El Paso experiment would not work in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 But they did nothing to dampen Wilson's enthusiasm for what he saw and heard. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have proved that by making the effort, if you are provided adequate 
resources, you can control the border," Wilson told Silvestre Reyes, chief of 
the Border Patrol's El Paso sector and the driving force behind the blockade, 
known as Operation Hold the Line. 
</P>
<P>
 The operation, which began in September, stationed agents 24 hours a day at 
more than 100 spots along the border. There, they sit in four-wheel-drive 
vehicles, passing their time reading books and listening to self-improvement 
tapes on headsets. Their constant presence deters immigrants who once slipped 
illegally past the points that now are guarded. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of apprehensions -- considered a good indicator of the number of 
illegal crossings -- has dropped 73% since the blockade began, according to the 
Border Patrol. Local police say crime also has dropped and retail business on 
the El Paso side, after a brief slowdown, is booming. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson ended his tour on a dusty plot a stone's throw from Colonia Anapra, a 
desperately poor community of about 1,000 squatters a few miles west of El Paso 
on the border with New Mexico. Wilson's entourage and the horses, helicopters 
and trucks amassed by the Border Patrol for his visit drew a handful of 
Mexicans to the unmarked boundary in the sand. 
</P>
<P>
 One boy smiled beneath a California Angels baseball cap. Another sported a 
T-shirt that said "Surf's Up." An older man said he has lived in Anapra for a 
year and supports the blockade because it has decreased the movement of illegal 
immigrants through his neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "The drug traffickers don't bother us anymore," Ramon Varela Samaniego, 63, 
told reporters as Wilson was hearing the same message from his official hosts. 
The news left the governor downright gleeful. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just about as near as you can get to an unqualified success," Wilson 
said. "We have to do (in California) what has been done here." 
</P>
<P>
 But the chief of the Border Patrol's San Diego office, Gustavo de la Vina, was 
also along on the tour and seemed skeptical that the results could be 
duplicated in California. 
</P>
<P>
 In El Paso, De la Vina said, much of the border is marked by the Rio Grande, a 
natural obstacle that is relatively easy to guard. Immigrants seeking to evade 
the blockade must risk travel over a harsh desert landscape, with the nearest 
major cities hundreds of miles away. The level of traffic is less than half of 
what it is in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I could take the same scenario and transfer it to San Diego," De la 
Vina told Wilson. "I can't do it. I wish I had a Rio Grande. But I don't have 
one." 
</P>
<P>
 De la Vina said his strategy in San Diego will rely more on fences, lights and 
technology to stop the human tide, although he anticipates adding 300 more 
officers to the 1,000 already stationed in his region. 
</P>
<P>
 De la Vina told Wilson as much at a briefing in Los Angeles on Wednesday, 
which led the governor's critics to question whether Wilson's jaunt to Texas 
was a fact-finding trip or a publicity stunt. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson was followed here by Bob Mulholland, a California Democratic Party 
official. 
</P>
<P>
 Mulholland said Wilson's tough stand on illegal immigration is hypocritical 
because as a U.S. senator he sponsored legislation to make it easier for 
farmers to bring migrant laborers in from Mexico to pick crops. Although Wilson 
says his intent was for those workers to stay only temporarily, many have 
remained and now use the same public services the governor says are bankrupting 
the state.

SYRINGE USED IN FUMES CASE HAS BEEN LOST; MYSTERY: CRITICAL EVIDENCE IN THE 
INVESTIGATION OF THE DEATH OF GLORIA RAMIREZ WAS APPARENTLY INCINERATED WITHIN 
HOURS OF THE EMERGENCY ROOM INCIDENT, OFFICIALS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The syringe used to draw blood from Gloria Ramirez, critical evidence in the 
investigation of the mystery fumes that overwhelmed emergency room attendants 
at Riverside General Hospital two months ago, apparently was incinerated within 
hours of the incident, county officials now acknowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 The emergency room was evacuated after those tending to Ramirez smelled the 
syringe containing her blood and complained that it smelled foul and contained 
crystals or other unusual particles. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside County spokesman Tom DeSantis said, however, that the blood had 
already been transferred to vials before the emergency room was abandoned. The 
blood was later retrieved by the Riverside Fire Department's 
hazardous-materials crew and turned over to the county coroner's office for 
testing and analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 It did not occur to the Fire Department crew to retrieve the biomedical waste 
container that apparently contained the syringe, however. Nor was the Fire 
Department instructed to do so by the head emergency room physician who helped 
direct the initial investigation and cleanup efforts, Fire Capt. Gerry 
Mungerson said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of the syringe "doesn't make the investigators' job any easier," 
DeSantis said. 
</P>
<P>
 For weeks, DeSantis had dodged questions about whether the syringe was 
recovered and analyzed, saying that he could neither confirm nor deny that it 
was in the hands of investigators. Late Wednesday, DeSantis said, he found out 
from investigators that the syringe was presumed lost. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that as a matter of standard hospital procedure, as soon as blood is 
drawn into a syringe, the blood is transferred to vials and the syringe is 
thrown away in a biomedical waste container, called a sharps container. 
</P>
<P>
 DeSantis said no witnesses to the Feb. 19 event can recall anything other than 
the standard procedure being followed that night -- even as the medical crew 
became ill after Ramirez's blood was drawn into the syringe. DeSantis said it 
is presumed that the syringe was still -- as procedure dictates -- discarded in 
the sharps container even as people began to collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Every few hours, he said, biomedical waste deposited in the containers is 
routinely incinerated at the hospital, and that was the apparent fate of the 
syringe after the hospital returned to normal several hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 Mungerson, one of two captains directing the city Fire Department's 
hazardous-materials team at the hospital that night, said his crew retrieved 
virtually everything from around where Ramirez was treated, including towels, 
cotton swabs and the vials of blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Mungerson said he directed his crew on the basis of consultation with county 
health officials and Dr. Humberto Ochoa, who heads the emergency room staff but 
was himself unaffected by the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main thing we were worried about was getting the blood," Mungerson said. 
"The doctor didn't mention (the sharps container). It's hindsight now. We were 
dealing with a medical environment that we weren't used to.  
</P>
<P>
 "We try to train for every possible situation as best we can," he said. "There 
are lots of protocols and procedures, and we utilize any people on site who can 
contribute. I guess they can't think of everything, either. I hope it doesn't 
cause a problem."

THE WASHINGTON CONNECTION / JAMES BORNEMEIER: WORRIES OF A POPULATION-WATCHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BORNEMEIER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The topic breeds statistics faster than a roomful of unrepentant chinchillas. 
That's exactly the point. When it comes to world population growth, the numbers 
keep piling up every passing minute. With no timeouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson of Woodland Hills hears the clock ticking very 
loudly. 
</P>
<P>
 "The world's population recently surpassed the 5.6-billion mark, and it is 
growing by almost 100 million people every year. Fifty years ago, the Earth's 
population was 2 billion. Since then, it has nearly tripled, and the next 
billion will be added in less than 11 years. Twenty-four hours from now, there 
will be 260,000 more people in the world than there are at this moment." 
</P>
<P>
 As the recently installed co-chairman of the Congressional Coalition on 
Population and Development, the nine-term Democrat relates these facts and 
figures with the polished cadence of a longtime advocate. He plans to journey 
to Cairo in September for the International Conference on Population and 
Development, sponsored by the United Nations, and earlier this month he spent 
several days in New York at a preparatory gathering of population control 
experts. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson's crusade to rein in the world's swelling population may not make 
him a media darling or give him a punchy campaign issue. But the daunting 
mega-topic has been at the top of his public agenda since his days in the 
California Assembly and Senate, when he authored the state's first liberalized 
abortion law and wrote most of the family planning laws back in the 1960s and 
'70s. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always been the issue that's concerned me the most," Beilenson says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To many of his congressional colleagues, it's a perfect fit.  
</P>
<P>
 Known for his thoughtful -- and occasionally maverick -- views on federal 
spending and campaign finance reform, his collegiality has been sought for 
various bipartisan tasks.  
</P>
<P>
 Although it barely shows up on the political radar scope, Beilenson believes 
his constituents appreciate his strong views on the perils of uncontrolled 
world population growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I work it into my speeches back in the district, the audience sometimes 
spontaneously breaks into applause," Beilenson says. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson's world population views dovetail nicely with his tough stance on 
illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Immigration is the largest factor in the population growth rates in 
California and the country as a whole," Beilenson says. "The state's fertility 
rate is similar to that of developing countries. You can really feel the 
difference from what (the population) was five or 10 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson and his fellow population caucus members have been making some 
progress. Over the past four years the federal appropriations for world 
population programs have more than doubled, to $507 million. The Clinton 
Administration has requested $585 million for this year, and Beilenson is 
seeking $800 million for fiscal 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, it's an open question how much impact that money will have against 
the cultural hurdles, religious taboos and abject poverty in some of the 
world's most troubled countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The more sympathetic Clinton Administration is a sea change from the preceding 
Republican presidencies, when abortion politics kept the United States from 
taking a leadership position in the world population debate. In a 1984 policy 
statement, President Reagan rejected the notion of a global population crisis 
-- a view that some experts still hold. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was hugely frustrating during the Reagan/Bush years, I've got to admit," 
Beilenson says. "We weren't talking about it and we weren't doing anything 
about it. Now (the country) is back on track." 
</P>
<P>
 He wouldn't mind if President Clinton got more involved, "but he's got 14 or 
15 other things on his plate." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Beilenson is optimistic that the United Nations meeting in Cairo will 
produce a general accord on controlling the planet's swelling tide of humans, 
he is painfully aware that once the delegates disband and head for home, the 
topic will recede into the background, where it usually dwells in noble 
inattention. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's one of the difficulties with an ongoing issue with major underlying 
problems that's not time-specific," Beilenson explains knowingly. "By its own 
nature, something can't be happening on this (topic) every day." 
</P>
<P>
 So don't expect to see him on "Hard Copy" any time soon. Even the United 
Nations spaces out its major international population conferences every 10 
years.

MIDEAST PEACE SIGNING NEAR, BOTH SIDES AGREE; DIPLOMACY: NEGOTIATORS EXPECT TO 
CONCLUDE TALKS ON PALESTINIAN SELF-RULE NEXT WEEK. RABIN WILLING TO END GOLAN 
SETTLEMENTS FOR PEACE WITH SYRIA.

<P>
 More than six grueling months after peace talks began, Israeli and Palestinian 
negotiators said Thursday that they expect to conclude talks on Palestinian 
self-rule next week, clearing the way for signing of a final agreement early 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the two sides still differ on a variety of largely symbolic issues -- 
from a Palestinian postage stamp to an international telephone dialing code and 
Palestinian passports -- negotiators said they are close enough on the 
substantial issues blocking an agreement that a nearly final draft could be 
completed during the next round of talks scheduled to begin Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Jerusalem, peace prospects on another front were advanced when Prime 
Minister Yitzhak Rabin said he would remove Jewish settlements from the Golan 
Heights, seized in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, to make peace with Syria. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we need to dismantle settlements for peace, I have supported that in the 
past, and I will continue to do so," Rabin said, declaring that the 32 Israeli 
settlements in the region do not bolster the country's security. "For me, peace 
is a more important value for the future of Israel's security than one group of 
settlements or another." 
</P>
<P>
 The Israeli and PLO delegates dealing with Palestinian autonomy in the West 
Bank town of Jericho and the Gaza Strip said a final accord could be signed in 
early May during a summit between Israel's Rabin and Palestine Liberation 
Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat, the delegations said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot make any 100% assurances, but I think it is highly probable that we 
will finish next week and therefore we will be signing the Monday after," chief 
Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath said. "Barring any major unexpected events, 
we should be very close to signature." 
</P>
<P>
 Maj. Gen. Amnon Shahak, head of the Israeli delegation that left Cairo on 
Thursday afternoon, for the first time shared the Palestinians' optimism and 
said the two sides agreed "upon quite a lot of issues" during the round of 
talks that concluded this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can only hope that next week, if the work will be the same as this week, we 
can at the end of the week be very close to summing up, if not all the things, 
then most of them," Shahak said. "And that will bring us very close to the day 
of the signature." 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinian negotiators said only four or five sub-paragraphs out of a draft 
agreement of more than 100 pages remain to be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
 The mood of the talks swung dramatically from early in the week, when the PLO 
declared a crisis in the talks over the issue of how much legal jurisdiction 
Israel will retain in the territories. But by Thursday, Shahak was back from 
consultations in Jerusalem with a new formula more acceptable to the 
Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 The PLO has insisted that it retain legal jurisdiction in criminal cases not 
only involving Palestinians, but non-Palestinians traveling in and through Gaza 
and Jericho. Israel had initially proposed sending all non-Palestinian cases to 
Israeli courts, but the new proposals "come very close to making an agreement 
on the jurisdiction issue, very close to the declaration of principles (signed 
in September) and therefore . . . a long way to satisfying our needs and 
requirements," Shaath said. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiators said they also reached an agreement on launching air service, once 
airport facilities are available, between Cairo and the Gaza Strip, via a new 
Palestinian airline and Egypt's Air Sinai. 
</P>
<P>
 The week's talks produced final agreement on nearly all areas relating to the 
hand-over of civil administration to Palestinian control, and Shahak said the 
outcome of ongoing economic talks in Paris would resolve most of the other 
outstanding issues. 
</P>
<P>
 But the smooth pace of the talks reflects the fact that some of the most 
difficult issues are being kept for last, to be decided at the highest levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres met Wednesday and Thursday in 
Bucharest, Romania, in an attempt to make headway on some of them, including 
the Palestinians' demands to issue their own passports, postage stamps and 
telephone dialing codes. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel has held fast against any symbols of Palestinian nationhood, but Shaath 
insisted that such "symbolic" gestures were not synonymous with statehood. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a collector of stamps, I am looking forward to the new Palestinian stamp," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even thornier issues -- the ultimate size of the area to be transferred to 
Palestinian control in Jericho, for example, and the presence of a Palestinian 
border guard on the bridge crossing between Jordan and Jericho -- will be left 
to a last-minute summit between Arafat and Rabin. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaath said he believed the two leaders could work out the details and sign a 
final accord during a two-day meeting in Cairo, most likely at the beginning of 
May. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palestinians' demand for a general amnesty for about 8,400 Palestinian 
prisoners also remains unresolved, though Shahak indicated that any releases 
beyond the 5,000 that Israel has pledged to free in two stages after the 
signing of the agreement could be delayed for later negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 The PLO is insisting that all prisoners, including those belonging to the 
militant Islamic group Hamas, be given amnesty. Israel has rejected the idea of 
releasing any Hamas members it holds in view of a wave of Hamas-engineered 
terrorist attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin's comments about the Golan settlements Thursday went beyond his stated 
readiness to pull Israeli forces back in the region. They appeared intended to 
promote negotiations with Syria when Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
visits the Middle East next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Moshe Maoz, a leading Israeli specialist on Syria, said the shift in Rabin's 
position and his bluntness suggested that Rabin is preparing to make painful 
concessions to obtain progress in the talks with Damascus. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rabin's comments, repeated under questioning by angry Golan settlers, 
brought immediate condemnation from the opposition Likud Party and other 
critics. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he says that he is willing to dismantle communities in order to withdraw 
from the Golan, he is actually saying, 'I am willing to make peace without 
security,' " Likud Chairman Benjamin Netanyahu said. "And a peace such as that 
won't last."

ISRAEL'S LABOR PARTY RENT BY POWER STRUGGLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Israel's ruling Labor Party expelled three of its members of Parliament on 
Thursday in an internal power struggle that Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin warned 
could lead to his government's downfall and Labor's defeat at the subsequent 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 Bitterly attacking former Health Minister Haim Ramon for challenging his 
leadership, Rabin said the insurgents were not only undermining the coalition 
government but also its efforts to achieve peace with Israel's Arab neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 In the short term, the expulsions mean that Rabin's government will be living 
from vote to vote in the Knesset, making it vulnerable to challenges from Likud 
and other right-wing parties on a range of issues, not only the peace accords. 
</P>
<P>
 They leave the Labor Party with 41 of the 120 seats in the Knesset, Israel's 
Parliament, and reduce Rabin's governing coalition to 53, making it more 
dependent on the support of five members from small Arab and Communist parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Rabin's warning about the danger to the peace negotiations, the battle 
is not over his approach to peace -- Ramon and his supporters are more dovish 
than the prime minister -- but for control of the country's 1.8-million-member 
trade union movement and the power base it offers for the next parliamentary 
election, due within two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramon, other Labor Party defectors and their allies in the leftist Meretz 
Party and Shas, an Orthodox religious party, are fielding a list of candidates 
in May 10 elections for the General Federation of Workers in Israel, known in 
Hebrew as the Histadrut. 
</P>
<P>
 If the insurgents defeat official Labor candidates, taking over control of 
Histadrut, veterans such as Rabin and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres would be 
pushed aside -- a radical reshaping of Israeli politics.  
</P>
<P>
 Expelled with Ramon from the Labor Party were Amir Peretz, chairman of the 
Knesset's Labor Affairs Committee, and Shmuel Avital, chairman of the Knesset's 
agricultural caucus. 
</P>
<P>
 The alliance of such popular young Labor politicians with Meretz and Shas 
suggested to Israeli political analysts that a new party, dovish on peace 
issues and committed to greater social democracy domestically, could emerge. 
</P>
<P>
 A sample of Histadrut members conducted for the newspaper Maariv this week 
showed Ramon's ticket, which includes Meretz and Shas candidates, to be leading 
that of Histadrut Secretary General Haim Haberfeld, 51% to 10%, with Likud's 
candidates getting 6%. Among the general population, 42% of those surveyed said 
they favored Ramon, compared to 8% for Haberfeld.

TWO IRAQI DIPLOMATS HELD IN LEBANON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From a Times Special Correspondent 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Iraqi diplomats accused of involvement in the assassination of a political 
dissident were arrested by Lebanese police Thursday as they attempted to fly 
out of Beirut after the closure of their mission over the affair. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives grabbed the two men at Beirut International Airport before they 
checked in for a flight to Amman, the Jordanian capital.Three other diplomats, 
including the embassy's charge d'affaires, Awad Fakhri, were allowed to board 
the plane. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrested men are Hadi Hassan, a low-ranking diplomat suspected of shooting 
and killing Iraqi dissident Taleb Ali Suheil on April 12; and Consul Ali Sultan 
Darwish, believed to be the embassy's intelligence chief and the 
assassination's mastermind. 
</P>
<P>
 Suheil, 64, was reported to be a key figure in a plot last year to overthrow 
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. His murder led to a break in diplomatic ties 
between Iraq and Lebanon.

SOUTH AMERICA; CHILE POLICE CHIEF'S 'VACATION' ENDS RIGHTS STANDOFF FOR NOW; HE 
IS SUSPECTED OF COVERING UP KILLINGS UNDER MILITARY REGIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gen. Rodolfo Stange, chief of Chile's militarized national police, refused to 
resign when President Eduardo Frei asked him to early this month. When Stange 
later agreed to go on "vacation," the tense standoff was at least temporarily 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 But the episode gave Frei, who took office in March, an early sample of 
troubles he may face as the second civilian president since the end of military 
rule in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Stange is accused of covering up police guilt in the brutal slaying of three 
Communists in 1985. Numerous military and police officers, in active service 
and retired, are implicated in other pending cases of human rights violations 
under the military regime of Gen. Augusto Pinochet. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinochet, who ruled the country from 1973 to 1990, remains as commander of the 
army. A clause in the Chilean constitution, enacted in 1980, leaves the 
president without authority to remove commanders in chief of the military 
branches or of the Carabineros, the militarized police force. Stange's recent 
refusal to step down has brought renewed demands that this clause be changed. 
</P>
<P>
 The abduction and killing of three Communist Party members in March, 1985, was 
one of the most notorious cases of human rights violations under Pinochet's 
right-wing regime. The bodies of the three men were found on the outskirts of 
Santiago with their throats slit. 
</P>
<P>
 Gen. Cesar Mendoza, then-director general of the Carabineros, resigned in 
August, 1985, after police officers were implicated in the killings. Stange 
succeeded Mendoza as director general of the Carabineros and as a member of 
Pinochet's governing junta. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 31, special judge Milton Juica convicted 15 former police officers 
and a civilian for the 1985 abductions and slayings. Juica also accused Stange 
and six retired officers, including former Director General Mendoza, of 
dereliction of duty and withholding evidence in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Denying any wrongdoing, Stange rejected recommendations by government 
ministers that he resign. Frei summoned him and "stated the convenience of his 
retirement," said a statement issued by the presidential palace. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not resigning," Stange told reporters after the meeting. Further 
government pressure resulted in an announcement by the Carabineros that Stange 
would take a "vacation." But while the government says the vacation will be 
indefinite in length, Stange's lawyer and the personnel director of the 
Carabineros have insisted it will be for 30 days, leading to fears the 
confrontation could be repeated next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence against Stange includes a secret tape recording of a 1985 meeting in 
which the general told other officers that he would lie to defend Carabineros 
in the murder case. A civilian member of a military court has been appointed to 
conduct a criminal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Stange does not give Frei more headaches, other cases may, especially 
if they involve the army. Twice since Pinochet left power, the army has alarmed 
the country with demonstrations of discontent, including putting units on 
alert, partly to protest legal and media concentration on rights violations 
under the military.

ASIA; U.N. UNDER FIRE FOR POLICIES ON 'BOAT PEOPLE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINE COURTNEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As efforts to repatriate thousands of Vietnamese "boat people" to their 
homeland reach a critical phase, the U.N. refugee agency in Hong Kong is facing 
a new wave of criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 Many human rights advocates here are increasingly skeptical of the Office of 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees' humanitarianism and methods 
after its alleged mishandling of a case involving a Vietnamese teen-ager and on 
account of its rejection of pleas for asylum from 39 Vietnamese adults 
belonging to a group that opposes their homeland's Communist regime. 
</P>
<P>
 The refugee agency is speeding up repatriation to end the 18-year-old saga of 
the boat people by clearing detention camps by 1995 -- a decision that more 
than 30 countries endorsed in February at a U.N. meeting in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
 "An organization like the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has a 
multifaceted range of activities throughout the world, and many of these 
activities are ones that we applaud," said Michael Darwyne, a lawyer in Hong 
Kong and an outspoken champion of the boat people. "But in relation to the 
situation in Hong Kong, one has to say that the UNHCR has consistently come 
across as being committed to the repatriation of the Vietnamese rather than 
being committed to the identification and protection of the refugees amongst 
the Vietnamese." 
</P>
<P>
 The top U.N. refugee official in Hong Kong, Jahanshan Assadi, maintains that 
the camps will be cleaned out -- one way or another -- in less than two years. 
"The Vietnamese should know that if they don't sign up with our voluntary 
repatriation program, the alternative is to get deported by the Hong Kong 
government," Assadi said. "I think we're going to have some rough times ahead 
of us." 
</P>
<P>
 The move to accelerate repatriation has sparked widespread protests here and 
hunger strikes by about 25,600 Vietnamese being held in the British colony. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hong Kong office of a refugee advocacy group called Refugee Concern said 
such protests helped draw attention to the plight of a 16-year-old Vietnamese 
orphan boy, Ngo Van Ha. The U.N. refugee agency reversed an earlier decision 
and allowed Ha to join relatives in San Gabriel earlier this month. Public 
pressure had mounted after the agency first insisted he be sent back to 
Vietnam, where he had an uncle who could not or would not care for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The UNHCR's credibility has been reduced even further with this case, if 
that's possible, and not a single person in the camps trusts them," said Ha's 
lawyer, Pam Baker. 
</P>
<P>
 Assadi said Ha simply had very good links with people "who know how to stir 
things up." 
</P>
<P>
 "We realize that from a public relations standpoint, no matter what we did, it 
would be a disaster," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the 39 anti-Communist adults have now been returned to Vietnam against 
their will, one bound and gagged, under a Hong Kong government program to 
deport Vietnamese not granted refugee status. 
</P>
<P>
 Refugee lawyers here continue to battle the U.N. agency over the status of the 
remaining 37 members of the group, who fear persecution in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Many human rights advocates say the agency's role began to change in 1988, 
when the Hong Kong government decreed that new Vietnamese arrivals would be 
considered non-refugees and would not be allowed to resettle unless they could 
prove that they were fleeing political persecution. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. agency began last year to put more pressure on refugees, announcing 
that repatriation grants of $360 per person would be cut to $240 for anyone who 
did not volunteer to return to Vietnam by Nov. 1, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Adult education and vocational classes in the camps were canceled, and 
opportunities for Vietnamese to earn money by helping to administer the camps 
were cut back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the problem with the UNHCR is that we bring the Vietnamese the kind 
of information they don't want to hear, and obviously they don't like that," 
Assadi said. "They also have the misconception that we are somehow involved in 
their deportation, when in fact our program is voluntary." 
</P>
<P>
 But rights advocates question whether the agency is doing anything more than 
cleaning up and clearing out.  
</P>
<P>
 "The UNHCR is supposed to serve as a safety net," Darwyne said. "But they've 
changed from protector of the Vietnamese to betrayer."

S. AFRICA VIOLENCE EBBS; 95% VOTER TURNOUT PREDICTED; ELECTIONS: ATTACKS 
DECLINE SHARPLY BETWEEN MEMBERS OF ANC AND ZULU INKATHA FREEDOM PARTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB DROGIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As reports of pre-election violence and intimidation plummeted nationwide, 
senior political leaders Thursday predicted a 95% turnout when the country's 
long-disenfranchised black majority goes to the polls for the first time next 
week.  
</P>
<P>
 The falloff in attacks, especially between rival members of the African 
National Congress and the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party, followed the 
dramatic decision Tuesday by Inkatha's chairman, Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha 
Buthelezi, finally to join the country's first all-race elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of the violence, leaders of the two parties blasted each other's 
policies in a bitter battle of words -- and a high-tech, high-altitude campaign 
ploy. 
</P>
<P>
 Cyril Ramaphosa, the ANC secretary general, said the vastly improved political 
climate, especially in battle-racked Natal province, proved that Inkatha had 
been "using our people as cannon fodder" in what he called "a sinister 
strategy" to achieve their goals "at all costs." 
</P>
<P>
 "They put the whole country in jeopardy," he told a news conference here. 
"They stand disgraced in front of the whole nation." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Buthelezi appeared earlier at his first official campaign rally 
and blasted the ANC for its longtime alliance with the Communist Party. He 
warned that Communists in the ANC are seeking "central government tyranny" to 
achieve "dictatorial Communist rule." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Communists in the ANC want a central government so they can embark on 
their program of nationalization and the redistribution of wealth directly 
after the election," Buthelezi told about 12,000 people in Enseleni township, 
according to the South African Press Assn.  
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before he spoke, however, a small plane repeatedly circled the sports 
field and showered the crowd with thousands of ANC leaflets. Many of the Zulus, 
who came armed with sticks and spears, tore the leaflets up. 
</P>
<P>
 ANC officials have repeatedly denied allegations that they will nationalize 
industries if, as expected, they win a landslide victory in the elections 
Tuesday through Thursday and Nelson Mandela becomes the country's first black 
president.  
</P>
<P>
 Inkatha has begun campaigning with a vengeance in Natal. It has run radio and 
newspaper advertisements and hung long-stored posters that show a smiling 
Buthelezi and a logo, "When the Time Comes!" Some posters have now been hastily 
amended with stickers that read, "The Time Has Come!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Our supporters are utterly, utterly ecstatic," Peter Smith, spokesman for 
Inkatha in Durban, said in a telephone interview. "You've never seen such 
jubilation, and such a sense of victory." 
</P>
<P>
 A palpable sense of relief has swept the whole nation since Tuesday, with 
nervous financial markets rallying and radio talk shows suddenly filled with 
voices of enthusiasm and hope for a peaceful election after so many tense 
months of uncertainty and fear. 
</P>
<P>
 Soaring political violence claimed more than 552 victims last month, more than 
double February's toll, according to the Human Rights Commission, an 
independent monitoring group. More than half those killed were in bitterly 
divided Zulu townships and villages in the Zulu homeland of KwaZulu and 
surrounding Natal province. 
</P>
<P>
 So far this month, 341 people have been killed, including 269 in KwaZulu and 
Natal after a province-wide state of emergency took effect April 1. Although 
the emergency remains in effect, the carnage has been sharply curbed in the 
last two days, with three deaths reported in Natal on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yesterday and today have been very, very quiet," said Patrick Kelly, national 
director of the commission. "We're hoping and praying it stays quiet."  
</P>
<P>
 The major exception was a pre-dawn bomb blast that ripped through a regional 
office of the Independent Electoral Commission in Hoopstad, a conservative 
white farming town in the Orange Free State. There were no injuries, but it was 
the first direct attack on the IEC, the independent group that is overseeing 
the election, since the campaign began.  
</P>

 Judge Johann Kriegler, the IEC chairman, said millions of ballots were already 
being shipped to warehouses for distribution to about 9,000 polling stations, 
including 1,475 in Natal. He said Inkatha's participation "quite clearly . . . 
enhances the prospect of our being able to declare the election substantially 
free and fair."

 Both Ramaphosa and Roelf Meyer, the constitutional development minister in the 
ruling National Party government, predicted that at least 95% of the eligible 
22.7 million voters will cast ballots in national and nine provincial 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
 With 19 parties on the national ballots and a total of 27 registered for the 
provincial ballots, the only major group still outside the election process is 
the ever-shrinking, pro-apartheid Conservative Party, which on Thursday 
reaffirmed its decision to boycott the polls and follow the "route of 
resistance" to achieve an all-white independent state.

SINGAPORE SENTENCES HONG KONG TEEN-AGER TO 12 CANING STROKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES P. WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 As the Singapore government deliberated the fate of an American youth 
sentenced to a flogging for vandalism, a Hong Kong teen-ager was sentenced 
Thursday to twice the punishment, 12 strokes of a rattan cane, for his role in 
the spray-painting case. 
</P>
<P>
 Shiu Chi Ho, a 17-year-old 10th-grader, was also sentenced to eight months in 
jail and a $967 fine after being convicted of four counts of vandalism. His 
lawyer said he would appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 An international controversy erupted when the 18-year-old American, Michael P. 
Fay, of Dayton, Ohio, was sentenced last month to six strokes of the cane, four 
months in jail and a $2,230 fine in the vandalism case. 
</P>
<P>
 Fay received the lesser sentence in a plea bargain with prosecutors in which 
56 charges were consolidated into two counts of vandalism, two counts of 
mischief and one count of possessing stolen property. Shiu, on the other hand, 
proclaimed his innocence and went to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The caning is carried out by a prison official trained in martial arts and 
often induces shock. It can cause permanent scarring. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton has termed the sentence given Fay as "extreme," and the 
State Department filed a formal diplomatic protest, saying that while Fay will 
be permanently scarred by the caning, the cars were not permanently damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Fay appealed his caning sentence, but the island nation's high court turned 
him down March 31. On Wednesday, he petitioned President Ong Teng Cheong for 
clemency. A spokeswoman for the president said Thursday that no decision had 
been reached on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. government and others maintain that the teen-agers were singled out 
for special treatment because the vandalism statute, which was enacted in the 
1960s to combat political graffiti on public buildings, never before has been 
used in cases of spray-painting private cars. The Ministry of Home Affairs said 
Tuesday that such arguments are "absurd." 
</P>
<P>
 However, a photograph appeared in the government-controlled Straits Times 
newspaper Thursday showing a newly spray-painted car. It quoted police as 
saying that the new case had been classified as mischief, a lesser offense than 
vandalism that has no provisions for caning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in a state of shock, this is just unbelievable," said Randy Chan, Fay's 
mother. "It proves a big point: that this has been unfair. (The caning) is not 
what's normally done here." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hong Kong teen-ager was at the center of the vandalism case because he was 
among the first two youngsters arrested by police, who had been on a stakeout 
for vandals. He was with the son of a Thai diplomat, who had diplomatic 
immunity and was released. 
</P>
<P>
 Shiu gave police the names of eight other youths, who were later arrested at 
their high schools. They included Fay, two Malaysians and another American, who 
is going to court next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Shiu maintained at his trial that his confession had been coerced by police 
who had punched and slapped him. Fay has made similar charges in a letter to 
his father in Dayton. 
</P>
<P>
 Shiu's parents are celebrities in Singapore: His father, Shiu Chung On, is 
drama director for the state-run Singapore Broadcasting Corp. and his mother is 
an actress. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the vandalism charges on which he was convicted Thursday, Shiu 
faces a further 38 counts of vandalism and mischief.

SUSPECTED ULSTER TERRORIST HILL CLEARED AFTER 20 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Paul Hill, one of the "Guildford Four" whose story is recounted in the movie 
"In the Name of the Father," was freed Thursday by an appeals court in Belfast, 
Northern Ireland, which quashed his conviction for the murder of an ex-British 
soldier 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Belfast-born Hill, 39, is an Irish republican sympathizer who is married 
to Courtney Kennedy, a daughter of the late Sen. Robert Kennedy. As he sat in 
the courtroom listening to the reading of the 42-page judgment that freed him, 
Hill was accompanied by his wife, her mother, Ethel, and a family cousin, 
Father Michael Kennedy. The Kennedy family had worked vigorously for his 
exoneration. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill had been arrested by police in the southern English county of Surrey in 
November, 1974, in the Irish Republican Army bombing of pubs in the city of 
Guildford and London district of Woolwich. Under interrogation, he confessed to 
the IRA killing of the ex-soldier, Brian Shaw, four months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the appeals court declared the confession inadmissible because it 
had been taken under duress. A police witness had testified that a fellow 
interrogator had pointed an empty pistol at Hill during questioning and pulled 
the trigger -- an act that Northern Ireland Chief Justice Brian Hutton called 
"a disgraceful and grossly improper action which clearly constituted inhuman 
treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 The court quashed the conviction because, it said, the only evidence against 
him was his confession and that was tainted. But the court also said Hill had 
lied about some aspects of the case.  
</P>
<P>
 It was the second case involving Hill's mistreatment by British law 
enforcement officials. Hill served 15 years in prison for the 
Guildford-Woolwich bombings before his release in 1989, the result of a long 
international campaign proclaiming his innocence. His three co-defendants also 
were freed because of tainted testimony during their arrest and trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The Guildford case raised serious questions about British police interrogation 
methods and the justice system's handling of alleged IRA offenses, especially 
in the emotional atmosphere of a bombing campaign that took 29 lives in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 After listening to the judgment freeing him, Hill said Thursday: "I want to 
live a normal life now. I've been in limbo for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw's widow, Maureen Hall, said she was disappointed with the verdict. She 
said the "Kennedy circus" had put pressure on the judges to rule in Hill's 
favor.

N. KOREA OFFERS PEEK AT NUCLEAR EFFORT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 North Korea on Thursday offered the world a look at key evidence in a dispute 
over its alleged secret atomic bomb project, inviting U.N. experts to watch as 
its main nuclear reactor is refueled. 
</P>
<P>
 International Atomic Energy Agency spokesman David Kyd said inspection of the 
Yongbyon reactor's exhausted fuel core is vital to try to clear up allegations 
that Pyongyang is developing nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the U.N. agency responded positively to the new North Korean offer 
and, provided other elements of a fresh IAEA inspection could be agreed upon, a 
new expert mission would leave for Yongbyon next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The presence of inspectors is necessary "to verify that there has been no 
diversion of nuclear materials," Kyd said. He cautioned that final, complete 
details of the new offer still must be settled.

GORE LABELS GLOBAL WARMING AS TOP PERIL; ENVIRONMENT: THE VICE PRESIDENT MARKS 
THE 24TH EARTH DAY ANNIVERSARY BY COMPARING THOSE SKEPTICAL OF THE CLIMATE 
CHANGE TO TOBACCO INDUSTRY LEADERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Vice President Al Gore, marking the 24th anniversary of Earth Day, Thursday 
called the threat of global warming "the most serious problem our civilization 
faces" and likened skeptics to leaders of the embattled tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "On one side there's a vast preponderance of serious scientists who have 
studied the evidence, and on the other hand we have a tiny minority of the 
self-interested who say, 'We just don't know,' " Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore's comments were aimed at a vocal community of those who challenge 
scientists' assertions that the buildup of carbon gases in the atmosphere will 
lead to a warming of Earth's surface, with dramatic disruptions in weather 
conditions, agricultural production and sea levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Like tobacco industry executives who have said there is no conclusive evidence 
that smoking can cause lung cancer, he said that many U.S. industrialists are 
warning that science has not proved that the accumulation of carbon gases will 
lead to the feared "global warming" effects. With many such industrialists in 
his audience, Gore scoffed that "there was a time earlier in (the tobacco) 
debate when some people actually believed" the tobacco industry's denials. 
</P>
<P>
 The vice president's speech underscored the White House's challenge as it 
seeks to carry out President Clinton's promise to reduce the nation's emissions 
of greenhouse gases. In addition to skeptics resistant to making those 
reductions, the pace and urgency of the Administration's proposed solutions are 
frustrating environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 While Gore slammed the skeptics Thursday, the President gently chided 
environmentalists, telling an Earth Day gathering in the capital that 
"government should encourage people to work together, not pit business and 
workers and environmentalists against each other." 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's comments came a day after the Energy Department signed an 
accord with more than 600 members of the Electric Utility Industry to reduce 
greenhouse gases. Under the memorandum of understanding, utilities voluntarily 
would adopt a variety of measures designed to reduce their release of carbon 
gases. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists have attacked the agreement -- and the Administration's 
efforts to draw industries into "partnerships" with government to achieve its 
environmental goals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sierra Club, for instance, charged Thursday that the Administration's 
proposal for reducing greenhouse gases -- announced last fall -- will fail to 
stabilize those emissions at the 1990 level, as Clinton promised. The United 
States would have to cut 139 million metric tons of carbon emissions to meet 
its goals, but the plan Clinton has laid out will reduce those emissions by 
only about half of that, a Sierra Club analysis warned. 
</P>
<P>
 "This plan bows to polluters but merely doffs its hat to the global warming 
problem," Sierra Club analyst Daniel Becker said. "It's good for polluter 
public relations but doesn't do much for the planet." 
</P>
<P>
 In response to such charges, Gore held out an olive branch to environmental 
groups, declaring that they are playing a crucial role in holding the 
Administration to its promises. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need you; we need you," Gore said. "Keep it up." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Gore cited not only scientists, but also a study from the 
Travelers Corp. insurance company that said even a modest 0.9-degree Fahrenheit 
increase in average global temperature by 2010 could extend the hurricane 
season by 20 days, cause a 33% jump in hurricane landfalls in the United 
States, increase storms' severity and cause a 30% annual rise in catastrophic 
U.S. losses from storms.

JURY ORDERS TV EVANGELIST TO PAY $1.5 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Television evangelist Robert Tilton, who preached prosperity through faith, 
defrauded a couple by misusing their donation to his ministry, a jury decided 
Thursday in awarding them $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike and Vivian Elliott of Tampa, Fla., donated $3,500 toward a crisis center, 
but instead it was "nothing more than fuel for Tilton's lavish lifestyle," said 
their lawyer, Gary Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
 The Elliotts were awarded $500,000 in actual damages and $1 million in 
punitive damages in their lawsuit against Tilton, his former wife, Marte, and 
the Word of Faith World Outreach Center Church in suburban Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 Tilton's attorney, Rhonda Johnson Byrd, argued that the Elliotts were never 
promised that the donations would be used for a crisis center. She said 
religious faith itself was on trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "God inspired Rev. Tilton" to write to his viewers, she told jurors. "It is 
not for you to decide whether that inspiration came from God. That would be 
invading the First Amendment." 
</P>
<P>
 The Elliotts accused Tilton of fraud and breach of contract. They also said 
Tilton's television show improperly credited the preacher with dissuading 
Vivian Elliott from suicide.

PRESSURE BUILDS IN CONGRESS FOR U.S. TO LIFT ARMS EMBARGO ON BOSNIA; BALKANS: 
DAYLONG DEBATE IN SENATE PITS CALL FOR UNILATERAL ACTION AGAINST THOSE WHO WANT 
NATO'S SUPPORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Momentum built quickly in Congress on Thursday for lifting the arms embargo on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, with many lawmakers calling on President Clinton to break 
with the United Nations and take unilateral steps to arm the embattled forces 
of the Bosnian government. 
</P>
<P>
 During an impassioned daylong debate in the Senate, major divisions emerged 
between lawmakers who want Clinton to lift the U.N.-imposed embargo immediately 
and unilaterally and those who, like Clinton, said it should be lifted only if 
the NATO allies agree. 
</P>
<P>
 A bipartisan group of senators led by Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) 
introduced legislation instructing Clinton to end U.S. compliance with the arms 
embargo imposed in 1991 on all the fighting factions in the former Yugoslavia. 
The embargo has worked to the advantage of the Bosnian Serbs because they 
obtain arms from Serbia, which took possession of most Yugoslav army weapons 
when the country dissolved. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Congress remained deeply divided over Clinton's proposals 
for new allied air strikes. Some lawmakers said the proposals did not go far 
enough, while others warned that the escalation could push the United States 
into a long and possibly disastrous military intervention in Bosnia's bloody 
ethnic strife. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), the influential chairman of the Senate Armed Services 
Committee, said Clinton's decision to press for expanded NATO air strikes moved 
the United States into "a very high risk" position in which the allies must be 
willing to respond forcefully if the Serbs choose to escalate the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to be willing to escalate too . . . escalate all the way to Serbia if 
need be," Nunn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher later rejected for the time being the 
idea of strategic bombing in Serbia itself, but said it "certainly can be 
considered in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher's threat and the language he used earlier in the day in an 
appearance on Capitol Hill referring to Serbian ambitions to create a "greater 
Serbia" through military conquest appear to mark a step up in Administration 
rhetoric to prepare the American people for the likelihood of greater U.S. 
involvement and for American casualties in the Balkan war. 
</P>
<P>
 That effort came as two NATO allies appeared to be backing Clinton's proposal 
for expanded air power. Christopher also said France had lined up in support, 
and German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, in Washington to see Christopher, 
said the proposals were important. "Basically, of course, we support the 
American position," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The arms embargo legislation would be much stronger than the resolution the 
Senate approved 87 to 9 in January urging Clinton to lift the ban. The new 
legislation, if also approved by the House, would require him to do so, but its 
immediate effect would be largely symbolic because it was offered as an 
amendment to a bankruptcy reform bill that has yet to be introduced in the 
House. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there is virtually no chance the legislation will be passed any time 
soon, it would be significant as an expression of congressional sentiment on 
the worsening Bosnia crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Debate over the measure divided the lawmakers who, torn between fears of 
standing by while another Holocaust happens or slipping into another Vietnam, 
could agree on only one point: President Clinton, speaker after speaker said, 
needs to show more leadership and be more forceful in trying to persuade the 
NATO allies to agree to lift the arms embargo for the Bosnians. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Clinton Administration has no idea of what it wants to do or how to do 
it," charged Utah Republican Orrin Hatch. "It has hesitated, vacillated and 
equivocated." He said Clinton must "step up to the mark . . . and lift the 
embargo now because the moment is right." 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing will change," added Dole, "unless America takes the lead." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, in announcing his intention to push for expanded NATO military action 
in Bosnia, said Wednesday that he would like to lift the embargo but would not 
unilaterally begin supplying arms to the Bosnian Muslims because doing so would 
could undermine international compliance with other embargoes against outlaw 
states. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we ignore a United Nations embargo because we think it has no moral basis, 
or even any legal validity, but everyone else feels contrary, then what is to 
stop our United Nations allies from ignoring embargoes that we like, such as 
the embargo against Saddam Hussein?" Clinton asked. 
</P>
<P>
 While saying they also supported the lifting of the embargo, leading Democrats 
came to Clinton's defense by arguing that Dole's amendment is ill-timed and 
could undercut the President's position in critical negotiations with the NATO 
allies over the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we lift the embargo today, they (the Serbs) will do everything they can" 
to overrun more Bosnian territory before "the arms can be delivered" to the 
Muslims, warned Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) 
</P>
<P>
 But it was also clear from their comments that even some of the President's 
defenders seemed to harbor doubts about his handling of the Bosnian crisis so 
far. 
</P>
<P>
 Nunn, who said he had not yet decided whether to vote for Dole's amendment, 
voiced concern at what he suggested was the Administration's apparent lack of a 
military strategy for Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Air strikes alone, even if we escalate, are not enough," he said. "Once we 
start, it is not enough to take step one. . . . We have to think through steps 
two, three, four and five with our allies. There has to be a strategy, not 
simply a tactical move." 
</P>
<P>
 The criticism from the Bosnia hawks and doves showed how much work the 
Administration has to do at home in selling its Bosnia policy. It also 
reflected a deeper concern that by piecemeal actions, the United States is 
sliding into the Bosnian morass, with even the fiercest congressional hawks 
saying they support arming the Bosnians.

 A fire raging across the largest of the Galapagos islands has destroyed 15,000 
acres of woodland and threatens to overrun a colony of 6,000 rare giant 
tortoises within days, Ecuadorean officials said. Jorge Ribadeneira, a navy 
captain at Isabela Island, said the fire, which erupted 10 days ago, may have 
already destroyed some rare wildlife and was moving quickly toward the 
tortoises. "Efforts to control the blaze are being complicated by the speed at 
which the fire is moving," he said.

RWANDA DEATH TOLL PUT AT 100,000; AFRICA: UNABLE TO HALT THE BLOODSHED, U.N. 
SECURITY COUNCIL DECIDES TO PULL ITS PEACEKEEPING FORCE OUT OF THE COUNTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The International Committee of the Red Cross said Thursday that more than 
100,000 Rwandans may have been killed in the last two weeks of ethnic slaughter 
and called it a "human tragedy on a scale we have rarely witnessed." 
</P>
<P>
 Powerless to halt the bloodshed, the Security Council decided late Thursday to 
pull the 1,700-member U.N. peacekeeping force out of the country, except for 
about 270 security guards and military observers. 
</P>
<P>
 In a bleak report before the unanimous vote, U.N. Secretary General Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali wrote: "There is no prospect of a cease-fire being agreed upon in 
the coming days." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the 1,705 U.N. peacekeepers now there should either be reinforced by 
thousands more and authorized to coerce the combatants into a cease-fire, or be 
mostly withdrawn. He advised against a complete withdrawal, saying that would 
cause further bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. members are reluctant to provide troops for another operation like 
Somalia, where the United Nations came to be regarded as a hostile force. 
</P>
<P>
 Those remaining from the U.N. mission to Rwanda would remain in Kigali, the 
capital, to try to arrange at least a temporary cease-fire and the resumption 
of limited humanitarian relief operations, Boutros-Ghali said. 
</P>
<P>
 At least half a million people have fled their homes in the central African 
nation since fighting between the Hutus and the Tutsi broke out two weeks ago. 
But fewer than 20,000 have crossed into neighboring countries, their 
traditional sanctuaries in times of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Rwanda's interim government, which is dominated by the majority Hutu ethnic 
group, has put the number of displaced people at 2 million, nearly one-quarter 
of the population. But most aid agencies consider that figure inflated. 
</P>
<P>
 Other aid officials feared the worst. 
</P>
<P>
 Heather Wall, in charge of humanitarian affairs at the Canadian Embassy in 
Nairobi, said the Rwandan army had sealed the country's borders with Burundi, 
Zaire and Tanzania. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Uganda border is open, but the few people arriving there are in very bad 
shape, many of them wounded," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the Tanzanian side, there are reports that people trying to get out have 
been killed by the army," she added. "There are bodies in the river that marks 
the border." 
</P>
<P>
 A similar report of bodies clogging the Rusizi River between Rwanda and Zaire 
came from Catherine Newbury, a professor who specializes in African affairs at 
the University of North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Cavalho of the U.N. Children's Fund said his office had received reports 
of makeshift barricades on many roads manned by either Rwandan soldiers or 
gangs armed with guns, machetes, knives and spears. 
</P>
<P>
 There were also fears that Rwanda is edging closer to a deadly outbreak of 
disease and famine sparked by growing fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 The extent of the slaughter is masked by the absence of U.N. or private aid 
workers in Rwanda's green, rolling countryside. Virtually all foreigners left 
last week. Only a handful, from the Red Cross and the humanitarian agency 
Doctors Without Borders, remain in the capital, where the orgy of violence 
began. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. force's original mission was to provide a buffer between the Rwandan 
army, dominated by ethnic Hutus, and the Tutsi rebels of the Rwandan Patriotic 
Front. The two groups signed a peace accord last August that ended a three-year 
civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 But the truce dissolved when the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi, both Hutus, 
died in a mysterious plane crash April 6. Chaos erupted in Kigali the next day, 
and the army and the rebels went back to war.

KEVORKIAN SOUGHT TO EASE PAIN, HIS LAWYER SAYS AS TRIAL OPENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY PASTERNAK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jack Kevorkian's attorney began his defense in Michigan's first 
assisted-suicide case Thursday by raising two issues, including the surprise 
revelation that the death of a 30-year-old suffering from terminal Lou Gehrig's 
disease took place in another county rather than in the city park where 
Kevorkian surrendered to police. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, attorney Geoffrey N. Fieger told a jury in his opening statement 
that assisting suicide is not banned if the motive was to ease pain and 
suffering rather than to cause death. He contended that Thomas Hyde, who spoke 
with difficulty, could barely move and increasingly had trouble swallowing, 
would find relief only through dying. Kevorkian has admitted supplying carbon 
monoxide, tubing and a face mask to Hyde. 
</P>
<P>
 A subsection of the law states that the ban does not apply "if the intent is 
to relieve pain or discomfort and not to cause death, even if the medication or 
procedure may hasten or increase the risk of death." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not a crime if the only intent is to relieve pain," Fieger said.  
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Timothy Kenny responded that "clearly, they are talking about 
medications and procedures that are experimental. So far, there's nothing to 
indicate that carbon monoxide was in relief of pain."  
</P>
<P>
 Hyde did not die on Belle Isle, a park in the Detroit River, where Kevorkian 
turned himself in, Fieger said. Hyde died in Kevorkian's 1968 Volkswagen van in 
a parking lot behind the retired pathologist's apartment in suburban Oakland 
County, the lawyer said. Only afterward did Kevorkian take the van, with Hyde's 
corpse in the back, to Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, Fieger claimed, the prosecution would not be able to show that 
the crime occurred in Wayne County, where the case is being heard in Detroit 
Recorder's Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Police witnesses concede that they never asked where Hyde died. Police 
Inspector James D. Arthurs grumbled later in a corridor: "I thought this guy 
wanted to confront the law. How come he's ducking and dodging?" 
</P>
<P>
 No matter what the outcome, the issue of assisting suicide for the terminally 
ill will still be open here. The Michigan Court of Appeals is reviewing the 
constitutionality of the ban, which was enacted to keep Kevorkian from 
continuing his work while the Legislature considers whether and how to regulate 
help for suicides. Kevorkian is collecting signatures in hopes of placing an 
amendment to the state constitution on the November ballot.

 A British court charged the wife of accused "House of Horror" serial killer 
Frederick West with the rape of an 11-year-old girl. In the latest twist to the 
gruesome case, Rosemary West, 40, was accused in court jointly with a man 
identified as William Smith of having had sexual intercourse with the girl 
without consent between July, 1974, and July, 1976. Frederick West, a 
52-year-old builder, has been charged with 10 murders after the discovery of 
nine decomposed female bodies at the house he shared with Rosemary, plus 
another set of female remains in a country field.

 Prince Charles has offered a reward for the return of his missing Jack Russell 
terrier, Pooh.Buckingham Palace said the dog was lost Sunday while walking with 
Charles on the queen's Balmoral estate, 50 miles west of Aberdeen. "The Prince 
of Wales apparently went out walking with his two Jack Russell terriers, Pooh 
and Tigger. He took them along the River Dee toward a forest area and it seems 
that Pooh disappeared," said Stuart Fairlie, a journalist at the Aberdeen Press 
and Journal. An advertisement in the paper offering a reward for information 
about Pooh has brought no response, the palace said.

DEATH PENALTY MEASURE SURVIVES HOUSE TEST; CONGRESS: LAWMAKERS BACK RACIAL 
JUSTICE ACT, WHICH ALLOWS USE OF RACIAL STATISTICS TO SHOW BIAS IN EXECUTIONS. 
GOP SAYS IT WILL NULLIFY CAPITAL PUNISHMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The House on Thursday reaffirmed support for the controversial Racial Justice 
Act despite Republican charges that it would effectively nullify the death 
penalty or produce a racial quota system in executions. 
</P>
<P>
 Defenders of the provision, adopted as part of the comprehensive House crime 
bill, argued that it is a modest step intended to overcome lingering racial 
bias in administering the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 A GOP attempt to remove it from the bill was defeated, 235 to 192 -- widening 
the margin from a showdown Wednesday, when opponents lost on a 212-212 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the retention of the provision in the House bill, both supporters and 
opponents predicted that it would not survive a conference committee that will 
be convened to reconcile Senate and House versions of the crime legislation. 
The Senate bill did not include any such provision, and the Senate rejected 
similar proposals last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the House provision, a person sentenced to death could introduce 
statistical evidence to support allegations of racial discrimination in the use 
of the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a defendant could ask a judge to consider evidence that 100% of 
the death sentences in a judicial circuit were imposed on black defendants, 
even though blacks make up only 10% of those convicted of murder. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial judge then would decide, by comparing similar cases, whether the 
allegation had been proved and could either dismiss the claim or, upon a 
finding of racial bias in imposing the death penalty, lower the sentence to 
life imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Bill McCollum (R-Fla.), chief GOP spokesman on the crime bill, argued 
that the provision would stop states from imposing the death penalty by placing 
an impossible burden on prosecutors to demonstrate an absence of racial 
discrimination in procedures for capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't a black-and-white issue," McCollum said, noting that whites 
convicted of murder also might use the process to escape execution. 
</P>
<P>
 McCollum said the National District Attorneys' Assn. opposes the provision. He 
said the language included in the proposal by Rep. Don Edwards (D-San Jose) 
would allow Death Row prisoners to challenge the death sentence retroactively. 
</P>
<P>
 But Edwards and Rep. Jack Brooks (D-Tex.) assured the House that they would 
drop the provision allowing retroactive challenges when the measure reaches the 
conference committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight over the Racial Justice Act brought Speaker Thomas S. Foley 
(D-Wash.) and Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) into the fray. 
Democratic leaders wanted to keep the provision in the final bill, partly to 
persuade members of the Congressional Black Caucus to vote for the legislation 
despite their misgivings about its expansion of federal crimes subject to the 
death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm for the death penalty, but I want the death penalty to be meted out 
fairly," Gephardt said. "This is not about quotas. . . . Some statistics show 
an astounding pattern of discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary 
Committee, lamented the House action, contending that the provision was 
"intended to end the use of the death penalty unless it is imposed on a racial 
quota basis." 
</P>
<P>
 Hatch said President Clinton should speak out against the provision if he 
truly supports expanded use of the federal death penalty.

UNIVERSAL COVERAGE GOAL SURVIVES THE CUTS; CONGRESS: THE VARIOUS COMMITTEES 
THAT WILL EVENTUALLY ISSUE THEIR OWN VERSIONS OF A HEALTH REFORM BILL HAVE NOT 
ABANDONED CLINTON'S CORE OBJECTIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A House Education and Labor subcommittee on Thursday became the second 
congressional panel to begin work on health care reform, but most of the real 
legislative action was taking place elsewhere behind the scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 It is difficult to gauge how that effort is faring, because no fewer than five 
congressional committees will eventually produce their own versions of the 
bill. The House and Senate leadership will then try to meld the bills into 
something both chambers can accept. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the uncertainty, the White House has taken heart that the committees 
are hewing to President Clinton's goal of health coverage for every American -- 
despite polls showing that public enthusiasm for overhauling the health care 
system is waning. 
</P>
<P>
 But most, if not all, of the committees are likely to abandon the bureaucratic 
structure of the Clinton plan, which would require most Americans to join 
government-organized purchasing cooperatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest battles are being fought over three key issues -- whether to 
require employers to buy health coverage for their workers, whether to impose 
government controls on health care costs and what kinds of benefits to 
guarantee every American. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one panel -- the House Ways and Means health subcommittee -- has acted so 
far. It has endorsed a requirement that companies help pay for their workers' 
health coverage, and it would expand the Medicare program to cover the 
remaining uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
 However, subcommittee Chairman Pete Stark (D-Hayward) said Thursday that it is 
far from certain whether the full committee will follow the outlines of the 
subcommittee bill. 
</P>
<P>
 For some committees, such as the generally liberal House Education and Labor 
Committee that began the official work on its draft Thursday, the outcome seems 
preordained. That panel is expected to approve a bill similar to Clinton's 
proposal and another bill that endorses a government-financed health care 
system -- known as "single payer" -- that is modeled after Canada's national 
health system. 
</P>
<P>
 But for other committee chairmen, trying to fashion an agreement among members 
who are splintered according to their philosophical leanings and their regional 
interests, the results are open to question.  
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere are negotiations more delicate than among the largely moderate and 
conservative Democrats of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Chairman 
John D. Dingell (D-Mich.) said Thursday that he was "very close" to the 23 
votes he needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Dingell's proposal, employers of fewer than 10 workers -- almost 80% of 
all businesses -- would not have to pay anything for employee health coverage. 
Businesses of between 10 and 20 workers also could choose not to pay their 
employees' health insurance costs directly, but would be subject to a tax of 1% 
to 2% if they did not. 
</P>
<P>
 The provision marks a significant shift from Clinton's original plan, which 
would require all employers to pay up to 80% of their workers' health costs. 
Government subsidies would ease the burden of small firms that have low-paid 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Jim Slattery (D-Kan.), a crucial uncommitted committee member, said he is 
exploring a dramatically different option, "building on" the latest proposal 
from a group of health experts and business leaders who call themselves the 
Jackson Hole group. That plan would have no employer mandate and does not 
guarantee universal coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Thursday, the subcommittee on labor-management relations of the House 
Education and Labor Committee began considering a bill drafted by chairman Pat 
Williams (D-Mont.). It resembles Clinton's, but offers even more generous 
benefits and reduces the burden on small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams' bill retains the employer mandate, but it would cap the required 
premium contributions by the smallest employers at 2% of payroll instead of 
3.5%, as proposed by Clinton.

CIA'S 'CULT OF PROTECTIVENESS' CRITICIZED; INTELLIGENCE: IN UNUSUAL SLAP, TWO 
LAWMAKERS BLAME AGENCY CHIEF WOOLSEY FOR INSULAR ATTITUDE IN WHICH SECURITY 
THREATS CAN THRIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee complained Thursday that CIA 
Director R. James Woolsey is fostering a "cult of protectiveness" at the agency 
that allows potential security threats to thrive and could impede reforms 
needed in the wake of the Aldrich H. Ames spy case. 
</P>
<P>
 The criticism from Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.) and similar views expressed 
by Rep. Dan Glickman (D-Kan.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, 
represented an unusual slap at the head of an agency whose chief normally 
receives special deference on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 DeConcini, at a breakfast session with reporters, said Woolsey and lesser CIA 
officials have been so loath to share sensitive internal information with the 
FBI that they should be compelled to do so by legislation. The FBI, by law, is 
charged with conducting counterintelligence investigations -- those aimed at 
rooting out U.S. moles. 
</P>
<P>
 A CIA spokesman declined comment, saying: "We're not responding to the 
retiring chairman," a reference to DeConcini, who is retiring at the end of 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Glickman, in an interview, said of the CIA: "The cult over this is very 
protective, very collegial. There's a reluctance to share anything with 
anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Of Woolsey, Glickman said: "He's not particularly bold. . . . He's more 
reactive than I would have liked." 
</P>
<P>
 As investigations into the spy scandal continue, the criticisms demonstrate 
that Woolsey has not succeeded in erasing doubts about his handling of security 
problems, and that Congress will try to legislate reforms at the agency.  
</P>
<P>
 The Administration is considering an executive order or a legislative proposal 
of its own to strengthen the FBI's role in handling counterintelligence 
failures at the CIA, The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
 The order, if issued, would put teeth into an earlier memorandum of 
understanding between the FBI and CIA under which the intelligence agency is to 
notify the bureau when it discovers a counterintelligence breach and would 
assign FBI agents to the CIA's counterintelligence unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is that the CIA has an intelligence mentality and doesn't look 
for criminal leads," said an Administration source familiar with the issue. "A 
mechanism is needed that forces the agency to alert the FBI." 
</P>
<P>
 Legislation introduced by DeConcini would require CIA officials to share all 
counterintelligence data with the FBI, making the failure to do so a felony. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest problem in counterespionage is that the FBI doesn't have access 
to all the CIA information they need," DeConcini said. "You can't have a law 
enforcement agency charged with this task that doesn't have access to the 
files. 
</P>
<P>
 "One problem is the CIA culture of deniability -- their tendency to deny that 
they're doing anything. There's a cult of protectiveness, and it runs counter 
to any external review of their operations. You need a legislative fix or it 
(cooperation with the FBI) isn't going to work." 
</P>
<P>
 DeConcini said that FBI Director Louis J. Freeh told him the FBI has had 
"unprecedented cooperation" with the CIA in recent years. "But when we pressed 
the issue more closely, we found they (the FBI) had been denied information 10 
to 12 times," he said.

SENATE SENDS CLINTON APPRENTICESHIP BILL; EDUCATION: NATION'S FIRST 
'SCHOOL-TO-WORK' PLAN WILL LET STUDENTS TRAIN IN INDUSTRIES WHILE ATTENDING 
CLASSES PART TIME. PROGRAMS WOULD BE RUN BY THE STATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Senate voted final passage Thursday of landmark legislation to train high 
school students to enter the American work force -- the first national 
apprenticeship or "school-to-work" system in the nation's history. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, which the House approved Wednesday and which now goes to President 
Clinton for his signature, is considered an integral part of the 
Administration's agenda for revising education and job training. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are on the verge of accomplishing something that will make a difference in 
thousands of young lives across this nation, and . . . our economic future," 
said Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.), the bill's chief sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
 The School-to-Work Opportunities Act, which the Senate approved on a voice 
vote, would launch a national system for young people to work as apprentices in 
industries while attending school part time. The students would eventually 
receive high school diplomas and certificates of competency in their chosen 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
 It also represents a change toward greater partnership between the federal 
government and business in regard to education. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventy-five percent of American young people do not complete a four-year 
college program, and the United States is one of the few major industrialized 
nations that lacks a "school-to-work" system for them. Japan, for instance, 
offers training to roughly 90% of its non-college graduates. 
</P>
<P>
 The shape of the U.S. apprenticeship system remains undetermined. The programs 
would be designed and operated by each state, in cooperation with area schools, 
businesses and community and labor leaders. The federal government would 
oversee the program and provide some funding in the shape of federal grants. 
</P>
<P>
 The act calls for spending $300 million for fiscal year 1995 and "such sums as 
may be necessary" through 1999. But most sources said it seemed unlikely that 
the bill would be fully funded because of federal budget constraints. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate sources suggested that the actual funding would fall between 30% and 
75% of the total. They noted, however, that the Administration is particularly 
committed to the bill and said the funding outlook probably will be better in 
the second and third years.  
</P>
<P>
 Some critics have derided the Administration's education agenda as lacking 
substance because it relies too much on the ingenuity and commitment of states 
to design and operate the programs. 
</P>
<P>
 But Simon has called the bill a solid beginning after what has been more than 
a decade of debate on the issue. And Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), the 
floor leader for the bill, has called it a down-payment on real change. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill addresses one of the most vulnerable parts of the nation's economy. 
Between 1975 and 1989, the Administration points out, salaries of people under 
25 who had only high school diplomas dropped by 40% after accounting for 
inflation, and wages for high school dropouts suffered even more. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor Department statistics suggest that by age 30, only one-third of the 
nation's working adults have been in their jobs for more than a year.

JUSTICE DEPT. REPLIES TO CRITICISM OF ITS ROLE IN ROCKY FLATS A-PLANT CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Justice Department on Thursday issued a rebuttal to congressional 
criticism of its handling of the 1989 investigation of environmental and safety 
problems at the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons complex. 
</P>
<P>
 The operator of the Colorado plant, Rockwell International Corp., paid an 
$18.5-million fine, the largest hazardous waste fine in history, in 1992 after 
pleading guilty to 10 hazardous waste and clean water violations. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case was not handled perfectly in the sense that any case of this nature 
with complicated investigatory and institutional issues is likely to have 
difficulties," said a report issued by the department. "None of these factors, 
however, was related to institutional breakdowns or improper political or 
personal influences." 
</P>
<P>
 The report serves as a response to criticism of the case by the investigation 
subcommittee of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, headed at 
the time by former Rep. Howard Wolpe (D-Mich.), which claimed that the plea 
agreement was too lenient. The Justice Department report said the agreement 
reflected "an appropriate exercise of prosecutorial discretion." 
</P>
<P>
 Wolpe, who left Congress and is now running for governor in Michigan, said: 
"My reaction is: What would you expect?" 
</P>
<P>
 The case attracted wide attention when a grand jury tried to issue a report 
that was more critical of Rockwell and the Energy Department than the 
prosecutors would endorse.

BLOOD TESTS FAVORED OVER AMNIOCENTESIS; MEDICINE: STUDY OF PREGNANT WOMEN OVER 
35 SUGGESTS THAT ALTERNATIVE SCREENING FOR DOWN'S SYNDROME IS SAFER. IT COULD 
SAVE $250 MILLION A YEAR.

<P>
 A new study of pregnant women over age 35 suggests that simple blood tests are 
safer than amniocentesis, a test widely used to screen fetuses for Down's 
syndrome, and could save $250 million a year in medical costs. 
</P>
<P>
 A research team from the Foundation for Blood Research in Scarborough, Maine, 
and the California Public Health Foundation in Berkeley has reported that 
screening based on the blood tests diagnosed 89% of Down's cases in mothers 
over age 35, compared with almost 100% caught by amniocentesis. Nationally, 
this means that women screened with blood tests would bear an additional 320 
Down's syndrome babies each year, according to an editorial accompanying the 
study in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 But the study also indicates that 14,000 amniocentesis-linked miscarriages of 
healthy fetuses might be avoided by using the blood tests, the editorial noted, 
and up to $250 million might be saved annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Those estimates assume that the blood tests would be given first, with 
amniocentesis given later to women shown to have at least a 1 in 200 chance of 
having a Down's syndrome baby. About 25% of the over-35 women given blood tests 
would fall into that risk category and would need the second test, the 
researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Amniocentesis is routinely recommended for pregnant women over 35 because the 
risk of having a Down's syndrome baby rises with the mother's age. The overall 
risk is one in 700, but it rises to one in 270 for mothers at age 35 and one in 
40 for women at age 40. 
</P>
<P>
 In amniocentesis, a needle is inserted through the woman's abdomen to withdraw 
amniotic fluid containing fetal cells from the uterus. Analysis of fetal 
chromosomes can detect fetuses that inherit an extra copy of chromosome 21, 
causing retarded mental and physical development. 
</P>
<P>
 An alternative is a technique called chorionic villus sampling, in which a 
catheter is inserted to gather cells from the placenta. Both sampling 
procedures carry a small risk of causing miscarriage. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past 10 years, new tests based on blood sampling to measure three 
substances -- alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin and unconjugated 
estriol -- have come into use for identifying fetal Down's syndrome. The blood 
tests are not believed to create any risk of miscarriage. 
</P>
<P>
 The safety of blood testing, plus the expense of amniocentesis, "made a 
compelling case that biochemical screening might prove useful for women 35 
years of age or older," said Dr. James Haddow of the Foundation for Blood 
Research. 
</P>
<P>
 The average cost of counseling, amniocentesis and chromosome-counting is about 
$1,000 in the United States. In contrast, the blood tests cost about $75.

DRIVER WITH A GUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * April 13, I joined the millions of L.A. commuters and inched my way home on 
the Harbor Freeway. About halfway home traffic was breezing along about 50 for 
a delightful change.Then a guy in a beat-up car in the lane next to me and 
slightly ahead of me suddenly rolled down his window and held out a gun. I 
slowed down, gave him a good lead and he pulled the gun in. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently everyone around me saw the act too for none of them passed me and I 
was going about 20 m.p.h. Then he pulled out the gun again and fired six shots 
in the air. The cars in front of him panicked and swerved all over the place; 
amazingly there was no accident. We were like a living body that parted 
momentarily to let a wound drain its pus, then sent in its white cells to 
commence healing -- only the joke's on us, we're not healing.

FUTURE SHOCK; POWER MARKET 2002: DEREGULATED, DIVERSE, DYNAMIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 It's fairly clear how heavy industry will take advantage of the post- monopoly 
market for electricity that the Public Utilities Commission said this week it 
plans to establish in California. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is far from certain how small businesses and residential customers will 
shop for electricity in 1999 and 2002, respectively, when they join the system. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter how smart we are, we don't know how the market will develop," PUC 
Commissioner P. Gregory Conlon said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 If the commission formally adopts its proposal following public hearings this 
summer, experts say, the details will begin to come into focus. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the likely sellers in the deregulated retail market for big industrial 
customers -- which would begin in 1996 under the PUC plan outlined Wednesday -- 
are already around, thanks to the existence of a lively wholesale market for 
power in the western United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are very sophisticated markets that act at the wholesale level," said 
John E. Bryson, chairman and chief executive of Southern California Edison Co. 
and its parent, SCEcorp. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison and the state's other investor-owned utilities are active in that 
market, which trades power across the interconnected transmission lines known 
as the Western Grid. 
</P>
<P>
 With the PUC's proposal to end local utilities' monopoly on the sale of 
electricity within their geographic turf, out-of-area utilities, municipal 
utilities such as the Los Angeles Department of Water & Power and other 
producers could market their electricity directly to big power users. They 
would then pay Edison or another local utility to deliver it through the grid 
to the customer. 
</P>
<P>
 The new suppliers will be a diverse lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Investor-owned utilities in Arizona, which have a glut of generating capacity, 
could compete with Edison for its customers. So could some big industrial 
companies in Southern California who have built co-generation facilities: They 
could sell some of the cheap electricity they make from the waste heat of their 
industrial processes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even wind-power generators -- which have made great strides with more 
efficient technology and claim to be competitive now with utility-produced 
power -- could be players. Edison recently signed a substantial deal to buy 
power from San Francisco-based wind-power producer Kenetech Corp. Such 
independent producers are expected to jump into direct marketing with the 
coming of deregulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts expect investor groups to build new power plants just across the 
Nevada and Arizona borders, where environmental rules may be less restrictive 
but where the plants can easily be connected to the grid. 
</P>
<P>
 And the parent companies of California's big utilities all have their own 
non-regulated power-generation companies, which most likely will be aggressive 
contenders in the post-1996 open market. 
</P>
<P>
 Envisioning a competitive market for small-business and residential customers 
is a more speculative venture. 
</P>
<P>
 One likely method, according to Conlon, would mirror a brokering system 
already in use to bring cheaper power to natural gas utility customers, 
including customers of Southern California Gas Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, Gas Co. marketers shop for the cheapest gas to sell to groups of 
small businesses or groups of homeowners -- as in retirement communities or 
condominiums. Similarly, electricity customers might buy power through private 
brokers and marketers who in turn would purchase big blocks of power directly 
from generators. 
</P>
<P>
 A resident might sign up for a year's worth of electricity through a 
particular broker, then shop again for a lower price the next season -- 
something like buying an annual homeowners insurance policy through an 
independent broker. Contracts also could be set up to allow rates to follow the 
larger electricity market, like an adjustable-rate mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 Larger businesses might solicit bids directly from both utilities and 
independents. 
</P>
<P>
 "A company like Safeway," Conlon said, "might go out for bids from six 
utilities and more independents. They would probably get 10 or 20 bids."

UC ECONOMIST SEEN AS CLINTON CHOICE FOR FED; ECONOMY: BERKELEY SCHOLAR JANET L. 
YELLEN IS DESCRIBED AS SOFT-SPOKEN, UNPRETENTIOUS AND HIGHLY RESPECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN PETERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton is expected to pick Janet L. Yellen, a soft-spoken, UC 
Berkeley economist whose interests range from the behavior of youth gangs to 
labor markets, to fill one of two vacancies on the Federal Reserve Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Her nomination could come by the end of next week, sources said Thursday. 
Yellen was traveling in Connecticut and could not be reached for comment.  
</P>
<P>
 Yellen, 47, has worked as a Fed economist and taught at Harvard, the London 
School of Economics and the University of California, Berkeley, where she is a 
professor of business administration. She and her husband live in Berkeley with 
their 12-year-old son, Robert. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not easy to pigeon-hole her," said Andrew K. Rose, a Berkeley colleague 
who has collaborated with Yellen on papers about Germany and other topics. "She 
has enormously broad interests." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the Brooklyn-born academic is viewed more as a liberal thinker, 
concerned with unemployment, than a conservative "inflation hawk." She is a 
protege of Yale economist James Tobin, who has criticized recent interest rate 
hikes by the Fed. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Yellen's colleagues, worried that fervent, anti-inflation advocates 
might be uncomfortable with her, sought to allay their fears: "People should 
not assume from her writings that they know what kind of policy advice she 
would give in a different context and at a different time," said the colleague, 
who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least some observers wondered whether the well-liked professor, known 
to stroll through Berkeley in khaki pants and maroon sweaters, is the most 
appropriate choice at a time when inflation anxieties are rocking the financial 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a recession, Yellen would be a great choice, but on the verge of an 
overheating, it may not be the best choice," Rudiger Dornbusch, an economist at 
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told Reuters.  
</P>
<P>
 The Fed has raised short-term interest rates three times this year in a bid to 
head off inflation -- and fears of inflation -- sparked by the growing economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The two Fed vacancies give the White House a limited chance to modify the 
central bank's priorities in favor of more growth. Alan Blinder, a Princeton 
University professor who is No. 2 at the White House Council of Economic 
Advisers, is likely to be nominated for the post of vice chairman. Both 
appointments require Senate approval. 
</P>
<P>
 A Berkeley colleague described Yellen as highly respected and unpretentious. 
Her casual tastes are echoed by those of her husband and scholarly 
collaborator, George Akerlof, a leading economist who is also on the Berkeley 
faculty. 
</P>
<P>
 "George and Janet walk around wearing virtually identical clothes," Rose said. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Yellen, twice named teacher of the year at Berkeley's Haas School of Business, 
is not an aggressive "Wall Street type" but rather "a sweet, nice person who's 
great at forming a consensus," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can have disproportionate influence if you can persuade people through 
your personal style and the force of your intellectual arguments," Rose said. 
"I think she'll be very effective at that." 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials, concerned that the recent surge in interest rates could 
jeopardize the economic recovery, said Thursday that inflation is not a 
significant danger. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief White House economist Laura D'Andrea Tyson said the extraordinary 7% 
growth rate gauged in the last quarter of 1993 was magnified by onetime events, 
such as rebuilding of farm inventories after the Midwest flood. 
</P>
<P>
 The true, underlying growth rate for the three-month period was a more 
moderate 4%, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Tyson, who also taught at Berkeley, Yellen believes federal policy can 
rectify some of the undesired consequences of a free market, such as 
joblessness or pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Yellen and her husband wrote in 1991 that the problems of eastern 
Germany required dramatic government intervention, notably large wage subsidies 
and major infrastructure investment.

SHAKEN TO ITS FOUNDATION; 20TH CENTURY QUAKE LOSSES RAISE QUESTIONS ON ITS 
FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The shocking $256-million loss posted Wednesday by consistently profitable 
20th Century Industries has sparked concern about how the big insurer will 
rebound from the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 For policyholders worried about the Woodland Hills-based company's ability to 
pay claims, the word from the insurance rating agency A.M. Best Co. is that 
20th Century's financial strength rating will surely drop, but its solvency 
does not appear threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's stock -- already weak for the last month -- plunged another 14% 
in trading Thursday, and an influential analyst downgraded its investment 
quality. The stock dropped $2.50 to $16 a share on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you collect $98 million in (earthquake insurance) premiums over 10 years 
and lose four times that in half a minute, that's not a good business," Gerald 
Lewinsohn of Merrill Lynch Global Securities Research said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewinsohn, who Thursday lowered his assessment of the company's long-term 
earnings potential to "below average," said 20th Century might consider 
dropping out of residential insurance. That sector provides only 10% of the 
company's premiums, while auto insurance generates the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 20th Century, founded in 1956 by Louis W. Foster, who is still its chairman, 
is California's eighth-largest property casualty insurer. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard A. Dinon, senior vice president and chief spokesman for 20th Century, 
deflected questions about whether the company might abandon homeowners 
insurance, saying the first objective is to finish handling the claims that 
have poured in from the magnitude 6.8 earthquake that hit Jan. 17.  
</P>
<P>
 As of April 18, 20th Century said it had received 31,000 homeowner and 
condominium claims and 9,000 automobile claims related to the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest estimate of gross earthquake claims costs is $475 million. Based on 
that figure, minus adjustments for taxes and reinsurance payments, 20th Century 
took a $269.5-million charge against first-quarter earnings, which produced the 
massive loss announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rival Allstate Corp. on Thursday announced a net loss of $275.2 million for 
the first quarter, the second-worst quarterly loss in the company's history, 
based on estimated gross earthquake costs of $950 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Like virtually every insurer hit by the quake, Allstate and 20th Century were 
forced to revise their loss estimates sharply upward. 
</P>
<P>
 A.M. Best estimates that total insured damage could reach $6.4 billion. The 
figure does not include damage to uninsured public property or losses that fall 
below earthquake insurance deductibles. Federal officials have estimated total 
damage at $15 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 John H. Snyder, senior vice president at A.M. Best, said the agency is 
reviewing its ratings of 20th Century and six other insurers affected by the 
quake. 20th Century currently carries an A+ rating from A.M. Best, the 
second-highest rating. Snyder said the rating is "going to be coming down -- 
it's a question of how far." 
</P>
<P>
 Rival rating agency Standard & Poor's dropped 20th Century's rating Tuesday, 
the day before the loss was announced, and is considering a further reduction. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's statutory reserves -- or cushion against claims losses -- 
dropped 42% because of Wednesday's loss, from $582 million to $335 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder added, however, that if the earthquake losses do not suddenly spiral 
upward from here, the company should certainly get through the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one should try to jump the gun on this," he said. "I don't see (the 
rating) being adjusted to the point where it's a solvency concern." 
</P>
<P>
 That sentiment was echoed by Norma Garcia, staff attorney for Consumers Union 
in San Francisco, who said major insurers such as 20th Century generally have 
adequate reserves and that the quake should not undermine policyholders' 
confidence in their ability to collect on claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia also noted that in the event of an insurance insolvency, policyholders 
would have their claims paid by the California Insurance Guaranty Assn. A Bad 
Quarter for 20th Century 
</P>
<P>
 After logging consistent profits since 1986, 20th Century Industries this week 
reported a $256.1-million loss, the result of a flood of insurance claims from 
the Northridge earthquake. Investors reacted by driving the already weak stock 
down another 14%. 
</P>
<P>
 Net income (or loss) by quarter, in millions: 1st quarter, 1994: -$256.1 
</P>
<P>
 Monthly stock price: Thursday: $16.00, down $2.50 
</P>
<P>
 EARTHQUAKE COSTS 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance companies' estimates for earthquake costs have been leapfrogging 
since the January quake, and further increases are expected. Here are the 
latest gross claim estimates for the four insurers most affected: State Farm: 
$1 billion Allstate: $950 million Farmers: $600-$800 million 20th Century: $475 
million

THE UPHEAVAL AT PLATINUM SOFTWARE; COMPUTERS: THE LATEST PROBLEMS ARE NOT THE 
FIRST THAT COMPANY FOUNDER GERALD BLACKIE HAS ENCOUNTERED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN CHRISTIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Platinum Software Corp. seemed aptly named. Just last year, the Irvine maker 
of accounting software tripled its payroll, made seven acquisitions and 
reported $39 million in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 But with Monday's announcement that the company's top managers quit and that 
Platinum had overstated revenue for 15 months, Platinum's explosive growth drew 
closer attention -- as did its architect, Gerald R. Blackie, the firm's 
founder, who stepped aside as chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Blackie's first computer venture, Heritage Computing Inc. in Costa Mesa, was 
sued for copyright infringement in 1983. The suit ended in an out-of-court 
settlement four years later -- by which time Heritage had gone bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, a trade group sued Advanced Business Microsystems Inc. -- which 
became Platinum -- for illegally duplicating software. That suit was also 
settled out of court. 
</P>
<P>
 Blackie has been unavailable for comment on the recent developments. Carmelo 
J. Santoro, the company's acting chief executive, on Thursday described Blackie 
as "concerned and sad." 
</P>
<P>
 But Santoro also said the company is still trying to assess the full extent of 
the overstated revenue and exactly how the overstatement occurred. Santoro said 
he met Tuesday with investigators from the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
adding that he expects an SEC investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The story of Platinum began, incongruously enough, with sportswear. In the 
late 1970s, Blackie opened a store in Huntington Beach that specialized in 
skiing paraphernalia. To balance his books, he bought an accounting program 
made by a Woodland Hills software maker, Occupational Computing Co. -- one of 
the first companies in the nation to offer such a product. 
</P>
<P>
 Blackie, a handsome New Zealand native who had moved to California a few years 
earlier, was so impressed with the software that he offered to market it. 
According to public records, the 29-year-old entrepreneur signed a contract in 
January, 1983, granting him a license to manufacture and distribute OCC's 
software. 
</P>
<P>
 At about the same time, Blackie opened Heritage Computing. He brought in three 
men who had operated the small financial consulting firm that introduced 
Blackie to OCC's software: its owner, Brett Wilson, and Wilson's two right-hand 
men, Kevin P. Riegelsberger and Timothy J. McMullen. 
</P>
<P>
 Riegelsberger and McMullen, who would later help Blackie found the company 
that became Platinum, were two of the executives at the company who last week 
gave up their board seats. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gerald was as charming a person as I have ever met," said Wilson, now the 
director of information services for Navicert Financial, a consulting firm in 
Carson. "He could make you feel that you were the most wonderful, smartest 
person in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 But the relationship between OCC and Heritage soon soured. OCC sued Heritage 
in December, 1983, alleging that Blackie sold the software without paying 
royalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Heritage filed for bankruptcy in 1985. Two years later, OCC and Heritage's 
insurer settled out of court for an undisclosed sum. In a deposition in the 
case, Wilson said he left Heritage in 1983 because he "would not be a party to 
stealing OCC's software." 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Price, an Irvine patent attorney who represented Blackie in the suit, 
said his client argued that Heritage distributed its own software, not OCC's. 
"He didn't take their product," Price said. "Heritage devised its own 
accounting package with its own programmers." 
</P>
<P>
 Blackie, Riegelsberger and McMullen founded another company, Advanced Business 
Microsystems, in 1984. The Irvine-based company made new accounting software 
called Platinum, and a few years later it adopted Platinum as its name. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the company landed in a legal dispute with the Software Publishers 
Assn., a trade group. The SPA sued ABM on behalf of eight software makers, 
including Microsoft Corp., WordPerfect Corp. and Lotus Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit alleged that ABM illegally duplicated software. The SPA files dozens 
of such suits every year, but it has targeted "an extremely small number" of 
software makers, said the association's litigation manager, Peter Beruk. 
</P>
<P>
 ABM settled out of court in 1992 for $85,000 after agreeing "to ensure that 
all unlicensed copies of computer software have been eliminated from its 
personal computers," according to an SPA news release.  
</P>
<P>
 Blackie said in that release: "We did find some areas where we were in 
technical violation, and we took immediate steps to correct the situation. ABM 
firmly believes in the right of all software producers to be paid for their 
products."

STOCKS AND BONDS STAGE DRAMATIC RALLY; DOW ADDS 54; MARKETS: SURPRISING IBM 
PROFIT REPORT SPARKS OPTIMISM, WHILE HINTS OF ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN HELP BONDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The stock market staged a sharp rebound Thursday, driven by another rally in 
the battered bond market and by a surprisingly strong profit by beleaguered IBM 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrials rocketed 53.83 points to end at 3,652.54 as buyers 
flocked back to many stocks that had been dumped in recent weeks, the victims 
of rising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, the influence of the Federal Reserve Board's three 
credit-tightening moves this year seemed to recede, as investors rushed in and 
bond yields fell across the board. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond dropped to 7.21% from 7.31% 
on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the continuing turnaround in the bond market, which has been 
rallying since Tuesday, appeared to be tied to belief that the U.S. economy is 
already slowing from the brisk growth of the past two quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what's crept into the (bond) bears is a bit of doubt about the vigor 
of the economy," said Dana Johnson, analyst at First Chicago Capital Markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs of an economic slowdown were evident in the government's Tuesday report 
on the nation's February trade deficit, experts say. A marked decline in export 
growth suggested that the manufacturing sector, which has surged in recent 
months, will soon see activity ebb. 
</P>
<P>
 More questions about the strength of the economic recovery were raised 
Thursday when the Labor Department reported that the number of newly laid-off 
workers filing claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly rose by 14,000 last 
week -- the third straight increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia on Thursday released a regional 
economic report that described slower growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock market, which had failed to respond well to the bond market's 
Wednesday rally, finally took some comfort Thursday from falling interest 
rates. Analysts said investors obviously are hoping that the economy slows only 
enough to stave off another Fed rate increase and not enough to fall into 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, International Business Machine's surprisingly upbeat first-quarter 
earnings report helped ignite buying, traders said. IBM zoomed 6 1/8 to 58 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broad market, advancing issues swamped decliners by about 11 to 5 on 
the New York Stock Exchange. Trading was very heavy at 378.7 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite concerns about a slowing economy -- which had crushed many industrial, 
transportation and technology stocks earlier in the week -- buyers returned to 
those stocks Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nasdaq market of mostly smaller stocks also enjoyed healthy buying. The 
Nasdaq composite index surged 13.22 points, or 1.9%, to 718.74. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many traders cautioned that stocks were overdue for some kind of 
rebound after the heavy selling of recent weeks. This may not necessarily 
indicate an end to the market's "correction," Wall Streeters warned. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stock market has been under some tremendous pressure," said Paul 
Hennessey, vice president of trading at Boston Co. "It was looking for an 
opportunity to rally here, and when the bond market rallied, it rallied along 
with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, noted that the strength of the rally was impressive. "People 
are beginning to feel halfway decent about things," said Larry Kinney at 
Soundview Financial. "This is the best rally we have had in about three weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Many tech stocks followed IBM higher. Winners included Intel, up 2 3/4 to 60 
1/4; Compaq, up 6 7/8 to 108 3/4; Cabletron Systems, up 8 1/8 to 103 1/4; Texas 
Instruments, which also reported strong earnings, up 6 3/4 to 71 1/2, and 
Cheyenne Software, up 3 to 25 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the few tech losers was Dell Computer, down 2 7/8 to 22, on word that 
it suffered losses on so-called derivative securities in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among industrial issues, Caterpillar surged 3 1/8 to 106 5/8, Chrysler rose 
2 to 48, Eaton gained 1 3/4 to 51 3/4, Nucor leaped 2 to 59 5/8 and PPG 
Industries was up 1 1/8 to 71 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Transportation issues rising sharply included Burlington Northern, up 2 1/2 
to 55; United Airlines parent UAL, up 3 to 126, and Norfolk Southern, up 1 3/8 
to 61 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Most utility stocks extended their rally. Peoples Energy rose 3/4 to 29 7/8, 
Commonwealth Edison added 1/2 to 25 1/4 and Bell Atlantic gained 1 1/8 to 54 
3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Consumer products stocks continued to be helped by stronger-than-expected 
earnings. McDonald's, a Dow component stock, rose 2 to 58 7/8 on news of solid 
first-quarter results. 
</P>
<P>
 Other winners included Kellogg, up 3 5/8 to 52 3/8; Gillette, up 2 to 66 3/8, 
and Pfizer, up 1 3/4 to 59 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 In foreign markets, Wall Street's optimism spilled into Mexico. The Bolsa 
stock index zoomed 117.99 points, or 6.0%, to 2,075.32, reversing all of 
Wednesday's steep loss. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, the Nikkei index eased 82.82 points to 19,799.36, while Frankfurt's 
DAX index ended at 2,196.9, up 14.33 points, and London's FTSE-100 index added 
2.9 points to 3,101.2.

 Food and tobacco conglomerate RJR Nabisco Holdings Co. said its net income 
rose 19.6% in the first quarter as onetime events boosted its latest results 
and depressed last year's figures.Excluding special factors, earnings were off 
8% from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York-based firm reported net income of $195 million in the three 
months ended March 31, compared to $163 million a year earlier. After preferred 
dividends were paid, earnings rose to $162 million, or 12 cents a share, from 
$157 million, or 12 cents a share, in 1993.

 Amoco Corp. reported a 74% gain in first-quarter earnings as higher sales and 
margins more than offset the impact of lower crude oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's profit was decreased as the company reduced the value of an oil

a year ago, profit rose 16%.

 The Chicago-based company had a profit of $398 million, or 80 cents per share,

$6.9 billion, mainly due to a decline in crude oil prices.

PEOPLE: L.A. TIMES REORGANIZES ADVERTISING DEPARTMENTS; 6 NEW POSTS CREATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Times, seeking to streamline and better coordinate its

 30-Year Mortgage Rates Climb: After declining last week, rates rose this week 
to their highest levels in nearly two years. The 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage 
averaged 8.49%, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. said.The 30-year rate was 
up from last week's 8.26% and was at its highest since it was 8.54% the week of 
June 12, 1992. This week's rate is 1 3/4 percentage points above the 25-year 
low of 6.74% last October. The average was 8.48% two weeks ago and declined 
last week. On one-year, adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an 
average initial rate of 5.06%, up from 4.96% last week. Fifteen-year notes, a 
popular refinancing option, averaged 7.97% this week, up from 7.72% a week 
earlier. The rates do not include add-on fees known as points.

EARNINGS: IBM FIRST-QUARTER PROFIT HITS $392 MILLION; COMPUTERS: THE COMPANY 
SAYS REVENUE WAS UP THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. APPLE'S SECOND-QUARTER PROFIT DROPS 
BY 84%. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 International Business Machines Corp. reported a surprisingly robust 
$392-million first-quarter profit Thursday, but it warned that its turnaround 
from massive losses of recent years is not complete. 
</P>
<P>
 The world's largest computer company said revenue, which rose 2% to $13.4 
billion, grew in all major regions of the world and expenses declined 
significantly. 
</P>
<P>
 "However, the results from one quarter do not guarantee sustained, long-term 
success," said Louis Gerstner, IBM's chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 The results mark a dramatic turnaround from the first quarter of 1993, when 
the company lost $399 million, or 70 cents a share, on revenue of $13.1 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 IBM's first-quarter results in 1994, which amounted to earnings of 64 cents 
per share, included an after-tax gain of $248 million from the sale of its 
Federal Systems Co. and an after-tax write-down of $192 million related to a 
change in software amortization periods. 
</P>
<P>
 Without any special items, its earnings from operations would have been a more 
modest $336 million, or 54 cents a share. But that was still far better than 
industry analysts' estimates, which ranged from a loss of 7 cents a share to a 
profit of 19 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
 The news lifted IBM's stock $6.125 to $58.375, a 12% gain, on the New York 
Stock Exchange.

FORD TO MERGE ITS NORTH AMERICAN, EUROPEAN OPERATIONS; AUTOS: WIDE-RANGING 
REORGANIZATION IS AIMED AT IMPROVING EFFICIENCY. IT COULD SAVE THE COMPANY $3 
BILLION A YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD W. NAUSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Criticized for spending too much and taking too long to develop new vehicles, 
Ford Motor Co. said Thursday that it will improve efficiency by merging its 
North American and European operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The reorganization -- the most wide-ranging at Ford in more than 25 years -- 
could produce savings of up to $3 billion a year by decade's end, when the 
changes will first touch car and truck production, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have these two big elephants called Europe and North America," Chairman 
and Chief Executive Alexander Trotman said at a news conference at the 
company's worldwide headquarters here. Each unit develops, designs and markets 
its own vehicles, often resulting in duplicative efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our concern is to have a harmonious dance between these two," Trotman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford's goal is to reduce the cost of product development, design, parts 
purchasing and related activities. That could mean some reductions in the 
company's 322,000-member work force, but executives said they hope the 
shrinkage can be handled through attrition. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts praised the realignment but said it is long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's about time," said Jim Harbour, a manufacturing consultant in Troy, Mich. 
"The sleeping giant behind Ford finally woke up." 
</P>
<P>
 David Cole, executive director of the University of Michigan's Office for the 
Study of Automotive Transportation, said the reorganization addresses Ford's 
fundamental weakness: duplication of systems and processes. 
</P>

 "What this does is give Ford a road map into the future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Ford is the most efficient U.S. auto maker and has one of the strongest 
balance sheets in the industry, its profit margins are slimmer than those of 
some competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The reason: Ford's development costs are much higher. Harbour estimates that 
Ford spent $800 per vehicle on development costs last year -- 60% more than 
Chrysler. It took six years and $6 billion to develop its Mondeo mid-size 
sedan, while Chrysler needed $1.3 billion and about three years to develop is 
Neon subcompact. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, Ford has problems with product development," said Maryann Keller, an 
analyst with Furman Selz, a New York brokerage. "With today's announcement, 
they admit it." 
</P>
<P>
 Trotman drew attention with his effort to undertake a remodeling of the 
30-year-old Mustang. By using a team approach similar to that espoused in 
Thursday's reorganization, he brought the new model in on time and under 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 He now hopes the new structure will help Ford develop more "world cars" -- 
basic designs that can be sold in several regions. Its past two efforts in that 
direction -- the Escort and Mondeo -- took longer and cost more than planned 
because of infighting among the European and North American staffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The restructuring establishes Ford Automotive Operations to oversee operations 
in Europe and North America. Its president, Edward E. Hagenlocker, will be in 
charge of five vehicle programs, each with worldwide responsibility for the 
design, development and engineering of vehicles assigned to it. 
</P>
<P>
 The structure is similar to that used by other auto makers. Chrysler has 
reduced costs and development time by giving more power to its so-called 
platform teams -- cross-functional groups that design, engineer, manufacture 
and market a vehicle from start to finish.

 Glendale Federal Puts Florida Branches Up for Sale: The thrift said it will 
dispose of the 60 branches, with $3.6 billion in deposits, to focus on its core 
California market. The planned sale will delay the release of third-quarter 
earnings until the second week of May, when the transaction is expected to be 
completed and result in an unspecified write-off of goodwill value. Before the 
write-off, the company expects a pretax loss of about $20 million for the 
quarter.

 ATM Operator Bows to Government: Electronic Payment Services Inc., the 
operator of a major automated-teller machine banking network, agreed to stop 
anti-competitive practices, which the Justice Department said cost customers in 
six Eastern states $100 million last year. The government had said the 
practices by the operator of the Money Access Service network raised costs to 
some banks and made it harder for competing ATM networks to enter the market. 
Electronic Payment said it will stop requiring some banks to use its 
data-processing services.

 Toyota Accused of Inflating Car Prices: Prompted by a former sales manager's 
disclosures, consumer lawyers have filed suit accusing Toyota of inflating 
prices to hundreds of thousands of Californians through secret dealer 
kickbacks.Toyota had no immediate comment. Evan Fragiadakis, the former 
dealership manager whose complaints launched the case, said the company offered 
a settlement earlier this year that would have given former buyers $100 
discounts on their next new Toyota. The first lawsuit was filed last week in 
Contra Costa County Superior Court. On Wednesday, lawyers who formerly 
represented Fragiadakis filed a similar suit on behalf of a customer in U.S. 
District Court, seeking to represent Toyota purchasers nationwide.

 Money Supply Rises: The two broadest measures of the nation's money supply 
rose in the week ended April 11, the Federal Reserve Board reported. The Fed 
said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally adjusted $3,597.2 billion 
from a revised $3,584.7 billion the previous week.A broader measure, M3, rose 
to a seasonally adjusted $4,219.8 billion from a revised $4,212.2 billion. The 
narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a seasonally adjusted 
$1,143.5 billion from $1,148.4 billion. M1 includes cash in circulation, 
deposits in checking accounts and non-bank traveler's checks. M2 is M1 plus 
accounts such as savings deposits and money market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus 
money kept in less liquid accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum 
denominations of $100,000.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: MUTUAL FUNDS IN DERIVATIVES: RISKS APPEAR MINIMAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The $2-trillion mutual fund industry has so far avoided the horrendous losses 
racked up by other players in the much maligned derivative-securities business. 
But are the funds next in line? 
</P>
<P>
 Probably not, for some simple reasons. Most funds appear to have dabbled in 
derivatives only minimally, usually risking less than 10% of their portfolios 
on these hybrid securities. And, because funds are required to reprice 
themselves "at the market" each day, any losses thus far should already be 
reflected in fund share values -- that is, assuming the pricing of derivatives 
is accurate. 
</P>
<P>
 Therein lies the key danger in these instruments, though: Their complexity can 
make it difficult to properly value them day to day. Their complexity has also 
left many fund companies unable, or unwilling, to explain in quarterly reports 
to shareholders exactly how derivatives are being used. As with many other 
aspects of mutual fund ownership, the individual investor is asked to trust the 
fund manager to get it right. 
</P>
<P>
 Derivatives, as many investors know by now, are often-synthetic securities 
whose values are "derived from" underlying baskets of stocks, bonds or 
currencies, or from their relative movements. Futures and options contracts are 
derivatives; so are the much more complicated Wall Street creations such as 
collateralized mortgage obligations, derived from mortgage bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most derivatives either give fund managers more bang for their buck (i.e., you 
can control a big chunk of securities for relatively little money down) or 
allow the manager to hedge in some way. In a typical hedge transaction, a bond 
fund manager fearful of rising market interest rates would buy derivatives 
designed to appreciate in value if rates rise -- which thus would offset some 
of the expected depreciation of the conventional bonds in the portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem in recent months, particularly for bond funds (which tend to be 
bigger users of complex derivatives than stock funds), is that losses incurred 
by high-flying speculators in derivatives have roiled these markets, causing 
potential buyers and sellers to pull back. As liquidity has dried up, many 
derivatives that worked as advertised in 1993 have turned into unpredictable 
animals this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Benham Management's $900-million Adjustable-Rate Government Securities fund, 
for example, owns some so-called IO bonds, or interest-only mortgage bond 
derivatives that usually jump in value if market interest rates rise. In 
theory, these bonds become more attractive as fewer mortgage holders prepay or 
refinance their loans in a rising rate environment. 
</P>
<P>
 We've certainly had rising rates this year. But Benham fund manager Randy Merk 
admits that the IOs "have not worked as well as expected. They're not going up 
in value the way you'd expect, because there is so much (investor) reluctance 
to put bids out for these securities." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Benham fund has suffered as another type of derivative -- 
inverse floaters, a bet on falling interest rates -- have tumbled in value 
while rates have surged. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Merk says the fund's investors have to put derivatives' effect in 
perspective: All told, the IO and inverse-floater bonds account for 2.5% of the 
portfolio. The fund's share price, now $9.68, has lost no more than 3 cents 
this year because of the fall in those derivatives' values, Merk says. And even 
that is misleading, he says, because the fund's yield would be lower without 
the derivatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Merk admits he has pared back his derivative holdings over the past six 
months, as controversy over their use has ballooned. That retreat naturally 
makes derivative-free funds look smart in retrospect. Andrew Jennings Sr., head 
of muni bond trading at the giant Franklin Advisers fund group, says Franklin's 
muni funds don't buy derivatives, period. "We're just very, very vanilla," he 
says. "It makes our lives easier." 
</P>
<P>
 Risk-averse investors may prefer that approach, but it's also worth noting 
that many of the same funds that have suffered small losses because of 
derivatives this year also successfully used them to enhance performance last 
year. If you assume that derivatives aren't going away, the best strategy for 
fund investors isn't necessarily to run from funds that use them but to be 
willing to accept that these hybrids cut both ways. Your risk may be higher, 
but your return over time should be as well. A Derivatives Lexicon 
</P>
<P>
 Some common derivatives used by bond mutual funds:  
</P>
<P>
 * CMO: Collateralized mortgage obligation. An umbrella term for securities 
derived from mortgage-backed bonds. Also known as remics (real estate mortgage 
investment conduits). 
</P>
<P>
 * IO: Interest-only bond. A mortgage derivative that pays interest only and 
does not receive principal payments on the bond. Thus, if paid off early, IO 
bonds become losers for their owners. 
</P>
<P>
 * PO: Principal-only bond. The flip side of the IO bond; owners get only 
principal payments. So they pay off quicker if interest rates fall and mortgage 
holders refinance. 
</P>
<P>
 * IF: Inverse floater bond. Common to both the mortgage and municipal bond 
markets, these derivatives are structured to pay more interest if market 
interest rates fall.

CONSUMER AFFAIRS / DENISE GELLENE: GET READY FOR HIGHER CARD RATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The surge in short-term interest rates is hitting consumers in their wallets: 
Interest rates on variable-rate credit cards are on the way up. 
</P>
<P>
 Most variable-rate cards are pegged to changes in the prime rate, the interest 
banks charge their best corporate customers. This week the prime rate rose by 
half a percentage point to 6.75%, the second increase in less than a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Most banks and other financial institutions adjust credit card rates 
quarterly. People with variable-rate cards -- about two-thirds of credit card 
holders -- will see higher rates this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert A. McKinley, president of Frederick, Md.-based Ram Research, estimated 
that the rate increase will cost the average consumer an extra $20 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Many economists believe short-term rates will continue to rise gradually, 
perhaps pushing the prime rate to 7% by the end of the year. That would lead to 
another boost in credit card rates. 
</P>
<P>
 People with variable-rate cards can take some steps to reduce the impact of 
rising rates:  
</P>
<P>
 * Choose a card that limits how high rates can go. First Interstate's standard 
variable-rate card won't charge more than 17.5%, no matter how high rates rise. 
Two popular cards -- the AT&T Universal card and the GM card -- have no 
ceilings on interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 * Choose a card with a small spread over the prime rate. Bank of America's 
standard card rate is the prime rate plus 10.9%. That means the BofA card will 
have a rate of 17.65% when the new prime rate is factored in. Wachovia National 
Bank in Georgia charges 3.9% plus prime, or 10.65% when the rate is adjusted. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone in the club: If the newly merged Price-Costco Wholesale Club stores 
seem a bit crowded, here's why: Thousands of Southern Californians have 
received free 60-day trial memberships.  
</P>
<P>
 The solicitations are unusual. Before the merger, both companies resisted 
mass-membership drives. They targeted select groups, such as small-business 
owners and union members -- people likely to have the resources to buy office 
supplies or groceries in bulk. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts who follow the company say Price-Costco is apparently under pressure 
to improve sales and defend itself against Sam's Club, a unit of Wal-Mart 
Stores that recently converted 91 Pace Membership Warehouse stores acquired 
from Kmart.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is a departure and is somewhat worrisome," said Mark D. Mandel, an 
analyst with Salomon Bros in New York. "This is more evidence that they are 
stretching or groping to reinvigorate the company." 
</P>
<P>
 Here's why Price-Costco wants you: As a result of the merger, the company has 
experienced a small decline in membership renewals due to overlapping Price and 
Costco memberships. The situation isn't dire: Overall revenue from membership 
fees is up because the company gained members at 31 new stores and increased 
membership fees. But the company can't afford to give up any ground, because 
annual membership fees are an important source of revenue. Without them, the 
company would not be profitable.  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Price-Costco also wants new members' shopping dollars to help turn 
around a sales decline at stores open a year or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Should you use the free trial membership card? Not if you intend to become a 
member. People using the trial membership will be charged 5% more than the 
regular Price-Costco price. Therefore, on the typical warehouse purchase of 
$150, trial shoppers will pay $7.50 more -- an amount equal to a fifth of the 
annual membership fee. 
</P>

<P>
 They want lemon-aid: The Legislature is considering a bill that proponents say 
would reform the state's automobile lemon law. 
</P>
<P>
 The key features of the bill, which passed Wednesday in the Assembly Consumer 
Protection, Governmental Efficiency and Economic Development Committee: 
</P>
<P>
 * Defines a lemon as a car that has had four unsuccessful repair attempts over 
24 months. The period now is 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
 * Extends lemon-law coverage to business vehicles used by self-employed 
individuals or companies with fewer than 10 vehicles in their fleets. 
Currently, business vehicles are not covered. 
</P>
<P>
 * Establishes a state-run arbitration program that consumers could use instead 
of going to court. Currently, consumers must arbitrate the dispute if the 
manufacturer runs an arbitration program before taking the matter to court. 
</P>
<P>
 * Establishes fines of up to $100,000 against auto makers failing to comply 
with arbitration judgments. There currently is no fine. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation will almost certainly be amended, and passage isn't a sure 
thing. Lee Ridgeway, lobbyist for General Motors Corp., said state-run 
arbitration should be a mandatory first step. However, the state's powerful 
trial lawyers are expected to oppose any limits on consumers' ability to sue 
auto makers.

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: SANS HOLLYWOOD, IS CANNES KAPUT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now that it's confirmed that mainstream Hollywood will have virtually no 
presence at next month's Cannes Film Festival, European movie makers have 
achieved a modified version of the cinematic purity they've sought since last 
year's GATT discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Les Patriots," "Grosse Fatigue" and other home-grown movies can command 
center stage at this year's festival without the distractions of a half-naked 
Madonna ascending the red-carpeted steps of the Palais des Festivals, Sylvester 
Stallone being sucked into a Cote d' Azur mob or an oversized Arnold 
Schwarzenegger balloon symbolically deflating on a barge. 
</P>
<P>
 But with America relegated to a supporting role this year, Cannes may also 
find its own cachet deflated, much as the European theatrical business could be 
undercut if the European Union follows through on threats to enforce tough 
restrictions on the inflow of American films. 
</P>
<P>
 Cannes regulars have acknowledged for decades that the festival derives much 
of its international media appeal and pizazz from Hollywood -- the most 
definitive book on Cannes is titled "Hollywood on the Riviera" -- no matter how 
many prestigious films the organizers showcase. 
</P>
<P>
 That explains why the controversial "Basic Instinct" got the coveted opening 
slot at Cannes two years ago and why the taut but vacuous "Cliffhanger" 
received a special screening last year. This year's Hollywood lineup consists 
of independently produced films such as Quentin Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction," 
low-budget studio releases such as Paramount's "The Browning Version" and 
Columbia's "I Like It Like That," and movies that have already failed 
domestically, such as "The Hudsucker Proxy" from Warner Bros.-PolyGram and 
"Serial Mom" from Savoy Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 After the selections were formally announced Thursday, sources suggested that 
festival director Gilles Jacob may still have a surprise up his sleeve, such as 
a glitzy last-minute addition. But Jacob said he's satisfied with the lineup. 
He noted that "Hudsucker Proxy" was produced by Joel Silver, "one of the 
greatest producers in Hollywood," and that "Serial Mom," which he identified in 
writing as "Serial Mother," stars the well-known Kathleen Turner. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Turner, the stars committed to Cannes so far are few. They include 
Clint Eastwood, president of the 47th annual festival jury, "Pulp Fiction" 
co-stars Bruce Willis and John Travolta, Tim Robbins, Jennifer Jason Leigh and 
Gerard Depardieu. A salute to director Robert Altman ("MASH," "Nashville," "The 
Player") could also turn up some big names. Yet even the chronically dull 
MIP-TV market recently produced such A-list celebrities as Prince Edward and 
the Duchess of York. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood will be better represented behind the scenes, where the usual amount 
of international deal making will take place, and on billboards and walls 
throughout Cannes, where low-budget American films tend to be shamelessly 
promoted. A number of those Hollywood deal makers believe top studio films are 
being withheld from Cannes in retribution against the French, who successfully 
lobbied for the entertainment industry's exclusion from protection under the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
</P>
<P>
 No one would publicly fess up to such collusion, and a Motion Picture Assn. of 
America representative in Paris denied the rumor Thursday. But it's curious, at 
least, that no major studio has stepped forward with a star-studded picture, 
especially since Cannes has been called the world's greatest promotional 
vehicle by no less an authority than Schwarzenegger. 
</P>
<P>
 He's one of many regulars who will not be on hand this year. The superstar's 
publicist says he's unable to attend because he's gone directly from filming 
"True Lies" to filming "Junior." Pat Kingsley, who represents stars such as Tom 
Cruise and Jodie Foster, said none of her major clients are expected to be 
there. Asked why, she said she had to take another call. 
</P>
<P>
 The studios, for their part, claim they've little to gain from Cannes this 
year. Some say it's because the festival is too expensive. Others insist their 
best films won't be ready in time, or that the crush of publicity at Cannes 
often undercuts their marketing efforts on the home front. 
</P>
<P>
 In fairness, participants point out that Hollywood's presence at Cannes has 
seesawed in the past. Only eight of the 62 films at last year's festival were 
American, though some of the titles were mainstream. The number was roughly 
double that of the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a written response to questions from The Times, Jacob said one problem is 
that release dates for major Hollywood films often conflict with the mid-May 
staging of Cannes. He also hinted, without saying it outright, that the 
available films this year were disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacob denied that GATT played any role in determining the quality of American 
films available to him. He refused to share his own opinion on the quota issue, 
saying, "I have my personal feelings concerning the problem of quotas, but at 
the post where I am, we have in France that which one calls the obligation of 
reserve."

 Theme parks: Euro Disney's debt restructuring is taking longer than planned, 
with 61 creditor banks now agreeing to suspend interest payments on the theme 
park operator's $2.76-billion debt until July as a deal is worked out. Bankers 
and Euro Disney executives say the deal could be finished in a few weeks and 
will include an 18-month waiver of interest payments.Previously, the target 
date for refinancing was April 15. Under a draft accord announced in March, 
Burbank-based Walt Disney Co., which owns 49% of Euro Disney, will participate 
in the refinancing with the banks. The park near Paris has been losing money 
due to factors such as the soft European economy, plunging real estate prices 
and the strength of the French franc relative to other European currencies.

AMERICAN TV IS ALIVE AND WELL IN EUROPE ; ENTERTAINMENT: U.S. FIRMS FLOCK TO 
CANNES MARKETING FESTIVAL DESPITE ALL THAT TALK OF CULTURAL ROADBLOCKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 "Davide, Davide . . . Ici, ici s'il vous plait," the photographers called out 
to veteran TV actor David Hasselhoff, who was sandwiched on a small stand in 
the bunker of the Palais des Festivals during the MIP-TV market. 
</P>
<P>
 The European press contingent's hysteria over the "Baywatch" star was 
understandable. Though NBC dumped the series years ago, the strength of it in 
syndicated form in markets such as France, Germany and Britain has made 
Hasselhoff a European television and recording star. 
</P>
<P>
 On the basis of the series' international success, he and All American 
Television came here to begin testing interest in a spinoff series tentatively 
called "Baywatch 2," which is being watched by other U.S. producers as a 
barometer of the European market for sequels. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, this was the first Marche International de Programmes Television, 
or MIP-TV, to be held since the entertainment industry was excluded from the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade accord. While some feared that the 
market for American products in Europe might dry up or at least diminish, 
people attending the festival said programs such as "Baywatch" remain as 
popular as ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am tired of all this crap about quotas and this GATT nonsense," one 
executive said privately. "It's all B.S., written by the trade press in Los 
Angeles. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 MCA TV International President Colin Davis agreed, saying: "The Europeans are 
buying as much as they ever did. If you look at the figures for all the major 
American companies, international sales continue to grow each year." 
</P>
<P>
 While most European TV viewers prefer home-grown products, American shows 
still make up 30% of European schedules, and Davis says that will continue as 
the number of stations grows. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim McNamara, president and CEO of New World International, concurs that 
quotas have had little effect on business at MIP, saying, "The bottom line is 
we come one-third or halfway around the world to sit in a tourist resort where 
we are never able to go outside; we spend our money on things like this (a key 
ring in the shape of a bloodied ax that lets out a scream) and on huge parties 
to get people's attention, because there are somewhere between 2,000 and 4,000 
buyers here, and despite GATT and despite the quotas, they come here to buy 
products." 
</P>
<P>
 On average, big U.S. companies spend $200,000 to $400,000 on promotion, 
booths, travel and entertainment at MIP. But some studios can write between $10 
million and $25 million in business. MIP is also seen as the perfect setting to 
conclude business begun by fax and phone. 
</P>
<P>
 "MIP is a bit like swallowing a small pill containing the entire international 
entertainment industry which sits in your stomach for six days," said Drew 
Levin, president of DSL Productions.  
</P>
<P>
 MIP can be particularly trying for producers with more cerebral projects. 
British documentary producer Diarmuth Jeffreys from Connaught Films explained a 
pitch he made to a U.S. executive last week that could easily be a scene from 
"The Player": "We give him this proposal on a Mother Theresa documentary, and 
we are quite reverent, as you are when presenting this idea for a program on a 
living saint. You know what his answer is? 
</P>
<P>
 " 'We don't do nuns. Our male audience does not respond well to nuns.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the current taste, MIP remains an American market with more booths 
from America than any other country. The main source of tension is American 
programming on French TV -- particularly after the recent U.S.-French battles 
over the import of American programs and services. 
</P>
<P>
 "France is still the market most affected by quotas," Levin said. "If you want 
to work with France, it has to be a French production . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 One project announced between Turner Productions and the French pay TV channel 
Canal Plus, "The Native Americans," shows how U.S. producers are finding ways 
to work around quotas, although many executives were scratching their heads 
over the partnering of a French company in a documentary series about Native 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Other cultural differences also stand out. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Canal Plus booth is made of stark, white rice paper with small 
splashes of discreet color from its Canal Plus logo, the Paramount booth is a 
spaceship from "Star Trek," complete with a bar hosted by staff dressed as 
Starship Enterprise crew members. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps therein lies l'invasion cultural that no quotas can ever reverse.

A DECISION THAT TURNED SOME HEADS; BARRY FLETCHER USED A BLACK MODEL TO WIN THE 
U.S. HAIRSTYLING TITLE, SO WHY NOT FOR THE INTERNATIONALS? TEAM OFFICIALS SAY 
IT WAS A MATTER OF HAIR TEXTURE -- NOT RACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Having a black woman as a model in the world's most prestigious hairdressing 
competition is a sure-fire way for a stylist to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what the coaches of the U.S. hairdressing team told American national 
champion Barry Fletcher when they barred him from working with an African 
American model at "Hair Olympics '94," the biennial world competition that 
concluded here this week. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not a race issue, they said. It's a hair texture issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that Fletcher, a soft-spoken stylist and salon owner from Maryland, 
had won the U.S. nationals in January with a black model didn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
 This was international competition, the coaches said, and the European judges 
would be expecting a certain look -- a look that Fletcher's favored models did 
not possess. 
</P>
<P>
 Fletcher, who is black, competed in the three-event Ladies Hairdressing 
Championships with a white model assigned to him by U.S. team coach Randy Rick. 
Despite his best efforts, Fletcher did not come close to a first-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. team of six hairdressers placed 22nd out of 34 competing countries in 
the ladies hairdressing events, with Japan, Germany and Russia taking the top 
three medals. The Americans placed fifth in the men's hairdressing events, with 
Great Britain, Germany and Italy taking the top prizes. Medals are not awarded 
to individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 These championships take place under the auspices of the trade organization 
Confederation Internationale de la Coiffure in Paris and hairdressing trade 
groups in the cities where the competitions take place. The next World Congress 
international contest will be in Washington, D.C. in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming off the competition floor at Wembley Exhibition Complex after the final 
event, the "progressive hairstyle" competition, Fletcher was frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like I was robbed of my strength," he said. "Obviously, I should have 
had a model I'm more familiar with. You should have a model with a texture of 
hair you're familiar with." 
</P>
<P>
 At his salon in Capitol Heights, Md., Fletcher's clientele is about 85% black. 
Among those entrusting their looks to him are celebrities ranging from Tina 
Turner and Iman to Maya Angelou and U.S. Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun. 
</P>
<P>
 Fletcher said Rick told him that the kinds of styles he had in mind for the 
U.S. team would not work on a black woman's hair, but the hairstylist insists 
that there would have been no problem had he been allowed to work with Jackie 
Smith, the model with whom he had won the U.S. championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "If she was good enough to qualify, then she should have been good enough to 
represent the country," he said. "I think the judges would look at the quality 
of the work, the execution, the color, the total feel and the harmony of the 
style and fashion." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who did not go to London, called it ridiculous that African American 
models are barred from competing. "When is it going to change?" asked the model 
and veterinarian from Maryland. "When do you say this is representative of 
American hair? When do you make a stand and say it can look stylish, it can 
look vogue, it can be competitive? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see it changing if we have the same people involved," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fletcher argued his case with Rick to no avail. He appealed to team manager 
Robert Niebuhr and recalled the manager's response. "Bob said, 'What if I let 
you use this black model? You go over there, you're going to lose. Now who's 
going to explain that to Matrix (the hair products company sponsoring the U.S. 
team)?' " 
</P>
<P>
 (Matrix said it had no involvement in the team selection process and does not 
believe in discrimination.) 
</P>
<P>
 Rick, who as team coach had final say over which models and styles the 
American competitors employ, said that before the competition, he went on a 
scouting expedition across Europe to discover which hairstyles were winning 
competitions. And what he noticed among the winners was the hair texture of 
whites. 
</P>
<P>
 "What am I going to do?" he said. "Go in there and say, 'Well, I'm going to be 
the maverick of the world and go different?' And then what?" 
</P>
<P>
 A sampling of hair officials from other countries all agreed with Rick. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard St. Laurent, coach of the Canadian team, said there are fabulous black 
models, but he understood the concerns of the U.S. coach. "Europe is 
different," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if Fletcher could have won with his original model, British team manager 
Trevor Mitchell said: "They couldn't win -- it's impossible. They wouldn't 
stand a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Like others questioned, he claimed this was not a racial issue. "If (black 
women) had straight hair, then you could have a black model. It's lovely to get 
someone with dark features on the floor." 
</P>
<P>
 Rae Stuart, president of the National Hairdresser Foundation in Great Britain, 
said: "There are no specific guidelines. But common sense in an international 
hairdressing competition would suggest that you would stand a better chance 
with an Occidental model or perhaps a Puerto Rican or Spanish-type model rather 
than a Negro." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fletcher figured he spent $15,000 for his shot at being named the best in the 
world. He was not told until about a month before the Hair Olympics that he 
could not use an African American model. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can't use a black model, they should put that in writing when you fill 
out the application," he said. "When we apply to compete, it costs us money. If 
I'd have known about it, maybe I would have changed my mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Fletcher disputes the assumption that there is only one type of hair suitable 
for international competition, hair that is only partially representative of 
the world as it is. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're really going to stand up to the true meaning of our creed as 
Americans," he said, "then we have to start being more open and adapting to 
what's actually happening in the United States. I don't want to have to submit 
to a particular level of artistry. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like if you take Michelangelo, you take his paints away and his brushes, 
and you say to him, 'Now I want you to paint this chapel and I want you to use, 
you know, Matrix products.' "

IN PRAISE OF THE BELT; FORGET ITS UTILITARIAN IMAGE. THE BELT IS REALLY A MAN'S 
TOOL OF SEDUCTION, A BRASH ADVERTISEMENT TO ATTRACT THE WOMAN AT THE END OF THE 
BAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So simple, at first glance. A strap. Oiled leather or alligator skin, braided 
or beaded. Some top stitching and a buckle. A few punch holes. But a man's belt 
is more than raw materials. Whether it comes from J. Crew or Kmart, this 
accessory encompasses more than just girth. 
</P>
<P>
 The belt represents a blurring of the distinction between function and 
fashion, not to mention an enduring testament to the male penchant for 
saber-rattling. And, located in a testosterone-rich area of the body, it cannot 
help but serve as a standard-bearer for sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 Honest. 
</P>
<P>
 How ironic to find so much of human nature bound up in an item of clothing 
normally afforded so little notice. The average man owns only a handful of 
belts. And that's counting reversibles as two. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, it is exactly such minutiae that demand inspection, an analysis of what 
the late Supreme Court Justice and fashion plate Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. 
called "the great forces that are behind every detail." 
</P>
<P>
 A fashion dictum if ever there was one. 
</P>
<P>
 So let us begin by debunking the belt's utilitarian image. It does not serve 
to hold up a man's trousers. Today's selection of fits and styles -- not to 
mention refinements in Sansabelt technology -- accommodate a wide variety of 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
 "The belt is still a necessity," argues a salesman for a Los Angeles belt 
manufacturer. "You have to put something through your belt loops." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course. Circular logic. But which came first? 
</P>
<P>
 The belt originated in the military, the Encyclopedia of Fashion says. It gave 
soldiers somewhere to hang their weapons. Cummerbunds -- a species of the genus 
-- began as humble Persian loincloths and were eventually annexed by British 
forces occupying India. They were subsequently aggrandized as decorative sashes 
for officers' dress uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 In peacetime, however, this accouterment has served in an altogether different 
sort of battle. It's all about sex. 
</P>
<P>
 The urge to procreate, to propagate the species, to get a phone number from 
the blonde at the end of the bar. 
</P>
<P>
 This primal force has turned the waistline into a Bermuda Triangle of the male 
anatomy, the one place on a man's body where senseless and inexplicable things 
are most often sighted. Once we come to grips with this inevitability, a lot of 
questions get answered, a lot of mysteries are solved. 
</P>
<P>
 Like pretentious ostrich-skin belts or black-leather straps with the words 
"God Bless America" tooled in two-inch, red, white and blue letters across the 
back. Or cowboy buckles -- silver ones the size of hubcaps. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to men and displays of sexuality, it seems, the results can 
prove conspicuously clumsy. 
</P>
<P>
 The belt, writes fashion historian Lawrence Langer, has often evolved into 
variations of exaggerated size. Such mass has "the obvious effect of drawing 
attention to what it was supposed to hide, or conversely pretending to hide 
what it intended to reveal." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, while women have traditionally seduced through a subtle blend 
of modesty and exhibition, men have resorted to brash advertisement. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the codpiece. Men wore this belted bag or flap over the front of 
their tight breeches during the 15th and 16th centuries. Some resorted to 
padding their codpieces and decorating them with jewels. 
</P>
<P>
 Shakespeare, for one, saw the folly of such fashion, equating this accessory 
with man's lesser inclinations. In King Lear, a character opines, "Here's grace 
and a codpiece; that's a wise man and a fool." 
</P>
<P>
 Pop mythology offers another example. Batman might have amounted to less than 
a super-hero -- just some guy in tights and a cape, perhaps -- if it weren't 
for his impressive utility belt. Its secret compartments afford room for a 
variety of necessities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bat rope, gas pellets, a miniature fingerprint kit," says Bob Greenberger 
of D.C. Comics. "Everything but a condom." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet such excess pales in comparison to the true behemoth of the belt world -- 
the cowboy buckle. Originally, cowboys didn't wear belts, says James Nottage, 
chief curator of the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum in Griffith Park. When 
these silvery adornments came into favor during the early 1900s, it was 
strictly prairie fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Throughout the 20th Century, there have been relatively few avenues for male 
jewelry," Nottage says. "These belt buckles are an avenue for that sort of 
expression. They show off your prowess. They show off your economic status if 
they are fancy." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, a garden variety cowboy buckle runs about $100. A stone-inlaid, 
sterling silver version can cost $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 That is a substantial sum to spend on something with little or no practical 
use. In other words, it's a lot like dating. 
</P>
<P>
 And Nottage shrinks at the "monstrous, gross" adaptations favored by the 
current urban line-dancing set. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the one anomaly to this belt phenomenon, the single instance in which 
males have conceived a waistline contraption that detracts rather than 
attracts, is Sansabelt slacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, the double-knit revolution of the late 1950s. Aimed at the "big and tall" 
golfing scene, Sansabelt offered a patented waistband -- not a single belt loop 
on it -- and "no roll" protection. Sounds like something you might bolt to a 
Jeep. 
</P>
<P>
 These slacks came in a nightmare of colors that could be appreciated only in 
country club lounges. Or by Ed McMahon. Yet even Sansabelt, in its peculiar 
self-conscious manner, served to give men slimmer and more attractive figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember, it's all about sex.

DESIGNER SPOTLIGHT: ENVIRONMENTALLY CORRECT JEWELRY NEEDN'T LOOK LIKE PEASANT 
WEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With Earth Day landing today, it's time -- once again -- to rethink what we 
wear, says environmentally minded jewelry designer Susan Cummings of Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, animal products are out, and anything that harms the rain forest 
isn't worth supporting. But before you throw on a straw shirt and bamboo clogs, 
consider other options. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentally correct wear can be tasteful and refined. 
</P>
<P>
 How about buttons or jewelry carved from tagua , a nut harvested from palm 
trees in northwest Ecuador? The inside of the nut is known as "vegetable ivory" 
because it has the resemblance and consistency of ivory. 
</P>
<P>
 Tagua is carefully harvested without causing damage to the rain forest, says 
Cummings, and proceeds support conservation programs and provide economic 
opportunities for the people who live there.  
</P>
<P>
 "They can harvest a sustainable product rather than cut down the forest," says 
the 42-year-old designer. 
</P>
<P>
 And, says Cummings, this stylish ivory substitute allows elephant and walrus 
tusk "to stay where it belongs, on living animals. It protects the animals, and 
it offers people a conscious choice to buy a product that has a philosophical 
benefit and meaning to it." 
</P>
<P>
 The artist, who donates a portion of her sales to nonprofit environmental 
groups, will be at Neiman Marcus in Fashion Island Newport Beach at 10 a.m. 
Saturday to show three new collections of sterling silver jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 The pieces in the For a Better Earth collection are accented with emerald 
chips and stones, and include a seven-strand charm bracelet ($545), post 
earrings with mom and dad charms ($95) and a star-motif ring ($240). 
</P>
<P>
 The Elements collection has charms with the words love, family , preservation 
of nature, respect for wildlife and peace stamped along with hearts, peace 
signs, liberty bells, animals and other symbols. 
</P>
<P>
 "All are elements of life," Cummings says. There are clip earrings with 
recycling motif charms ($150) and a double-strand bracelet promoting education, 
nonviolence and the family ($495). 
</P>
<P>
 The Rain Forest collection pieces are accented with watermelon tourmaline. 
Included in it are a two-strand necklace with frog, bird and butterfly charms 
($310), a matching bracelet with parrot and pansy charms ($250), and clip 
earrings with fern, orchid and butterfly charms ($240). 
</P>
<P>
 Also at Neiman Marcus on Saturday, teen-age members of the Tree Musketeers, an 
environmental group, will give seedlings to everyone purchasing earth-friendly 
products. Susan Cummings, jewelry designer

CHOICES BY THE YARD; FABRICS: LINENS. COTTONS. TWEEDS. 'ENVIRONMENTALLY 
FRIENDLY' MATERIALS. AND THOSE PASTELS! THE RECENT L.A. TEXTILE SHOW PREVIEWS 
JUST HOW SPRING 1995 WILL LOOK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Popping into dozens of showrooms, they scrutinized hundreds of variations on 
the stripe and dot. They touched the denims, nylons and tweeds. They talked, 
they pondered, they nibbled (candy, cookies, pretzels, pistachios). Then they 
took the free swatches or ordered sample yardage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The follow-up comes later," explained California Mart spokesman David 
Stamper. 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, the atmosphere at the recent Los Angeles International Textile 
Show came closer to a country fair than to a business affair. Along with 
colorful displays of spring '95 fabrics and colorful people -- apparel-company 
owners, designers and marketing teams from 16 states -- there were sideshows, 
door prizes and a heavy dose of euphoria. 
</P>
<P>
 The serious browsing seemed to cast a rosy glow on the garment industry. 
Eventually, all those yards and yards of fabric could tempt consumers -- in 
goods ranging from christening gowns and camisoles to hats, handbags, jackets, 
jeans, pajamas, pareus, swimsuits, slip dresses, ties, T-shirts and trousers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russians, ensconced in a huge corner space with a labyrinth of private 
showrooms, seemed especially happy. Edward Gurevich, chief operating officer 
for Igra-Tekhnika America (ITA), said the numbers were looking good. With six 
sounding like Gurevich's lucky figure, he mentioned a deal for "6 million yards 
of denim" and another for so much linen that the mill "has nothing to sell for 
the next six months." 
</P>
<P>
 Boris Treyzon, ITA's American-educated, Los Angeles-based managing director, 
said the corporation represents 18 Russian mills, some of them with 
300-year-old factories. The textiles have already been sold to fashion leaders 
such as Ralph Lauren. 
</P>
<P>
 But why? "You can't get anything newer than Russian fabrics and the price 
points are substantially less," Treyzon explained, pointing with pride to 
handmade laces, "ecologically pure" linen, 18th-Century cotton Jacquard 
patterns and a lack, so far, of quality or delivery problems. 
</P>
<P>
 While exhibitors such as DuPont and ITA showed their wares behind closed doors 
or high-walled cubicles, others worked in bustling, fishbowl settings. Numbers, 
the kind you get in a busy bakery, would have been a good idea at Rag Race 
Sales, where people queued up for swatches of nylon and terry cloth that might 
become anything from active wear to luggage. 
</P>
<P>
 The pace was slower at Eco-Tex, where the draw was "environmentally 
responsible" fabrics made with Tencel, a natural cellulosic fiber. Los Angeles 
designer and sportswear company president Leon Max, who had already attended 
two European textile shows, was among the lookers.  
</P>
<P>
 Unlike some local executives who dropped in for a short visit, Max was 
planning to spend a day at the show. He saw it as "a great way to get an 
overview." And a good way to check out the competition: "If we find a fabric is 
going to be very popular, we might not use it." 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in a three-piece khaki suit and pastel-striped shirt, Max was one of 
the more formally attired visitors. The typical male uniform tended to be a 
white oversized shirt worn with jeans or casual trousers. Women favored 
something tiny, such as a parochial-plaid skirt, short shorts or a black 
suspender dress over a white T-shirt. And life didn't seem worth living without 
a hard-body, tan legs, a chic backpack and sexy black suede mules. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone went along with the program. Baron Bodnar, the 23-year-old owner 
of Original Weedwear, carried a cellular phone and looked decidedly out of 
place with his shaved head, oversize shorts, bandanna-print shirt and zoot-suit 
chain wallet -- all Original Weedwear products sold in surf, skate and 
snowboard shops. Some of them quite far away. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're big in Germany and Japan," Bodnar said, adding that the company's 
typical customer is 15 to 25 years old. "But we have some 40-year-olds who want 
to feel kind of wild." 
</P>
<P>
 Just how wild things might get next spring was the subject of two slide-show 
fashion forecasts. Pat Tunsky, president of the eponymous New York-based trend 
reporting firm, predicted a "baby-doll backlash," Kool-Aid colors, pastels, a 
ton of white, futuristic shapes in silver, "second-skin" dressing and alfresco 
sweaters (meaning you still have to work on your midriff). 
</P>
<P>
 It was a similar story when Ellen Sideri, president of ESP Inc., presented the 
Peclers-Paris trend report. She added more proof of the pastels, silver, vests 
against bare skin and sexy architectural shapes to come. Sideri was also big on 
bobby socks with heels, the "lingerie mood," cosmetic colors and the revival of 
"calendar pinups." 
</P>
<P>
 Tsveta Yvanova, a free-lance designer with Design Concepts, thoroughly enjoyed 
the Peclers show. But it was only a show. And after it was over, she was back 
to reality, looking for fabrics to please "middle America." 
</P>
<P>
 "We need this, but we laugh at what they say," Yvanova explained. "Half of the 
things would only sell in a very few places. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fashion is like food. There are all the fancy dishes, but you have to make 
the basic things people need. And the less fashion, the longer it will stay in 
their wardrobes. I love pastels," she added wistfully, referring to the 
forecast. "But they don't sell. So I'm doing brights."

 The baby finger finally gets its due. 
</P>
<P>
 Antique opals, Egyptian scarabs and simple ropes of silver are running circles 
around every last digit -- and both thumbs.Many of the newest designs are meant 
to meet up with one's existing jewelry for a group show. Others are strictly 
solo acts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Alicia Bleier Collection of jewelry is designed in Los Angeles by two 
women known collectively as Ilan-Oded. Their bands of sterling silver and gold, 
set with semiprecious (topaz, peridot) and precious (ruby, emerald) stones, 
feature filigree details from old Spanish and Middle Eastern cultures.  
</P>
<P>
 Sika, also of Los Angeles, makes sterling silver rings with fossilized stones 
and shells, but his biggest sellers showcase amber. "People go for the stones 
because they're old and hold some special feeling of magic and spirit," he 
says.  
</P>
<P>
 When he's not surfing, Willie Thoms paints, sculpts and makes jewelry. The way 
to create is "to trip on shape," says the L.A. designer. His "Tempered Chunk" 
pairs a square block of glass with a sterling silver setting.  
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco designer Jan Michaels finds inspiration in the past, 
particularly ancient Egypt. The top of her oversize pyramid ring unlatches to 
reveal a piece of faux mummy wrap, a.k.a. gauze. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Lalor's puzzle ring, on the other hand, is understated and sentimental. 
His Maine-based line, Circle Around the Moon, includes a wedding ring with 
interlocking parts. Inspired by designs from the 16th Century, Lalor says he 
likes the idea of providing a "'private space" for secrets between lovers.

'PHANTOM TOLLBOOTH': FARE PLAY; THEATER: THE LAGUNA PLAYHOUSE PRODUCTION TAKES 
KIDS ON A FANTASY ADVENTURE THAT IS EQUALLY APPEALING TO ADULTS.

 Demons are rampant, like the Demon of Insincerity and the Demon of Horrible 
Hopping Hindsight. And the Terrible Trivium, who is the Dean of Useless Things. 
And the ever-present Word Snatcher, who takes the words right out of your 
mouth. And the royal sisters of the Kings of Dictionopolis and Digitopolis, who 
have been imprisoned by their brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 It is to their rescue that young Milo flies in only one of his adventures 
after he passes through "The Phantom Tollbooth." 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Playhouse production of this classic young person's tale opens 
today as the season finale of the Playhouse's Youth Theatre season, and, though 
the company suggests it for viewers age 4 and up, it's accessible in many ways 
for children, teens, young adults and up. 
</P>
<P>
 Norton Juster's "Phantom Tollbooth" was written in 1961 with young readers in 
mind and is required reading for many fifth- and sixth-grade classes. But like 
the Oz stories of L. Frank Baum, the fables of E.B. White and the Wonderland 
fantasies of Lewis Carroll, Juster's work has humor and insights that can as 
easily be appreciated, and laughed at, by adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the wordplay might be a bit opaque for very little ones, but the 
characters and action are right up their alley. Yet even teen-agers and adults 
have to listen closely to catch all the puns and pell-mell plot turns. If they 
blink, according to Youth Theatre director Joe Lauderdale, they'll miss 
something. 
</P>
<P>
 And for adults who fear they might be bored, the game of finding the artistic 
inspirations in the production's design might intrigue them. The Dr. Seuss 
influence will be easy to identify. But try to pick out hints of Salvador Dali 
and Rene Magritte in the Lands Beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 Lauderdale had read the stage adaptation of Juster's book a couple of years 
ago but hadn't found a spot for it in previous Youth Theatre seasons. This 
year, following an opening fairy tale, the musical "Oliver" and a literary 
adaptation of "Anne of Green Gables," it seemed that a carefully balanced 
season called for a fantasy finale. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just filled the bill," said Lauderdale, "a child going on a journey and 
learning a lot about life. I find that a lot of adults, and the teen-agers in 
the cast, remember very vividly reading the book and enjoying it so much. Also, 
Milo is pretty much a teen himself." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Milo's problem is boredom. He can find nothing to do. He's read books and 
watched television, but nothing intrigues him until one day when he discovers a 
strange package in his room labeled "For Milo, who has plenty of time." Inside 
is the tollbooth that leads him into the Lands Beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 "He learns that life is really not as dull as he thought it was," Lauderdale 
said, "that it's actually very exciting, and that time can pass very quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something anyone can relate to," Lauderdale said. "I can recall being 
13, 14, 15 years old, and being bored, wanting something to do, even though 
there were all kinds of things around me. I just didn't seem to be able to find 
interesting things to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Lauderdale later fell in love with "Tollbooth" and the lands it led to. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really wanted to do it because it's so bizarre," the director said. "It's 
crazy, and it's zany, and it's comical. There's also a nice message. It's not 
pounded over the head, but Milo does learn something along the way." 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Phantom Tollbooth," Laguna Playhouse Youth Theatre, 606 Laguna Canyon 
Road, Laguna Beach. Plays today and Saturday at 8 p.m., Saturday and Sunday 
matinees, 2 p.m. Ends May 1. Tickets: $6 (children 13 and under) and $9

THEATER / MARK CHALON SMITH; SCHOOLS OFFER TWO DEGREES OF SHAKESPEARE; CAL 
STATE FULLERTON AND UCI STAGE TRAGEDY AND COMEDY THIS WEEKEND WITH 'MACBETH,' 
'HAMLET' AND 'MEASURE FOR MEASURE.' 
</P>

<P>
 You want Shakespeare? We've got Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, two local universities have him this weekend: UC Irvine and Cal 
State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 UCI is the most ambitious, staging two of his plays in repertory: 
Shakespeare's dark comedy, "Measure for Measure" opens tonight, followed on 
Saturday by the great tragedy, "Hamlet." 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton chooses another of Shakespeare's greatest hits. The campus 
creeps into the Bard's world of rich English vowels and dirty castle intrigue 
with "Macbeth," which opens tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 For Stephen M. Burdman, the 27-year-old UCI graduate student who is directing, 
"Hamlet" is "the greatest play ever written." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just so incredibly rich," he said. "There are so many layers and themes 
involved. My challenge is finding which ones to emphasize. The danger is that 
you try to do too much and end up with a mushy production . . . but it's such a 
wonderful story, you always have that." 
</P>
<P>
 That wonderful story, of course, involves murder and revenge, deception and 
manipulation, madness and betrayal, ghastly men and poetic ghosts, all of which 
give the young prince of Denmark quite a ride on the way to self-discovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see Hamlet as 19 or 20 years old, and he's not yet ready to rule," Burdman 
said. "He becomes a king because he learns how to use the tools of betrayal and 
manipulation. (But) Hamlet's end is tragic because he refuses to accept the 
machinations of a corrupt world." 
</P>
<P>
 To some, the play's complexity might demand a director with more seasoning, 
but Burdman, who is directing "Hamlet" as his master's thesis, said his age and 
experience allows him to understand the callow hero. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is definitely something for young directors to do," he said. "I know I 
feel connected to Hamlet, that in some ways there's a direct connection to my 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the staging, Burdman described it as "modern gothic," meaning both 
traditional and contemporary styles will mingle. Characters, for example, will 
wear today's clothes under period outer-garments, and Julie Allardice's set 
design incorporates the old and the new, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Burdman conceded that part of the reason is the prohibitive cost of a full 
period look. But he also thinks that the combination may make the production 
more accessible. "You walk anywhere in L.A. and see the old and new in 
architecture and clothes," he said. "Much of the staging comes out of that 
idea." 
</P>
<P>
 The same notion will carry over into "Measure for Measure," which is directed 
by Dudley Knight, the head of acting for UCI's drama department. 
</P>
<P>
 "The designers have created a brilliant blending of historic and modern 
elements that help free us from viewing these masterworks as history and allows 
us to appreciate the validity of Shakespeare's point of view in our time," 
Knight said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although "Measure for Measure" was chosen to contrast with the weightiness of 
"Hamlet," it's not considered one of Shakespeare's lighter comedies. The play 
has long been recognized for its dark humor and cynicism. That's not 
surprising; the plot, after all, revolves around an immoral magistrate who 
tries to use his position to seduce a beautiful young woman. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not in the vein of unalloyed laughter characteristic of earlier 
comedies," Knight said. "Rather, it is a scathing indictment of moral hypocrisy 
. . . in which Shakespeare embraces the dark and light of human nature." 
</P>
<P>
 Smiles are even more unlikely at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 "Macbeth" is all gloom and grimace as Lady Macbeth stirs at the caldron of her 
own deceptions and, as Shakespeare ruminates on the taint of guilt, Macbeth 
himself stumbles to madness. In short, it's the stuff of tragedy that the Bard 
is famous for. 
</P>
<P>
 James Taulli, the graduate student who directs, turned metaphorical when 
describing his take on "Macbeth." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like the fires of hell breaking through the fragile crust of the earth," 
he said. "This play reminds us of how easily we succumb to the evils of power. 
</P>
<P>
 "How, with just a few promises of greatness, we can be led into darkness, 
swallowed up and transformed." 
</P>
<P>
 * UC Irvine's "Measure for Measure" opens tonight at 7 and continues Saturday, 
Tuesday and Thursday at 7 p.m. and April 30 at 2 p.m. "Hamlet" opens Saturday 
at 2 p.m. and continues Sunday at 2 p.m. and April 29 and 30 at 7 p.m. Both 
productions are in the Fine Arts Concert Hall, UC Irvine. $6 to $14. (714) 
856-6616 or (714) 856-5000. * Cal State Fullerton's "Macbeth" opens tonight at 
8 and continues Saturday and Thursday through April 30 at 8 p.m.; April 30 at 
2:30 p.m.; and Sunday and May 1 at 5 p.m. at the CSUF Performing Arts Center's 
Little Theater, 800 N. State College Blvd., Fullerton. $6 to $8. (714) 
773-3371.

ANIMATION REVIEW; FESTIVAL DRAWS ON BRITISH HUMOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Recent shorts by British animators dominate the new "Spike & Mike's Festival 
of Animation" (opening today at the Edwards Mesa Cinema in Costa Mesa), 
including Nick Park's "The Wrong Trousers," which won the Academy Award for 
animated short earlier this year, and two other Oscar nominees: "Blindscape" by 
Stephen Palmer and Mark Baker's "The Village."  
</P>
<P>
 "Wrong Trousers" continues the misadventures of Wallace, the genially 
befuddled inventor, and his shrewd dog, Gromit, from Park's Oscar-nominated "A 
Grand Day Out." A clever spoof of '40s detective movies, "Trousers" pits the 
resourceful Gromit against the sinister penguin jewel thief "Feathers" McGraw. 
</P>
<P>
 Park set a new standard for subtle animation of stop-motion clay figures in 
his previous Oscar-winner, "Creature Comforts." The often hilarious expressions 
he gives Gromit represent a refinement of his technique. 
</P>
<P>
 The other Oscar nominees look less impressive. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Blindscape," Palmer uses nicely rendered, colored pencil drawings to 
suggest the images created by sounds in the mind of a blind man, but the film 
suffers from a weak story and uncertain tone. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Village," Baker's tale of covert passion in a tiny hamlet, repeats the 
simple, absurd drawing style of his Oscar nominee, "The Hill Farm," but not its 
warmth and charm. In "Hill Farm," Baker made the plight of his silly little 
animals and people seem compelling; the loves and hates of his villagers lack 
that sense of urgency. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Joanna Quinn offers a barbed satire of England's colonial past in "Britannia" 
(England). Markedly superior to her previous sexist rants, "Britannia" features 
some of the most interesting drawn animation in the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Another institution gets its knocks in "Jurassic Park" (United States), a rock 
video to the "Weird Al" Yankovic song that combines clay and drawn animation. 
Despite some funny moments, "Park" is closer in tone and technical 
sophistication to "Pee-wee's Playhouse" than "Wrong Trousers." 
</P>
<P>
 "Festival" also includes "Five Female Persuasions" (United States), a student 
film that amounts to a drawn-out attempt to update Thurber's cartoon series 
"The Masculine Approach," plus the previously reviewed "N'Cest Pas" (United 
States) and "Legacy" (United States). 
</P>
<P>
 * "Spike & Mike's Festival of Animation" continues through June 2 in tandem 
with "Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation" at the Edwards Mesa Cinema, 1884 
Newport Blvd., Costa Mesa. (714) 646-5025.

GANG MEMBER CONVICTED IN TEEN'S MURDER; VERDICT: JURORS TAKE ONLY TWO HOURS TO 
FIND MIGUEL CAMARENA, 19, GUILTY IN FEBRUARY, 1993, SHOOTING OF STUDENT NEAR 
SANTA ANA'S CENTURY HIGH SCHOOL. 
</P>

<P>
 A jury took just two hours Thursday to convict a gang member of first-degree 
murder for shooting a teen-age soccer player near Century High School, a 
killing that has come to symbolize senseless gang violence on city streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Miguel Camarena, 19, faces life in prison without the possibility of parole 
when he is sentenced later this year for the Feb. 26, 1993, murder of Jose Luis 
Lopez, 17, who was shot in the head as he drove to school. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court jurors rejected defense arguments that Camarena 
is mentally retarded and never intended to kill the teen-ager. Camarena was 
also convicted of lying in wait for his victim and committing a gang-related 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "The jury felt he knew what he was doing and intended to do it," said Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Marc Rozenberg. "They felt that Mr. Camarena was very street-smart, 
very streetwise and knew exactly what he was doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Two days before the shooting, Camarena lost a fistfight with the victim's 
brother. Rozenberg offered jurors a lesson in gang life during the two-week 
trial, explaining that Camarena was following a key tenet of street justice 
that requires gang members to "pay back" perceived wrongs. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior and a varsity soccer player, Jose Lopez watched but did not 
participate in the fight, Rozenberg said. Even though Camarena's gripe was with 
Adrian Lopez, he shot Jose Lopez, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender James Appel said he was surprised by the swiftness of 
the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he believes jurors were eager to convict his client because he was 
involved in gangs -- despite his plea that jurors decide the case on the facts 
before them and not on any notions about gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think juries are so caught up in this gang stuff, they absolutely refuse to 
treat these kids as individuals," Appel said. "Maybe that's what happened in 
this case." 
</P>
<P>
 Camarena is mentally retarded and had only armed himself to discourage another 
fight, the defense attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was not trying to kill anyone," Appel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Appel said he hopes his client will be spared state prison and will be 
sentenced instead to the California Youth Authority because Camarena was a 
juvenile when the murder took place. Camarena was ordered to stand trial as an 
adult. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge James A. Jackman is expected to sentence 
Camarena later this year after CYA staff performs a sentencing evaluation on 
Camarena. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial offered a close examination of the harsh life on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 After his brother was shot in the head, Adrian Lopez ran to the high school, 
crying out that his brother had been shot. Rozenberg said gang members at the 
school just laughed. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are we as a society going to allow?" Rozenberg asked jurors during his 
closing argument. "They laugh when people die. They think it is funny." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez was the fourth Southland student to die by gunfire in the month leading 
up to his death, and the shooting was the eighth near Orange County schools in 
the 1992-93 school year.

FINALLY, EVERYTHING'S IGUANA BE ALL RIGHT; PETS: IGORA'S FEELING FINE NOW, 
AFTER SURGERY TO REMOVE A STONE AND A GENDER. AND HER FRIENDS AT SCHOOL 
COULDN'T BE HAPPIER.  
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 This is a story of a much-loved, gender-confused iguana that mistook a rock 
for a raspberry and nearly died. 
</P>
<P>
 And, thanks to a local veterinarian who donated his surgical skills to save 
the iguana, this tale has a happy ending. 
</P>
<P>
 Igora the iguana, the three-foot-long mascot of the Orange County Children's 
Mental Health Clinic in Mission Viejo and surrogate pet to hundreds of children 
served by the county-run clinic, paid a return visit to her savior Thursday. 
The lizard, along with about 20 county mental health workers, surprised 
veterinarian Doug Coward with cake and flowers to say thanks. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a former schoolteacher, I know the kind of bond that exists between 
children and classroom pets," said Coward, who successfully extricated the rock 
from the lizard's belly last February. "Igora gave me quite a few gray hairs, 
but I'm glad she made it." 
</P>
<P>
 Once known as Igor, the plump, green iguana lives in a special terrarium at 
the clinic, which is at Los Alisos Intermediate School. It is a reptilian 
fantasyland, built inside an eight-foot-wide pagoda complete with waterfall and 
pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the kids get out of school at 3 p.m., they run to Igora," said Linda 
Rappaport, county chief of children's services. "She's a very mellow pet and is 
great with the children. With all the publicity over 'Jurassic Park,' they 
think of her as a little dinosaur." 
</P>
<P>
 More than just a mascot, Igora has therapeutic value for the children who 
visit the clinic. Some youngsters are being treated for physical abuse; others 
have problems ranging from attention deficit disorder to more severe mental 
disorders. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she is not used in therapy or other treatment at the clinic, Igora's 
presence carries many of the values of pet therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the kids who come to us don't have friends or pets," Rappaport said. 
"They talk to Igora and tell her secrets, and she listens. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quite a few of our kids developed a feeling for animals because of Igora and 
are on the road to developing social skills," she said. "Igora is really a link 
for the children." 
</P>
<P>
 When the lizard turned up a snout to its usual diet of carrots, green beans 
and broccoli in January, the clinic staff grew worried. 
</P>
<P>
 X-rays revealed a large stone in her belly. Staff members speculate that the 
iguana -- then known as Igor -- gobbled up the rock, mistaking it for a 
cherished raspberry. 
</P>
<P>
 But the X-rays also revealed something that gave clinic staffers a double 
shock. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Igor needed to be renamed Igora. Second, she was pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 This carried serious implications because the many, infertile eggs carried by 
Igora would make it difficult for the veterinarian to operate. Fortunately, 
Igora reabsorbed many of her eggs, freeing Coward to perform surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Was he certain Igora would recover? "I found another green lizard just like 
her as a backup," Coward said. "We named him Igor." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Igora sports a four-inch scar on her stomach, with stitches still 
intact. She has made a full recovery of her health and sunny disposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to think reptiles didn't do anything and hung around in the ooze," 
Rappaport said. "When the kids pet her, I swear, you can actually see Igora 
smile."

COUNTY TREASURER SAYS THIS RACE WILL BE HIS LAST; GOVERNMENT: ROBERT L. CITRON 
CITES THE EMOTIONAL TOLL STEMMING FROM THE CONTROVERSY OVER HIS INVESTMENT 
STRATEGIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Acknowledging that recent controversy surrounding his aggressive investment 
tactics has been painful to him and his wife, County Treasurer Robert L. Citron 
said Thursday that this will be his last campaign for the job he has held since 
1970. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be my last term," the 69-year-old Citron said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron, whose investment tactics have been put under scrutiny for the first 
time as he faces his first challenger in 24 years, said the recent turn of 
events had taken an emotional toll on him and his wife, Terry. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife and I have a very loving relationship and I'm not going to put her 
through this again," said Citron, the only Democrat currently holding elective 
office in county government. "This tears her up. And it tears me up." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, Terry Citron said she was furious over the recent criticism 
of her husband of nearly 39 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes me so mad," she said. "I'm more bothered than he is. He's not making 
risky deals. He wouldn't do that. That'd kill him." 
</P>
<P>
 By using aggressive -- but potentially lucrative -- investments known as 
"derivatives" and "reverse repurchase agreements," Citron has consistently 
earned among the highest returns in the state on money he manages for Orange 
County and 185 other California cities, school districts and governmental 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 As treasurer, Citron is responsible for investing the county's operating and 
capital improvement funds, as well as its pension funds. His impressive track 
record, known up and down the state, has attracted the funds of almost every 
municipality in the county to the investment pool he heads. 
</P>
<P>
 His opponent, Republican John Moorlach, a certified public accountant and 
financial planner, has charged that Citron's investment strategies are too 
risky, contending that the recent rise in interest rates could result in 
substantial losses of taxpayer money. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although Citron has been forced to come up with $215 million in "collateral 
calls" to back up the investments in recent weeks, he said he has taken no 
undue risks with public funds. Over the past nine months -- a shaky economic 
period at best -- the county's $7.5-billion portfolio has earned a laudable 
7.8% return, Citron said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his average rate of return over the past decade is 9.03%, twice that 
of a comparable state investment fund. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, Citron was honored by the County Board of Supervisors for 
generating enough interest revenue through his investments to bankroll a new 
gang suppression program run by the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 First elected as tax collector in 1970, Citron became treasurer when the Board 
of Supervisors combined the two positions in 1973. Since that first race, he 
has never again faced an opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent dispute has garnered the attention of the Wall Street Journal, 
which has published a pair of stories on Citron and his investments in recent 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorlach said he was not surprised by Citron's decision not to seek office 
again because of the veteran treasurer's age. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless he's going to turn into a Tom Riley (who is a county supervisor) and 
do this for life, I wouldn't expect him to run after this," Moorlach said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorlach also stepped up his criticism Thursday of Citron by demanding more 
public documents from the treasurer's office. After picking up 700 pages of 
investment data from Citron's office Monday in order to analyze the portfolio, 
the challenger requested more documentation and accused Citron of mounting "a 
campaign of belligerence and intimidation toward anyone who questions his 
high-risk investment strategies." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorlach said there were "several indicators in leading national financial 
publications which simply cast a shadow of doubt on Citron's investment 
strategies."

ACTIVIST CELES KING ROBBED, BADLY BEATEN; CRIME: THE 70-YEAR-OLD FORMER NAACP 
LEADER, ATTACKED IN THE WILSHIRE DISTRICT, IS REPORTED IN SERIOUS CONDITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Celes King III, a prominent activist and businessman in the Los Angeles black 
community, was in serious condition at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center on 
Thursday after he was beaten and robbed in the Wilshire district, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 70-year-old bail bondsman -- former president of the Los Angeles Human 
Relations Commission and the Los Angeles chapter of the National Assn. for the 
Advancement of Colored People -- suffered severe head injuries and other wounds 
in the pre-dawn attack, said Adelaida De la Cerda, a spokeswoman for the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing their continuing investigation, police provided few details about the 
incident, saying only that King was attacked somewhere between his home in the 
Country Club Park area and the corner of 3rd Street and Ardmore Avenue -- a 
distance of about two miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Police declined to say whether King was in his car when the assailant -- 
described as a black man in his 30s, armed with a handgun -- approached him 
about 2:45 a.m. Officers refused to say whether the man used his fists or a 
weapon in the attack, but a doctor's description of the injuries suggested that 
some sort of sharp weapon may have been used. 
</P>
<P>
 The man fled with an undetermined amount of cash, detectives said. King 
summoned a cab at 3rd and Ardmore and had the driver take him to his bail bond 
office on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. Members of his staff said he went 
directly to a home behind his office, and the woman who lives there summoned 
police and paramedics. The paramedics took King to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 King's physician, Dr. James Mays, said the bail bondsman suffered at least two 
puncture wounds -- one to the shoulder and the other to the neck or to the side 
of his face. 
</P>
<P>
 Mays said King also suffered a concussion from "a tremendous blunt-force 
trauma to his head. We don't know how long he was unconscious." 
</P>
<P>
 X-rays show no bullet wounds, Mays said, but several bones in King's right 
hand are broken. King's brain scan appeared normal, but it is too early to say 
whether he will have a full recovery because of his age, the physician said. 
</P>
<P>
 King's office on King Boulevard is connected to offices of the state Congress 
on Racial Equality, which King heads. CORE volunteer Dennis Schatzman said 
Thursday that many of King's associates have been concerned for some time about 
his safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was often out late at night," said Schatzman, a staff writer for the Los 
Angeles Sentinel, a weekly newspaper. "It's the nature of the (bail bond) 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 Mays said King's family and friends believe he could have been trying to lead 
his assailant away from his home when he was assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
 Schatzman said a contractor working on King's offices reported recently that 
he had seen a suspicious-looking man, apparently casing the office or checking 
on King's movements. 
</P>
<P>
 Staffers in King's office and other business people in the neighborhood said 
King was known to regularly carry large amounts of cash, up to $5,000. They 
also mentioned that he carried a pistol. 
</P>
<P>
 The heavyset bail bondsman made no secret of being armed, writing in a recent 
essay, "I carry a Smith & Wesson .38-caliber Model 60 revolver." 
</P>
<P>
 In another essay, published last year, King wrote that with "crime in L.A. at 
an all-time high . . . Los Angeles is in a crisis situation." Arguing for a 
larger police force here, he added, "Increasing security in the Southland is a 
must."  
</P>
<P>
 Sheila Randle, a family friend, said she thought the attack on King "was a 
random robbery." 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to keep in mind the element he works with," she said. "But none of 
his clients he has bailed out of jail would harm him." 
</P>
<P>
 King, a longtime Republican Party activist in the African American community, 
had been at a reception for Gov. Pete Wilson on Wednesday, Schatzman said. The 
bail bondsman's movements were difficult to trace after that, the CORE 
volunteer said. King was seen in his office late Wednesday night, but it was 
unknown how long he remained, Schatzman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack on King came two days before the 9th annual parade here honoring 
Martin Luther King Jr. The event, founded by King, had been scheduled for 
January but was postponed because of the Jan. 17 earthquake.

WIND SAYS KOON GAVE AN ORDER TO STRIKE KING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN L. MITCHELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The second phase of the trial of Rodney G. King's lawsuit began Thursday with 
one of the former officers acquitted of criminal charges in King's beating 
testifying that he struck and kicked King on the orders of his superior. 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy E. Wind, who was a rookie on the night of the March 3, 1991, beating 
in Lake View Terrace, said he struck King nine or 10 times with his baton and 
kicked him six times after hearing Sgt. Stacey C. Koon say, "Hit him! Hit him!" 
</P>
<P>
 Wind said he hit King, who was attempting to push up from the ground, to keep 
him down. 
</P>
<P>
 Wind, who was acquitted of criminal charges in two previous trials, spoke 
confidently to the jurors, at one point leaving the stand to demonstrate kicks 
used by officers to subdue King. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time he had testified in court about his participation in the 
beating. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the jury concluded the first phase of the trial, determining that 
the city owed King $3.8 million for his injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Wind's testimony followed opening statements by both sides in the second phase 
of the lawsuit -- being heard by the same seven-woman, three-man jury that 
heard the first phase. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel is to determine whether punitive damages will be assessed against 15 
present and former officers, including former Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, and 
former officers Wind, Koon, Theodore J. Briseno and Laurence M. Powell. 
</P>
<P>
 Under questioning from King's attorney, Wind said he had seen Powell strike 
King in the face. It was Powell who administered the most blows to King. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw the end of (Powell's) baton hit Mr. King in the right cheek," said 
Wind, adding that King was in a "push-up position." 
</P>
<P>
 As officers swarmed around, Wind testified, he could hear Koon yell out the 
order to hit King. Wind's testimony was the first attributing such an order to 
Koon, who was not in court during the testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 In elaborating on his interaction with King, Wind said: "I was using my foot 
to try to push him back on the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the jury was called in to start the second phase, Powell's attorneys 
told U.S. District Judge John G. Davies that their client would invoke his 5th 
Amendment protection against self-incrimination in the trial. Koon's lawyers 
are concerned that his comments might be used against him in the pending appeal 
of his federal conviction for violating King's civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell and Koon, who was also convicted last year of violating King's civil 
rights, are serving 30-month prison sentences. Powell's lawyers argued that he 
cannot be compelled to testify until all appeals of his civil rights conviction 
are resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 But Davies said he would allow Powell to take the stand. The judge said he 
will decide what questions Powell can answer on an individual basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening statements began with an attorney for King promising to call expert 
witnesses to testify about the Christopher Commission's findings that the 
Police Department has a history of committing abuses, particularly against 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the defense praised the officers' actions during King's arrest, 
saying he was a fleeing felony suspect considered to be under the influence of 
drugs. They blamed his injuries, in part, on the Police Department's decision 
to ban the controversial chokehold that would have helped to subdue him. 
</P>
<P>
 Briseno has filed a countersuit against King, contending that he was knocked 
on the ground and injured by King while trying to handcuff him. The jury also 
will settle that claim. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Koon, Gates and one of the 10 bystander officers at the scene 
of the beating were not in court Thursday. The bystander officers are accused 
in King's suit of failing to stop the beating. 
</P>
<P>
 The punitive damage phase began with no new efforts to settle the case out of 
court. A lawyer for Powell said his client and the other officers accused in 
the case are broke and cannot pay King any money. 
</P>
<P>
 But King's lawyer, Milton Grimes, disagreed: "I believe their net worth is 
going to be over $1 million," he said.

MALL TO GET THEATERS; CITY TO BE PAID ; NEIGHBORHOODS: TENTATIVE COMPROMISE 
WOULD END STALEMATE OVER BALDWIN HILLS CENTER. MULTIPLEX IS SEEN AS KEY TO ITS 
SUCCESS.

 The Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza shopping center will get a long-awaited 
multiscreen movie theater and the city of Los Angeles will get a share of the 
mall's profits under a tentative agreement announced by city officials 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrangement was hailed as a tonic for the drooping fortunes of the first 
major mall in the United States built in a predominantly African American 
community and as insurance that the city will receive a return on its 
decade-long investment in the shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 The tentative pact announced by Stanley Hirsh, chairman of the city Community 
Redevelopment Agency, ends a monthlong feud that began when mall developer 
Alexander Haagen said he was closing the door on his long partnership with the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Haagen company officials said in March that the city lost its 50% claim on the 
plaza's profits, despite its $50-million investment, when the company was sold 
to a real estate investment trust. 
</P>
<P>
 But city lawyers said the change in ownership was largely a paper transfer to 
a publicly traded concern in which Haagen maintained a controlling interest. 
They argued that a previous contract entitled the city to half the proceeds, 
despite the transfer. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Bruning, a vice president of the new Alexander Haagen Properties, denied 
that Haagen had kept his controlling interest in the company. He said that a 
94% interest is now owned by shareholders in the trust's stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruning, who said last month that the city "has no ongoing interest" in the 
mall, said Thursday that there had merely been a misunderstanding and that the 
city is "entitled to 50% of the profit in the center, once the debt expires." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan and others said they were particularly upset by the 
developer cutting them out of the mall operations, because the action came just 
as the CRA was moving ahead to bring a 12-screen movie theater into the 
shopping center, located at Crenshaw and Martin Luther King Jr. boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 The multiplex is widely predicted to help the plaza turn a profit for the 
first time since its 1988 opening. 
</P>
<P>
 Hirsh said the dispute was tentatively resolved with an agreement that assures 
the city will get half the mall's profits. 
</P>
<P>
 It also promises that the city will expedite approval for the multiplex 
theater, which is to be built by a partnership headed by basketball great Magic 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has agreed to let the mall keep all profits, if any, for the next two 
years. The start-up period will give the Haagen company more time to attract 
lucrative tenants and permit a partnership headed by Johnson to establish the 
theaters, Hirsh said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's cool. Everybody is happy," said Hirsh, adding that the tentative 
agreement heads off what could have been a protracted legal struggle. "In two 
years, the city's share will be equal to their share. 
</P>
<P>
 "And in the process, we want people to enjoy the mall and for the mall to 
attract more major tenants." 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents of the affluent Baldwin Hills community have complained that 
they will not shop at the Art Deco shopping complex until it attracts more 
national retailers. Hirsh said that such outlets, including a Gap clothing 
store, are on the way. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement between the CRA and the Haagen trust will not become final until 
it is approved by the agency's board. Officials predicted it could take as much 
as a month to hammer out the details. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials were celebrating Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mayor is very excited," said Riordan's legal counsel, Karen Rotschafer. 
"This is a win for everyone involved. It's a win for the city and a win for the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who represents the Crenshaw area, said the 
theaters will be a "linchpin that will stimulate trade in the rest of the mall 
and create entertainment options that are not available at present in that part 
of the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Haagen company officials could not be reached for comment.

LONG-AWAITED SUPERMARKET PLAN UNVEILED; REDEVELOPMENT: GROUPS CAMPAIGNED 
AGGRESSIVELY FOR A STORE IN SOUTH-CENTRAL. AN ALPHA BETA WILL BE BUILT BY LATE 
NEXT YEAR, OFFICIALS SAY. 
</P>

<P>
 The sun broke through the clouds momentarily Thursday as Food 4 Less and City 
Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas announced plans to build a supermarket at Adams 
Boulevard and Vermont Avenue, a commitment cheered by community residents who 
now see the light at the end of a decade-long tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
 By late next year, a top-of-the-line Alpha Beta supermarket will be on the 
four-acre site, said George Golleher, president of Food 4 Less, which owns the 
property and is negotiating with the Community Redevelopment Agency for some 
adjacent parcels of land. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the home of a small market, the site has been vacant for more than nine 
years, since the store was demolished and Food 4 Less bought the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Southern California Organizing Committee, an activist group 
that draws from local churches, block clubs and community groups, campaigned 
aggressively for a new market, often criticizing both Food 4 Less and 
Ridley-Thomas for delays. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's about time," said Orinio Opinaldo, a member of the activist group. 
"People were dragging their feet and we had to put a fire under them to make it 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, group members turned up the heat, staging slowdowns in 
checkout lines of markets owned by Food 4 Less, confronting Ridley-Thomas at 
community meetings and, last month, gathering to pray in front of his house. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Ridley-Thomas said that although he understands the group's 
impatience, delays were unavoidable. "Remember, there were extensive 
negotiations, changes in the corporate ownership of the site, changes at the 
CRA and changes at the council level," he said. Ridley-Thomas was elected in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were key elements that we pushed for and got, namely, a full-service 
market, joint minority participation and ownership and the preservation of 
adjacent historic homes," Ridley-Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 The minority partner, Brotherhood Crusade President Danny Bakewell, whose 
development company will build the $9-million project, said plans call for a 
40,000-square-foot market with a deli, bakery and pharmacy and an additional 
14,000 square feet for adjoining retail shops, creating about 150 new jobs. 
Bakewell, who began negotiations in 1984 with The Boys markets, now owned by 
Alpha Beta's parent company, Food 4 Less, will be a part owner of the 
development with Alpha Beta. Under CRA guidelines, the project required a 
minority business partner. 
</P>
<P>
 Assembling different parcels of land to make the site large enough required 
the participation of the Community Redevelopment Agency, which owns three 
historic homes on Menlo Avenue adjacent to the Food 4 Less property. 
</P>
<P>
 Once negotiations for the sale of those lots are concluded, the redevelopment 
agency will move and rehabilitate the houses, said Oscar Jauregui, project 
manager of the Hoover Redevelopment Project. The agency also plans to speed up 
a supplemental review of the project to determine how to mitigate potential 
negative effects on the surrounding community. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridley-Thomas said the final round of negotiations will begin today "at a pace 
that will be well-received by the community. We won't tolerate any 
backsliding." 
</P>
<P>
 Father William Delaney, pastor at St. Agnes Church across the street from the 
site and a member of the community activist group, credited Mayor Richard 
Riordan with using his influence to push the project forward, but the mayor was 
happy to spread the praise around. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great morning for all of us," Riordan told the more than 200 people 
who gathered at the site for the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor promised to work with Ridley-Thomas to push through the necessary 
permits and paperwork "in record time." 
</P>
<P>
 Lillian Marenco, a member of the activist group who lives near the site, said 
she hopes a new supermarket will attract more investment in her community. 
"This will give confidence to businesses and bring a good image to our 
community," she said. "That will help us rebuild South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 "We worked so hard to make this happen," she added. "A supermarket is not a 
luxury, it's a great need." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1965 and 1990, the number of supermarkets in South-Central Los Angeles 
dropped from 55 to 30; the area has 25% fewer supermarkets per capita than 
other areas of Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 A study of the neighborhoods around the site prepared for the Coalition of 
Neighborhood Developers, an organization of inner-city nonprofit civic, church 
and economic development agencies, found that the three existing supermarkets 
in the area do not adequately serve the community's needs. 
</P>
<P>
 The predominantly Latino neighborhoods have a population of roughly 140,000, 
with 31% living below the poverty line. The median household income of $16,619 
is less than half the county level. 
</P>
<P>
 Many families are forced to rely on small neighborhood markets or liquor and 
convenience stores for their shopping, which means they are likely to pay 
higher prices while finding a more limited selection of healthy foods. 
</P>
<P>
 The study found that 46% of the residents do not have access to a car, so they 
must walk or rely on buses when they go shopping; the trip home with armfuls of 
grocery bags can be a daunting and exhausting trek, Marenco said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another study conducted for the Community Redevelopment Agency in 1985 showed 
that the one-square-mile area around the Adams/Vermont site could support at 
least four supermarkets. Construction of a Smart & Final store at Vermont 
Avenue and 36th Street is under way. 
</P>
<P>
 For community residents, the only damper on an otherwise celebratory event was 
the lack of a firm groundbreaking date. But all parties agree: There will be a 
supermarket at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're prepared to do battle until that supermarket is standing," said 
Opinaldo of the activist group.

ROSEANNE ARNOLD DROPS DIVORCE ACTION; TELEVISION: SITCOM STAR SAYS 'NASTY 
GOSSIP AND LIES' HAD PUSHED HER TOWARD BREAKUP. SHE RETRACTS CHARGES THAT SHE 
HAD BEEN ABUSED BY HER HUSBAND, TOM. 
</P>

<P>
 In the most bizarre twist yet in the continuing soap opera surrounding one of 
Hollywood's most controversial couples, Roseanne Arnold on Thursday dropped 
divorce proceedings against her husband, Tom, and withdrew charges that he 
emotionally and physically abused her. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement released by her press agent, Pat Kingsley, Arnold also 
mentioned Tom Arnold's assistant Kim Silva, who was rumored to have had an 
affair with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I must apologize to my husband, Tom, and my dear friend Kim Silva for letting 
outsiders, nasty gossip and lies finally break me down and leave me reeling," 
said Arnold in her statement. "Tom never hurt my children, and often our fights 
in the past have led to physical action which we both are learning to control." 
</P>
<P>
 She continued, "Please forgive me to everyone I love. I just lost it 
completely and found myself camping in the Sequoias. I am off for a much-needed 
rest to attempt to put my marriage and my head back together." 
</P>
<P>
 The withdrawal came a day after Tom Arnold gave several interviews to 
entertainment news outlets saying that the claims of abuse were false and that 
he wanted to reconcile with his wife. He had said she would retract the 
accusations. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, a spokesman for Tom Arnold said, "Tom has seen the retraction and 
finds it a great first step toward a loving and healthy resolution of the 
crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 Roseanne Arnold on Monday had filed divorce proceedings against her husband, 
and said in legal papers that he had abused her throughout their four-year 
marriage. She maintained that her husband "hit me, struck me, has thrown 
objects at me, pinched me and verbally abused me. He has also pushed me against 
walls, while he screams and shouts at me, drowning out any possible pleas that 
I might make for him to stop." 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint said, "I now realize that I am a classic battered and abused 
wife who has tolerated the conduct of (Tom Arnold) only because (Arnold) has 
successfully lowered my self-esteem and reduced me into the realm of 
battered-wife syndrome." 
</P>
<P>
 The news of Roseanne Arnold's retraction left many skeptics in the 
entertainment industry shaking their heads. They said several factors made the 
split appear to be another of the Arnolds' infamous publicity stunts. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Arnold's CBS series, "Tom," is struggling in the ratings. Roseanne 
Arnold's hit ABC series, "Roseanne," finished filming last week, but fell below 
"Home Improvement" as television's most popular show. Her recent book, "My 
Lives," did not sell as well as expected. A loud argument between the couple 
was observed by several witnesses Friday on the set of "Roseanne." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's indicative of their entire careers that they play out this whole marital 
high drama in public," said one insider. "They're constantly creating theater. 
Either she was lying or she was telling the truth and has gone back into a bad 
marriage, which is one of the symptoms of a battered wife." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not surprised," said another source. "They're experts at doing this, 
making the media jump through hoops." 
</P>
<P>
 For a week, the story of the abuse accusations and the pending divorce was the 
focus of radio and television news shows around the country. KCBS Channel 2 
news on Wednesday made Roseanne Arnold's "surprise" appearance at the couple's 
Brentwood home its top news story. She supposedly was to have been on a 
European vacation at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold's popularity gave her enough power to influence executives at ABC and 
CBS to pluck her husband out of relative obscurity and make him the star of two 
network series. One, "The Jackie Thomas Show," failed, and "Tom" is unlikely to 
be renewed for next fall.

ELECTIONS / DISTRICT 43 STATE ASSEMBLY; DEEP-POCKETED CONSERVATIVES BACK ROGAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four Republican millionaires, who spent $2.2 million on GOP candidates and 
conservative causes in 1992, are now committed to help finance the campaign of 
Municipal Judge James Rogan as he seeks a Glendale-Burbank-based state Assembly 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're prepared to back Rogan all the way," said Danielle Madison, executive 
director of Allied Business PAC, a political action committee with a 
conservative, Christian fundamentalist agenda, established two years ago by 
state Sen. Rob Hurtt (R-Garden Grove) and now controlled by the four wealthy 
businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rogan is a wonderful candidate . . . and a family man," said Madison, who 
added that Allied is prepared to help finance Rogan throughout the entire 
bewildering array of elections this year for the 43rd District assembly seat, 
formerly held by Pat Nolan. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Rogan is running virtually neck and neck in fund raising with two 
other candidates in the May 3 election, according to campaign-finance reports 
filed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan, a Republican, has raised a total of $82,200; Julia Wu, a Republican and 
a trustee on the Los Angeles Community College Board, has raised $88,600, and 
Democrat Adam Schiff, a former federal prosecutor, has raised $84,600. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the upcoming special election is to fill the vacancy created 
Feb. 18 by Nolan's resignation after the veteran lawmaker pleaded guilty to one 
count of racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven candidates are running in the election. If any candidate gets more than 
50% of the vote, he or she will immediately take over the seat. If none gets a 
majority, the top two vote-getters from each party will compete in a runoff 
June 28. 
</P>
<P>
 The special election is designed to fill the vacant seat until Dec. 5, when 
the current term expires. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the procedure for choosing who will get the full two-year term that 
begins Dec. 5 is already in motion. The primary election to choose candidates 
for that race will take place June 7, with a runoff on Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the Allied PAC and its four members spent $2,241,121 on campaigns up 
and down the state, according to a 1993 California Common Cause report that 
also identified Allied as the fourth-largest contributor to state legislative 
races that year. In 1993, the group spent $600,000 on six special elections, 
Madison said. 
</P>
<P>
 Allied gave $2,500 to the Rogan campaign while $1,000 was contributed by 
Hurtt, who founded the PAC, and another $1,000 by his wife, Nancy. Also 
contributing $1,000 each were PAC members Roland Hinz of Mission Hills, owner 
of Daisy/Hi-Torque Publications, which publishes motorcycle magazines, and 
Edward Atsinger of Camarillo, part owner of Salem Communications, a 
broadcasting company that owns more than a dozen Christian radio stations 
nationwide, including KKAL-AM in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 Fieldstead & Co., controlled by Robert Ahmanson, another Allied members, gave 
$1,000. Ahmanson is an heir to the Ahmanson Savings and Loan fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, $1,000 each was contributed by Ahmanson's wife, Roberta, and Hinz's 
wife, Lila. 
</P>
<P>
 The total from all these sources is $9,500. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth member of the Allied Business PAC is Rich Riddle of Arcadia, owner 
of a manufacturing company. He had not contributed to the campaign as of 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Allied group's contributions represented slightly more than 10% of Rogan's 
war chest of $82,200. 
</P>
<P>
 A California Common Cause report called Allied's 1992 campaign-finance 
activities historic. Never before had an "ideological" group broken into the 
ranks of the state's top 10 contributors, the report asserted. Allied-backed 
candidates are typically strong conservatives, often Christian fundamentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan himself, for example, opposes abortion rights and spousal benefits for 
gay couples and backs a voucher program to support private-school tuition. "But 
he's not at the far end of the spectrum on any of these issues," said Sheila 
McNichols, Rogan's campaign manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan said he was proud and grateful to have the support of the Allied group. 
"I'm just confused about how the so-called liberal lawyer Rogan got the support 
of the Allied when the conservative Republican Wu did not," Rogan quipped 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan was referring to a Wu campaign mailer that noted that Rogan had been a 
Democratic Party activist until the late 1980s, when he re-registered as a 
Republican. Her campaign literature called Rogan a "liberal lawyer" while 
characterizing herself as a "conservative Republican." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the campaign reports filed Thursday showed that Wu, who is one of 
the most prominent female Asian-American Republican officeholders in the state, 
has a strong fund-raising base in the Asian-American community. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Schiff's money has come from a $50,000 loan from his family. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Department Officer Peter Repovich, who is not running in 
the 43rd District special election but is a Republican candidate in the June 7 
primary, was not required to file a campaign statement Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Repovich has raised more than $350,000 to run in the regular election race, 
$275,000 of it in a loan from a friend.

2 ACCUSED OF BILKING INVESTORS IN ARTWORK; CRIME: CHATSWORTH DEALER AND SHERMAN 
OAKS LAWYER ARE CHARGED. POLICE SAY CLIENTS LOST NEARLY $1 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An art dealer and an attorney were charged Thursday with bilking clients out 
of nearly $1 million in fraudulent art investments, authorities said. The two 
men are suspected by police of also defrauding other victims in the elaborate 
scheme that lasted at least several years. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Lawrence Stephen Miller of Sherman Oaks and Chatsworth art dealer 
Robert Kenneth Goldman posted $100,000 bail each Thursday, one day after they 
were arrested at their homes on suspicion of grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller was indicted 10 years ago on charges of being involved in what the FBI 
described at the time as "the largest nationwide narcotics investigation ever." 
He was identified by authorities as the lawyer who arranged the acquisition of 
a tuna boat allegedly used for smuggling drugs, but the charges were later 
dropped on a technicality, according to authorities and Miller's lawyer at the 
time, Harland Braun. 
</P>
<P>
 But now police are on Miller's trail once again, trying to determine if there 
are other victims of what they say was a scheme to take people's money under 
the guise of using it to buy -- and then sell for profit -- the works of German 
contemporary artist Gerhard Richter. 
</P>
<P>
 What Miller and Goldman actually were doing, police say, was running a 
sophisticated Ponzi scheme in which they paid out just enough "profits" to 
clients out of their own pockets so the clients would then make large 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
 "They sucked them in deeper and deeper while making it look good," said 
Detective Bill Martin, an investigator with the Los Angeles Police Department's 
Art Theft Detail. "In the end, they walked away with a million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe there are a lot more victims out there," Martin said. "We believe 
there are other investors that haven't come forward. We know of several." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller and Goldman allegedly told clients they had a direct relationship with 
Richter, but police said the artist had nothing to do with the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, the State Bar of California moved to disbar Miller for "conduct 
involving moral turpitude which extended over a six-year period of time," even 
after he promised to "deal with his gambling addiction which was the cause of 
most of his professional failings," according to bar association documents. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the height of his addiction, (Miller) was placing wagers of between 
$30,000-$40,000 on a weekly basis," and using his client's money to cover his 
other expenses, according to the bar association's Oct. 25 decision to 
recommend disbarment. "(Miller) knew what he was doing was wrong, but that he 
could not help himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller admitted to 22 acts of willful misconduct, including "misappropriating 
tens of thousands of dollars of his clients' funds for his own personal use," 
and writing 455 checks to clients that ultimately bounced, said the decision, 
written by state Bar Court Judge Michael E. Wine. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller ultimately sought help from a therapist and Gamblers Anonymous. 
"Originally, (Miller) was able to excuse his behavior by paying back his 
clients; however, over time, (Miller) felt more remorse, referring to himself 
as a 'scumbag' in his therapy sessions," according to Wine's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller submitted his resignation in December before he could be formally 
disbarred. The resignation becomes effective April 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the police investigation continues, and Martin said he and 
Detective Barbara Bella are pursuing leads gleaned from business records seized 
at the homes and offices of Miller and Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Miller nor Goldman could be reached for comment. Braun, in an 
interview, said although he has represented Miller in the past, he was 
"definitely not representing him this time." 
</P>
<P>
 One suspected victim of the investment scheme, police say, is Woodland Hills 
real estate agent Adam Sharon, who said he's out almost $200,000, even though 
he checked out the two men thoroughly before investing -- including calling the 
bar association. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a total sucker," Sharon, 49, said in an interview. "This involved 
something very elaborate." 
</P>

 Miller, 46, and Goldman, 44, made at least 33 transactions with five victims, 
one of whom has since died, authorities said. Besides Sharon, the victims 
included a 73-year-old West Los Angeles man who has claimed he lost $580,000 to 
Goldman and Miller between 1991 and 1993, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller faces 12 counts of grand theft and Goldman faces 11. Their arraignment 
is set for May 11. The case is being handled by the district attorney's 
office's Organized Crime Unit. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men persuaded their clients to invest by bringing them to opulent 
offices, police said, and telling them the money would be placed in an 
independent trust to invest in Richter's artwork. 
</P>
<P>
 But by last fall, at least one client -- Sharon -- became suspicious and 
confronted Miller when he found he couldn't get money from the investment 
trusts. Sharon said Miller promised to pay him back his investment money in 
installments, but never did. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the money was supposed to go into segregated trust accounts," said 
Sharon. 
</P>
<P>
 One source close to the investigation speculated that Richter was a good 
artist to use unwittingly in such a scheme because he worked in another country 
but had enough name recognition here so the value of his artwork could be 
verified by prospective clients. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pretty sophisticated. And it worked for a long time," said Martin. 
"This took place over a period of years." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin said that all the investors checked out the two men as best they could. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every one of them was sophisticated enough to have it checked out, not 
knowing this guy was a crook," he said of Miller. "They did their homework; 
they called the bar association and found out he was legit. However, they were 
wrong."

MAN GUILTY ON 1 THEFT COUNT IN RUBY CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN W. O'NEILL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Woodland Hills man accused of stealing a $1-million, 6.76-carat Burmese ruby 
was found guilty Thursday of grand theft as a convoluted case known around the 
courthouse as "The Great Ruby Caper" drew to a close. 
</P>
<P>
 Jewelry broker Ali Reza Paravar, 42, faces up to five years in state prison 
after being convicted of the most serious charge against him. Although Paravar 
did not actually steal the rare, blood-red stone known as the "Mona Lisa of 
rubies," his actions qualify as theft because he was holding the jewel and did 
not return it to the rightful owner, prosecutor Ed Abele argued in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys in the case declined to comment Thursday because the jury still is 
deliberating other counts against other defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury of six women and six men today resume deliberating counts against 
Rasekh Uddin Siddiqui, 46, of Chatsworth and Behzad Saba, 33, of Irvine, who 
are accused of receiving stolen property in connection with a scheme to sell 
the stolen ruby back to its original owner for $360,000. They insisted they 
were merely acting as middlemen to help the owner retrieve his prized gem. 
</P>
<P>
 In delivering its guilty verdict, the jury appeared to reject defense 
arguments that the case was nothing more than a business dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 The caper came to light last summer when nearly two dozen law enforcement 
officials, backed up by a police helicopter, arrested five men in an Encino 
parking lot following a sting operation. The ruby's original owner had agreed 
to meet the defendants to buy back the gem. Police found the ruby in Paravar's 
pocket during the raid. 
</P>
<P>
 According to testimony, German gem trader Peter Morlock gave the ruby in 1990 
to a man named Ron Levi to sell on consignment. The agreement called for Levi 
to either return the stone within two days or pay Morlock $527,000. Instead, 
the charismatic Levi gave the gem to Paravar -- a move defense attorneys 
claimed was common practice among jewel wholesalers. 
</P>
<P>
 Paravar testified that he refused to return the ruby to Morlock because Levi 
owed him $300,000 and had given him the gem as collateral. When Paravar refused 
to hand over the gem, Morlock went to police in October, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 As the police investigation began, Levi disappeared. He has not been charged 
in Los Angeles, but has been indicted by a grand jury in Texas in another 
alleged gem-consignment scam. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial offered a rare glimpse into the close-knit downtown Jewelry Mart, 
the second-largest jewelry district in the nation, which has been described as 
a shadowy world where consignment transactions are common and multimillion 
dollar deals rest on a handshake.

WAS NIXON THE ONE?; VALLEY TEENS TAKE A VOICE VOTE ON LEADER'S LEGACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The faces were young and unlined, but the argument over presidential right and 
wrong was as old as John Lennon's granny glasses. 
</P>
<P>
 Was Richard Nixon a bad President or was he driven from office by a vindictive 
media who didn't like his politics or his 5 o'clock shadow? 
</P>
<P>
 As the 37th President lay in critical condition in a New York hospital, San 
Fernando Valley high school students who were not yet born when he resigned in 
1974 rehashed the argument over the Watergate controversy that is as much a 
part of Nixon's legacy as fiddling is Nero's. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think Watergate was really that bad," Mike Wenzel, a junior in Ted 
Bennett's Advanced Placement history class at Chatsworth High School, said 
Wednesday. "I believe other Presidents covered up the wrongdoing of their 
friends. Because he got caught, we shouldn't blow it out of proportion." 
</P>
<P>
 But blowing things out of proportion, many students feel, is what the media 
does best. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are the crooks," said Charley Padow, 16, provoking general laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, this anti-media attitude may reflect only the fact that while the 
students don't know all that much about the ex-President, the press and 
television are around them every day. 
</P>
<P>
 "The media is an ongoing thing with them, while Nixon is something they hear 
about in history class," agreed Donna Wyatt, assistant principal. 
</P>
<P>
 So how much do the students know about a man who belongs far more to history 
than to the legion of humorists who once trooped onto TV variety shows and 
shook their jowls and thrust their arms over their heads in that victory salute 
that looked like a man testing the inseams of a new suit? 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth High students demonstrated a broad range of knowledge. Some said he 
stuffed ballot boxes; others thought he personally bugged the Democratic 
National Committee headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know anything about him. Who is he?" one girl asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how many knew what the Watergate controversy was about, 10 of the 25 
students in Bennett's class raised their hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worst thing he did was try to cover up what his friends did and using his 
position of power to obstruct a criminal investigation," prompted Bennett. He 
said he had not yet begun teaching the class about Watergate. 
</P>
<P>
 The history and social studies framework for the Los Angeles Unified School 
District is quite specific about what teachers should emphasize about Nixon and 
Watergate. "Students should understand the events that led to President Nixon's 
resignation, and they should assess the role of the courts, the press and the 
Congress. Students can discuss the continuing issue of unchecked presidential 
power. Are the president and his staff above the law?" 
</P>
<P>
 Esther Taira, a district administrator, said one of the standard texts, "The 
Americans," devotes seven pages to Watergate alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Bennett's students were sympathetic to Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he actually was a good President," said Maya Adrabi. "I think 
(Watergate) was a serious act, but he would have won regardless. It was a 
mistake. He was too insecure." 
</P>
<P>
 The opinions in the school's detention room were more judgmental. "I heard he 
was a bad President," said Scott Dumas, 14, who had run up too many tardies. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Davis, 15, in detention for telling a student that he looked like he 
shopped at the Salvation Army, said Nixon was "a punk, because he broke the 
law. He shouldn't have broken the law. He's the President. We gave him free 
housing and he broke the law." 
</P>
<P>
 Watergate, he said, was "where he had people break into the other party's 
place." That was about as good a description as any that the students came up 
with. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul also agreed that Nixon was right in resigning. OK then, so who was worse, 
the media or Nixon? 
</P>
<P>
 "The media."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; STUDENT GARDENERS GIVE NATURE A HAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gray clouds from an incoming rainstorm didn't stop a Kaiser Elementary School 
fifth-grade class Thursday from planting native California greenery that 
conserves water. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the week, students have quietly transformed a dirt patch in front 
of the campus' staff room into a colorful sea of drought-resistant irises, sage 
and tulips. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, they learned about the environment and got a group lesson in 
gardening. 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt good to be able to help nature," said Travis Eve, 10, of Costa Mesa. 
"I learned it's important to help the environment." 
</P>
<P>
 The plantings provided students with hands-on experience to go along with 
teacher Laurel Ritter's classroom science lectures. The school received a $500 
grant from the Metropolitan Water District that helped pay for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I find when I talk with kids about the Earth is that they are really 
concerned -- in some ways more concerned than the adults," Ritter said. "But as 
kids, they feel powerless to change things. By doing this, they feel like they 
have the power to change." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, this power meant digging holes and gently placing the plants in 
the ground along with some wood chips and water. The garden now includes green 
Mexican mobilas, purple Douglas irises, white and pink autumn sage and purple 
Mexican tulips. 
</P>
<P>
 Ritter hopes the new garden will bloom by the end of May -- just in time for 
parents' night at Kaiser. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, students will periodically measure the growth of the plants. 
</P>
<P>
 "This helps the kids remember" what they are taught, Ritter said of the 
activity. "This gives them a chance to do something to help the Earth." 
</P>
<P>
 Most students expressed excitement at their assignment. But for one 
environmentally aware 10-year-old, drought-resistant plants are old hat. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have these at home. My father taught me how to plant," said Isaias 
Garcilazo of Costa Mesa. "It's nice to see it grow without a lot of water."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; RACIST FLYERS ANSWERED WITH MURAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU PICKEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Students at Marco Forster Middle School are painting away their anger. 
</P>
<P>
 Since racist flyers aimed at Latinos were found throughout the school in 
January, Latino students have responded by painting a mural depicting racial 
unity and American and Mexican themes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel proud because all the stuff that was in the flyer was not true," said 
student painter Leonel Perez, 14. 
</P>
<P>
 "This shows them part of who we are," he said, gesturing toward the bright 
image of an Aztec calendar flanked by the Mexican and United States flags. 
</P>
<P>
 The flyers, which officials believe were the work of a San Diego-based white 
supremacist group, were stuffed in all 1,200 student lockers Jan. 25. Identical 
flyers were found the same day at Laguna Beach High School, and just last week 
anti-Semitic flyers were found inside lockers at two Mission Viejo schools. It 
is not clear, however, whether the latest incident is related to the others. 
</P>
<P>
 The point of the flyers was to "rile kids up and create problems between 
students," said Marc Lavine, Marco Forster's director of in-school detention. 
</P>
<P>
 Mural painter Aaron Mandujano, 13, said the flyers made him "angry inside." A 
friend started to cry after reading the flyer and the two left class and went 
outside to sit on a bench and think about how to respond to the insult. 
</P>
<P>
 Julio Peraza, 14, said he suspected that some white students at the school had 
distributed the flyers. He wanted to fight, but realized fighting could lead to 
"big trouble."  
</P>
<P>
 Instead of brawling, about 30 students came up with the idea of painting a 
mural, and six students have been working on it every day after school and on 
Saturdays for three weeks.  
</P>
<P>
 They hope to finish by May 5, in time for the Cinco de Mayo celebration 
commemorating the victory of a rag-tag Mexican army over superior forces of a 
French invading army in 1862.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's great for the students and it's wonderful to see them develop the 
concentration and the discipline this requires," bilingual instructor's aide 
Andrea Siracusa said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a source of pride and a centering point for them," Lavine said. He added 
that some of the students had a history of truancy and other discipline 
problems, and the mural has given them a chance for positive recognition.  
</P>
<P>
 Prominently displayed in the school's "cafetorium," the mural depicts a 
likeness of Benito Juarez, the first Mexican president of Indian descent, who 
was considered a national hero for leading the war against the French invaders 
from 1862 to 1867. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other end of the mural is a likeness of the Virgin of Guadeloupe, the 
patron saint of Mexico, robed in royal blue and surrounded by bright pink 
flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's my favorite part," said Fabiola Cardenas, 14, pointing her 
paint-stained hands toward the image. 
</P>
<P>
 Next to the Virgin, the students will paint a quote from Juarez that reads: 
"Between individuals as between nations, respect for another's rights is 
peace."MARY LOU PICKEL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA; TUTOR HONORED WITH PRESIDENTIAL AWARD 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rose Espinoza, a computer designer who began an after-school tutoring program 
for needy children in her garage three years ago, will be recognized with a 
presidential Volunteer Action Award today at the White House in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Espinoza, 42, is one of 21 volunteers across the country named as winners of 
the award this year. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton will present the awards, which have been sponsored by the 
Points of Light Foundation for 13 years. The awards recognize people for their 
contributions to their communities and volunteerism, White House officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What Rose does in her neighborhood is representative of what needs to be done 
in communities all over the country," said Jess Sarmiento, a White House aide. 
"She tutors disadvantaged youths who normally would not get that kind of 
attention, and she should be really proud of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Espinoza's garage looks like a classroom, complete with chalkboards, desks and 
book-filled shelves. Many of the children in her poor Fifth Avenue neighborhood 
get little help with their schoolwork at home because their parents speak 
little English. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to tutoring elementary, middle and high school students, Espinoza 
offers English classes for parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Espinoza, a computer designer at Beckman Instruments in Brea, said her 
tutoring program helps her students boost their grades and motivates them to 
learn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe I'm getting this award," Espinoza said last week upon being 
notified of her selection. "All I did was move back to the neighborhood where I 
grew up to help out." MIMI KO

<P>
 A Brentwood doctor was convicted Thursday on 10 counts of sexually assaulting 
his female patients, but a jury deadlocked on eight other counts and acquitted 
the doctor on two remaining charges.

<P>
 In all, Lavi was convicted of three counts of genital penetration by a foreign 
object, three misdemeanor counts of sexual battery, two counts of sexual 
battery on an institutionalized person, and two counts of rape of an

SPEAKING UP : A LOOK AT NOTEWORTHY ADDRESSES IN THE SOUTHLAND.  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Santa Monica City Councilman Tony Vasquez spoke Tuesday at Loyola Marymount 
University on Westside Latinos and the Political Landscape of Los Angeles 
County. His remarks were sponsored by the Loyola Marymount University Chicano 
studies department. From his address: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Latino Role Models 
</P>
<P>
 "When I received the (invitation to speak) it was kind of refreshing that 
somebody was taking interest in the Westside, because the focus has always been 
on the Eastside. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I was actually raised on the Westside, between Santa Monica, West Los Angeles 
and Mar Vista. So for me growing up as a kid there weren't really role models. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're sitting in a classroom like this and you're not looking at 
somebody that reflects you and your history and your culture, it's very 
difficult for you or your peers to really feel like there's some hope and a 
chance for you to be in the driver's seat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Growing up here, I didn't have a Chicano, Latino, Central American or South 
American teacher until I got to college. I went through elementary school, 
middle school, high school and even part of my community college days. . . . 
The majority of the folks on the Westside have never seen a Latino professor or 
teacher. Now it's starting to break through but it's still a small percentage. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's more difficult for people of color, specifically Latinos, these 
last 20 years on the Westside than it's been on the Eastside. Because on the 
Eastside there are some role models. Garfield High School is a good example, 
has always had a good presence. Probably not enough in terms of the 
representation that exists in that community, but there's been a presence 
nevertheless. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "The school I taught (at) was actually in unincorporated East Los Angeles. 
These were elementary school kids, third-graders. I happened to be their first 
male Latino at that particular school. They'd had other Mexican American and 
Central American teachers but they'd never had a male. So that was kind of a 
culture shock, I think, for a lot of the kids." On Coalition-Building 
</P>
<P>
 "(Latinos) are going to have the largest group to be coming of age to vote and 
hopefully get involved in civic activities within the community. It's key for 
you as students to look at that and begin to figure out where you want to be in 
that picture and what your role is going to be. . . . We realized that for us 
we needed to get and gain some political power. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "The way it came was through coalition-building. Santa Monica has about 93,000 
people . . . according to the 1990 census. Latinos make up about 13% to 14%. Of 
that number, only about 2% are registered and eligible to vote. So there's no 
way, even if you had everybody voting for you in the Latino community, you're 
going to win an election in Santa Monica.  
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things you need to understand is that when you're dealing with 
coalition-building, it's not just about your little niche. It's talking about 
the wealth and the good of all the people in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need to coalesce with other groups. So you need to identify those other 
groups, whether it's the African American community, the Asian Pacific 
community or the Anglo population. Find the commonalities that you can agree 
upon and then those things that you disagree on and agree to disagree. And 
that's OK. . . . We agree to disagree, we find the commonality and we move 
forward.  
</P>
<P>
 "But without Latinos, specifically on the Westside and in Greater Los Angeles, 
sitting at the table, whether it's on the city council level or at the school 
board level, we're not part of the process. Particular positions and issues as 
they affect our community are not even being heard. . . . We need professional 
role models, at all levels. Unless we're sitting at the table doing that, it's 
not going to happen. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "For the longest time, people have always identified, once again, the Eastside 
and other parts of Los Angeles, and not the Westside, as (having) a large 
number of Latinos. But it doesn't mean a whole lot if we're not taking an 
active role. Looking Ahead

PASSING THE BAR EXAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Of the 7,057 people who took the California State Bar Exam last July, 59.0% 
passed and won the right to practice law. The pass rate was 73.8% among the 
5,254 people taking the exam for the first time. The pass percentage 
traditionally is higher among first-timers than among the total group of 
applicants, which includes people who repeatedly fail the exam. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the statistics compiled by the State Bar of California are comparative 
pass-fail rates for graduates of California-accredited law schools. Shown below 
are results of 
</P>
<P>
 the July exam, with schools ranked according to the percentage of first-time 
applicants passing. 
</P>
<P>
 Also shown are the combined results for first-time applicants taking the 10 
bar exams given over five years--from February, 1989, through July, 1993. 
Statewide, of 21,510 first-time bar applicants during that time, 15,993 or 
74.35%--passed the test. Rankings of unaccredited and correspondence schools 
are not included. Schools listed in bold are in Los Angeles County. STATE

EARTH DAY '94; A GREENER VALLEY; ACTIVISTS REFLECT ON NEED FOR RECRUITS TO THE 
CAUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM and JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Protest marches to planning hearings. Word of mouth to WordPerfect. The 
environmental movement has changed since the first Earth Day 25 years ago, but 
the same issues of pollution, conservation and lack of education still drive 
San Fernando Valley activists. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Valley's foremost activists, the passage of time has also created a 
new predicament: the need for fresh recruits to the cause. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times asked a few of these activists to share their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy Wohlgemuth, conservation chair of the Los Angeles Chapter of the Audubon 
Society, Reseda resident. 
</P>
<P>
 For Wohlgemuth, improving the environment is an attitude problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge began 25 years ago, when he took his family from Reseda to 
Yellowstone National Park. During a hike he discovered an unnatural site that 
would change his life: a beer can in the bottom of a crystal-clear pond. 
</P>
<P>
 "That sort of set the wheels in motion," said Wohlgemuth, a retired 
pharmacist. "I just felt that this was kind of symbolic of the way a lot of 
people feel toward the environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Wohlgemuth has been trying to change people's attitudes ever since, most 
recently with the Los Angeles Chapter of the Audubon Society. 
</P>
<P>
 But the negative attitudes are still there, sometimes uglier than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "Several weeks ago, some kids came in with axes and machetes and tore some 
informational signs on birds off their moorings at the Sepulveda Basin," said 
Wohlgemuth. "They drew swastikas on the dirt and wrote, 'We'll be back.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Jill Swift, founder of the Santa Monica Mountains Task Force of the Sierra 
Club and founder of Friends of Caballero Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, every day for the last 25 years has been Earth Day," said Swift, who 
became an activist after a Sierra Club hike in the mountains 25 years ago. "If 
you get into it, it's like a giant game." 
</P>
<P>
 Swift's opponents in this game are those who would spoil the air and water of 
the Santa Monica Mountains and the Sepulveda Basin. 
</P>
<P>
 As a new grandmother, the retired schoolteacher and Tarzana resident has a new 
concern: Who will play the game in the future to protect her grandson?  
</P>
<P>
 "The motivation for people to get involved has lessened," said Swift, 65. 
"There is less free time. And everything has become more expensive in the 
environmental movement. It costs money to drive places, postage has gone up, 
and most environmental groups do not pay anything for being involved." 
</P>
<P>
 But as long as there is Earth Day, Swift is optimistic that new recruits to 
the environmental movement can be harvested for decades to come. 
</P>
<P>
 "Earth Day stands as a symbol for young people to become educated, and old 
people, too, to take stock of where we are," Swift said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Daniel, chairman of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 If environmental activists in the Valley fear depleting ranks in the future, 
Daniel believes they need look no further than their next-door neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the people who are involved in the environmental movement have at one 
time or another gotten their start with a local homeowner group," said Daniel, 
58, who first became interested in the movement when he bought a hillside home 
in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 As chairman of the conservancy, Daniel finds himself in constant contact with 
homeowners concerned about conserving open space and the rural environments of 
the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's extremely important that we have open spaces," Daniel said. "We've got 
to have that to maintain our community sanity." 
</P>
<P>
 As the population continues to expand, Daniel added, more Valley residents 
seem to be aware of this need. "There has got to be some place for them to 
escape to, to get away from the urban sprawl and the concrete and asphalt 
everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Since its formation in 1979, the conservancy has helped acquire close to 
21,000 acres of open space in mountain areas in Los Angeles and Ventura 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Earth Day, Daniel said, serves to continue this positive relationship between 
Valley homeowners and conservationists by creating a day when all people can 
celebrate their natural surroundings with a hike or other outdoor activity.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: ROSEMEAD; MAN SHOT TO 
DEATH AFTER STANDOFF WITH DEPUTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A standoff between Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies and a distraught 
Rosemead man ended when he was fatally wounded Wednesday night by a single 
shotgun blast fired by a deputy after the man ignored repeated warnings to drop 
a pistol he was pointing at them, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Victor Decapias Jr., 23, had been barricaded in his house at 9108 Guess 
St. for about half an hour Wednesday night when he emerged and began waving a 
semiautomatic pistol, Deputy Irma Vecerra said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies were called to the scene about 8 p.m. by Decapias' parents, who told 
them their son was inside the house with a gun and threatening to kill anyone 
who came near him, Vecerra said. 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing a gunshot from inside the house, deputies reached Decapias by 
phone and attempted to negotiate, they said. After 25 minutes, a neighbor 
reported seeing Decapias hiding in some bushes next to the house and pointing a 
handgun at two deputies who were unaware he was there, Vecerra said. 
</P>
<P>
 Decapias lowered the pistol, walked to the front of the house and pointed the 
handgun at several other deputies. When he would not put down the weapon, he 
was shot, Vecerra said. He died at 9:39 p.m. at San Gabriel Valley Medical 
Center. No other injuries were reported.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; DRIVER 
RESCUED AFTER CAR PLUNGES 250 FEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman whose car plunged 250 feet down an embankment spent Wednesday night 
unconscious, but awoke Thursday morning, used her cellular phone to dial 911, 
and was rescued by a Fire Department helicopter crew.  
</P>
<P>
 "She didn't know where she was," said Fire Department spokesman Jim Wells."We 
kept her on the line and asked her to tell us if she heard our sirens and 
that's how we found her." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman phoned for help about 7:50 a.m. and firefighters found her about 
half an hour later near Mulholland Drive and Laurel Canyon Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, brought out of the heavily forested area on a litter, was taken to 
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for treatment of neck and back injuries, Wells 
said.

 Sampang is accused of befriending young girls at shopping malls and in other 
public settings, raping them and then warning them that they would face 
retaliation by members of his gang if they reported the incidents. He was 
arrested Tuesday evening as he left a friend's house in Lakewood, sheriff's 
deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Philip K. Mautino ordered Sampang held without bail. Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Robert Samoian had asked Mautino to set bail at $1 million "due to the 
predatory nature of the defendant's conduct." 
</P>
<P>
 A preliminary hearing is scheduled for May 3.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; ARAB 
GROUP'S DIRECTOR QUITS TO RETURN TO MIDEAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Southern California regional director of the American-Arab 
Anti-Discrimination Committee, Nazih Bayda, has resigned for personal reasons, 
and plans to resume his career as a petroleum engineer by taking a job in the 
Persian Gulf sheikdom of Abu Dhabi, it was announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bayda, 35, played a key role in protesting interviews of prominent Arab 
Americans by the FBI at the beginning of the Gulf War in 1991.A previous 
regional director of the Anti-Discrimination Committee, Alex Odeh, was murdered 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Bayda said that damage at his San Fernando Valley home from the Jan. 17 
earthquake had led to his family's decision to leave Los Angeles. His 
performance at the Anti-Discrimination Committee, where he had been regional 
director for six years, won praise from Don Boustany, the group's Los 
Angeles-area president.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA; NEW BIDS SOUGHT ON DOWNTOWN PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city has decided to reopen the bidding on construction and relocation work 
at its historic downtown district because of dissatisfaction with offers 
received to date. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, however, officials hope to generate enough interest in the project 
to split up the work among several developers, instead of giving the contract 
to a single bidder as originally planned.That could make the project more 
attractive to local developers. 
</P>
<P>
 The new bidding was decided by a 4-1 vote of the City Council at its meeting 
earlier this week. Kathryn E. Wiser was the lone dissenter, saying later that 
she does not believe the city has developed a clear enough plan for the 
redevelopment effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Two companies submitted proposals for the project earlier this year, but city 
officials said the firms did not provide proof that they could adequately 
finance the Heritage Block project, located on the northeast corner of Brea 
Boulevard and Ash Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The project consists of moving three historic buildings, including the 
89-year-old Brea Hotel, to the 7.5-acre site and building retail and office 
structures and affordable housing there as well. The land is owned by the 
city's Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has not yet decided whether to sell the historic buildings to 
developers and let them do the rehabilitation work. If no developers come 
forward with proposals that meet requirements, the city will complete the 
project at government expense. 
</P>
<P>
 The total costs are still not known. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council, in its capacity as the Redevelopment Agency, will evaluate 
proposals to determine the value of the project, said Eric Nicoll, 
redevelopment services manager.MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; GROUP WANTS CITY TO KEEP CENTER OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 About 30 people came to this week's council meeting to demonstrate their 
support for a community center that may have to be closed. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is negotiating to extend its lease on the Balearic Center, but faces 
the hurdle of skyrocketing rents. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1977, the city has paid a token rent of $1 a year to the Newport-Mesa 
Unified School District. But school district official Carolyn Stocker said 
Newport-Mesa now wants market value for renting out the property, which she 
estimated at $66,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Allan L. Roeder told residents at Monday's council meeting that 
the city does not want to reduce the availability of child-care, after-school 
and other programs offered at the center. But he said he will present the 
council with options for moving these operations elsewhere if the city can no 
longer afford to rent the building at 1975 Balearic Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Roeder said the city pays $110,000 annually to rent another community center 
-- the REA Community Center at 661 Hamilton St. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Jay Humphrey encouraged the residents to make their feelings known 
to members of the Newport-Mesa school board, since they are the ones who want 
to raise the rent. 
</P>
<P>
 The Balearic Center lease expires June 30. The council will discuss the lease 
at a May 9 study session and is scheduled to vote on the lease May 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocker said the district would like to keep the city as a tenant, but it also 
wants to get more rental money.  
</P>
<P>
 "If I was in business, I'd want the same," said Andrea Coghill, who lives near 
the Balearic Center and sent her two children to programs there. But she says 
she thinks the school district should consider the overall good of the 
community. WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT; SEAFARING TRADITION WILL BE CELEBRATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1835, Richard Henry Dana sailed into Dana Point, bringing a taste of ocean 
adventure to what is now South County. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, the adventure resumes in the form of song and storytelling at a 
concert featuring the nationally known singing group Forebitter. 
</P>
<P>
 The 7:30 p.m. show will cost $11 for adults and $9 for children 12 years and 
younger. The concert will be held at the Dana Point Youth Group Facility on 
Dana Point Harbor Drive, near the Orange County Marine Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 The Connecticut-based trio, named after mooring posts where sailors often 
gathered to sing and entertain themselves on long voyages, performs at maritime 
festivals throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Through song, they keep alive the rich vocal tradition of seafaring vessels, 
which before the 20th Century often sailed on the ocean for three to five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The group will perform several forms of sea songs, from working to 
leisure-time chanteys. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an old saying that a good song was worth 10 men," said Dan Stetson, 
institute director of maritime affairs. "A small number of men pulling together 
with a song could get more work done." 
</P>
<P>
 The program will be run by local storyteller Ed Dobyns of San Clemente, who 
will spin a few tales of the sea before the concert. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100,000 people visited the institute last year and another 100,000 
participated in programs run by the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dana Point is a center of cultural maritime history," Stetson said. "Part of 
our history is to bring these type of groups to the institute. By doing that we 
hope to keep some of these maritime traditions alive." 
</P>
<P>
 For reservations and information about the concert, call (714) 496-2274. FRANK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; FREEWAY ACCIDENT TAKES WOMAN'S LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 47-year-old Garden Grove woman was killed Thursday morning when she lost 
control of her car and crashed into a semitrailer truck on the Garden Grove 
Freeway, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ja Nam was driving east on the freeway near the Magnolia Avenue off-ramp 
about 11:30 a.m. when she lost control of her vehicle, swerved into the next 
lane and hit the rear wheels of the truck, CHP Officer Denise Quesada said. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact forced the woman to veer to the right shoulder, Quesada said. The 
vehicle overturned and slid back onto the freeway, where it came to a stop in 
one of the middle lanes, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics, Quesada said. 
</P>
<P>
 The truck driver, Mitchell Pettyjohn, 32, of Palmdale, was not injured, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident closed a lane of the freeway, causing a three-mile backup for 
eastbound traffic that lasted until about 3 p.m., CHP Officer Joan Rivas said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; YOUTH BOXING CLUB WILL OPEN SATURDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An after-school boxing program for Santa Ana boys and girls that will also 
offer study rooms, peer counseling and possibly arts and crafts is ready to 
open and will register children on Saturday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Community activist and mayoral candidate John Raya has been working on TKO, or 
Turning Kids On, for more than a year and a half, since the Santa Ana City 
Council first committed $25,000 to the project and negotiated a $1-a-year lease 
with Raya for a building at 1416 Bristol St. 
</P>
<P>
 Cubanito Perez, who boxed for the lightweight world title in 1986, is 
volunteering as trainer. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was young, coming up, I was real hyper. I got into boxing and it took 
all my energy," said Perez, 36, who has lived in Santa Ana for 15 years. "A lot 
of times kids get into trouble because they don't have anything to do. This 
club has the potential to be one of the best around. Everything is set up so 
nice." 
</P>
<P>
 The club offers a boxing ring and set of bags, weightlifting equipment and a 
study hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants must be of ages 8 through 18 and enrolled in Santa Ana schools, 
Raya said. They should also demonstrate an eagerness to take part in community 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The club opens for boxing Monday and will be open during the week from 4 to 8 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Youths who join will commit to help clean the facility and grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Athletics provide some real life lessons. If we can get kids in there, help 
them with their homework, kind of broaden their expectations and show them they 
have the skills and the heart to succeed, to compete, then the obstacles life 
challenges them with won't seem so insurmountable," Raya said. "They'll know 
they have the fight to push themselves."LEE ROMNEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; CITY STUDIES WAYS TO END COASTAL FLOODING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chi Kredell, who has called the city's coast home for 47 years, figured out 
long ago that heavy rains usually produce minor flooding in front of his house 
on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 This month, he and other residents asked the city to look at ways of 
preventing the flooding -- and Kredell, 60, has a few ideas of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing an engineering report completed for the city several years ago, Kredell 
said the solution might lie in having bulldozers loosen the sand north of the 
Seal Beach Pier. And city officials said he might have a point. 
</P>
<P>
 With most heavy downpours, rain runoff flows from the pier parking lot and 
nearby alleys into the concrete walkway that divides the beach from Ocean 
Avenue homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The water is supposed to be absorbed by the sand. But oil and mud carried to 
the beach along with the runoff make the sand less able to absorb large amounts 
of water, Kredell said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the rainwater collects in front of homes on Ocean Avenue, 
sometimes causing flooding. Damage from such floods is usually minor, but 
Kredell said he lost a washer and dryer a decade ago when an especially strong 
storm flooded his garage. 
</P>
<P>
 The engineering report -- prepared several years ago by an independent 
consulting firm -- suggested that the beach would absorb more rain runoff if 
the city used a bulldozer equipped with three-foot steel claws to dig up the 
sand. 
</P>
<P>
 The process is known as "scarification" and is designed to loosen the sand, 
allowing the grains to spread apart and absorb more water. The city might also 
consider adding larger-grained sand to the beach, Kredell said. The bigger 
grains absorb more water, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Kredell discussed the issue at last week's City Council meeting. His 
suggestions were warmly received by city officials, who have vowed to examine 
their feasibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The focus comes as city officials plan a major sand replenishment project on a 
different beach south of the pier. The plan to dump up to 150,000 cubic yards 
of Santa Ana River sand on the eroded beach received California Coastal 
Commission approval last week. The proposal, which will cost the city about 
$500,000, still needs the approval of the Army Corps of Engineers. SHELBY GRAD

'HE SAID NOT TO GRIEVE BECAUSE HE LOVED FLYING' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Patrick Dean Brinnon was trying to accumulate flight hours and get a pilot's 
job in Eureka when his single-engine plane crashed in a Westside residential 
neighborhood, his mother said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But flying was more than a career goal for the cable television director and 
editor, Dolores Brinnon said from her Northridge home. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had flying in his blood," she said. "He always said if he went down in a 
plane not to grieve because he loved it." 
</P>
<P>
 Her son had completed his commercial pilot and instrument training and 1,300 
hours of flight time. He needed 200 more hours for his commercial credentials. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday morning, the engine of the Piper Saratoga that Brinnon was 
piloting apparently failed shortly after takeoff from Santa Monica Airport. He 
crashed into a garage while trying to return to the airport, causing a fire 
that was extinguished within minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Brinnon, 36, had moved to Northridge three years ago from the Northern 
California city of Eureka, where he had been working for a small cable 
television company. It was in Eureka that he discovered his love of flying and 
took his first lessons, his mother said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He decided to come back home, live with us and complete his credentials," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brinnon hoped to eventually return to Eureka and work as a spotter for the 
state Department of Forestry. 
</P>
<P>
 The fatal crash was the third in five months involving planes taking off or 
landing at Santa Monica Airport, the nation's busiest single-runway airport. 
</P>
<P>
 No one on the ground was injured in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolores Brinnon said her son's ashes will be taken to Eureka and scattered 
into the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Brinnon leaves a 2 1/2-year-old son, Cody Patrick Hocking, who lives with his 
mother in Redding, Calif.

PAPERS RAISE DOUBTS ABOUT HOMELESS SHELTER; HOUSING: ORGANIZATION THAT GOT U.S. 
PERMISSION TO RUN FACILITY FOR MORE THAN 800 PEOPLE IS CURRENTLY SERVING 20. 
CRITICS SAY IT DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH EXPERIENCE.

<P>
 Federal officials gave a South-Central organization permission to open a 
homeless shelter for 880 people in San Pedro even though application documents 
released Thursday show it was only serving 20 people. 
</P>
<P>
 A copy of the application was released by Rep. Jane Harman (D-Marina del Rey), 
who said she had obtained the document from the federal Health and Human 
Services Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a portion of the 300-page document was released. Resumes and other 
supporting pages were taken out under the Freedom of Information Act by Rep. 
John Conyers, chairman of the House Government Operations Committee, said Eric 
Altshule, a spokesman for Harman. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner's Technical Institute was given permission by the department to use 
surplus Navy property in the harbor community, even though the group did not 
claim to have experience running a large shelter.  
</P>
<P>
 According to the application, Turner's was incorporated in 1984 to teach 
business courses such as word processing and bookkeeping. Its Open Door program 
was serving "approximately 20 individuals" in existing homeless facilities, the 
application says.  
</P>
<P>
 Homeless people are one of nine groups Turner's serves, and housing is one of 
seven services it offers, according to the document.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials from Health and Human Services could not be reached for comment on 
their decision to approve the application. Requests to speak to Secretary Donna 
Shalala were turned down. Judy Breitman, staff member of the department's 
Health Facilities Planning Division who examined Turner's application, did not 
return telephone calls Thursday. Priscilla E. Turner, director of the 
institute, also did not return phone calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing that Turner's lacks the qualifications and experience to run a large 
shelter, community groups and local politicians have been trying to persuade 
federal officials to withdraw the permit from Turner's. 
</P>
<P>
 It was hoped the document would give some clue to how Turner's plans to run 
the homeless center in 140 units on a 27-acre Taper Avenue site that the Navy 
is vacating this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner's former executive director, Johnathon C. Marzet, who resigned facing 
allegations of forgery last week, could not answer specific questions about the 
operation or financing of the shelter when he addressed about 1,000 hostile 
residents at gatherings last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Marzet told the residents that the center would house a maximum of 600 people, 
although the application states it would serve 880. 
</P>
<P>
 The application shows Turner's plans to run 19 services from the center, 
including providing food and clothing, child care and education, with six 
professionals and 13 support staff. The current staff is made up of three 
professionals and seven support staff, according to the application.  
</P>
<P>
 Turner's estimates the shelter's start-up costs will be $331,775. 
</P>
<P>
 Marzet defended the homeless plan Thursday, saying he was being attacked 
politically to get Turner's Institute to relinquish the Taper Avenue site. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter released Monday, Marzet resigned as treasurer, assistant director 
and board member of the institute. Dr. James A. Mays, a cardiologist who was 
asked to support the project, accused Marzet of forging his name on an 
endorsement letter in the application. Marzet says that although his staff did 
sign the letter, he had Mays' permission to sign and send it. 
</P>
<P>
 Mays said he did not give permission to Marzet to sign the letter. However, 
Mays said he personally signed a copy of the same letter several days later. 
</P>
<P>
 "He never indicated it was going to HHS," Mays said. "It was a general letter 
of recommendation." 
</P>
<P>
 Health and Human Services officials are looking into the allegations of 
forgery and the qualifications of Turner's Institute, Rayford Kytle, a 
spokesman for the department, said Tuesday.

 Senate Leader Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) on Thursday called a major tax break 
proposal by Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), aimed at inducing 
corporations such as Taco Bell to keep their headquarters in California, 
nothing more than a public subsidy to highly paid business executives.

 "If we are going to start subsidizing the highest-paid people in the state of 
California, I think it is fair to begin to regulate the salaries and perks of 
those people," Lockyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockyer took aim at a newly proposed bill by Brown, a fellow Democrat, that 
would grant a 6% investment tax credit to major companies that locate or expand 
their headquarters in California instead of moving to other states. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said through a spokeswoman that his plan resulted in part from the 
recent disclosure that Taco Bell Corp. is considering shifting its headquarters 
and 1,000-worker payroll from Orange County to Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's spokeswoman, Darolyn Davis, refused to comment directly on Lockyer's 
criticism. She described Brown's measure as a product of the Speaker's economic 
summit last year and part of his "one step at a time" program to improve the 
state's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockyer blistered the bill during an informal session with reporters.  
</P>
<P>
 Under the Brown measure, businesses that constructed new headquarters 
buildings would be eligible to receive a five-year tax credit for costs 
involving real and personal property, construction and wages of employees. If 
companies fell below certain minimum levels for number of employees, they would 
lose the tax break. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockyer said the bill would provide an estimated $6-million tax credit for 
Taco Bell and as much as $1 billion if other affected corporations also 
qualified. He warned that the loss of tax revenue would translate into further 
reductions in money available for education and health programs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Considered a legislative expert on tax issues, Lockyer said he found it 
distressing that the proposed tax credit represented a "subsidy of CEOs' 
salaries." But he said the notion of government regulation of business 
executive compensation must be raised "when you begin to subsidize people who 
get paid tens of millions of dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm more interested in creating jobs on the bottom end of the ladder rather 
than at the top end," Lockyer said.

4.4 QUAKE RATTLES CENTRAL CALIFORNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A magnitude 4.4 temblor rattled the central California community of Coalinga 
at 9:37 a.m. Thursday, causing seven schools to be briefly evacuated but 
resulting in no damage or injuries. It was the third moderate earthquake in the 
area in less than a month. Two quakes, magnitude 4.4 and 4.2, occurred in the 
vicinity March 31.

RON HARRIS: WITH A PUSH, TEEN-AGE DADS CAN BE PARENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Little Imani was born Jan. 17. For those who have forgotten, that was the same 
day that the earth shook in Southern California and the houses, walls and 
freeways came tumbling down. For me, the timing of the two events seemed quite 
appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 Imani is my granddaughter, born to a 17-year-old girl, fathered by my 
18-year-old son. Babies making babies. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the first shock came some seven months earlier when I got a call 
from the girl's mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Harris, I've been meaning to call you for some time," she said. I knew 
what was coming because my parents had been on the receiving end of that phone 
call when I was only 19. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Every day in Southern California, about 40 babies are born to teen-age girls. 
That's the way it is usually noted in the various publications and agencies 
describing the plight of children. It is a curious notation to me, as though 
these girls conceived these children alone and now they alone must bear full 
responsibility for them. 
</P>
<P>
 I have two sons, who, all praises due their mothers, have lived with me about 
half their lives in Memphis, Chicago and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Far too often, people (usually women) praised me for raising my sons alone. It 
is undeserved. Their comments imply that what I am doing is something 
extraordinary. Obviously, it isn't. Millions of women do it every day. 
</P>
<P>
 Or there is the unspoken sentiment that I am inherently more responsible, more 
sensitive than most men because my sons are with me. I'm not that, either. I am 
a father because from Day 1 my parents, James and Geraldine Harris, insisted 
that I be one. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most teen-agers, the last thing on my mind when my first son was born was 
being a parent. I was more interested in basketball, girls and just hanging 
with the fellas. But that wasn't my mother's plan. Invariably, two or three 
times a week, she would say, "Ronnie, go get the baby." 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't want to do it, but since I was living in my parents' house, I had no 
choice. Barely minutes after placing my son in her arms, I would prepare to 
bolt for the door. Her voice would pull me back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where are you going?" she would ask. 
</P>
<P>
 "Going to play some basketball," I'd say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who's going to take care of the baby?" she'd ask. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're here," I would say. 
</P>
<P>
 "You didn't ask me," she'd say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, can you take care of the baby?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I've got things to do, and you're the baby's father," came the reply. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, you're the one that wanted the baby here," I'd huff. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, so you could take care of him," she would say sternly. 
</P>
<P>
 So there I was, stuck changing diapers, bathing the baby, feeding the baby and 
otherwise fretting over something I didn't want in the first place. I resented 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 At night, he would sleep in a crib assigned to my bedroom, and like babies do, 
he would wake around 3 a.m. It was my job to play with him or feed him or do 
whatever until he went back to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't want to do it. I didn't like doing it. I had to do it. But somewhere 
along the way, something unexpected happened. I fell in love with my son and 
found myself making decisions based on the fact that he was my son. I missed 
him when I was away in school. When I graduated, I turned down jobs in other 
cities to accept one in my hometown, a city I loathed, because that's where my 
son was. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't get me wrong. It wasn't smooth sailing from then on. When my second son 
was born, my parents literally drove from Memphis to Atlanta, picked him up, 
brought him back to my apartment and put him in my arms. Growing into 
fatherhood, especially as a single man, is a process, and not always an easy 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Because of my parents, my sons have two parents and not just a mother and a 
man who impregnated her and disappeared. And because they have both, their 
mothers have been able to pursue their lives more fully, and possibly my 
children's lives are better than they would have been otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 As I have watched other parents of teen-age boys and young fathers, I am 
amazed more of them didn't do what my parents did, particularly single mothers. 
How could they let their sons do to their children and their children's mothers 
what their own fathers had done to them? 
</P>
<P>
 I am adamant that it won't happen. 
</P>
<P>
 My son will tend to his daughter, and not just with money. He will bathe her, 
and feed her, and change her, and burp her, and shop for baby shoes, and enroll 
her in school, and read to her, and fret over her teeth and nurse her through 
chicken pox. Initially, he won't like it. 
</P>
<P>
 But he will do it because I insist, and because ultimately, he will fall in 
love with his daughter, just as I did with him.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PANORAMA CITY; 'MISS OCTOBER' SHOWS OFF HER LOVE OF BOOKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to dispel the stereotypes that Playboy Playmates are bimbos, last 
October's Playmate of the Month spent an hour reading Dr. Seuss to children 
Wednesday as the guest of a Panorama City public library. 
</P>
<P>
 She encouraged them, of course, to not just look at the pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Librarians hoped the celebrity would generate interest in reading among 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "People told me when I was little that I could never be a model," said 
Jennifer McCarthy, 21, sporting funky high heels, a Playboy bunny necklace and 
wire-rim reading glasses (and black slacks, sweater and vest). "I want these 
kids to realize that if you want to be something, go for it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Playmate's appearance drew plenty of reaction from library-goers. 
Surrounded by a group of 16 children, McCarthy read "Hippo Was Hot," "Green 
Eggs And Ham" and "Too Much Noise." Heber Rodriguez, 17, of North Hills, and 
buddy Diego Tiscareno, 18, of Panorama City watched in rapt attention a few 
feet away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't understand the stories, but I enjoyed them anyway," smiled 
Rodriguez, who said he often comes to the library to study. 
</P>
<P>
 Others had a hard time buying the concept of a Playboy Playmate as a role 
model for reading. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody reads Playboy," sneered Abe Khouri, 21, of Northridge, as he stole a 
glimpse of McCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
 One mother had a more unusual reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 She brought her three children to the reading believing that "October" was the 
storyteller's last name. Then she discovered that it was actually "Miss 
October" of Playboy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh," said the mother, who asked not to be identified. "I hope 
she's not taking her clothes off here." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor did the mother take any chances. By the time the green eggs and ham were 
devoured, she had shooed her clan out the door. 
</P>
<P>
 But such reaction did not throw McCarthy off her mission. As a preschool aide 
during her high school years in Chicago, McCarthy spent a year reading to small 
children. And she hopes some day to return to college to finish her degree in 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 If the library audience was an indication, it's a career to which she could 
easily return. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was great," said 7-year-old Shavella Brown, who is no stranger to being 
read to and sat patiently through all 30 minutes of story time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to see somebody like that doing something good for the kids," said 
Shavella's mother, Gloria Brown, 26, of North Hills. "No matter what she does 
for a living, it shows she cares, and that's good." 
</P>
<P>
 McCarthy, who lives in Los Angeles, plans to be back in libraries again, 
hopefully as storyteller when the Northridge branch reopens after the 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez and Tiscareno will be happy to provide the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of our friends would be interested in hearing a story from her," 
Rodriguez said. JEFF SCHNAUFER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HILLS; ACCESS ORDERED FOR NUDE ENTERTAINERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seeking equal opportunity in its barest form, the city of Los Angeles has 
ordered managers of an adult nightclub to either stop using a shower in which 
nude dancers bathe in front of customers or add wheelchair access to it. 
</P>
<P>
 The elevated shower attraction at the Odd Ball Cabaret in North Hills violates 
state code, the Los Angeles Disabled Access Appeals Commission ruled, because 
it would not be accessible to wheelchair-bound entertainers.The club has never 
employed a nude dancer who uses a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't matter what you're doing, you can't discriminate against the 
physically disabled," said Ron Shigeta, chief of the Disabled Access Division 
of the city's Department of Building and Safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "The code doesn't recognize whether or not there would be a disabled person 
working there," he said. "When you construct something, it has to be 
accessible." 
</P>
<P>
 The commission voted 4 to 0 in January that the shower could not be used 
unless modified. Commissioner David Honda abstained from the vote, calling the 
issue "absurd" and "anti-business." 
</P>
<P>
 The enclosed shower and viewing area, which is wheelchair-accessible, have 
been closed, and it is unclear whether the owners will eventually decide to 
install a ramp, lower the shower or remove it altogether, said Bill Markley, 
assistant manager of the Odd Ball Cabaret. 
</P>
<P>
 While the attraction was operating, one or two customers would pay $20 each to 
watch a nude woman shower for the length of one song. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue came to light after a Building and Safety inspector reported the 
shower, which had been built without a permit, said Marsha Broderick, 
commission vice president. The inspector apparently had gone to Odd Ball to 
inspect a newly installed, wheelchair-accessible bathroom, she said. KURT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; CITY HONORS 3 WHO HELPED SAVE A LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 John Van Hecke wasn't going to stand there and watch another man die on a 
tennis court. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, his tennis partner died after having a stroke and heart attack on 
the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, fellow player Chi Van Nguyen of Hawthorne collapsed on a court 
next to where Van Hecke was playing at Fountain Valley Recreation Tennis 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Hecke and two other men came to Nguyen's aid and saved his life. The three 
men were honored this week for their action. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really wanted to do something this time," said Van Hecke, who gave Nguyen 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw my partner die and I didn't want to see another man die," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When paramedics arrived, Nguyen was not breathing and he had no heartbeat, 
fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Chief Bernard F. Heimos said that Nguyen's chances of survival increased 
because of the efforts of the three men. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they had not administered CPR, there's a good chance he might not have 
made it," said Heimos said. "They sure increased his odds." 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen, 47, who is recovering, said he is appreciative that the men came to 
his rescue. "I feel very lucky," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Hecke of Westminster said the action was a team effort. The two other men 
who assisted were Vince Ho of Santa Ana and Dan Nguyen of Westminster. Both 
were also playing tennis on March 27. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't take any credit," said Van Hecke, a hair stylist. "I just thank God 
we saved his life." 
</P>
<P>
 The three men were commended by the City Council for their willingness to 
help. Each was given a certificate of appreciation by Mayor John Collins. 
</P>
<P>
 "They got involved and made a difference," Collins said, adding that he hopes 
their actions will inspire others to do the same in such an emergency 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 The men said that while they were surprised at getting the city recognition, 
they were honored. 
</P>
<P>
 "Saving anybody's life is a good deed and a good feeling," said Ho, who held 
Nguyen's head while the other two administered CPR. "But this is special 
because he's one of the players in our group." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Hecke agreed that their life-saving effort was well worth it: "It's 
gratifying to know I saved someone's life." DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; POLICE TO CONDUCT SOBRIETY CHECKPOINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To create public awareness about the dangers of drinking and driving, the 
Police Department will conduct a sobriety checkpoint tonight at Warner Avenue 
and Los Jardines West. 
</P>
<P>
 The checkpoint will be conducted from 9:30 p.m. to 3 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Sgt. Larry Griswold said that since the department started conducting 
the checkpoints in October, 1992, 84 people have been arrested on charges of 
driving under the influence of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 Griswold also said that 12,900 motorists have driven through the checkpoints, 
which have been conducted at various locations in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those motorists, 9,553 were stopped and given public education information 
by police officers. As a result of those stops, Griswold said, 182 people were 
given sobriety tests. 
</P>
<P>
 The maximum legal blood-alcohol level for adults is .08%, and in many of the 
motorists arrested the blood-alcohol content was at least .15%, almost twice 
the legal limit, Griswold said. He said motorists also have been cited on other 
charges, including possession of alcohol and drugs.

 About 300 volunteers are expected to turn out Saturday to help the city with 
graffiti removal and park cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort marks the city's participation in the nationwide "Volunteer 
Connection Day."The national effort focuses on urging people of all ages to do 
volunteer work for their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers will meet at 8 a.m. at the Garden Grove Municipal Services Center, 
13802 Newhope St. "They will then get their assignments in various areas and go 
to those assignments to work until noon," said Mike Adams, administrative 
analyst with the city's Public Services Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The anticipated volunteers are from civic groups and youth organizations that 
have done volunteer work for the city, Adams said. He said, however, that any 
individual may help on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Those wishing to help should call (714) 741-5375 before Saturday to get on the 
assignment list, Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort is also part of a countywide program coordinated by the Volunteer 
Center of Greater Orange County. BILL BILLITER

 City officials are asking for help to clean Pepper Tree Park and the Tustin 
Area Senior Center on Saturday as part of the countywide observance of 
Volunteer Connection Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers should wear work clothes and gloves, but the city will provide the 
tools, according to recreation supervisor Randy Westrick.He said the volunteers 
will paint benches and tables, plant flowers, rake leaves and sweep the park 
sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Senior Center next to the park, volunteers will scrub floors, wash the 
windows, clean the tables and kitchen "and give the place a little shine," 
Westrick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration will begin at 10 a.m. The work is expected to completed by 2 
p.m., Westrick said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the cleanup, there will be a canned-food drive, he said. Those 
unable to volunteer are encouraged to donate food, which later will be donated 
to local food banks.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; DIRECTOR ARRESTED FOR LEWD CONDUCT

<TEXT>
<P>
 A television director was arrested Wednesday for secretly filming women using 
a restroom at a Warner Center office complex, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Niles Goodsite, 52, of Chatsworth, was booked for the misdemeanor charge of 
loitering in a restroom with the intention to commit a lewd act, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident occurred after Goodsite sneaked into a first-floor bathroom at 
Warner Gateway Plaza, 21820 Burbank Blvd., at about 11:55 a.m., said Detective 
Nancy Severns of the West Valley station's sex crime unit. 
</P>
<P>
 After he went into a stall and closed the door behind him, Goodsite sat on a 
toilet and angled a video camera under adjoining stalls for more than an hour, 
police said. He filmed more than 15 women using the toilet before he was 
caught, Severns said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives said several women had noticed a pair of men's shoes under the 
stall door, but most thought a man had mistakenly gone into the wrong room. 
</P>
<P>
 But after a woman spotted Goodsite's camera she alerted a male maintenance 
worker, who held Goodsite while two women grabbed his camera and a videotape -- 
which Goodsite tried to drop in a toilet, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodsite, a member of the Director's Guild of America since 1977, is credited 
with directing sitcoms, dramas, news and other television genres, a guild 
spokeswoman said. TIMOTHY WILLIAMS

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; OAKVIEW AREA TO GET BRANCH LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council voted unanimously Monday night to use $175,230 in 
federal-state block-grant funds to build a library branch in the Oakview 
neighborhood, an area in which many Latino families live. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Hayden, the city's director of library services, said the 
2,000-square-foot modular library branch will be built near Oak View School.The 
branch is scheduled to open Jan. 1, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakview is a neighborhood roughly bounded by Beach Boulevard, Gothard Street 
and Slater and Warner avenues. Many of the residents in the densely populated 
area are new immigrants from Mexico and Central America. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be the first branch library in the city in 25 years, and I can't 
think of a better place to put it," Hayden said in an interview. He said the 
library programs should help the neighborhood by offering literacy training and 
other educational services. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're especially interested in reaching out to the children in Oakview," 
Hayden said. "Our survey found that 35% of the children had never come to the 
Central Library. We think the branch library will be a way of introducing these 
children to a whole new world." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the city is committed to keeping the branch library at the site for 
only about a year because there is no permanent funding, city officials said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; PENSION-SPIKING 'COVER-UP' ALLEGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A resident who has been a frequent critic of "pension spiking" by city 
employees called on the City Council this week to avoid the appearance of a 
"cover-up" and make public the names of all personnel who may benefit from the 
controversial procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Spiking" is the practice that allows public employees to increase their 
pensions by inflating their actual salaries through unused vacation days and 
other means. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Mello, a resident who has devoted many hours to studying public documents 
and computing the effects of spiking, told the City Council Monday night that 
he believes 153 city employees stand to benefit from pension spiking. 
</P>
<P>
 Mello said that City Atty. Gail C. Hutton has refused to release the names of 
the 153 employees on the grounds that such disclosure would violate their 
privacy. But in his remarks to the council during the public-comment session, 
Mello charged that the real reason the city is not disclosing the employees' 
names is because "the spikers are ashamed." 
</P>
<P>
 Mello urged the City Council to remove the city attorney from "all issues that 
deal with employee compensation." He also asked the city to "stop the cover-up" 
and release the names of employees who may benefit from pension spiking. 
</P>
<P>
 No one on the council responded to Mello's requests or accusations. BILL 
BILLITER

MOTHER REPORTS ATTEMPT TO KIDNAP 2-YEAR-OLD CHILD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies are investigating a possible attempted kidnaping Thursday 
of a 2-year-old child in front of a shopping center in the 22300 block of El 
Toro Road. 
</P>
<P>
 A South County woman was walking to her car about 12:30 p.m., with her child, 
groceries and rented videotapes, according to sheriff's Lt. Dan Martini, when 
another woman approached, bumped the mother and attempted to snatch her child. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mother grabbed the child's clothing and there was a short struggle," and 
the mother pulled her child back, Martini said. The assailant ran off, got into 
a car driven by a second person and fled. Officers would not identify the 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both victims are in good condition," Martini said.  
</P>
<P>
 "You really have to commend the action of the mother. She fought for her child 
and won." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman returned to the video store, where a clerk called police. 
</P>
<P>
 In the struggle, some of the mother's personal property disappeared, and 
Martini said that the assault could have been a diversion for a robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, he said, "we are looking at it as an attempted kidnaping. . . . 
It's a warning flag for everyone."

EX-COACH FACES CHARGES OF SEX WITH MINOR; ARRAIGNMENT: THE HUNTINGTON BEACH MAN 
AND A STUDENT, 15, FROM THE SCHOOL HE WORKED AT WERE ALLEGEDLY FOUND IN A STATE 
OF UNDRESS IN A CAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former assistant baseball coach at a Huntington Beach high school is 
scheduled to be arraigned May 16 on charges of having sex with a minor and 
contributing to her delinquency after police allegedly caught him and a 
15-year-old girl who attends that school partially clad in a car. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley police says an officer found Cory Colbert, 23, with the 
teen-ager early Saturday in a vehicle parked behind a store in the 17200 block 
of Brookhurst Street.At the time, Colbert worked as a coach at Ocean View High 
in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "The two were (trying to grab) their clothes," police spokesman Dann Bean 
said. Colbert "was arrested and brought to the Police Department that night." 
</P>
<P>
 Colbert of Huntington Beach was released on his own recognizance that same 
night, Bean said. Having sex with a minor is a felony and contributing to a 
minor's delinquency is a misdemeanor, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Colbert has since lost his job as an assistant coach with the boys' varsity 
baseball team, Principal Carla Rush said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cory Colbert is no longer an employee of the district," said Rush, who is in 
charge of the 2,000-student school that serves Huntington Beach, Westminster, 
and Fountain Valley. She declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Colbert could not be reached for comment.

FORMER COACH SENTENCED FOR LEWD CONDUCT; COURTS: SIXTY-DAY JAIL TERM, THREE 
YEARS' PROBATION GIVEN AFTER HE PLEADS GUILTY TO MISDEMEANOR CHARGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Savanna High School wresting coach was sentenced to 60 days in jail 
and ordered to undergo counseling after pleading guilty to misdemeanor child 
annoyance and lewd conduct charges, a prosecutor said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Caspari, 31, of La Palma, will begin serving his sentence June 6 and will 
be on three years' probation after his release from the Orange County Men's 
Jail, said prosecutor Mark Logan. 
</P>
<P>
 North Orange Municipal Judge Carla M. Singer also ordered Caspari to avoid 
contact with the two teen-age boys named in the complaint, and to refrain from 
any contact with minors without another adult being present. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges relate to sexually explicit language Caspari used in front of the 
two teen-agers, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Caspari, who was sentenced Wednesday, had pleaded guilty March 1, Logan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors wanted Singer to additionally order Caspari to pay the costs of 
his victims' counseling, but the judge declined to do so, Logan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are extremely disappointed restitution was not ordered," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Caspari's attorney did not return phone calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Caspari coached the Rebels for six years and had one of the county's most 
envied wrestling programs. Savanna won the Southern Section Division 3-A title 
in 1991 and won or shared four consecutive Orange League titles. He also 
coached the boys' cross-country team and the school's club surfing team. 
</P>
<P>
 Caspari resigned at the end of the school year last June during an Anaheim 
Police Department investigation into the allegations, made earlier in the term.

PILOT SOUGHT COMMERCIAL LICENSE; CRASH: NORTHRIDGE RESIDENT HAD HOPED TO FLY AS 
A SPOTTER FOR FORESTRY AGENCY. HE DIED IN SANTA MONICA ACCIDENT.

<P>
 Patrick Dean Brinnon was trying to accumulate flight hours needed for a 
pilot's job in Eureka when his single-engine plane crashed Wednesday in a 
Westside residential neighborhood, according to his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 But flying was more than a career goal for the cable television director and 
editor, said Dolores Brinnon, speaking from her Northridge home. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had flying in his blood," she said. "He always said if he went down in a 
plane not to grieve because he loved it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He ate, slept and lived it." 
</P>
<P>
 Her son, known as Pat to his friends and family, had completed his commercial 
pilot and instrument training and 1,300 hours of flight time. He needed 200 
more hours for his commercial credentials. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday morning, the engine of the Piper Saratoga that Pat Brinnon, 36, 
was piloting apparently failed shortly after his takeoff from Santa Monica 
Airport. When he attempted to return to the airport, he crashed into a garage 
behind a home in the Sunset Park section of Santa Monica, causing a fire that 
was extinguished within minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago he moved to Northridge from the Northern California city of 
Eureka, where he had been working for a small cable television company. It was 
in Eureka that he discovered his love for flying and took his first lessons, 
his mother said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He decided to come back home, live with us and complete his credentials," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon completion of his training, Pat Brinnon hoped to return to Eureka and 
work as a spotter for the state Department of Forestry. 
</P>
<P>
 "From everything I've been told, he was an excellent pilot," his mother said. 
"He wasn't a hot dog." 
</P>
<P>
 The fatal crash is the third in five months involving airplanes that were 
either taking off or landing at Santa Monica Airport, the busiest single-runway 
airport in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 No one on the ground was injured in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of the home where Brinnon crashed invited Brinnon's father, Keith, 
and mother to visit the crash site and place flowers there in memory of their 
son. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think we could handle that," said Keith Brinnon. "Seeing it on TV 
was tough enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Dolores Brinnon said her son's ashes will be taken to Eureka and scattered 
into the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 "He liked it up there and that's where his ashes will be taken," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brinnon leaves a 2 1/2-year-old son, Cody Patrick Hocking, who lives with his 
mother in Redding in Northern California.

POLICE OFFER TIPS ON CRIME PREVENTION; UNIVERSAL CITY: GAS STATION AND 
CONVENIENCE STORE OWNERS AND MANAGERS LEARN AT SEMINAR WHAT THEY CAN DO TO 
MINIMIZE PROBLEMS.

 A gun-toting robber walks into an AM-PM Mini-Market and demands money from the 
cash register. He flees, but police are able to arrest him moments later thanks 
to quick thinking by the store owner. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a happy ending, but it's only a simulation. 
</P>
<P>
 The video dramatization, "A Robbery at Ernie's Place," was shown to about 175 
owners and managers of gas stations and convenience stores who gathered at the 
Universal City Hilton on Thursday to pick up crime prevention tips from police. 
</P>
<P>
 For Naren Jhala, owner and manager of an AM-PM Mini-Market in Mission Hills, 
the video seemed too true to life. In 1990, he was the victim of a holdup at 
his convenience store in which the gunman fled with $150. 
</P>
<P>
 "You cannot think, it happened so fast," Jhala said. "The guy who does it to 
you is more frightened than you, so you don't want to make him nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter how much security you have, there's always something that's going 
to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Police offered a number of safety tips: Keep money in the cash register to a 
minimum, make sure that all outdoor lights are on at night, stay alert for 
loiterers and take down any posters or displays that block the view from 
outside so that police and passersby can spot a robbery attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Also during the seminar, salespeople from companies specializing in crime 
prevention displayed such products as door alarms, surveillance cameras and 
monitors. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In the last 12 months, there have been two homicides reported in Los Angeles 
involving employees of gas stations and convenience stores, according to 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 That's less than the number of liquor store employees killed on the job during 
the same time period, but that statistic is of little solace to this group. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stats are meaningless when someone has a gun stuffed in your face," said 
Los Angeles Police Sgt. Chris West of the crime prevention section. 
</P>
<P>
 The seminar was sponsored by Arco and the Los Angeles Police Department.

POLITICAL BRIEFING: EX-RACKETEER NOLAN NOW SQUEAKY CLEAN, BUT A LITTLE TOO LATE

 GETTING SETTLED: It seems like every time a state lawmaker from the San 
Fernando Valley area gets sent up the river, prison authorities hand him a mop, 
a pail and a dose of humility. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Assemblyman Pat Nolan (R-Glendale) is now in his third week at the 
Dublin federal minimum security camp east of Oakland and, according to a prison 
spokesman, has been assigned to sanitation detail. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is keeping his area neat and clean and making sure that the floor is swept 
and mopped," said Wilson J. Moore, the camp unit manager. "He's doing basic 
janitorial service." 
</P>
<P>
 The same job taught former state Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Van Nuys) never to take 
cleaning crews for granted, he said recently in an interview. Robbins spent two 
years in a Lompoc federal prison after pleading guilty in 1991 to racketeering 
and a related tax charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan, who admitted to one count of racketeering while in office, still has 
ample opportunity for recreation, Moore said. "He can walk, run or lift 
weights. He has plenty of free time." 
</P>
<P>
 Presumably, he won't be too lonely in prison. There are three other inmates at 
Dublin under similar circumstances: former Assembly aide Tyrone Netters, former 
California Coastal Commissioner Mark Nathanson and former lobbyist Clayton R. 
Jackson -- all convicted in a federal probe of Capitol corruption. 
</P>

 PERPETUAL CAMPAIGN: Now that the recall campaign against state Sen. David A. 
Roberti is history, he can relax a little and get back to the business of being 
an elected representative.  
</P>
<P>
 So long as he doesn't spend too much time pursuing the job he's set his sights 
on next, that is. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti, who is running hard for the Democratic nomination for state treasurer 
against Sacramento developer Phil Angelides, racked up quite an absentee rate 
while fighting the recall. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Secretary Rick Rollins notes that the Van Nuys Democrat was gone 10 of 
55 days when the Legislature was in session. 
</P>
<P>
 "I might add that even when he was here, he was terribly distracted," Rollins 
said. "His attention span was not there." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the well-financed Angelides is hoping his head start on Roberti will give 
him the momentum he needs to capture the Democratic nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, the Angelides campaign attacked Roberti on an issue that defines a 
critical difference between the two candidates -- the issue of abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
 A devout Catholic, Roberti is opposed to abortion. Angelides, who calls 
himself "the candidate of choice," holds the more traditional Democratic view 
that a woman has the right to choose abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter that Angelides circulated this week, James Wagoner, executive vice 
president of the National Abortion Rights Action League, attacked Roberti for 
failing to support a resolution condemning violence at abortion clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason we are supporting your opponent in the treasurer's race, Phil 
Angelides, is that he has . . . stood up for women and against terrorism and 
violence at clinics around the country." 
</P>
<P>
 And you probably thought the state treasurer's office focused mostly on fiscal 
affairs. 
</P>

 WHEN NAME RECOGNITION GOES BAD: The notoriety of Los Angeles County Supervisor 
Mike Antonovich spread a bit more under the state Capitol dome this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, it was again Antonovich's misconduct, not his record as a public 
official, that held the attention of legislators. 
</P>
<P>
 When a bill to reduce government liability in the wake of an elected 
official's misdeeds came up before the Assembly Judiciary Committee, Chairman 
Phillip Isenberg (D-Sacramento) immediately pegged it as another measure on 
"how to solve the famous Antonovich case." 
</P>
<P>
 That brings to three the number of bills advancing through the Legislature to 
amend laws that forced Los Angeles County taxpayers to shell out $1.2 million 
to pay for a civil judgment against Antonovich. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisor was found liable last year for conspiring to influence a judge 
on behalf of a businessman who contributed thousands of dollars to his 
political campaign. Under the new measures, elected officials would have to pay 
the cost of such judgments themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Paul V. Horcher (R-West Covina) said his bill was not necessarily 
aimed directly at Antonovich, but "was more of a rifle shot" fired at the 
broader issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "When elected officials act like buffoons, they don't deserve to be bailed out 
by taxpayers," Horcher said, accusing those in Antonovich's shoes of 
"committing idiocies and foolishness at taxpayer expense." 
</P>
<P>
 Harsh words, particularly coming from a fellow Republican. The measure passed 
easily. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 SOKA SETBACK: The next item on the committee's agenda fizzled when Horcher 
unexpectedly withdrew a bill to aid Soka University of Calabasas in its 
long-running battle with the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Seems that Horcher, described by Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria) as 
"pragmatic . . . a good nose counter," simply had not mustered enough votes to 
pass the Soka bill, so he dropped it for the time being. 
</P>
<P>
 The Soka-sponsored bill would have made it tougher for the conservancy to 
seize the language school's property for parkland through eminent domain. In so 
doing, it would have changed priority rankings for land-use, putting nonprofit 
educational institutions on an equal footing with protected public lands. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our belief is that college degrees are at least as valuable as a walk in the 
park," said Jeff Ourvan, Soka spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Assembly members wanted to hear support from a broad coalition of 
college campuses, not just Soka. Ourvan says he is working on that. 
</P>
<P>
 For three years now, the Legislature has been an arena for the continuing 
Soka/conservancy showdown. That's not likely to change any time soon, given the 
kind of budget (tens of thousands of dollars) that Soka dedicates to Capitol 
lobbying. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 SENSITIVITY TRAINING: In recent weeks, racist literature launching crude 
attacks on Latinos and Jews has been slipped into lockers and distributed in 
parking lots at high school campuses throughout the San Fernando Valley and 
beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents, teachers, students and school administrators are alarmed at this hate 
leaflet trend and want to see it stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to crack down, Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) on Thursday 
introduced a measure to make distribution of such material a crime. It's a 
follow-up, he says, to a 1992 law he co-authored requiring California public 
schools to teach students in grades 7 through 12 about the Holocaust and 
slavery.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; SITE OF WOMAN'S SLAYING TO BE LIT; PUBLIC 
WORKS: SANTA CLARITA AUTHORIZES THE STREET LIGHTS. FRIENDS AND FAMILY OF THE 
VICTIM PUSHED FOR THE PROJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Four months after a woman was dragged off an unlit section of Santa Clarita's 
main east-west thoroughfare and strangled to death, city officials have 
authorized street lights for a dark stretch of the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Veronica Estrada, 29, was walking along Soledad Canyon Road, near Camp Plenty 
Road, about 8:15 p.m. Dec. 15 when she was attacked and pulled over an 
embankment. She was a nationally ranked black belt in tae kwon do, and a 
popular instructor at a Canyon Country martial arts studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart Edward Milburn, 27, who worked with Estrada at the martial arts studio, 
has been charged with her death. He has pleaded not guilty to a murder charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Estrada's death, her friends and relatives have called for placing 
lights along the dark stretch of Soledad Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Deborah Luck and Theresa Estrada also successfully made the lights a campaign 
issue last month, securing pledges from several City Council candidates to 
install them. 
</P>
<P>
 "How many incidents have to occur along that street before we get lights?" 
asked Theresa Estrada, Veronica's sister. 
</P>
<P>
 Their efforts culminated this week when Luck presented the City Council with a 
binder, wrapped in a yellow ribbon, bearing 3,500 signatures asking for lights 
on that portion of Soledad Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dec. 15 changed the lives of many people," Luck said in an emotional plea to 
the council. "One person's light was extinguished that night, but 3,000 other 
people have come together to light up Soledad Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of giving me 20 reasons why it can't be done, you look at Veronica 
Estrada's family, friends and neighbors and you find one damn good reason why 
it should be done," Luck said. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members unanimously approved elevating that segment of Soledad Canyon 
Road from fourth to first place on the city's priority list for street lights, 
apologizing that the process wasn't completed sooner. 
</P>
<P>
 The council decision includes a 20% fee increase for property owners in an 
existing lighting district to cover the cost of the lights. The increased 
annual fees are $6 for houses, $24 for businesses and $48 for mobile home 
parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita previously had no policy for street light installation other 
than requiring developers to include them in new construction. Several unlit 
city streets have no plans for development in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
 Even at the top of the priority list, the unlit portion of Soledad Canyon Road 
in Canyon Country isn't expected to have lights until the beginning of next 
year, according to Tony Nisich, a city engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County administers the lighting district, which predates Santa 
Clarita becoming a city and covers 85% of its area. Once public hearings begin, 
they are expected to take three to four months to approve the fee structure, 
and actual construction should take about two months, Nisich said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the time here will be spent doing the fiscal gymnastics," Nisich 
said. "It's not an engineering issue, it's a procedural issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Some 324 lights will be installed along the 4.25-mile stretch of road, at a 
projected cost of more than $490,000 for design and installation.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; STUDENTS GLIMPSE ELIZABETHAN TIMES

<P>
 Seventh-graders at Sierra Vista Junior High School on Thursday got a much 
closer look at William Shakespeare and Sir Francis Drake than they have in 
their history books. 
</P>
<P>
 The famous men from Elizabethan times visited the Canyon Country campus with 
the help of the Living History Centre, host of the recurring Renaissance 
Pleasure Faire, currently running in San Bernardino County's Glen Helen 
Regional Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "They learned a whole lot of bits and pieces about the theater and everyday 
Elizabethan life," said Linda Underhill, education director for the Living 
History Centre. 
</P>
<P>
 In the presentation, the center's Will Wood portrayed Drake, Michael Cawelti 
took the part of Shakespeare, and Underhill played Mistress Rose, "a common 
woman." 
</P>
<P>
 Students talked with the performers about clothing, marriage customs, 
punishment and being knighted by the queen. The conversation also drifted to 
include the merits and myths of cats. 
</P>
<P>
 The group has been making presentations to schools for eight years, 
instructing at all grade levels. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the performers' second visit to Sierra Vista.  
</P>
<P>
 Junior high schools are common for the performances because the Elizabethan 
period is covered in California's seventh-grade curriculum, Underhill said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 32nd annual Renaissance Pleasure Faire, which re-creates "the merrymaking 
of old English holidays" in marketplaces, pageants and parades, runs weekends 
from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. through June 5. 
</P>
<P>
 To participate, 1,000 performers study "Elizabethan-as-a-Second-Language," 
techniques of improvisation and country dance, song and costume design to 
transform themselves into residents of an Elizabethan town celebrating May 
traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Glen Helen Regional Park is located in Devore at the intersections of 
Interstates 15 and 215. The fair is presented in cooperation with the San 
Bernardino County Regional Parks Department.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; BOMBING SUSPECT'S BAIL SET AT $1.2 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge set bail at $1.2 million Thursday for a Monrovia man accused of 
setting off pipe bombs in Lancaster beneath his ex-wife's pickup truck and 
motor home. 
</P>
<P>
 After approving the steep bail for Charles Edwin Smith, 70, Antelope Municipal 
Court Judge Ian R. Grant postponed Smith's arraignment until today) to give 
Smith time to complete the hiring of his defense attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith was charged with two counts of exploding a destructive device with 
intent to intimidate, terrorize or destroy property; one count of manufacturing 
a destructive device and one count of making terrorist threats. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted on all counts, he could face up to 12 years in state prison, said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Ron Smalstig. Investigators believe the bombing incidents 
stem from a bitter marital breakup. "He's been threatening to kill his 
ex-wife," the prosecutor said. "The evidence I have is that he appears to have 
been stalking her the past six years." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies have alleged that Smith placed a pipe bomb late Monday 
beneath his ex-wife's pickup, which was parked in a driveway outside a house in 
the 1100 block of Herzel Avenue. The ex-wife, Rini Duzanne, 51, was inside the 
house, which belongs to her daughter from a previous marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured in the blast, which caused an estimated $4,000 damage to 
the truck, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith also is charged in connection with a March 26 explosion that damaged 
Duzanne's motor home, which was parked behind a Lancaster restaurant. Duzanne 
was not inside at the time, and no injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Smalstig said Los Angeles Fire Department investigators are trying to 
determine whether Smith is linked to an arson at the Chatsworth house in which 
Duzanne was living last December. No charges have been filed in connection with 
that incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Duzanne said she left her husband in 1988 and that her divorce became final 
last November. 
</P>
<P>
 At today's arraignment, Smith, who remained in Los Angeles County Jail in lieu 
of bail, will enter a plea to the criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Michael C. Eberhardt, who will represent Smith, said he will seek a 
reduction in the $1.2-million bail. Eberhardt said he will ask the judge to 
consider Smith's age, his health and his reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 "My understanding is that he is a very stable person, that he is a well-known 
and respected person in his community and has never had any legal problems in 
the past," the attorney said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; SANTA CLARITA BALLOT RECOUNT SET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 10,426 ballots voters cast for City Council seats last week will be 
electronically recounted Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 H. Clyde Smyth, former superintendent of the William S. Hart Union High School 
District, edged out incumbent Jill Klajic for the third open seat on the 
council by 16 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 The recount was requested by Skip Newhall, Klajic's campaign manager, who said 
he asked for a second vote tally because Klajic's supporters otherwise "would 
always wonder 'What if?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The recount is scheduled to begin at 9 a.m. at Santa Clarita's temporary city 
offices, 21444 Golden Triangle Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Whoever requests a recount is charged for the staff time and supplies. 
Recounting the 10,426 ballots is projected to take four hours and cost $500 if 
done by computer or take five days and cost about $6,840 if counted by hand. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first recount in the history of Santa Clarita, which became a city 
in December, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Smyth, who at last count had edged Klajic by 3,804 votes to 3,788, was sworn 
in Tuesday night along with returning incumbents Jo Anne Darcy and Carl Boyer.

LIQUID OXYGEN LEAK FORCES EVACUATION OF THERAPY UNIT; PUBLIC SAFETY: 
FIREFIGHTERS, FEARING EXPLOSION, GET PATIENTS AND EMPLOYEES OUT OF AFFECTED 
AREA OF FACILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A leak in a 1,000-gallon liquid oxygen tank forced the evacuation Thursday of 
critical-care patients and personnel at a respiratory therapy facility here, 
fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 firefighters and members of hazardous materials teams responded to an 
emergency call at Vencor Corp. Critical Care facility in the 200 block of 
Hospital Circle. 
</P>
<P>
 An employee discovered a leak about 11:40 a.m. in an oxygen tank in the 
building's loading dock, said Capt. Craig Campbell, spokesman for the 
Westminster Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing that the leaking gas could cause an explosion, firefighters evacuated 
the facility's personnel and moved its 46 patients, 20 of whom were hooked up 
to breathing ventilators, to another wing in the building, Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The move of the critical-care patients, especially those on the ventilators, 
was particularly difficult for firefighters, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to substitute the mechanical ventilators with portable resuscitators, 
and it took some doing," Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several dozen hospital employees were evacuated across the street as hazardous 
materials units from Huntington Beach and Newport Beach contained the leak. All 
available Westminster firefighters were present to help carry out the 
evacuation, said Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
 The patients were taken back to their rooms about 1 p.m. after the 
firefighters plugged the leak, Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire investigators speculated that one of the tank's valves may have frozen 
shut, creating pressure that found an outlet through a relief valve, he said. 
Such tanks are supposed to be inspected at least once a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital officials declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the dozens of employees evacuated was Jose Madrigal, who works in the 
hospital's Environmental Services Department. Madrigal said that when he heard 
of the leak he did not panic, but when he saw the firefighters, "I really got 
scared and started heading for the door." 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't play around with gas, it doesn't matter if it's oxygen," Madrigal 
said. "The right combination and, boom! "

WOMAN KILLED, HUSBAND HURT IN COLLISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Laguna Niguel woman was killed Thursday in a three-car, rush-hour collision 
near the intersection of the San Diego and San Gabriel River freeways, the 
California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Witte, 65, was fatally injured and her husband, Norman Witte, 63, who was 
driving, was seriously injured when their 1988 Pontiac 6000 was struck from 
behind after first colliding with a vehicle in front, CHP Officer Pete 
Gustafson said. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman in the car that struck the Wittes' vehicle was slightly injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Witte was pronounced dead at the scene. Norman Witte was taken to Long 
Beach Memorial Hospital, where he was reported in fair condition. 
</P>
<P>
 The collision occurred just before 5 p.m. on the southbound San Gabriel River 
Freeway, near Katella Avenue. A 1989 Toyota Tercel in front of the Wittes' 
vehicle slowed suddenly because of congestion at the intersection with the San 
Diego Freeway. The Witte car rear-ended the Tercel, doing minor damage to the 
Toyota. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Toyota pulled over to the center divider, the Wittes' Pontiac was hit 
from behind by a 1979 Toyota Corona. The driver of the Corona, a 28-year-old 
Santa Ana woman, suffered minor injuries. Two children in her car were unhurt. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash resulted in a 90-minute SigAlert that backed up traffic to the 
Artesia Freeway, the CHP said.

PARENTING; PARTIES THAT TAKE THE CAKE; * CUSTOMIZED CELEBRATIONS REQUIRE A BIT 
OF IMAGINATION, BUT THEY CAN BE MEMORABLE AND INEXPENSIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For many parents, the idea of staging a child's party at a place that 
mass-produces celebrations has grown stale. Such merry-making can be exhausting 
and even a bit disappointing, and it may leave the whole family wondering about 
the purpose and meaning of kids' celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
 With a little imagination, far more memorable events can be planned -- 
anything from a kidnap breakfast to a tour of a wild-animal park, an hour of 
cheerleading lessons or a nature hike. While such parties may be less expensive 
than the prefabricated celebrations, they can require more creativity and 
planning. But the pay-off is a one-of-a-kind event that won't soon be 
forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 Liz Elledge of Sherman Oaks had a "dress-up" party at home for her daughter 
Rachel's second birthday. Elledge filled an old trunk full of silky, lacy old 
clothes, and provided lots of glittery jewelry, hats, high-heeled shoes and 
gloves for the little girls to try on. "It was great fun," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since that party Elledge has tried the full range of possibilities -- renting 
two ponies for her son Zachary's first birthday, hiring a clown to come to the 
house for a circus-themed event and taking about 20 6-year-old girls to a 
beauty shop for individual make-overs, at $20 a guest.  
</P>
<P>
 Elledge has found that what kids want most has nothing to do with high-cost 
party trimmings. "Children want to be with their friends, and that's all they 
care about," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 But a little ingenuity can go a long way. K. T. Appleby, 8, recently invited 
her friends to a party at the Wildlife Waystation in Lake View Terrace, a 
facility otherwise open only twice a month to those with advance reservations. 
The children were taken on a docent-lead, 45-minute tour of the grounds, seeing 
animals like lions, bears, wolves and peacocks. They then had cake and punch in 
a park-like area on the grounds. (The Waystation requests a donation for the 
tour; the suggested fee, including decorations and paper goods, is $175 for up 
to 48 children.) 
</P>
<P>
 "The important thing is having fun and enjoying yourself," said K. T. "I think 
we all had a good time." 
</P>
<P>
 Kappy Appleby, K. T.'s mother, thought of the tour because it was something 
she also had long wanted to do. "I think families should consider how much the 
parents are going to enjoy the activity too. You're going to be there, and it's 
going to reflect back to the children if the adults aren't having a good time," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robin Charin, of Robin the Clown in Studio City, reports that the new party 
philosophy among both parents and children is that less is more. For 10 years, 
Charin has helped choreograph and perform at children's parties, from simple 
neighborhood events to extravaganzas for the children of the rich and famous. 
</P>
<P>
 "Huge, expensive parties crested in the early '90s," Charin said. "There was a 
period of mass consumption when you had to outdo yourself. Now the idea is to 
have something simple and fun."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Charin has found that as children grow older, the task of finding a perfect 
party idea can become even more challenging. Not only have parents run through 
the typical themes, but the children are also less excited at seeing a Barbie 
or Power Ranger look-alike show up at the front door. 
</P>
<P>
 Charin recommends having someone come to teach the guests something new. She 
has done makeup parties, with the girls parading to Madonna's "Material Girl," 
and was recently hired by a family in Toluca Lake to teach a group of 
11-year-old girls to be-bop (each runs about $150, whatever the group's size). 
Sports, dance and makeup seem to be successful themes for older elementary 
school-age children, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents who find new party paradigms intriguing may have some trouble 
convincing their children that an untested idea will be appreciated by their 
friends. One mother spent weeks talking her almost 8-year-old son into having a 
nature-hike birthday party. He favored the idea of a tried-and-true, socially 
safe bowling party, but ended up thoroughly enjoying the more adventurous 
alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 The less scripted parties can also pose problems for parents. A father who was 
picking up 7- and 8-year-old girls for a surprise kidnap breakfast in the wee 
hours of the morning was nonplussed when one invitee's parents had forgotten 
the party altogether -- and had an uninvited member of the class sleeping over. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the more creativity parents use in their party designs, the less 
charted the territory. But even if there are problems -- glue that won't stick 
in the middle of a craft-centered party, or kids who find running self-designed 
relay races more exciting than learning a dance routine from a hired 
cheerleader -- the event can still be successful.  
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line with parties is that no matter what happens, the kids have 
fun," Elledge said. 10 Fresh Ideas for Fun 
</P>
<P>
 1. Surprise kidnap breakfast: Pick up the kids before they have a chance to 
wake up -- or change out of their pajamas -- and take them out to breakfast at 
a nearby restaurant. If you like, take guests back home afterward for casual 
party games. Good for kids age 6 and up. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Dress-up party (especially fun for girls 3 to 6): Prepare a roomful of fun 
clothes, hats, shoes and jewelry, and take plenty of pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Cheerleading: Hire a local cheerleader to teach crowd-pleasing routines to 
girls 6 and up. All you need is a tape deck, plastic pompons, and an open area. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Nature hike: Take a hike on the wild side, at a nearby park, or to a place 
a reasonable car ride away. Try to pretest the excursion to make sure it's the 
right length and level of difficulty for the group, which might range from age 
6 to 12. Bring individual water bottles and plenty of snacks. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Craft party: Select something to make at a local craft store, and buy all 
the fixings needed for the guests. Children from 4 to 12 enjoy making things -- 
from painted ceramics to T-shirts, jewelry boxes to lanyards. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Take a trip: Pick a fun place to explore, and make sure you have enough 
drivers, seat belts, food and drink. Ideas include whale watching or a harbor 
tour, a visit to a nearby museum, zoo or historical site, pedal boating on a 
lake, or even a concert. Works for kids 5 to 13. 
</P>
<P>
 7. Old-fashioned picnic with games and sports: This perennial favorite can 
include everything from gunnysack races to water-balloon catch, egg rolls and 
relay races. Fun for any age. 
</P>
<P>
 8. A Teddy bear tea party: Invite the guests to bring along their favorite 
bear, and serve high tea/juice with little sandwiches. Party games and cake can 
round out the occasion. Good for children 3 to 6. 
</P>
<P>
 9. Book-character party: Ask youngsters age 3 and up to come as their favorite 
storybook or children's-novel character. Activities can include charades, 
make-your-own sundaes, pass-the-orange, spoon races and relay races.  
</P>
<P>
 10. Learn-a-dance party: Teach boys and girls age 8 and older a new (or old) 
dance routine, and turn up the music. Food can include munchies, pizza and 
'50s-style milkshakes. For More Ideas:

PARENTING; MUSIC TO CHILDREN'S EARS; * THERE ARE MANY ALTERNATIVES TO SUGARY 
AND COMMERCIAL RECORDINGS. HOWEVER, THEY ARE OFTEN DIFFICULT TO FIND. 
</P>

<P>
 Tired of Disney movie soundtracks, Barney tapes and sugary soprano lullabies? 
Many parents are unaware that there's a cornucopia of alternative children's 
music out there. Some of the artists making this music have backgrounds in 
education or psychology and they key their lyrics to important developmental 
issues. Others are simply wonderful musicians who love children and feel 
inspired to write for them. 
</P>
<P>
 One problem: It's hard to find albums by these out-of-the-way artists at chain 
record stores. Select toy stores and children's bookstores are a better source. 
</P>
<P>
 Imaginarium in Canoga Park stocks a wide variety of audiocassettes, both 
mainstream and alternative, and its salespeople are knowledgeable. When asked 
about her current favorites, saleswoman Jenny Brown recently enthused over the 
work of artist John McCutcheon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Musically speaking, he's the most talented of all the children's artists," 
she said. "He plays a range of instruments. His songs are wonderful and I'd 
recommend 'Family Garden' (Rounder Records, $10.95) to anyone with a child from 
2 to 10 years old." 
</P>
<P>
 For parents with battered ears, Brown sees Peter, Paul and Mary as a godsend. 
"The harmonies go down easily," she reported. "There are no treacly songs. Your 
child will love 'Peter, Paul and Mommy, Too' (Warner Bros. Records, $11.95), 
and you won't go crazy listening to it." 
</P>
<P>
 In this vein, she continued: "I'd also recommend Joe Scruggs. His sense of 
humor pleases everyone. We sell a lot of 'Deep in the Jungle' (Educational 
Graphics Press, Inc., $9.95), and customers come back to the store to tell me 
how much they love it." 
</P>
<P>
 At Intelliplay (in Woodland Hills and Sherman Oaks), owner Tsippi Wilson 
stocks selected titles that she's enjoyed with her own children. "We've 
listened to all the Joanie Bartels albums together," she said, "and I recommend 
them all, from the traveling music you play in your car to the get-up-and-dance 
tapes. No one will be disappointed buying a Joanie Bartels tape" (Discovery 
Music, $10.95). 
</P>
<P>
 Page's Books for Children and Young Adults in Tarzana carries hundreds of 
titles of children's music. Owner Darlene Daniels listed her personal favorite 
for preschoolers now as David Jack's "Gotta Hop" (Golden Music, $10.98). 
According to Daniels, "It's filled with bouncy rhythms and catchy lyrics and 
it's just right for the child who's discovering his powers of movement." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For ages 4 to 10, said Daniels, "I'd buy anything by Tickle Tune Typhoon. This 
group has humane values, a great contemporary beat and sly, funny lyrics. 
'Circle Around' (Music for Little People, $9.98) is my favorite recording of 
theirs. It won a 1991 Parents' Choice Medal and the American Library Assn.'s 
Notable Children's Recording Award." 
</P>
<P>
 A title that comes up again and again among people familiar with the 
children's music field is "For the Children," an album recorded at a concert 
for the Pediatric AIDS Foundation. It features pop artists like Bette Midler, 
Bruce Springsteen, Patti LaBelle and others singing traditional children's 
songs. This album, which gets across-the-board raves, is a Disney product 
available at most mainstream record stores ($10.95). 
</P>
<P>
 For parents who like to take their youngsters to concerts, the Children's 
Concert Calendar lists musical events for kids that are staged in bookstores, 
parks and malls throughout the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Performers at these events include such dedicated musicians as Dan Crow, 
Dennis Hysom, Joanie Bartels and Nina Ryne. Their cassettes are usually 
available after the concert. (To request a $4 annual subscription, write Teri 
Baker, 14431 Ventura Blvd., 285, Sherman Oaks, CA 91423.) 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to concert-going, a good way to shop for new sounds is to tune in 
to the children's music station Radio Aahs (located at 830 on the AM dial). The 
station blends mainstream and alternative children's music in about a 70/30 
ratio. Careful listeners who jot down the title and recording company of tunes 
they like can then contact record companies, which often have an 800 number for 
telephone ordering. 
</P>
<P>
 Further information on new kids' music -- including a "best list" compiled by 
experts around the country -- is available through "Parents' Choice," a 
nonprofit consumer guide to the latest children's media. An $18 annual 
subscription buys dependable advice on books, toys, videos, music, computer 
programs, television and magazines for youngsters. (To subscribe, write the 
Parents' Choice Foundation, Box 185, Newton, MA 02168.)

 Alan McNary plays guitar for kindergartners, tutors students in reading and 
fixes broken bunny cages and tricycles at Apperson Street Elementary School in 
Sunland.  
</P>
<P>
 At Chatsworth Park Elementary, Michele DeGaetano takes temperatures and 
applies ice packs to feverish children, teaches jewelry-making classes and 
heads the school's booster club.  
</P>
<P>
 At Canterbury Avenue Elementary in Pacoima, Connie Carbajal types lessons for 
teachers, buys materials for art projects and leads the girls' drill team. 
</P>
<P>
 McNary, DeGaetano and Carbajal are not school employees. They are parents -- 
just three of thousands of moms and dads throughout the Valley who form a 
prominent presence at their children's schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Such participation represents a growing trend: National PTA surveys show that 
more than a third of all parents volunteer at schools in some capacity, and 
more than half belong to school-parent groups or booster clubs.  
</P>
<P>
 In the Los Angeles Unified School District, about 15,000 volunteers -- more 
than a third of them Valley residents -- do everything from cleaning up 
campuses to keeping libraries open.  
</P>
<P>
 "My daughter really enjoys having Dad around -- and I could see the more 
involved I got, the more problems I could solve," said McNary. "Schools don't 
have a lot of resources, and the district is really strapped."  
</P>
<P>
 Other parents, he said, staff the school's computer lab, tutor children, work 
in the cafeteria or help coordinate events.  
</P>
<P>
 Now more than ever, parent volunteers are needed at cash-poor public schools. 
The L.A. school district's budget has been slashed by $1.4 billion since 1989, 
according to district spokesman Pat Spencer. In the same period, the number of 
students increased by almost 50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents no longer take schools and education for granted," said Joan Suter, 
director of the district's volunteer program. According to Suter, parents have 
set up science labs, art studios, photography programs, dance classes and 
theater productions at schools.  
</P>
<P>
 After the Jan. 17 earthquake, parent volunteers made phone calls to notify 
each other of school closings and meetings, helped clean debris from campuses 
and soothed children's jangled nerves. 
</P>
<P>
 A widespread disaster such as an earthquake usually boosts the number of 
parents on campus, said Rosa Soto of San Fernando, a community representative 
for the school district. "Many parents want to stay closer to their kids -- and 
the schools have things for them to do."  
</P>
<P>
 Parents who work 9 to 5 also play significant roles on campus. For example, 
Carbajal, a saleswoman for a vitamin manufacturer, types and photocopies 
lessons, donates needed supplies and regularly attends PTA and leadership 
council meetings.  
</P>
<P>
 "I do whatever I can because it is important for (my kids) to know I care 
about their education and their school," she said. "And if I want my opinions 
heard, I have to get involved."  
</P>
<P>
 Such parent-school alliances result not only in more effective schools, but 
also in higher grade and test scores, long-term academic achievement and 
positive student attitudes and behavior, according to the National Committee 
for Citizens in Education. The Washington, D.C.-based organization has 
documented about 50 studies citing the benefits of parental involvement.  
</P>
<P>
 McNary doesn't need research to tell him parental involvement works. "The 
better students at our school are those whose parents volunteer," he said. 
"Maybe they are there only once a month; maybe they show up only for meetings, 
but they are there, and they have the finger on the pulse of what is going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet parents who are active on elementary campuses tend to disappear when their 
children reach junior high. 
</P>
<P>
 Fewer than 1,000 of the school system's 15,000 volunteers can be found at 
middle or secondary schools. But adolescents desperately need adult guidance 
and role models, said middle school teacher Terry Wang of Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
 Carbajal says she intends to stay active when her 11-year-old daughter Valerie 
attends middle school next September. "I always stick by my children when they 
do homework. I always go to conferences and open houses. I always push them to 
do their best, to be all they can be. And I will continue that, no matter what 
schools my children go to." What You Can Do 
</P>
<P>
 A survey of local teachers and administrators yielded the following advice for 
parents eager to help at their children's schools: 
</P>
<P>
 * Get to know the principal and teachers and ask how you can assist on campus. 
Simply say, "These are some things I do well and have an interest in; this is 
the amount of time I have available. What can I do to help?" 
</P>
<P>
 * Join your school's PTA, leadership council or booster club. Get active on 
the group's board or join a committee.  
</P>
<P>
 * Parents who work during the day can stuff envelopes, grade papers or type 
lessons at home, assist at weekend or evening events, chaperon field trips or 
provide refreshments for parties. If you can spare an occasional hour or two, 
offer to talk to a class during career day, or escort students on a tour of 
your place of business. 
</P>
<P>
 * Even parents with the most crowded schedules can show their interest and 
concern in their child's education. Read and respond to memos from teachers, 
read to your child every day (or insist that children spend 15 minutes a day 
reading on their own), telephone teachers and principals to monitor your 
child's progress and attend open houses and parent-teacher conferences.

PARENTING; BATTLES OVER BEDTIME; * GETTING YOUNG CHILDREN TO SLEEP WHEN THEY 
SHOULD IS ACHIEVABLE, BUT REQUIRES TOLERANCE AND CONSISTENCY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As long as there have been parents and children, there have been battles over 
bedtime. Some are small and brief. Others seem like never-ending nightmares. 
</P>
<P>
 Claire Perrier, Sherman Oaks mother of Domi nick, 6, and Nichola, 5, recalled 
trying to explain this to her childless sister. "She wanted to know, 'Why is 
bedtime such a terrible thing with your kids?' " Perrier said. "I told her, 
'Believe me, it's a terrible thing with all kids.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Pediatricians and other experts say getting young children to sleep when you 
want them to is an achievable goal, although one that requires tolerance, 
consistency and an understanding that not all kids are the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "I give parents examples of two geniuses," said Dr. Willa Olsen, a Northridge 
pediatrician. "Einstein slept 12 hours a day. Maybe not every single night, but 
he slept a good piece of his life away. Edison is said to have slept four or 
five hours. It just has to do with individual requirements, even for geniuses." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Dennis McGinty, lab director of the sleep disorder center at Northridge 
Hospital Medical Center, said organic sleep disorders in children are rare. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the problems are caused by a conflict between the hopes or intentions 
of the parents and the child's schedule," he said. "It's not like there is a 
right or wrong. All you can do is create a kind of relaxed state for them to be 
in to fall asleep." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Olsen suggests adopting a simple routine that can be followed each night. 
Children, she said, seem to thrive when expectations are spelled out in an 
understandable way. "You need to be able to adhere to a basic game plan so that 
you can keep your wits about you even if you're tired," she said. "Some of the 
defiance just comes from the age of the child. They're asserting themselves. If 
you can follow through on your plan in a low-key, friendly way, they'll handle 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Pam Ricks of Granada Hills has successfully taken that approach with her 
4-year-old daughter, Samantha. "She expects the same thing every night -- teeth 
brushed, pajamas on and into bed for a couple of stories," said Ricks, who also 
has a 2-year-old son. "You just have to find something that works for you and 
your kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Olsen suggests monitoring a child's daytime activity as a way of predicting 
success at bedtime. For example, is your child getting enough to eat? "If you 
don't get the calories you need, you would be tired but not sleepy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also important to factor in how much your child is allowed to sleep 
during the day. "A child will sleep for only one long cycle during a 24-hour 
period," Olsen said. "If your child was allowed to sleep a great deal during 
the day, they're going to be wide awake and ready for the party to start when 
you want them to go to bed at night." 
</P>
<P>
 McGinty suggests taking control of the situation in the morning. "You can't 
cause them to fall asleep, but you can cause them to wake up," he said. "It 
might be tough on you in the short run, but if you get them up earlier and get 
them activated right away, they will probably be more sleepy at bedtime." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, some children will not get the hang of things regardless of how 
well you plan and monitor. Even if your kids fall asleep in their own bed or 
crib, there's no guarantee that they will want to remain there the whole night. 
Untold numbers of double-, queen- and king-sized beds are full each night and 
morning with sleeping parents and their children. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Our kids have their own rooms with nice beds," said Lucy Svensson of Canoga 
Park, who has a 3-year-old son, Lars, and a 2-year-old daughter, Kady. "But 
when they walk in crying during the middle of the night and you're tired, well, 
sometimes it's just easier to pull them in with you. 
</P>
<P>
 "It might not be comfortable," she added, "but at least everyone goes back to 
sleep. My husband said we should sell the house and get a one-bedroom 
apartment." 
</P>
<P>
 Opinions vary on the best way to handle sleep disturbances. Some parents let 
their children cry themselves back to sleep. Others try to soothe them by voice 
or touch. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the approach, experts suggest installing a night light in a child's 
room. It serves not only as a comfort for the child, but allows a parent to see 
in from the doorway.

 "In a way, the best message is to get parents to follow common sense," McGinty 
said. "You just have to be tolerant and realize how individualistic children 
are." In short, he concludes, all Mom or Dad can do is this: "Create a relaxed 
mood, and keep your fingers crossed." Joys of Sleep Deprivation 
</P>
<P>
 It's 3:45 a.m., time to get to work on that story about how my wife and I 
manage to get three kids under age 4 to sleep through the night without a fuss. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, I must hurry. Someone is bound to wake up soon, although it won't 
be our 1-month-old son, Will, who's been screaming for the last 45 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Will, in fact, is the reason that father and son are sitting here in a 
darkened home office. On sleepless nights such as these, you take inspiration 
where you can find it. I'm typing with one hand because Will is cradled in my 
left arm. Here's hoping the tap-tap-tap of the keystrokes will send him off 
into dreamland because warm blankets, a cozy bassinet, a full tummy, a dry 
diaper, close proximity to Mom and an untold number of songs, rhymes and pleas 
from Dad have failed to do the trick. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember when I told my own mother of Will's impending birth. Recalling the 
joys of sleep deprivation produced by my sister, brother and me, she just shook 
her head, rolled her eyes and knowingly murmured, "Oy." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, my wife, Kathy, and I were confident that we had things under control 
the day Will came home from the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Casey, our 3 1/2-year-old daughter, has never been much of a problem 
sleep-wise. When she was an infant, any late-night partying on her part was 
easily squelched by picking her up and waltzing her around the living room. Nat 
King Cole or Madonna always did the job. Four songs and she was out. 
Guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Casey sleeps soundly in her own bed. She is living proof that when 
a child spends almost every waking hour running through the back yard and house 
at warp speed, she will eventually run out of gas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher, our 18-month-old son, has always been enthusiastic about bedtime. 
Turn on the dinosaur-shaped twinkling lights, tell him a story and he's sawing 
logs in his crib within 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 On our first official night together as a family of five, I was feeling pretty 
confident. Kathy and the kids all were snoozing soundly by 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Three hours later, reality placed a wake-up call. 
</P>
<P>
 Casey called out, "Da-a-a-d," and threw up in her bed, starting a chain 
reaction of tears and screams from all family members. 
</P>
<P>
 After hosing down the bedding and Casey's pajamas outside, I spent the rest of 
the night lying on the hallway floor and ushering Casey to the bathroom every 
30 minutes. Fatherhood. Hey, you've gotta love it. 
</P>
<P>
 About 3 a.m., Casey was vomiting, Will was nursing and Christopher was jumping 
up and down in his crib. I looked at Kathy, laughed deliriously and said, 
"Well, things can only get better, right?" 
</P>
<P>
 Things have, indeed, improved since then. Casey and Christopher are generally 
fed by 5 p.m., bathed by 6, and asleep for the night between 7 and 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Will, of course, still wakes up when he needs to be fed -- or when he wants to 
spend some quality time with Dad on deadline. He's been nodding off the last 
few sentences, so I'll give him the honor of typing the final word on the 
subject before we call it a night.

PARENTING; IN STEP WITH SOCIAL GRACES; * COTILLION TEACHES CHILDREN MORE THAN 
DANCING. IT OFFERS A CHAPERONED INTRODUCTION TO THE OPPOSITE SEX.

<P>
 Flash back to the Age of Innocence when exquisite table manners, graceful 
dancing and witty repartee were as essential to a young person's education as 
the skills needed for a profession. 
</P>
<P>
 Flash forward to 1994, where kids are more apt to identify with flatware-free 
Big Macs, hip-hop and Beavis and Butt-head. Amid such influences, some parents, 
seeking a more balanced cultural diet for their children, are turning to 
classes in social graces called cotillions. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the word cotillion is the name of a French dance, in current American 
usage it denotes a combination of etiquette lessons and ballroom-dance 
instruction. For parents, it's also a chance to allow youngsters, under the eye 
of proper chaperons, to have their first social contacts with the opposite sex. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents know this is not dancing school, this is social training," says Gaye 
Smith, who runs a program called National Cotillions in Westlake Village and 
Beverly Hills. The etiquette portion of Smith's program features lessons in 
courtesy as well as deportment. 
</P>
<P>
 While youngsters might balk initially at the prospect of spending free time 
learning to walk across a room, the feedback from students is surprisingly 
good. "It's fun and you get to learn fun things," says Shannon McLaughlan, 14, 
of Chatsworth, who has been taking cotillion classes for three years. "The boys 
like meeting the girls," she adds, "even if they don't like the etiquette." 
</P>
<P>
 Her brother, 10-year-old Kevan McLaughlan, doesn't even mind the etiquette. As 
he puts it, "The manners part has helped me a lot. Now, when I bump into 
someone, I say excuse me." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacqueline Swarthout Smith, a Palms Springs resident who teaches cotillions at 
the Encino Woman's Club and the Northridge Woman's Club, believes that whatever 
attitude students start out with, they'll be glad later that they took her 
class. As for laying the groundwork with reluctant youngsters, she believes, 
"It's up to parents to make children understand it's good for them." 
</P>
<P>
 The cotillion season runs from October through April, but now is the time to 
enroll -- or consider enrolling -- children for the fall. Gaye Smith registers 
students during March and April, until classes are full. Swarthout Smith holds 
sign-ups in the fall but offers an April registration option as well as a 
September information meeting, for those who want to learn more before 
enrolling. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the season begins, Swarthout Smith conducts monthly classes for children 
from fourth through eighth grade. Her program, which is called the Swarthout 
Valley Cotillions and was started by her parents in 1939, consists of seven 
sessions, four of which focus on dancing and etiquette lessons. The other three 
are full-blown cotillion parties, some themed -- like the Western Hoe-Down -- 
others more formal. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaye Smith's Westlake Village classes -- held during the same time period for 
students from fourth through 12th grade -- are all centered around parties. 
Each month, participants begin by going through a formal receiving line, during 
which they must properly present their escorts. Other skills they pick up 
include how to cut in on a dance and carry on a civilized conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although perceived by some as intended only for would-be debutantes and their 
dates, Valley cotillion programs are open to a variety of interested 
youngsters, depending on available space. While most of Smith's students come 
to her through recommendations from former students, private schools and 
country clubs, only a small portion actually go on to make a formal social bow. 
The same is true for Swarthout Smith, who sees a mere handful of aspiring debs 
in her classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon McLaughlan, one of the girls who does plan to make a debut, 
appreciates the social training she gets from Swarthout Smith. While her 
brothers, both fellow students, go through this too, the 11-year-old, Erik, 
merely endures it as he waits for what he really enjoys. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like how they teach you to dance," he reveals. "It's modern -- not just the 
old-fashioned ways -- and more than one step." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever their reasons, the McLaughlans' mother Denise is simply grateful 
they'll go to a cotillion. She, too, attended the Swarthout program as a 
Sherman Oaks teen-ager and regards it as preparation for later life. 
</P>
<P>
 As might be expected, such an educational amenity doesn't come cheap. Tuition 
for Swarthout Smith's 1994-95 classes will run $140 per student, with 
scholarships available. Gaye Smith charges $75 per student. WHERE AND WHEN

PARENTING; CAMPS IN STEP WITH CHANGING TIMES; MANY GROUPS ARE ADDING HIGH-TECH 
PROGRAMS, ALTHOUGH TRADITIONAL ACTIVITIES REMAIN VERY POPULAR.

 Paul Emmer of Northridge, 11, has attended camp every summer for the past 
eight years. But despite his ample camping expertise, Paul can not remember 
ever sitting around a campfire, roasting marshmallows or engaging in 
sing-alongs and ghost stories. Ask him what he does at Sierra Canyon Day Camp 
in Chatsworth, and he'll yak about magic lessons and Mac computers, go-carts 
and racing cars, and field trips to Raging Waters and Venice Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 As Paul's experience illustrates, camps have undoubtedly changed since the 
parents of today's campers were kids -- but perhaps not as much as one might 
think. After all, Paul also lists arts and crafts, fishing and swimming among 
his favorite camp activities. "Everything is interesting and really, really 
fun," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's new is old," said Saul Rowen, who has operated Cali-Camp Day Camp in 
Topanga for 39 years. "Children still love arts and crafts, creative 
dramatization and the things we had years ago, but they may be presented in a 
different way nowadays. We still expose children to the natural environment, 
give them an opportunity to be very self-reliant and teach them skills that are 
different from what they have been taught in school." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Shirley Walch, executive director of the Calabasas-based Southern 
California section of the American Camping Assn., most camps continue to offer 
an array of traditional activities. "But they also incorporate what's hot in 
society -- everything from windsurfing to jet skiing to video making," she 
said. "Camps keep pace with the interests of families and children, especially 
in terms of high-tech activities." 
</P>
<P>
 But the most popular camp offerings call for neither expensive equipment nor 
technological wizardry. Several camp directors said horseback riding remains a 
favorite among campers, especially girls. Boys continue to gravitate to sports. 
And the youngest campers love it all. "The little kids are the easiest to 
please. Everything excites them," Walch said. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep up with the latest trends, old camp-time favorites often take on a new 
look. For example, because today's youth are more aware of the environment than 
previous generations, arts and crafts are likely to incorporate finds from 
nature, such as dried leaves, thistles and pine cones. Dramatic presentations 
may include rap songs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids' interests spring from what they see on TV or are taught in school," 
Rowen said. "We also have to realize that counselors today are different from 
30 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 In response to children's shifting interests, Rowen eliminated roller-skating 
and added dune buggies and go-carts to the repertoire of offerings at 
Cali-Camp. "Many of us look at motorized off-road vehicles and say it is not a 
true camp activity," he said. "But children have needs, and their needs 
change." 
</P>
<P>
 Other sports recently added at many camps include rock climbing, rappelling 
and ropes challenge courses -- activities in which kids, strapped in harnesses 
and dangling from ropes, tackle telephone poles, vertical walls and balance 
beams many feet off the ground. Such deeds of derring-do build self-confidence 
and encourage teamwork, while fulfilling children's need for excitement, 
according to Tom Stephens, director of Cottontail Ranch, a resident camp in 
Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is looking for adventure," he said. "Kids are getting more 
adventurous; our whole society has become more adventurous." 
</P>
<P>
 Specialty camps that focus on a single activity or theme are often offered as 
a separate program within a traditional day camp. Listed in the American 
Camping Assn's. directory of accredited Southern California camps, for example, 
are water skiing and weight loss camps, baseball and soccer camps, acting and 
academic camps, and astronomy and oceanography camps. 
</P>
<P>
 While some specialty camps concentrate on a single area of interest or 
instruction, others offer split-day programs, with a few hours devoted to the 
specialty and the rest of the day spent on general camp activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Specialty camps come and go depending on what's popular at the moment," Walch 
said. "Single-sport camps are very popular." 
</P>
<P>
 Computer camps continue to be among the most common specialty camps around the 
San Fernando Valley. "We got on the computer bandwagon 12 years ago," Rowen 
said. "Every year, we think it will not work because children have computers in 
school and in their homes. But many children take it year after year." 
</P>
<P>
 Computers are also popular at Sierra Canyon, which offers specialty Macintosh 
and baseball camps. "Our specialty camps are based on what kids want and what 
parents ask for," camp director Steve Schachter said. "Parents come to us and 
say, 'Why don't you offer baseball camp? Why don't you offer a computer camp?' 
So we offer them." 
</P>
<P>
 Sue Emmer decided against baseball camp for her sons, Paul and Scott, 6. "My 
feeling is the kids play so much baseball during the year. Enough!" she said. 
"But computers are very 'now.' There are new computer programs to learn, and I 
think kids are more interested than ever. I just started to learn computers 
over the last couple of years myself, and I would love to spend a week playing 
with different programs and seeing what is available." 
</P>
<P>
 As a child, Emmer, 40, attended camp every summer. She compares her camping 
experiences with that of her sons. "Except for the computers, there are not a 
lot of differences between then and now," she said. "The kids still do the 
swimming and hiking. They still get on a horse, bring home crafts and go on 
field trips. Kids may be different today, but I don't think camps have changed 
terribly." Checking Out Facilities 
</P>
<P>
 The American Camping Assn. offers a free directory of accredited camps in 
Southern California. Call (818) 223-9232. The association also publishes a 
nationwide directory of more than 2,000 accredited camps for $12.95 (price 
includes shipping). Call (800) 428-CAMP. 
</P>
<P>
 The Western Assn. of Independent Camps offers a free directory of summer camps 
in California and eight other Western states. Call (800) 758-7519. Ask the Camp 
Director  
</P>
<P>
 Before settling on a camp, parents should visit the camp while it is in 
operation and ask the camp director questions about anything that concerns 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Camping Assn. suggests that parents get answers to the following 
questions: 
</P>
<P>
 * What is the background of the director? Camp directors should have completed 
recent in-service training and have administrative camp experience. 
</P>
<P>
 * What is the camp's philosophy? Does the camp promote competition among 
teams? Or does it foster non-competitive, cooperative learning? 
</P>
<P>
 Are activities geared to a particular age group or skill level? 
</P>
<P>
 * What is the ratio of counselors to campers? In sleep-away camps, depending 
on the ages of young participants, ratios should range from one staff member 
for every six campers age 6 to 8 to one staff member for every 10 teen-age 
campers. 
</P>
<P>
 For day camps, suggested ratios range from one staff member for every eight 
young campers to one staff member for every 12 teen-age campers. 
</P>
<P>
 * What is the transportation system? How often are vehicles used? How often 
are they inspected? 
</P>
<P>
 * How old are the counselors? Most of them should be 18 or older; all should 
be at least two years older than the campers. 
</P>
<P>
 If swimming is included in activities, are qualified lifeguards on duty at all 
times? 
</P>
<P>
 * What percentage of campers return each year? A high proportion of returning 
campers usually indicates satisfaction with the camp. 
</P>
<P>
 * How are special needs handled? What provisions and facilities are available 
for special requirements? 
</P>
<P>
 Is a nurse on staff? Where is insulin or medication stored? What care is 
provided for children who become ill? 
</P>
<P>
 * Are references available? Check them out.

MIRAGES OF SUMMER; * THE IMAGE, AS SHOWN IN THOSE IRRESISTIBLE FULL-COLOR 
BROCHURES, OFTEN DOES NOT MATCH THE REALITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Last week a friend called to tell me she had signed her son up at summer camp. 
From the way she went on about this place you would have thought it promised to 
prepare kids for a shot at the Olympics. Among its offerings were 
boogie-boarding, bodysurfing, mountain biking, water-skiing and canoeing. And 
these were just for starters. Next, her Johnny would be rappelling down 
mountain cliffs and bungee jumping off suspension bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought about this kid. Johnny is, as far as I know, allergic to physical 
activity. He's the kind of kid who has to be really up to play a game of jacks. 
I got a sudden flash of him panting after a long line of robust boys, his 
glasses askew, his face as mottled as the inside of a watermelon. 
</P>
<P>
 That brought back my own memories as a summer camper. The most vivid memories 
center on a boil the size of Cincinnati that appeared on my back the second day 
of camp and made all physical activity excruciating. Serving a volleyball felt 
like a back peel. In baseball, I could only manage grounders. 
</P>
<P>
 At first the other kids seemed sympathetic but soon they stopped picking me 
for teams. They started giggling when they asked how I was doing. Not long 
after that they were calling me "Vesuvius." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, after an eternity of helping the counselors count and sort equipment, 
I recovered, but my troubles were far from over. The program had shifted to 
water sports. A new enemy surfaced in the form of grapefruit-sized bluebottle 
flies that zoomed straight for me during canoe practice. My canoeing partner, 
of course, had to be the toughest girl in camp who watched stonily as the flies 
dove and I, flailing, tipped us over. That night she got back at me by putting 
a small army of centipedes in my bunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Memories like these die hard. No wonder I have been letting my children stay 
home for the summer. They can hone their skills at that great summer game, 
SuperNintendo. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh sure, we tried camp one year. It was at one of those schools up on 
Mulholland Drive that resembles a country club when you drive past. What no one 
tells you is that in August those places heat up like foundries. The first day 
my daughter was there, the kids fainted from heat prostration. After that the 
counselors confined them to special underground rooms where they talked about 
Native Americans and made prayer mats out of buffalo chips and flattened tuna 
cans. 
</P>
<P>
 From time to time vans showed up to ferry the youngsters to the swimming pool 
at a YMCA in Van Nuys. For this I paid a tuition roughly equal to the GNP of 
Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Parents such as me are between a rock and a hard place when it comes to camp. 
On the one hand there's the lure, expensive but irresistible, as shown in those 
full-color camp brochures: kids riding horseback, swimming, singing around the 
campfire. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side are the less photogenic realities -- nature on the rampage: 
wasps' nests, lake water the temperature of Pluto, bugs left over from the 
Pleistocene era. Worse yet, there's that bottom line of children's social 
lives, the pecking order. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everybody rides high in the saddle. 
</P>
<P>
 A case in point was my friend Aileen from the fifth grade. I remember the day 
she came back from a camp in the Catskills. I naturally was poised to 
sympathize. In a way that I could relate to, her bony little body was 
pock-marked with mosquito bites, streaked with calamine lotion. As she talked 
about her experience her face went from streaked to stippled. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One day a bunch of tough girls had called her "four eyes," ripped off her 
glasses and thrown them in the lake. Another clique pulled off her pajama top 
to make fun of her tiny asymmetrical breasts. "The worst was when my spaghetti 
started to move," she wept. Someone had laced it with live fish bait. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Aileen told me, she got fed up. One morning she and another girl 
sneaked off from their tormentors. Instead of swimming, hiking, biking and 
riding, they threw themselves on their backs in a secluded spot across the 
lake. First they just lounged around and talked. After a while they skimmed a 
few smooth stones across the water. Then they lay down again and looked up at 
the clouds and made up stories about what they saw. They ate some lunch, played 
a little catch, fell asleep. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, if only camps could promise that kind of summer for our kids. Those 
endless, suspended moments of self-forgetting. No pressure. No 
responsibilities. Peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that would be worth the GNP of Luxembourg.

PARENTING; KIDS AND HABITS: GIVE 'EM A BREAK; * FROM BURPING TO NOSE-PICKING, 
DOCTORS SAY THE BEST ADVICE OFTEN IS TO IGNORE BEHAVIORS RATHER THAN TRY TO 
STOP THEM.

 Isaac Gonzalez, 11, can't stop cracking his knuckles, and it's driving his 
mother crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an awful sound," said Alicia Gonzalez, a public rela tions coordinator 
who lives in San Fernando. "It bothers me because if he continues to do this, 
he will have huge, ugly hands." 
</P>
<P>
 Isaac also bites his nails down to the quick, a practice shared by his sister, 
Erica, 8. Erica's twin, Jessica, has her own irritating quirk. She burps. 
Loudly. 
</P>
<P>
 "She does it anywhere and everywhere," said an exasperated Gonzalez. "And of 
course, her sister supports her by laughing." 
</P>
<P>
 Kids do the darndest things -- and parents want them to stop. From burping and 
bed-wetting to nail-biting and nose-picking, children's nasty habits are always 
annoying, often unattractive, sometimes embarrassing and occasionally 
unhealthy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But before taking steps to put an end to a particular behavior, Tarzana 
pediatrician Nan Zaitlen suggests that parents ask themselves if they are 
overreacting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents need to distinguish if this is a problem for them -- versus a problem 
for their child," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I counsel parents to ignore, rather than try to break, many things they see 
as bad habits. If a 4- or 5-year-old child thumb-sucks while relaxing in front 
of the television before going to bed, is that something you really need to 
extinguish? If the child is otherwise fine, if other kids are not making fun of 
the child, if the habit is not doing any damage, we can let it go." 
</P>
<P>
 But experts agree that habits that can lead to physical injury or emotional 
scars need to be stopped. Children who masturbate in public or pick their nose, 
for example, are likely to be taunted by other children, while overzealous 
thumb-sucking or nail-biting can lead to infections and abscesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Dangerous habits, such as head-banging, or repetitive rituals, such as 
constant hand-washing, may signal more serious problems and require 
professional counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Intervention needs to be initiated if the habit is happening to excess, or if 
it is unsafe, dangerous or socially unacceptable," Zaitlen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents should first determine if they inadvertently encourage the habit, said 
Northridge child psychiatrist Stephen Surtshin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents sometimes unwittingly reward the child for a behavior. If a kid 
interrupts conversations, you may be irritated and angry, but you reward the 
kid by giving him attention and terminating your conversation. If a kid breaks 
toys, you don't need to rush to the toy store to replace them. Let the kid live 
with the broken toy." 
</P>
<P>
 Even babies quickly learn how to get their way, according to Burbank 
pediatrician Marsha Gerro. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes babies who are 6 months old or older will get in the habit of 
waking multiple times during the night -- and the parents get in the habit of 
feeding their babies," she said. "By giving the children what they want, the 
parents are reinforcing the behavior. I tell parents to go to the child's room 
and reassure them -- but don't feed them. The child will get the message that 
they can cry, but they are not going to be fed." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bad habits are most easily broken when parents and children work together -- 
not against each other, said Encino clinical psychologist Charles Weinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you get into a tug of war, you are going to lose because the child 
has the ultimate control. Take a positive, team approach." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, parents should reinforce their children's behavior when they are 
not engaged in the habit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be a social reward, a sticker system or coins in a bottle," 
Weinstein said. "Look for something that will motivate the child to stop the 
behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 Since many bad habits are brought on or worsened by stress, tension or 
boredom, experts also recommend that parents introduce calming activities to 
their children. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Projects that keep little hands busy -- molding clay, drawing pictures or 
stringing beads -- are especially effective. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is vital that parents be consistent in their efforts to put an end to the 
habit," Surtshin said. "If a parent gives in just one time, it is just enough 
to reinforce the bad behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 Stacy and David Wagner of Agoura are learning the consequences of 
inconsistency with 7-year-old Zach, who has the habit of throwing his jackets, 
backpack and shoes on the floor of the kitchen, den, living room and, 
occasionally, his own room. 
</P>
<P>
 "I keep on him," David said. "He has to be responsible. But the problem is, 
Stacy will sometimes hang up the clothes for him." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I do pick them up and bring them upstairs for him," Stacy admitted. 
"I get tired of reminding him. It's easier than trying to deal with him." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, David said, "I am looking at his karate uniform on the floor 
right now." What Works; What Doesn't 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't punish. "Punishments, such as 'time out' or bad-tasting ointment on 
fingers may stop a behavior, but only temporarily," said Encino clinical 
psychologist Charles Weinstein. "No learning takes place through punishment." 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't nag. According to Encino psychotherapist Shirley Bekey, "Nagging and 
criticism make the kid resistant and angry." 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't be inconsistent. "Children only get confused if a parent gets very 
concerned when they do something one day but ignores it the next day," said 
Burbank pediatrician Marsha Gerro. 
</P>
<P>
 * Do reward. "Rather than give negative reinforcement for a particular 
behavior, promise them positive rewards for doing what you want them to do," 
Gerro said. "For example, I might promise to apply fingernail polish on a 
little girl if she promises not to bite her nails for a day." 
</P>
<P>
 * Do work with the child. "It's nice when you can get your kid involved," 
Tarzana pediatrician Nan Zaitlen said. "If the child wants to stop the habit, 
you will have more success, but if the kid doesn't want to participate, it can 
be a battle, and the habit can become even more intense." 
</P>
<P>
 * Do agree on a strategy. "Parents need to work together to decide what the 
rules and the important parameters are for their children," Bekey said. "It is 
important that parents have a unified front and not undermine each other."

PARENTING; OUT OF HARM'S WAY; * HOME SAFETY DEVICES HELP PROTECT ADVENTUROUS 
CHILDREN. BUT THERE'S NO SUBSTITUTE FOR A WATCHFUL ADULT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Thirty seconds. That was all it took for Mark Zeolla of Calabasas to get 
Popsicles from the garage freezer for 3-year-old Christina and 13-month-old 
Ciara. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty seconds was all it took for Ciara to drink from the oil-filled lamp on 
the living room table. 
</P>
<P>
 When Zeolla returned, Ciara was gasping for breath. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, she's fine. But, Zeolla remembered, "it was traumatic seeing my 
daughter almost die in my arms." 
</P>
<P>
 He and his wife, Cindy, consider themselves safety-conscious. They had 
installed a gate at the entrance to the living room. But on the day of the 
accident, the gate was inadvertently left unlatched. 
</P>
<P>
 "Child-proofing can give a false sense of security," said Daryl Gregory of Mr. 
Baby Proofer, a Van Nuys safety device installation service. "The key to 
protecting your child is supervision." 
</P>
<P>
 While safety gadgets are no substitute for a parent's watchful presence, they 
do cut down on the potential for disaster. For a curious child exploring the 
world, the potential is considerable. The National Safety Council reports that 
in 1991 about 2 million injuries and in 1992 more than 2,000 deaths of children 
under 5 years were due to home accidents. And the dangers arise early. 
</P>
<P>
 Child-proofing should begin before a baby can crawl -- usually when the child 
is 6 months old. At that point, it's wise for parents to inspect rooms 
thoroughly from the little one's perspective -- on hands and knees -- to 
eliminate potential booby traps. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts in the field single out the following devices and products, which 
address the most common hazards around the home: 
</P>
<P>
 * Cabinet, drawer, garbage pail and appliance latches keep sharp utensils, 
cleaning solutions and other dangers inaccessible to small explorers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Plug inserts for unused outlets, outlet shields, wire covers, lamp cord 
shorteners and VCR guards reduce electrical accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 * Window shade/blind cord shorteners help avert strangulation accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 * Window locks/guards keep children from falling out. 
</P>
<P>
 * Security gates block off stairways and rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 * A locked fence around the pool is a must. Children require constant 
supervision around water, and safety advocates caution against reliance on 
flotation devices or bath support rings for security. 
</P>
<P>
 * Toilet locks, which prevent children from falling into the bowl, can protect 
against drowning. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rubber mats, non-skid appliques and cushion covers for faucets and spouts 
add to bathtub safety. Anti-scald devices offer extra protection. 
</P>
<P>
 * Table-edge cushions and corner bumpers prevent injuries, as do interlocking 
mats on hardwood floors and wall braces for heavy furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 * A choke tester is a handy device when older siblings play with small toys. 
If a toy fits entirely within the tube, it's a hazard to babies. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stove-knob covers and range guards protect youngsters against burns. Even 
more important, advised Keith Noren, co-owner of Safer-Baby, a retailer of 
safety products in Studio City, adults should "discourage play in the kitchen 
and bathroom." 
</P>
<P>
 Gregory suggests creating a safe room where a supervised child can explore 
without risk. "But there are rooms that should be off-limits, including the 
office and exercise rooms," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Door locks and knob covers keep young ones from entering forbidden rooms or 
wandering away from home. 
</P>
<P>
 Safety devices are available at Safer-Baby, Toys R Us, baby furniture stores, 
home-improvement stores and self-service stores, such as Target. They can also 
be ordered from catalogues, among them Perfectly Safe (1-800-837-KIDS) and The 
Safety Zone (1-800-999-3030). 
</P>
<P>
 Noren and Gregory agree that products made outside the United States aren't as 
durable as some domestic offerings. Brands they recommend include First Years, 
Gerber, Kinderguard, Playskool, Mericon and Totlock. 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, say experts, parents should be aware of their own habits and 
example. It's inadvisable, for instance, to take medicine in front of copy-cat 
kids, or leave plastic dry-cleaning bags around. 
</P>
<P>
 If responsible parents inoculate their children against disease, they might 
consider child-proofing as just another way to ensure that a youngster grows 
into a healthy adult. Sources of Information

HIS HUGENESS; OHIO STATE'S DAN WILKINSON, ALL 308 POUNDS OF HIM, IS FULFILLING 
FAMILY RESPONSIBILITY AS NFL'S TOP DRAFT PROSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As you read this, some members of the Wilkinson family of Dayton, Ohio, are 
already in the air, flying toward California and riches they still don't 
comprehend. 
</P>
<P>
 Only three of the seven Wilkinsons who will descend upon Newport Beach on 
Sunday had ever stepped inside an airplane. Only two had ever been to 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, they will take a boat ride for the first time. They will eat fresh 
seafood for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Sunday afternoon, crowded in front of a television set in a hotel suite, 
they will hug and laugh and shed tears of joy for the first time in a long 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 The second-youngest of 11 Wilkinson children, Dan, is expected to be the first 
overall pick in the 59th annual NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
 He is an Ohio State defensive lineman, 6 feet 4 and 308 pounds, nicknamed "Big 
Daddy." He is so large that agent Leigh Steinberg hesitates to take him to 
Disneyland this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want anybody mistaking him for a ride," Steinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 But what scouts like most about Wilkinson is his strength. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the sudden death of his father after a heart attack six years ago, it 
has been Wilkinson's mandate to lift the family from the struggles of a west 
Dayton neighborhood to a life that always belonged to somebody else. 
</P>
<P>
 It was his duty to make sure that his mother, Veronda, was rewarded for 
rearing 11 children while finding time to get a college degree. 
</P>
<P>
 It was his mission to make sure the memory of his father, a foundry worker who 
stayed overtime nearly every day to pay grocery bills, would not be buried with 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of his father's death, Dan Wilkinson was a 14-year-old boy who 
weighed nearly 300 pounds and exercised only when he was made to. 
</P>
<P>
 He would run, but only on those days his mother would come home with a new 
pair of shoes. He would fight, but only with his brothers, and only in the 
kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 Then one day the Wilkinson family's rock disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan's older brother, Oliver Jr., took him aside. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Dan, do you know how big you are? Do you know what you can do in 
this world?' " Oliver Jr. recalled. "I said, 'Dan, you can be the one to take 
care of Mama. You can be the one to take care of this family.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, when representatives of the Cincinnati Bengals read his name, the 
entire sports world will know that he has become that one. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother keeps waiting for the punch line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am flabbergasted," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives say Dan's nickname comes from a junior high school coach who looked 
over at several fathers watching the end of a practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at all those daddies standing over there," the coach said. 
</P>
<P>
 He then realized that one of those "daddies" was actually Dan Wilkinson. 
</P>
<P>
 A seventh grader. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkinson heard other nicknames while growing up. The most popular was "Fat 
Butt." 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard fat jokes," Wilkinson said. "I always just said, 'The hell with it.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Today he answers to different descriptions. Such as "dominating." Or "The next 
Cortez Kennedy." 
</P>
<P>
 After three years and two seasons at Ohio State, he was already considered a 
top-five pick before the annual scouting combine in February. There, he vaulted 
to No. 1 status without ever setting foot on a field. 
</P>
<P>
 He could bench press 225 pounds 34 consecutive times, several repetitions 
beyond his nearest competitor. 
</P>
<P>
 A month later, as if pro personnel really needed to see anymore, 150 guys with 
stopwatches congregated in Columbus to watch Wilkinson work out. 
</P>
<P>
 He ran a 40-yard dash like a sprinter -- 4.7 seconds on some charts. The 
league was sold. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dan is a guy that has rare abilities," said Dave Shula, Bengal coach. "There 
haven't been a whole lot of guys like him. His size, strength, quickness and 
speed put him in a special category." 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby Beathard, general manager of the San Diego Chargers, said, "Players like 
him only come along once in a while." 
</P>
<P>
 The only question is whether the thrifty Bengals can pay him the several 
million dollars standard for a No. 1 pick, or whether they will have to trade 
the pick to one of several suitors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arizona Cardinals covet Wilkinson and have already made a lucrative offer, 
including one of the stars of last year's draft, running back Garrison Hearst. 
</P>
<P>
 The New England Patriots covet him, and have made their own draft-pick-laden 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing Wilkinson knows is reputations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything I hear about Cincinnati is that they have been in the dumps," he 
said. "I'm not saying I don't want to go there, but I don't want to be in a bad 
situation where I don't sign until late." 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilkinson also understands about reputations. He has spent all of his 21 
years sparring with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lot of people still think I'm too heavy, that I can't really run like I can 
run," he said. "But I consider myself a big player, an impact player. And I 
will show everybody that." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkinson showed that to his family during those early kitchen fights. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would stand toe to toe and box until we finally couldn't punch anymore," 
recalled Oliver Jr. "Dan and I were equal." 
</P>
<P>
 Oliver Jr. was 11 at the time. Dan was 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon Dan was fighting siblings over food. They would buy chicken or pizza with 
their own money, then try to hide it from him in the back of the refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
 "But Dan would always find it," Oliver Jr. said. "We'd come home the next day 
and it would be gone. And he would owe us." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkinson said that as he ate his way toward 350 pounds by his senior year in 
high school, he was snacking at all hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even 3 a.m." he said. "Wake up in the middle of the night, go out to the 
refrigerator, get some pizza." 
</P>
<P>
 In some large families, they fight across the dinner table. Wilkinson said his 
family fought just to get to the table . 
</P>
<P>
 Once there, they would tear into his mother's homemade bread. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that bread had a lot to do with his weight," said Veronda, who bought 
two gallons of milk every day so there would be something to wash down that 
bread with. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkinson never thought much about the potential in his size, never played 
much street football with the other children and quit the junior high team when 
his father died. 
</P>
<P>
 After being coaxed by relatives and coaches to return, his career continued 
without a rudder until his senior year in high school, when he was recruited by 
nearby Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the chance of a lifetime. But that chance was put on hold because of 
poor test scores. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, his family and friends reminded him of his calling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never cared if my children were great. . . . I just wanted them to be 
active, decent human beings," said Veronda, a computer programmer. "Daniel has 
always been the type of child that, whatever he had to do, he did it. 
</P>
<P>
 "So you help him all you can . . . and then you pray. You pray all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkinson responded by attending classes in early summer until he could 
qualify academically. He was accepted at Ohio State one month before the start 
of the 1991 school year -- the latest that Coach John Cooper has ever signed a 
player. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, more obstacles. All that studying had made him hungry, and he was about 
60 pounds overweight. He had to sit out his first year because of flab. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I had to change," Wilkinson said. "I knew I owed it to myself to 
change. So I did." 
</P>
<P>
 No more food after 10 p.m. No more gorging on fast food unless the words 
grilled chicken appeared on the wrapper. 
</P>
<P>
 And no more nights drinking 10 or 15 beers. Wilkinson knew he was in trouble 
when all that brew never even made him dizzy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pretty soon, Daniel was coming home and educating us how to eat," Veronda 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 His impact on the family's life is just beginning. Even though his siblings 
don't want to leave their modest brick home because of memories, Wilkinson is 
going to buy a new home for his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 She can finally experience what it is like to talk on a phone, knowing that 
the only voice in the house is hers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a level at which Dan feels the burden of achievement on his 
shoulders," Steinberg said. "But he doesn't look at it like a burden, but an 
excitement. His family is the most special part of the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Especially his late father, who also was a big man, but a man who never had 
the time or energy keep himself healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 To see his 10th child drag himself from a similar rut to become the country's 
most sought-after college football player is something that all agree would 
have made Oliver Wilkinson Sr. proud. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always thought first round, but No. 1 overall?" Wilkinson asked. "I don't 
know how to explain that." 
</P>
<P>
 He is the only Wilkinson who doesn't.

UCLA IGNORED TICKET OPTIONS; ROSE BOWL: BRUIN OFFICIALS SAY THEY SOLD LARGE 
BLOCK TO BOOSTER BECAUSE THEY FEARED FINANCIAL LOSSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER and WENDY WITHERSPOON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UCLA officials, facing heavy criticism over the sale of 4,000 1994 Rose Bowl 
tickets to one booster, said Thursday they agreed to the transaction because 
they feared a potential "financial disaster" if those tickets remained unsold. 
</P>
<P>
 But many who were subsequently unable to get tickets when the demand exceeded 
the supply labeled the decision premature because: 
</P>
<P>
 -- UCLA sold the block of tickets Dec. 2, 30 days before the game. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Bruins' eventual opponent, the University of Wisconsin, had not even 
been determined at the time. When the Badgers clinched the Big Ten spot on Dec. 
5, ticket demand skyrocketed. 
</P>
<P>
 -- UCLA had options to offer unsold tickets to season-ticket holders, to its 
Big Ten opponent or to the Tournament of Roses Assn. If none of them were 
interested, UCLA almost certainly would have been granted permission by 
tournament officials to conduct a public sale. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, UCLA still had about 5,000 of its allotted 41,586 tickets, priced 
at $46 each. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of pursuing those options, UCLA officials sold 4,000 seats that day to 
Angelo M. Mazzone III, a booster and former athletic department official who 
had indicated that he would make a sizable contribution to the school's 
athletic scholarship fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Mazzone got his tickets, and UCLA got a $100,000 contribution. 
</P>
<P>
 Since that was reported Thursday, there has been an angry reaction from UCLA 
season-ticket holders complaining about preferential treatment for Mazzone, and 
from Wisconsin, where about 1,000 fans were deprived of tickets they had been 
promised from ticket agencies. A Wisconsin lawyer has been threatening to file 
a class-action lawsuit since early April. 
</P>
<P>
 At UCLA, season-ticket holders were offered an opportunity to buy one Rose 
Bowl ticket for each season ticket held. They were told to send in money to 
UCLA for any additional tickets requested and, if extra tickets were available, 
they would be allowed to buy them. 
</P>
<P>
 But in early December, many season-ticket holders received letters from the 
school, stating that all available tickets had been sold. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't even tell you how outraged I am," said Dan Rothmel, who has had UCLA 
season tickets for nearly 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothmel, president of a catalogue company in Los Angeles, makes a $300 
donation each year to UCLA for the privilege of buying season tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I treated my customers the way they treat us, I would be out of business 
in two weeks," Rothmel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin fans were similarly upset to learn that one person was able to buy 
such a large block of tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was told that there was just no possible way that the Wisconsin fans were 
going to be able to buy blocks and the only way to do it was to go through the 
ticket brokers," said Charles Mazursky, a Westwood lawyer who graduated from 
Wisconsin in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Joseph D. Mandel, vice chancellor of legal affairs at UCLA: "I don't 
believe there was preferential treatment, although, in hindsight, it may have 
turned out to have been preferential. On more than one occasion in the past, we 
have been stuck with an allotment of tickets." 
</P>
<P>
 The previous year, Mandel said, UCLA was unable to sell all of its allotted 
1,000 tickets for the Rose Bowl game featuring Washington and Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were burned financially," Mandel said. "Now, 1,000 tickets is not a huge 
number, but any number is painful in this day and age when you've got a 
cumulative deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given that deficit and given the experience of the last few years, there was 
a considerable level of anxiety that we would get stuck with the tickets. At 
that point, still unaware of our opponent, the athletic administration got 
quite nervous." 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Mazzone, who has strong ties to UCLA athletics. He was the football 
team's equipment manager as a student. He continued to work for the athletic 
department while attending law school and even after graduation. Mazzone was 
associate athletic director-business manager before leaving the school in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempts to contact Mazzone were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anthony is a lover of UCLA who has purchased smaller blocks of tickets in the 
past," Mandel said. "He has done so to help avoid financial danger for the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only Angelo knows his motivation in this case, whether it was to protect the 
school from financial disaster or whether he was some visionary who knew that 
Wisconsin was going to get in and that the fans would be in a frenzy for 
tickets. I think it was just another gesture on his part to assist UCLA and 
enable us to cover ourselves in the event the demand was not there. He took 
those tickets off our hands." 
</P>
<P>
 There are a lot of people in Wisconsin who would have been thrilled to have 
those tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 James A. Olson, a Madison, Wis., lawyer, is considering a suit against UCLA 
because of the school's failure to make its excess tickets available to 
Wisconsin fans. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter he sent to potential partners in the suit, Olson said: 
</P>
<P>
 "We asserted that UCLA refused to provide excess tickets to the University of 
Wisconsin and had allotted an excessive amount of tickets to the UCLA athletic 
department. Furthermore, we made specific reference to the 'sale' of 4,000 
tickets to an individual anonymous donor and the fact that UCLA's listing of 
the purchaser as a 'donor' implies that something above sale price was 
donated." 
</P>
<P>
 Mandel responded by saying that it is not UCLA's responsibility to compensate 
any losses suffered by Wisconsin fans who could not get tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandel concedes that Mazzone's contribution was certainly a factor in making 
the tickets available to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were told that he would repeat the practice he has done in the past to be 
generous with our endowment fund," Mandel said. "There were no negotiations. It 
wasn't like, 'To get this amount of tickets, you have to do this.' But we would 
be breaching our fiduciary duty to the taxpayers if we did not take advantage 
of (the contribution)." 
</P>
<P>
 Athletic Director Peter Dalis called Mazzone's contribution "a lasting legacy 
for our endowment fund and our future scholarships." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Mandel: "Why should our athletic director have said to Angelo that his 
offer was awfully nice, but we should make additional tickets available in case 
someone may have an aunt coming out from Wisconsin. UCLA did the understandable 
thing, consistent with the law, and with good fiscal practices." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Rosenzweig, UCLA's acting vice chancellor for university relations, 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't know how things were going to end up," he said. "The feeling was, 
it was the prudent thing to take protection at the front end." 
</P>
<P>
 Mazursky, the Wisconsin grad from Westwood, said if one person controls the 
market, he can dictate the market price. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I have no doubt that that's what happened here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So will steps be taken to prevent this type of transaction in the future? 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific 10 Conference officials say that the Tournament of Roses' longstanding 
policy regarding distribution of tickets should not be changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's important that maybe we don't overreact too much in this 
situation," said Jim Muldoon, assistant commissioner of the Pac-10. "The ticket 
situation that is there has been in there for years . . and over the course of 
time has proven to be pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
 Jack French, the Tournament of Roses' executive director, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden there's a flaw, which is really an aberration, and there's a 
lot of reaction to that," he said. "When things settle down, in the ensuing 
years, things will balance out." 
</P>
<P>
 But officials of the Big Ten Conference are not so sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing I can say is that we have asked for some relief in that area 
in terms of trying to get more (tickets)," said Mark Rudner, assistant 
commissioner of the Big Ten. 
</P>
<P>
 The parties will discuss ticket distribution at a meeting May 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenzweig says UCLA will also investigate its ticket situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to take a hard look at ticket policy," he said. "Nobody is happy 
about how things worked out this year. We feel badly people from Wisconsin 
didn't get tickets. Hopefully there are ways this can be avoided in the 
future."

MOORER ENTERS BIG TIME SURROUNDED BY QUESTIONS; PRO BOXING: WILL TOUGHEST 
TRAINING CAMP HELP CHALLENGER OVERCOME PRESSURE AND TROUBLING LULLS AGAINST 
BATTLE-TESTED HOLYFIELD? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He's relatively unknown, undersized, untested, understated, possibly 
under-appreciated and definitely under more scrutiny than he has ever 
previously endured. 
</P>
<P>
 He got the fight only through the intervention of the World Boxing Assn. and 
International Boxing Federation, and achieved a No. 1 ranking in two world 
bodies without having fought any other top contender. 
</P>
<P>
 Is Michael Moorer ready to meet the moment tonight in the Caesars Palace 
outdoor pavilion (televised on pay-per-view) against time-tested, 
battle-scarred champion Evander Holyfield, as Moorer seeks to become the first 
left-handed heavyweight champion in history? 
</P>
<P>
 No one, including Moorer, really seems to know. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody doubts that Moorer (34-0, 30 knockouts) is far more talented and far 
more dangerous than the legion of wobbly journeymen given unlikely title shots 
in the recent past. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Michael hits you, it's like a mountain dropping on your head," said 
Everett (Bigfoot) Martin, who lost to Moorer in 1992 and was a sparring partner 
the last few months. "Real power." 
</P>
<P>
 As a left-hander, Moorer presents problems for Holyfield, who has fought only 
one other southpaw -- he knocked out Jesse Shelby in the third-round eight 
years ago -- in his 31-fight career (30-1-0, 22 KOs). In fact, Moorer is only 
the third left-hander to challenge for the title. 
</P>
<P>
 Several trainers have pointed out that Holyfield, who matches Moorer at 6 feet 
2 and 214 pounds, has a tendency during exchanges to drift to his left, leaving 
his right side open for Moorer's swift left hook and uppercut. 
</P>
<P>
 "People talk about the power," Moorer said. "The power is there. But you don't 
go into the fight thinking about the power. You have to go into the ring 
mentally and physically fit, and when the opportunity comes, the power will be 
displayed." 
</P>
<P>
 But Moorer, 26, has never fought a fight of anywhere near this significance. 
He was knocked down not only by Martin but also by Burt Cooper. This will be 
Holyfield's seventh heavyweight title fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess we can safely say that Evander Holyfield is cooler under fire than 
Michael Moorer," said Holyfield's new trainer, Don Turner. "He hasn't been down 
as much as Michael Moorer. He's fought a better caliber of opponents than 
Michael Moorer." 
</P>
<P>
 Will Moorer, who has appeared tentative several times during the early stages 
of fights and has been in deep trouble because of it, have the emotional 
wherewithal to stand up against a champion who has proven his mettle in big 
fights? 
</P>
<P>
 "Pressure can get to anybody," said Moorer's manager, John Davimos. "I don't 
think you can ever know 100% until that time comes." 
</P>
<P>
 Teddy Atlas, Moorer's trainer, said he recognizes and has dealt with the 
possibility that Moorer begins to feel overburdened by his chance at history. 
Moorer, never known for his dedication, went through the hardest and longest 
training camp in his career for this fight. He sparred 130 rounds in seven 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I've done is try to make him face things, to have the discipline and 
have as much confidence as he needs to deal with the moment," Atlas said. "When 
the moment is far away, you can avoid it. When the moment comes, you start to 
search, 'Why didn't I do this? Why didn't I do that?' 
</P>
<P>
 "That's all been done now. He's very confident. He's nervous, but he feels 
very sure about himself now." 
</P>
<P>
 For the Moorer camp, the circumstances of this fight give them as much hope as 
the relative talents of the fighters. 
</P>
<P>
 First, they point out that Holyfield's style of inside brawling perfectly 
suits Moorer, who is more comfortable when his opponent takes the fight to him 
and has looked bad when he has had to chase people -- including his most recent 
fight, a 10-round decision over Mike Evans last December. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, Holyfield, whose take of as much as $15 million tonight will make him 
the first fighter in history to top $100 million in purse earnings, is coming 
off the fight of his life, in which he took the WBA and IBF titles from Riddick 
Bowe. Moorer is scheduled to earn about $5 million tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Holyfield originally wanted to skip this mandatory fight against Moorer and 
move on to a unification fight against World Boxing Council champion Lennox 
Lewis. But the IBF and WBA would not allow Moorer to be bypassed. So, for 
Holyfield, Moorer is something of a nuisance, something to get past en route to 
bigger, better things. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't look past Michael Moorer," Holyfield said. "I look through him. One 
step at a time." 
</P>
<P>
 But if the Moorer camp believes Holyfield will be lured into an awkward 
slugfest, Holyfield said that, with the help of trainer Turner, he will prove 
them incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm more of a thinker now," said Holyfield, who blames his defeat in the 
first Bowe fight on his stubborn desire to prove he could mix it up with the 
far heavier Bowe. "Don says I fight too hard, I make fights tougher than I need 
to -- that I fight just because I like fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he stands there right in front of me, yeah, I'll go toe to toe with him. 
For a while. And if he's getting the best of it, I'll be smart enough to move 
outside, where I know I'm better than he is." 
</P>

Gregorio Vargas on the undercard.

KNICKS SUSPEND MASON INDEFINITELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anthony Mason, who complained over a recent second-half benching, was 
indefinitely suspended without pay Thursday by the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
 Mason, a 6-foot-7 forward, missed Thursday night's home game against the 
Philadelphia 76ers, won by the Knicks, 130-82. 
</P>
<P>
 Mason had been critical of Coach Pat Riley after sitting out the second half 
of the Knicks' 87-84 loss against Atlanta. Riley went with Charles Smith, who 
is coming off a knee injury and is expected to help the Knicks during the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley said Mason's status will be evaluated in the next few days but said 
Mason will not play the last two games of the regular season. The Knicks are 
bidding for the best record in the Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Mason, a key reserve, is averaging 7.2 points and 5.8 rebounds in 26.1 minutes 
per game. 
</P>
<P>
 "The core objective of the New York Knicks has been, is and always will be, 
team first and team last," Riley said. "The greatest challenge for a player, 
who is part of a team, is to voluntarily get out of himself and get with the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 "To do that, sometimes you have to do things you don't want to in order to 
achieve what the team wants. When it comes to that, everyone has to sacrifice. 
It's very simple. You're either in or you're out." 
</P>
<P>
 Riley said the suspension did not stem from one particular incident or 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all about attitude, an attitude one takes to every game," he said. "Over 
the course of the year you always have problems with some player. But at this 
point in the season, we don't have time for that."

RAIDERS' KELLY VOWS NOT TO RE-SIGN FOR LESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Raiders' plan was simple when they waived Joe Kelly, their starting middle 
linebacker, earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Cut him now and hope to re-sign him before training camp for less money.Around 
the NFL, that's a common practice these salary-cap days. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, however, this move might backfire. Kelly, who finished second in 
tackles for the Raiders last season, says he will not return. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't need to have 15 teams knocking on my door, all I need is one to give 
me a shot," he said. "If I have to play for less anywhere, it sure will not be 
with the Raiders." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly signed as a free agent with the Raiders last season after two seasons 
with the New York Jets and three with the Cincinnati Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
 After signing two high-priced free agents, offensive guard Kevin Gogan from 
Dallas and cornerback Albert Lewis from Kansas City, and re-signing wide 
receiver Tim Brown, the Raiders released Kelly, who earned $600,000 last 
season, to make room under the cap before Sunday's NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly could have made $950,000 in salary, bonuses and incentives next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Without Kelly, the Raiders would have only inexperienced Greg Biekert at 
middle linebacker.

FORMER COWBOY COACH JOHNSON REELS IN TV JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jimmy Johnson, saying a coach can only fish for so long, accepted a job 
Thursday as a studio commentator for the Fox network. 
</P>
<P>
 He will work with Terry Bradshaw, Howie Long and a yet-to-be-named host on 
Fox's Los Angeles-based one-hour shows before NFL games on Sunday mornings. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if the television job was for one year only, the former Dallas Cowboy 
coach said, "There's a possibility, a strong possibility, that I'll do it for 
more than one year, but I'm also not closing the door on coaching." 
</P>
<P>
 According to industry sources, he will make $650,000 from Fox, and $250,000 
more if, as expected, he signs to work for HBO as well. 
</P>
<P>
 With HBO, Johnson would be part of the pay-cable network's critically 
acclaimed Thursday night show, "Inside the NFL." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a strong possibility an announcement (regarding HBO) will be 
forthcoming in the next few days," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross Greenburg, the executive producer for HBO sports, concurred and also took 
a shot at Fox for "trying to blow us out of the water." 
</P>
<P>
 "They tried to demand exclusivity, and I didn't appreciate that, to be honest 
about it," Greenburg said. "But Jimmy was professional enough to stand up for 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 ESPN and Turner Broadcasting also made bids for Johnson's expertise as a 
studio analyst, but because they are both cable entities, he couldn't also have 
worked for HBO had he chosen one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Goren, the executive producer for Fox sports, said a host for the network's 
NFL pregame show won't be announced for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Gumbel, whose CBS contract expires this fall, is considered the 
front-runner. Roy Firestone is also a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Goren said that because the Fox show will be one hour, there will be plenty of 
room for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said he got to know Bradshaw when he was an assistant coach at 
Louisiana Tech. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said he coached Long in the 1979 Blue-Gray game. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who has been doing coach's shows for about 25 years, said that with 
Fox he hopes to add "some in-house knowledge and convey that to the viewer." 
</P>
<P>
 Will he be critical? 
</P>
<P>
 "If you'll check the record, I was not that reserved when someone was paying 
my salary, and I don't think I'll be that reserved now." 
</P>
<P>
 He also said, "I'm not going to go out of my way to take a shot at anyone, but 
I'm not going to change my personality. I'm just going to give opinions."

ROY SIDELINED WITH APPENDICITIS AS CANADIENS ROUTED BY BRUINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Montreal Canadiens received a blow to their defense of the Stanley Cup 
title when goalie Patrick Roy, the key in last year's success, was hospitalized 
Thursday because of appendicitis that might require surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Without Roy, the Canadiens gave up three first-period goals behind Ron Tugnutt 
as the Boston Bruins cruised to 6-3 victory at Montreal to take a 2-1 lead in 
the best-of-seven series. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins did not waste time in taking advantage of Roy's absence as Tugnutt 
allowed five of Boston's first 13 shots into the net, including two from long 
range. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm obviously very disappointed with how I performed," said Tugnutt, who was 
acquired from the Mighty Ducks in February. "I'll take my part of the blame." 
</P>
<P>
 Roy, 28, could return for Game 4 on Saturday if it is determined today he does 
not require surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 An operation would sideline him for 10 to 14 days, meaning he would not return 
until the second round of playoffs -- if Montreal advances past Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he recovers, he can play as soon as he gets a few meals under his belt," 
said Douglas Kinnear, the Montreal team physician.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; BAD BACK DOESN'T SLOW DOWN BUTLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brett Butler played all 11 innings Wednesday night despite a sore back, but 
who would have guessed it? For the second consecutive game, Butler provided the 
spark that helped the Dodgers to victory. In a game that was tied three times, 
Butler singled to shallow center field with the bases loaded in the 11th inning 
to score Jose Offerman for a 6-5 victory over the New York Mets. Butler was 
five for six in the game, including a double and a triple and two runs batted 
in. He scored twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, at Philadelphia, Butler made a game-saving catch in the ninth inning 
to preserve a come-from-behind 8-7 victory against the Phillies. But even 
during that game, Butler said his back ached. "We played all eight games of the 
trip on artificial turf, and we have never played that many consecutive games 
on turf before," Butler said. "My back was killing me last night, and it ached 
in Philly, but I think the plane trip back and sleeping 12 hours just did it 
in. " 
</P>
<P>
 Butler said he arrived at Dodger Stadium at 1:30 Wednesday and started 
treatment on his back. "There have been games when I have been sicker than a 
dog and I play my best," Butler said. "Sometimes if you feel too good, you can 
try to do too much, and the end result isn't as good." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Tom Lasorda said that Chan Ho Park felt badly when he was told 
Wednesday that he was being sent to the minors. Park was sent to the Dodgers' 
double-A club in San Antonio, but not because of his skill level. In 
Albuquerque, where the Dodgers' triple-A team plays, the air is so thin that it 
is sometimes difficult for a pitcher to get a good read on what he is throwing. 
It can also damage a pitcher's confidence. Park will make his first start 
tonight against El Paso at San Antonio.  
</P>

<P>
 Carlos Hernandez, who has been sidelined because of a sprained back, is 
feeling better and eligible to be activated. . . . Hitting instructor Reggie 
Smith will have arthroscopic surgery on his knee today for a probable cartilage 
tear. Bench coach Bill Russell worked first base during Thursday's game.

 Steve Sax, bothered by an injured left foot this spring, was put on 
unconditional release waivers by the Chicago White Sox on Thursday. Sax, 34, 
was recalled from his rehabilitation assignment at double-A Birmingham and 
reinstated from the 15-day disabled list before being put on waivers.If he 
clears next week, the White Sox will be responsible for the remainder of his 
$3.1-million salary this year and his $3.1-million salary next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Sax, a five-time All-Star, was put on the disabled list April 1 with a bruised 
left heel. In seven games at Birmingham, he hit .318 with two doubles and one 
run batted in.

 Catcher Benito Santiago of the Florida Marlins was suspended for four games 
for "inciting a bench-clearing brawl" but immediately appealed, delaying the 
penalty. Santiago, who also was fined, charged the mound Sunday against the San 
Francisco Giants. . . . Right-hander Tim Worrell of the San Diego Padres was 
put on the 15-day disabled list, retroactive to Tuesday, because of an injured 
right elbow. . . . The Boston Red Sox sent reliever Ricky Trlicek to double-A

 Pitcher Mark Langston, recovering quicker than the Angels had hoped, threw in 
the bullpen Thursday for the first time since his elbow surgery April 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there are no setbacks, I'll definitely come back before six weeks," 
Langston said."I want to get back as quickly as I can. The faster I can get 
through this, the better off I'll be because my arm will still be strong." 
</P>
<P>
 Langston said he experienced some inflammation after the operation but no 
pain. He reported no problems after throwing for 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe how good I feel," he said. "Every day I can do something 
different than the day before. I can even comb my hair now, and put mousse in 
the right spots."

 The Angels sent a psychiatrist from their employee-assistance program to visit 
Vancouver second baseman Kevin Flora, whose wife was killed a year ago today in 
a car accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Flora, who has not played since the third game of the season because of his 
emotional difficulties, was receptive to the visit from Tim Allen, according to 
Flora's agent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kevin knows the door is open to him if he needs help, and appreciates the 
Angels' concern," Bill Moore said.

rehabilitative assignment for Class-A Lake Elsinore. He threw 62 strikes in 84 
pitches. BOB NIGHTENGALE

COLLEGE BASEBALL / GARY KLEIN; THIS LONGHORN HAS COME A LONG WAY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cliff Gustafson had a modest goal when he became coach at Texas in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to do well enough to hold on to the job and not get run out of 
town," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-seven years later, Gustafson is on the verge of becoming the winningest 
Division I baseball coach in history. Texas' 6-5 victory Tuesday night over 
Houston Baptist was No. 1,332 for Gustafson, equaling the record set by former 
USC Coach Rod Dedeaux. 
</P>
<P>
 Gustafson, 63, has guided his teams to two national titles and a record of 
1,332-325-2 in 26-plus seasons. Dedeaux won a record 11 national championships 
and was 1,332-571-11 in 45 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Gustafson can break the record tonight when the Longhorns open a three-game 
series against Grand Canyon at Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought about personal goals at the outset of my coaching career," 
said Gustafson, whose teams have made a record 17 College World Series 
appearances. "Somewhere along around 1986, when I was creeping up on 1,000, I 
became conscious of the number. I thought it would be nice to be the third guy 
after Dedeaux and (former Miami Coach) Ron Fraser.  
</P>
<P>
 "But to even talk about the Dedeaux mark was a little absurd." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Gustafson will break the record during a season in which the 
Longhorns will probably eclipse the school mark for most defeats. Texas is 
31-16, two shy of the record of 18 lost by the 1989 and 1991 teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't been playing very well as of late, but we could still be a good 
ballclub if each of our players elevates his game to his ability level," 
Gustafson said. "As for how long I plan to coach, well, as long as my health 
stays good and they want me to continue, I'll be out there."

 Trivia time: Which two major league general managers played on national 
championship teams at USC? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman sensation: Not since 1977, when Bill Bordley went 14-0, has a USC 
freshman pitcher been as successful as Randy Flores has this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores, a walk-on from El Rancho High in Pico Rivera, is 7-0 with a 1.23 
earned-run average for the fourth-ranked Trojans. The 5-foot-11, 151-pound 
left-hander has pitched three shutouts and four complete games, including a 9-0 
Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division victory over 10th-ranked Arizona State 
last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came here, my goal was just to make the traveling team," said Flores, 
who decided to attend USC on an academic scholarship after visiting Princeton, 
Air Force Academy and Oklahoma. "Developing a consistent third pitch, a 
changeup, has probably been the biggest key to the success I've had." 
</P>
<P>
 Flores has struck out 38 and walked only 16 in 66 innings. He is one of the 
main reasons USC is 30-12 overall and leading the Southern Division with a 16-8 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans play host to UCLA on Friday night in the opener of a three-game 
conference series and conclude their conference schedule next weekend at 
California. Stanford (14-7) is in second place with nine conference games left. 
Arizona State is 13-8 with nine conference games remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really haven't had much time to think about being undefeated or things like 
that because we're in such a tight conference race," Flores said. "The team is 
playing really, really well behind me. So I'm just going to try to keep doing 
the things that have been working." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest slugger: While traditional powers such as Texas and Texas A&M have 
struggled this season, 10 players from California have helped No. 25 Texas Tech 
position itself for a run at its first Southwest Conference title since joining 
the league in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy DuRoss, a six-foot, 180-pound junior first baseman from La Verne, is 
batting .313 with a team-high 10 home runs and 38 runs batted in for the Red 
Raiders, who are 35-12 and 9-3 in the SWC heading into this weekend's series 
against Rice. 
</P>
<P>
 DuRoss, who hit three homers during his first two years in Lubbock, homered in 
four consecutive games earlier this season. Batting second in the lineup, 
DuRoss also has 13 sacrifices, one shy of the school record. 
</P>
<P>
 "My coach and I agree that I should stay where I am in the order because I'm 
not really a No. 3- or 4-type hitter," DuRoss said.  
</P>
<P>
 DuRoss and pitcher Jason Whittle, a junior transfer from Riverside Community 
College who is 8-3 with a 2.66 ERA, will probably help Texas Tech gain its 
first NCAA playoff berth. Last season, the Red Raiders finished 43-15 but were 
passed over because of a weak schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've played much better teams this season and think we can get to the 
regional," DuRoss said. "We want to show people there are more than a couple of 
good baseball schools in Texas." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Production line: With a 13-26 overall record and 6-12 mark in the Pacific 10 
Southern Division, UCLA is having one of its worst seasons since Gary Adams 
became coach in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA, however, led the nation in the number of former players on opening-day 
major league rosters. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven former Bruins started the season in the majors. Arizona State and 
Stanford each had 10 players in the majors, followed by Michigan with nine, 
Florida State with eight and Arizona, Minnesota and Oklahoma State each with 
seven. 
</P>
<P>
 USC had six. Fullerton, Louisiana State and Wichita State each had five.

SAILING; 47TH NEWPORT-ENSENADA RACE TO BEGIN TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH ROBERTS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three defending class champions, but not Newsboy, are among 410 entries 
scheduled to start the 47th Newport-Ensenada International Yacht Race off 
Newport Beach at noon today. 
</P>
<P>
 Newsboy, Jack Baillie's wooden 12-meter built for the America's Cup in the 
'50s, has competed in 37 Ensenada races and won more trophies than any other 
boat.This year, however, Baillie did not enter. 
</P>
<P>
 Class corrected-time winners from last year returning include Carl 
Eichenlaub's Cadenza in PHRF, John R. Simpkins' Flying Fish in Ocean Racing 
Catamaran Assn. and Dave Dillehay's 50-foot Aldora in IMS. Dennis Conner's 
60-foot catamaran Stars & Stripes also is entered. It was first to finish last 
year and holds the elapsed-time record of 9 hours 7 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The weather forecast for the start called for northwest winds of 20 to 30 
knots, meaning the boats could be flying off the line under spinnakers -- a 
rare sight. RICH ROBERTS

KRONE RETURNS TO TRACK SAYING SHE IS ALMOST READY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Julie Krone, racing's top female jockey, rode for the first time Wednesday 
since suffering a broken right ankle in a spill last August at Saratoga. She 
said she hoped to return to competitive riding in 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "The back of my shoulders hurt and a couple of times my ankle burned," Krone 
said after galloping Uncharted Waters and Vel Vel for trainer Scotty Schulhofer 
at Belmont Park's training track. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hurts a little, but it's like with Charles Barkley, who has a bad back. He 
says it only hurts when he's walking around, not playing basketball." 
</P>
<P>
 Krone, who has 13 pins in her ankle, also visited with trainers Allen Jerkens, 
Bill Mott and Angel Cordero, whose own Hall of Fame riding career ended after a 
major spill. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't Krone's first time on a horse since the accident. After three months 
of rehabilitation, Krone did some recreational riding on her farm the first 
week in April and was thrown when the horse she was riding lost his footing 
jumping over some fallen trees. He landed on her injured leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Krone said she was a little nervous before her ride and that she felt awkward 
on Uncharted Waters but better on Vel Vel. 
</P>
<P>
 Is she ready for competition? 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel a little bit cocky already," said Krone, the winner of last year's 
Belmont Stakes aboard Colonial Affair. "It's easier to ride right now than it 
is to walk."

THOROUGHBRED RACING / BILL CHRISTINE; 'DOTAGE INDEX' NOT AN AGE-OLD SYSTEM, BUT 
IT SEEMS TO WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since Leon Rasmussen began writing about it in the Daily Racing Form in 1981, 
the dosage index has hung heavy over every running of the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 The dosage index is a pedigree analysis that forecasts whether a horse has the 
speed and the stamina to win at 1 1/4 miles, the distance of the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, when Sea Hero was the upset winner of the Derby for owner Paul 
Mellon and trainer Mack Millon, John Nelson of the Associated Press introduced 
still another system for picking the winner of the race: The dotage index. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mellon's 85 and Miller's 71," Nelson said. "Sea Hero had both the dosage and 
the dotage." 
</P>
<P>
 A review of Derby winners for the last 10 years shows that Nelson's theory 
about dotage is no one-time thing. By and large, the horsemen behind the Derby 
winners have been advanced in years. Here are the ages of the owners and 
trainers of those winners (in the case of multiple owners, an average was 
used), with the total years representing the dotage index: 04,17,10,09,07 Horse 
Owner(s) Trainer Index Swale 34 70 104 Spend A Buck 42 35 77 Ferdinand 72 73 
145 Alysheba 61 50 111 Winning Colors 67 52 119 Sunday Silence 76 76 142 
Unbridled 92 48 140 Strike The Gold 58 43 101 Lil E. Tee 82 52 134 Sea Hero 85 
71 156 * 
</P>
<P>
 With the exceptions of 1985, when whippersnapper Dennis Diaz and his 
wet-behind-the-ears trainer, Cam Gambolati, won with Spend A Buck, and 1991, 
when an ownership triumvirate and trainer Nick Zito won with Strike The Gold, 
the index shows that when it comes to winning the Derby, those under 50 need 
not apply. The average index for the last decade is 123, led by the 
Mellon-Miller combination and followed by trainer Charlie Whittingham's 
victories for different owners with Ferdinand in 1986 and Sunday Silence in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittingham, who turned 81 this month, is the oldest trainer ever to win the 
Derby, and he's back this year with two contenders, Strodes Creek and Numerous. 
Howard Keck, who owns Numerous, a $1.7-million yearling purchase, bred 
Ferdinand and raced the colt in his former wife's name. 
</P>
<P>
 Because they are both octogenarians, Whittingham and Keck give Numerous a 161, 
the highest dotage index for any Derby candidate this year and higher than any 
index since at least 1984. Using the 10-year average of 123 as a threshold, 
only six contenders--Numerous and Strodes Creek, along with Holy Bull, Brocco, 
Tabasco Cat, Valiant Nature--have a chance to win the Derby this year. Here's a 
rundown of the top horses according to index: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Horse: Index 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous: 161 Strodes Creek: 145 Holy Bull: 148 Brocco: 139 Valiant Nature: 
139 Tabasco Cat: 135 Halo's Image: 121 Ride The Rails: 115 Blumin Affair: 112 
Soul Of The Matter: 108 Go For Gin: 106 Kandaly: 104 Lakeway: 103 Smilin Singin 
Sam: 96 Powis Castle: 95 Irgun: 92 Mahogany Hall: 82 
</P>
<P>
 Being a new system, the dotage index has not yet been embraced by the racing 
community. After all, dosage has had a 13-year head start. But dotage has 
created a stir just the same. 
</P>
<P>
 When told about the dotage index for Smilin Singin Sam, the Remington Park 
Derby winner, a spokesman for the colt's owner, Dogwood Stable, said, "This is 
very disappointing. We knew our dosage was too high, and now we find out that 
our dotage is too low. What are you going to do?" 
</P>
<P>
 Irgun, winner of the Wood Memorial at Aqueduct last Saturday, races for 
Marianne and Brandon Chase. "There's not much they can do at this late stage," 
said a friend of the Chases. "Steve Young's a good trainer, but he's only 32. 
Maybe they could come up with an older trainer before the Derby, to get that 
index up." 
</P>
<P>
 The dotage index crowd, which operates by that universal rule known as flying 
by the seat of your pants, had to come up with a special provision to establish 
a number for Holy Bull. Because the Florida Derby and Blue Grass Stakes winner 
is owned by his trainer, Jimmy Croll, Croll's age was doubled in order to give 
the colt an index. 
</P>
<P>
 Croll has little use for dosage or dotage. All he knows is that the 
free-running Holy Bull is the horse to beat in the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me tell you a story about dosage," Croll said the other day at Keeneland. 
"There's a retired travel agent who sits in the box next to me at Monmouth 
Park. He's not a bad guy, but I would call him a horse degenerate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyway, Holy Bull wins his first race there last August, and this guy goes 
home to his computers. Dit, dit, dit, he starts hitting the keys, putting this 
stuff in and crossing that stuff with new stuff, and then he sees me in the box 
the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'They might say your horse doesn't have the dosage,' he says, 'but the way I 
figure it, he'll be all right. It'll be no problem. This horse will go a mile 
and a half.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what he thought of this opinion, Croll pointed to both of his ears. "It 
goes in one side and comes out the other," the trainer said.

FLYING FAN MAN LANDS IN JAIL FOR THIS TITLE FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Fan Man landed in jail Thursday, so he won't be landing in the middle of 
tonight's Evander Holyfield-Michael Moorer heavyweight title fight. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of a deal to ensure that he would not repeat the paragliding stunt he 
pulled last November at the last Caesars Palace outdoor fight, James Miller, 
a.k.a., the Fan Man, pleaded guilty to a charge of misdemeanor trespassing 
during the Holyfield-Riddick Bowe fight and began an eight-day jail term 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, of Henderson, Nev., used a motorized parachute to glide over the ring, 
then crashed into the ring ropes in the middle of the seventh round last 
November. He was facing the possibility of a one-year sentence until the deal 
was struck. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good," said Bowe when asked for a response to the sentence. "The guy should 
have been in (jail) last time." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller also flew over the Coliseum during the Raiders' wild-card playoff game 
against the Denver Broncos last January but was followed by a police helicopter 
and arrested before he could cause a disturbance. TIM KAWAKAMIPARAGLIDING

CARELINE WILL BUY LIFEFLEET IN AMBULANCE SERVICE MERGER; ACQUISITION: THE 
IRVINE FIRM WILL PAY $93 MILLION IN THE DEAL, WHICH WOULD MAKE IT THE NATION'S 
SECOND-LARGEST PROVIDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a deal that would make it the nation's second-largest provider of ambulance 
service, CareLine Inc. said Thursday that it will acquire privately held 
LifeFleet Inc. for $93 million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 The transaction, expected to be completed by the end of May, is the largest 
deal in a rapidly consolidating industry that only a few years ago was composed 
of more than 2,600 mom-and-pop operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The merged company will have 2,800 drivers, paramedics, dispatchers and 
administrators in eight states. With projected annual revenue of more than $160 
million, it will be second only to American Medical Response in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Ambulance service generates $4 billion a year in revenue nationally, and the 
country's aging population assures continued growth in the industry, said Nancy 
Moyer, an industry analyst at Unterberg Harris, a New York brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
 The emergence of large publicly held ambulance companies began only two years 
ago with the formation of American Medical. The company was created by the 
merger of four companies, including two in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The financial incentive appears great. Two years ago, Moyer said, the average 
basic non-emergency trip cost $400 and life-support trips were $700. 
Critical-care transport, in rigs that look like mini-intensive-care units, ran 
about $1,500 a trip.

 Those charges helped to make up for the 20% to 40% of bills that went unpaid, 
she said. And the expense of putting in state-of-the-art medical and 
communications equipment as well as meeting stricter regulations that require 
quick responses has become a financial burden for small companies. In addition, 
only larger operations can expect to obtain sufficient funding from Wall 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are still significant opportunities to grow," said Thomas E. Sullivan, 
an analyst with Minneapolis brokerage Piper, Jaffray Inc. "We've only 
consolidated a fraction of the companies." 
</P>
<P>
 CareLine, he said, made a number of acquisitions before and after it went 
public in December with a stock offering that gave it $52.2 million. And it has 
access to more money, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week, the company will start issuing debt securities -- essentially 
corporate IOUs -- to raise $75 million, said Roy Luna, CareLine's chief 
financial officer. The proceeds, together with bank loans, will pay for the 
acquisition of Newport Beach-based LifeFleet and other companies CareLine hopes 
to buy in the near future, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The acquisition would strengthen CareLine's presence in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 LifeFleet has operations in Anaheim; Seattle, Spokane and Tacoma, Wash., and 
six sites in central and southern Florida. CareLine operates in Los Angeles, 
San Bernardino and Riverside counties, Boston, Atlanta, as well as Birmingham, 
Ala.; Pueblo, Colo., and southeastern Tennessee. It also has two acquisitions 
pending in Philadelphia and one in Wichita Falls, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 LifeFleet is owned by Secom Co. Ltd., a Tokyo residential and commercial 
security company that also owns Westec Security. Combined Forces: The 
CareLine-LifeFleet Merger 
</P>
<P>
 Two Orange County-based ambulance companies will merge to form the nation's 
second-largest emergency medical services firm. Details on Irvine-based 
CareLine's acquisition of LifeFleet, its Newport Beach-based competitor:

THE UPHEAVAL AT PLATINUM SOFTWARE; COMPUTERS: THE LATEST PROBLEMS ARE NOT THE 
FIRST THAT IRVINE COMPANY FOUNDER GERALD BLACKIE HAS ENCOUNTERED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN CHRISTIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Platinum Software Corp. seemed aptly named. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last year, with demand for its popular accounting software growing 
rapidly, Platinum tripled its payroll, made seven acquisitions and reported $39 
million in annual revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 But with Monday's announcement that the company's top managers had resigned 
and that Platinum had overstated its revenue for 15 months, the company's 
explosive growth drew closer attention -- as did its architect, Gerald R. 
Blackie, the firm's founder, who stepped aside as chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turns out, Blackie's first computer venture, Heritage Computing Inc. in 
Costa Mesa, was sued for copyright infringement in 1983, according to court 
documents. The suit ended in an out-of-court settlement four years later -- by 
which time Heritage had gone bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, a trade group sued Advanced Business Microsystems Inc. -- which 
became Platinum -- for illegally duplicating software. That suit, too, was 
settled out of court. 
</P>
<P>
 Blackie has been unavailable for comment on the recent turn of events. 
</P>
<P>
 Carmelo J. Santoro, Platinum's acting chief executive, described him Thursday 
as "concerned and sad." 
</P>
<P>
 "He really believes in this company, and he's proud of what he's done here," 
said Santoro, who is also a Platinum board member and vice chairman of AST 
Research Inc. in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 The story of Platinum began, incongruously enough, with sportswear. In the 
late 1970s, Blackie opened a store in Huntington Beach that specialized in ski 
paraphernalia: suits, gloves, goggles and masks. 
</P>
<P>
 To balance his books, Blackie bought an accounting program made by a Woodland 
Hills software manufacturer, Occupational Computing Co. -- one of the first in 
the nation to come out with such a product. 
</P>
<P>
 Blackie, a handsome New Zealand native who had moved to California a few years 
before, was so impressed with the software that he offered to market it. 
According to public records, the 29-year-old entrepreneur signed a contract in 
January, 1983, granting him a license to manufacture and distribute OCC's 
software. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 About the same time, Blackie opened Heritage Computing. He brought with him 
three men who formerly had operated the small financial consulting firm that 
introduced Blackie to OCC's software: its owner, Brett Wilson, and Wilson's two 
right-hand men, Kevin P. Riegelsberger and Timothy J. McMullen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gerald was as charming a person as I have ever met," said Wilson, now the 
director of information services for Navicert Financial, a consulting firm in 
Carson. "He could make you feel that you were the most wonderful, smartest 
person in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Within a year, the relationship between OCC and Heritage soured. OCC filed a 
lawsuit against Heritage in December of 1983 alleging that Blackie sold the 
software without paying royalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Heritage filed for bankruptcy in 1985. Two years later, OCC and Heritage's 
insurance carrier settled the suit out of court for an undisclosed amount of 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 In sworn testimony taken in a deposition, Wilson said he left Heritage in 1983 
because he "would not be a party to stealing OCC's software." 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Price, an Irvine patent lawyer who represented Blackie in the suit, 
said his client argued that Heritage distributed its own software, not OCC's. 
"He didn't take their product," Price said. "Heritage devised its own 
accounting package with its own programmers." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Blackie, Riegelsberger and McMullen founded another company, 
Advanced Business Microsystems Inc., in 1984. The Irvine-based company, known 
as ABM, made and marketed a new kind of accounting software, Platinum. That 
eventually became the company's name. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the year before it went public, the company landed in a legal dispute 
with the Software Publishers Assn. -- a trade group that acts as a watchdog 
against copyright infringement in the computer industry. The Washington-based 
organization filed a suit against ABM on behalf of eight software makers -- 
including Microsoft Corp., WordPerfect Corp. and Lotus Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit alleged that ABM, Platinum's predecessor, illegally duplicated 
software. An employee with the company called the association anonymously with 
the tip, an SPA spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 SPA files dozens of such suits every year but focuses on "an extremely small 
number" of software makers, said the association's litigation manager, Peter 
Beruk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally, software companies are cognizant of the fact that they would not 
want someone stealing their software, and therefore should not infringe on 
other makers' rights," Beruk said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company settled the suit out of court in 1992 for $85,000 after agreeing 
"to ensure that all unlicensed copies of computer software have been eliminated 
from its personal computers," according to the SPA. 
</P>
<P>
 Blackie said in the press release at the time: "We did find some areas where 
we were in technical violation, and we took immediate steps to correct the 
situation. ABM firmly believes in the right of all software producers to be 
paid for their products." 
</P>
<P>
 Platinum grew quickly after its initial public offering in October, 1992, when 
it raised $22.5 million. The company's accounting software could run on 
personal computer networks -- which made it attractive to big corporations that 
were shifting from multimillion-dollar centralized computers known as 
mainframes to less expensive networks of PCs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the rapid growth suddenly stalled. The company reported a steep decline in 
earnings on Jan. 17, saying it had difficulty closing contracts with customers 
during the quarter ended Dec. 31. The stock dropped $3 a share to $13 a share 
the day of the announcement.  
</P>
<P>
 The next day, shareholder Ezriel Tauber sued the company, alleging that it 
withheld crucial information from investors and violated securities laws. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, the outside directors of the company -- acting chairman Santoro 
and AST Research's chief financial officer, Bruce Edwards -- hired the 
accounting firm Ernst & Young to review Platinum's books, which had previously 
been audited by Arthur Andersen & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 When the review came back, it stated that the company had misinterpreted 
accounting rules and would have to scale back its revenue from the past four 
quarters by as much as $10 million. After reading the review, Arthur Andersen 
withdrew its report. 
</P>
<P>
 Santoro and Edwards then asked for resignations from Blackie and CFO Jon R. 
Erickson. Blackie's longtime business associates, vice presidents Riegelsberger 
and McMullen, stayed on at the company but gave up their titles and board 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
 "The four officers are named in the class-action suit," Santoro said. "Their 
departure allows Platinum to separate the legal and business aspects of the 
company." 
</P>
<P>
 Santoro said Platinum is still trying to assess the full extent of the 
overstatement of revenue and exactly how it happened. He said he met Tuesday 
with investigators from the Securities and Exchange Commission and expects an 
SEC investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Santoro said he knew nothing about the lawsuit filed against Heritage 
Computing or about the company itself. "I've never heard those words associated 
with (Blackie)," he said. "When I met him, he was Platinum Software. I never 
knew anything about what he had done in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Platinum spokesman David Downing said he has faith that the company's deposed 
chief "will land on his feet." 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a great visionary," Downing said of Blackie. "I have no doubt he will 
re-emerge in some other capacity, that he will start some kind of business 
again. He has a lot of energy."

INVESTOR MAY SEEK CHANGE ON GATEWAY BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 An East Coast investor in Gateway Communications Inc., the Irvine marketer of 
computer networking equipment, said it may call for a change in the company's 
board or management. 
</P>
<P>
 Investment Perspectives Advisory Corp., which holds 248,700 Gateway shares, or 
a 4.9% stake, said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Thursday that 
it "may desire a change in the present board or the management of the issuer." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of neither Gateway nor Investment Perspectives could be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 For 1993, Gateway posted a loss of $2.27 million, compared to a profit of 
$609,000 for 1992. Revenue declined to $10.4 million from $20.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Investment Perspectives, based in Macungie, Pa., also said it may speak with 
other investors about forming a shareholder group. Steel Partners Ltd., Adage 
Inc., Warren G. Lichtenstein, Jack Howard, Lawrence Butler and Ronald W. Hayes 
have already agreed to participate with Investment Perspectives as a group, 
according to the SEC filing. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Gateway's shares were up 28 cents to close at an even $1 in 
Nasdaq trading.

 Importers and exporters can get so mired in customs documentation that they 
spend more time filling out forms than trading products with other nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Toshiba America Electronic Components in Irvine is part of a test group that 
could ease the laborious process.The U.S. Customs Service has been using the 
company in a program that allows cargo to move across international borders 
without the usual avalanche of paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Toshiba America, a maker of picture tubes, is one of 65 U.S. companies testing 
the electronic filing program that permits the rapid, almost paperless flow of 
goods. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pre-Importation Review Program, as Customs calls the new system, "permits 
us to achieve cost savings and virtually same-day customs clearance for our 
products, something we would have (never) thought possible a year ago," said 
Laurie J. Peach, the company's traffic manager. "It also improves our 
competitiveness."

TOYOTA OFFICIALS REVIEWING UNFAIR-PRICING LAWSUITS; AUTOS: THE COMPANY IS BEING 
ACCUSED OF PADDING INVOICES WITH ADVERTISING FEES THAT WERE ACTUALLY KICKBACKS 
TO DEALERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Officials at Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. said they are reviewing an 
unfair-pricing lawsuit filed against the company Thursday in San Francisco, as 
well as a spate of others filed earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuits allege that Toyota and its dealers inflated prices and misled 
consumers by adding to auto invoices a dealer advertising fee that was actually 
kicked back to dealers as additional profit on each sale. 
</P>
<P>
 The allegations against Toyota come just weeks after a handful of former top 
officials at American Honda Motor Co., also based in Torrance, were charged 
with bribery in the awarding of franchises across the nation during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Though they are unrelated, the allegations against the two auto giants are 
damaging to the whole industry at a time when it has been working to improve 
its image with consumers, said consultant George Peterson, president of 
AutoPacific Group in Santa Ana.  
</P>
<P>
 "If there is much more of this, then consumers are going to start feeling they 
are paying prices that are too high," Peterson said. "They will start to 
question dealers' credibility and ethics, and that's a hit the industry doesn't 
need right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Toyota officials said they would not comment further on the lawsuits until 
today or Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The first of the suits was filed last week in Contra Costa County Superior 
Court. Another was filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 A separate lawsuit was filed Wednesday in Los Angeles County Superior Court by 
a Santa Monica couple, Marvin H. and Helen M. Leaf, who allege that Toyota's 
California distribution subsidiary covertly inflated prices of cars sold in the 
state from 1975 through 1991 by adding a small profit to the handling and 
shipping charges listed on state-mandated price stickers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Leafs' lawyer, Thomas Anderson, said Toyota Motors Distribution Inc. added 
from $76 to $200 to the prices of about 2.5 million cars sold in California. 
The money was extra profit to the distributor -- a subsidiary of Toyota Motor 
Sales -- and was hidden as part of the total "inland freight and handling" 
charge shown in the window stickers, the suit alleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the increases were concealed, consumers were denied knowledge that 
would have aided them in negotiating a fair price when they bought Toyotas, the 
suit alleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson has asked the court to expand the suit into a class action -- meaning 
that he would be representing all 2.5 million Toyota buyers who he says were 
affected. 
</P>
<P>
 The two law firms that filed the kickback suits in Northern California are 
also seeking to be allowed to sue on behalf of all Toyota buyers who paid 
higher prices for their cars because of the allegedly improper advertising fee 
rebates to dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Toyota officials would not comment on those charges, the president of 
the Southern California Toyota Dealers Assn. called the suits "groundless." 
Such advertising fees, association President Norris Bishton said, have existed 
for years and are part of the typical cooperative advertising arrangement used 
widely in the auto industry and in other retailing businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishton, a Los Angeles lawyer and owner of Toyota of Garden Grove, one the 
nation's largest Toyota dealerships, said dealers do receive a portion of the 
advertising fee but that it is earmarked for advertising costs and is not a 
hidden profit or kickback.

 Singapore Office: Odetics Inc., the maker of automatic data storage systems 
for computers, has created a new Far East operation and opened a marketing 
office in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 The subsidiary, called Odetics Asia Pacific, gives the Anaheim company a 
larger overseas presence with its first Asian-based operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Singapore itself provides a prime example of a communications market that is 
in need of products we manufacture," said Frank Borst, director of global 
business development and the new managing director of Odetics Asia Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 The company formed Odetics U.K. Ltd. in 1989 as a subsidiary to market its 
products in Great Britain, but that operation has since expanded into Central 
Europe, the Middle East and Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's part of an overall globalization strategy," Borst said about the 
Singapore unit. Already, the Asia Pacific subsidiary has made sales in 
Malaysia, Japan and South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Borst also said the timing is "perfect" for the new office because of the 
opening of Vietnam this year to U.S. trade. "We do particularly well in 
emerging markets where new communications channels are being established," he 
said. "Vietnam definitely meets this criteria."

 Water Purifier: OffShore Marine Laboratories in Laguna Hills has shipped one 
of its water-purification units to the island of Truk in Micronesia, where it 
will be installed in a hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 The unit is capable of producing 25,000 gallons of fresh water a day for 
guests at the Continental Hotel on the island, a World War II battle site that 
has become popular with recreational divers who explore the coral reefs. 
</P>
<P>
 The unit is easy to transport because it comes in the same configuration as a 
20-foot ocean shipping container. It is valued at $150,000, said OffShore 
President Thomas Duncan.  
</P>
<P>
 It purifies water through a reverse-osmosis system, forcing salt water through 
a membrane to filter out salt and other impurities.

 Independence One Bank of California, FSB: The Mission Viejo savings and loan 
said first-quarter profit fell 44%, to $944,000 from last year's first-quarter 
profit of $1.7 million.The thrift said the earnings decline resulted primarily 
from the anticipated $114-million pay-down of a government note and a downward 
rate adjustment on the remaining balance. Also, the company said, a slowdown in 
the real estate refinancing market led to a decline in lending activities at 
the bank's mortgage warehouse lending subsidiary. As of March 31, total assets 
stood at $756.6 million, down 12% from $856.2 million a year earlier.

 What to look for in some key PC components: 
</P>
<P>
 * Central processing unit. It contains the microprocessor, the "brains" of the 
computer. IBM-compatibles operate on the 8086-80486 family of microprocessor 
chips (386, 486, for short) or the new Pentium chip by Intel. Chips' processing 
speeds are expressed in megahertz. The higher the number, the faster the 
computer's response to instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts' recommendations: nothing less than a 386, since older machines cannot 
run many of today's newest programs, with a minimum of 25 megahertz. Also, look 
for a "DX" processor rather than an "SX" to run mathematical spreadsheets. 
</P>
<P>
 * Random access memory, or RAM. This is where the computer stores programs and 
files in use. Storage capacity is expressed in megabytes, with one megabyte 
able to store a million characters. Most systems, though, can have memory added 
through single in-line memory modules, or SIMMs, that plug into a computer. The 
more memory, the more data can be used at one time and the faster a computer 
works. 
</P>
<P>
 Recommendation: nothing lower than four megabytes, especially for those 
planning to use Windows software. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hard disk drive. It stores all software programs and data even when the PC 
is turned off, like a computer data warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Recommendation: a minimum of 105 megabytes, though the average for most models 
today is in the 200-megabyte range. 
</P>
<P>
 * Floppy disk drive. This allows PC users to read or save data from other 
computer sources stored on floppy disks. 
</P>
<P>
 Recommendations: It would be ideal to have two floppy disk drives -- one for 5 
1/4-inch floppies and one for 3 1/2-inch floppies. But if you have to choose 
just one, pick the one for the smaller floppies, since they have become the 
industry standard. 
</P>
<P>
 * Monitor. It houses the screen on which information is displayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Recommendations: a minimum 14-inch screen, though larger screens are better 
for spreadsheet programs. A "super VGA" and non-interlaced screen is best for 
the eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keyboard and mouse. Both are used to give commands to the computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Recommendation: whatever feels comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 * Modem. This allows computer data to be carried over phone lines and is 
necessary for connection to on-line information services such as Prodigy or 
CompuServe. Many modems also have faxing capabilities. The faster the modem, 
the less time it takes to transmit data and the lower your phone bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Recommendation: a minimum 2,400-baud modem, though many experts say it is 
wiser to invest in faster 9,600- and 14,400-baud modems. 
</P>
<P>
 * Printer. It transfers computer-generated text and pictures to paper. The 
least expensive is the dot-matrix, which creates characters by printing a 
series of dots. A laser printer, which uses a laser beam to transfer images, is 
the most expensive but offers the highest quality. 
</P>
<P>
 Recommendation: If you need letter-quality results, stick with a laser 
printer.

INDUSTRY AIMS TO MAKE PC A HOUSEHOLD WORD; TECHNOLOGY: WITH THE CORPORATE 
MARKET ABOUT TAPPED OUT, COMPUTER MAKERS ARE TARGETING INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS 
WITH LESS COSTLY, MORE POWERFUL AND EASIER TO USE UNITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With a flick of a switch and a click of a key or two, today's families can 
balance their checkbooks, message friends around the world, compose music, even 
study mating calls of exotic birds. 
</P>
<P>
 The technological advances in personal computers have made all this and much 
more possible. Yet only a third of the 96 million U.S. households are plugged 
into that world. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the unplugged confess that they are scared by the sight of a "mouse," 
not to mention a keyboard, monitor and modem. They are perplexed by the 
techno-jargon of bits, bytes, baud, RAM, ROM and DOS. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem lies with the computer industry, which in the past catered 
mainly to experienced commercial users. Individuals were dismissed as 
"dead-end" users, a term technicians used for the painfully obvious questions 
novices could pose. 
</P>
<P>
 But that has rapidly changed as high-tech firms, nearing a saturation point in 
the corporate market, turn to consumers as a source of business. The technology 
has also made computers more powerful for less money. 
</P>
<P>
 "The PC industry has historically never really addressed consumers," said Rick 
Martin, director of product marketing for Compaq Computer Corp. "We have to 
tell our story to the people . . . and explain all the benefits of having a PC 
in the first place. Then we have to provide the technology to do those things. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to go after the two-thirds of the households that don't have a 
computer." 
</P>
<P>
 To tap into that market, Compaq has been heavily marketing its Presario PC 
brand, unveiled last summer with individuals and small businesses in mind. It 
includes all-in-one units that require no assembly, a software program that 
organizes computer files like a notebook and easy-to-read manuals. 
</P>
<P>
 Gateway 2000, a mail-order company, has been "advertising in magazines that we 
have never advertised in before -- more consumer-oriented magazines," said 
Wendell Watson, a company spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, he said, sales have been brisk for its recently introduced 
Family PC, which comes equipped with a multimedia package that includes a 
CD-ROM player and speakers that allow users to both see and hear information 
from their software programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Other companies, including industry leaders like IBM Corp. and Apple Computer 
Inc., have made their equipment easier to use and more fun to operate. Their 
lightweight laptop PCs pack the same punch as the larger desktop PCs but can be 
used just about anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Improved software has helped. A standard installation now in many machines is 
the Windows program created by Microsoft Corp., which lets users point to 
on-screen pictures to tell the computer what to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Windows has made it easier to work with a computer's disk operating system, or 
DOS, the cumbersome foundation software that tends to the basic functioning of 
all IBM-compatible computers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The technology has come a long way in a relatively short time. You can do so 
much with your PC," said Lawrence J. Magid, author of "The Little PC Book," 
written for novices. 
</P>
<P>
 While the technology has leaped, prices have fallen. Today, a fast, 
well-equipped PC can be purchased for $1,200 to $2,000, with portable units 
costing about a third more than desktop units. 
</P>
<P>
 About a year ago, the average PC sold for about $3,000. Four years ago, it 
cost about $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The normal reaction may be to wait until technological advances bring down 
prices even more. But Magid's book recommends: "If you need a computer now, buy 
one. If you wait a year or two, you'll save money or wind up with a more 
powerful system, but think of the opportunities you'll have missed." 
</P>
<P>
 Magid says the safest bet is to avoid both the ultra-high-end models and last 
year's leftovers. "You should try to buy as much technology as you can afford. 
. . . It's sometimes more expensive to upgrade," he added in a recent 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Before shopping, decide what you want a PC for: Will it be used mainly as a 
word processor for occasionally working at home? To organize family finances? 
Help with your children's homework? Play games? Perhaps a little of each? 
</P>
<P>
 The initial choice boils down to either an IBM-compatible PC or an Apple 
Macintosh. Either will do the job; the main difference is that each uses its 
own proprietary software and the IBM standard is more prevalent. (Apple has 
recently introduced Macintoshes that are IBM-compatible, however.) 
</P>
<P>
 While it is not necessary to fully understand a computer's components to run 
one, it is helpful to become familiar with basic functions to make a more 
educated choice. 
</P>
<P>
 You will need to know two key things: a PC's power and its memory capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 The power, or main computing work, comes from the microprocessor chip, the 
computer's brain. IBM-compatibles operate on the 8086-80486 family of chips or 
the new Pentium chip by Intel Corp. A chip's ability to process data depends on 
the level of megahertz. The higher the number, the faster the processing speed. 
</P>
<P>
 Each PC has random-access memory, or RAM, which is where the computer stores 
programs and files in use. It also contains what is known as a hard disk, which 
acts as a warehouse by holding all data. Storage capacity is expressed in 
megabytes, with one megabyte storing 1 million characters. Again, the higher 
the number, the more information can be handled and the more you can do with 
your PC.

CSUN HOPING TO PARTY WITH ITS NOISEMAKER; OUTGOING HEITMANN GIVES VOLLEYBALL 
TEAM TITLE SHOT 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the finger-twirlin', tongue-waggin', smack-talkin' diatribe department of 
college men's volleyball, Cal State Northridge has a player who gives new 
meaning to the term lip service. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointed remarks are best left unsaid when Oliver Heitmann, the Matadors' star 
middle blocker, is on patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the consequences for a Pepperdine player who earlier this season 
dared to deride a shot that Heitmann blasted errantly into the net. 
</P>
<P>
 Heitmann's next shot was smashed through that particular opponent's block and 
off the hardwood floor with such force that the ball ricocheted up into the 
rafters of Pepperdine's Firestone Fieldhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about a rooof.  
</P>
<P>
 "The hardest-hit ball of all time," said Chris McGee, the Matadors' team 
captain. "I don't think he likes guys talking to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Quiet, McGee. You're divulging team secrets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm kind of hoping guys talk trash to him all this weekend," Northridge Coach 
John Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors will need an inspired Heitmann if they hope to win a second 
consecutive Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament title. Northridge 
(17-9) will meet Pepperdine (12-8) in first-round action Saturday at 4 p.m. at 
Stanford's Maples Pavilion. The winner of the tournament probably will be 
invited to the NCAA Final Four in Fort Wayne, Ind., May 6-7. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the reason we have a good chance," McGee said. "We don't have a great 
team, but we have a good team and we have that one guy -- Oliver -- who can 
take over a game." 
</P>
<P>
 A game, a match, a season, a party. Heitmann, 24, might be the most popular 
non-bottled German import to hit Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "He loves to hang out," McGee said. "He wants to get to know everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Heitmann's commitment to fun already is legendary. McGee, who doubles as team 
leader and social director, recalls making a stop with Heitmann at a bank 
teller machine as they prepared to celebrate St. Patrick's Day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got my customary $20 and then Oliver takes out $300," McGee said. "I said, 
'Oliver, what are you going to do with all that money?' He said, 'Girls are 
expensive in California.' That's all he said." 
</P>
<P>
 For such a seemingly soft-spoken fellow -- "a quiet, nice guy" is how Price 
describes him -- Heitmann carries quite a reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having lived with the guy I can tell you he definitely is not quiet," said 
Gary Reznick, Heitmann's roommate and the Matadors' starting setter. "He's a 
very funny, wild and crazy guy." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, he fits right in with most other members of the Northridge 
team. To wit: 
</P>
<P>
 In February, at Northridge's last home basketball game, the volleyball team 
dressed in zany outfits and appeared en masse as the "Matamaniacs." Heitmann, 
who had been enrolled in school only a few weeks, was among them. 
</P>
<P>
 His get-up? Well, let's just say it was nothing he packed for his trip from 
Hamburg. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wore a crazy shirt, sun glasses, hat, shorts, knee pads, something like 
that," Heitmann said. "I wasn't really prepared with clothes." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor was he prepared to go on public display so dysfunctionally attired. Not 
even a legitimate excuse was reason enough to miss the dress-up. Heitmann 
missed an astronomy lab in order to attend the game, a worthwhile sacrifice he 
now believes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I go, no problem," he said. "I am a team player." 
</P>
<P>
 There is little doubt about that. Proof positive, Price said, is that Heitmann 
attends many of Northridge's home baseball games and cheers and jeers from the 
bleachers with his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "That has to be a team bonding thing," Price said. "I've never met anyone from 
Europe who enjoys watching baseball. That would be like finding an American who 
likes cricket." 
</P>
<P>
 Heitmann, a member of the German national team, was recruited by Price sight 
unseen. "I've never seen him play, not even on tape," Price said late in 
January on the day the school officially admitted the 6-foot-7 junior. "I've 
seen his picture in Volleyball Monthly (magazine). Does that count?" 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge took a $7,000 gamble -- the price of a full scholarship, including 
foreign tuition -- based on the word of several reliable sources. U.S. national 
team coaches Rod Wilde and Jim Coleman were among them, as were former Matador 
players Axel Hager and Neil Coffman, who play in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Hager, another Hamburg native, preceded Heitmann at Northridge, playing in 
1992 and '93. 
</P>
<P>
 Since his arrival, Heitmann said, he has been too busy to be homesick. He is 
taking a 12-unit academic load, plus a crash course in U.S. college volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
 Heitmann's first practice was Feb. 1, his first match, Feb. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really didn't spend a lot of time talking to him and getting to know him," 
Price said. "Basically, we just threw him in there." 
</P>
<P>
 At first with mixed reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early going, Heitmann was neither in peak physical condition nor 
accustomed to competing with such a youthful and mistake-prone supporting cast. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was an adjustment period, but he was very tolerant of inexperienced 
mistakes, more so than I was," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 The patience is paying big dividends. Northridge has won three in a row, seven 
of eight and nine 11 matches. 
</P>
<P>
 Heitmann mans a place in the Matadors' lineup that previously was occupied by 
Coley Kyman, a three-time All-American. 
</P>
<P>
 The spot continues to produce. 
</P>
<P>
 Heitmann's .460 attacking percentage is sixth in the nation, his 6.43 kill 
average is seventh, and his 1.53 block average is 11th. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a big gap in our lineup," Reznick said. "Bringing in one guy like 
Oliver set everybody in their roles and helped us all become better players. 
</P>
<P>
 "You play next to a guy like him and you have two choices. You either stay 
where you're at, or you decide that you want to be that good too. We've all 
been trying to rise to his level." 
</P>
<P>
 On his end, Heitmann also has been making an effort to fit in with his 
relatively new set of teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, on the bus ride to a match at Cal State Long Beach, Heitmann was 
asked to sing the German national anthem. At first, he declined. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then we said, 'If you do it, we'll win for sure,' " McGee recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 So he did. And the Matadors won. 
</P>
<P>
 They've lost only once -- to top-ranked UCLA -- since. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that's a team in concert.

CSUN DISMISSALS STEMMED FROM VIOLATION OF TEAM POLICY; WOMEN'S BASKETBALL: 
CHANDLER SAYS UNRECONCILED OFF-COURT INCIDENT BROUGHT ABOUT THE REVOCATION OF 
TWO STARTERS' SCHOLARSHIPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The dismissal of two prominent Cal State Northridge women's basketball players 
was a result of a dispute touched off by a "severe violation" of team policy, 
Coach Kim Chandler said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Point guard Kris Waldorf and leading scorer Michelle Esparza were told by 
Chandler in separate meetings Wednesday night that their scholarships would be 
revoked after this semester. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler said that an unspecified off-court incident involving both players 
last December never was reconciled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both of these players were instrumental to our basketball program with their 
ability on the floor," the coach said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "But . . . the program will not be jeopardized with actions of this kind by 
players or staff at any time." 
</P>
<P>
 Waldorf, a 5-foot-5 sophomore from Artesia, and Esparza, a 5-foot-10 sophomore 
from Monterey Park, would not divulge specifics about their alleged misconduct. 
However, both players acknowledged that a "personal incident off the court" 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Waldorf, the team's assist leader with 71, started all but one of Northridge's 
25 games at point guard. Esparza, a shooting guard, averaged a team-high 15.7 
points and took down 4.9 rebounds per game. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler said the players "failed to meet probationary requirements to 
maintain their involvement in the program." 
</P>
<P>
 "This was not an easy decision for any of us, but it was one that had to be 
made," Chandler added. "There are certain things you just don't do. I won't 
jeopardize the principles of this program no matter who is involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler's move came with the blessing of Judith Brame, associate athletic 
director at Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Brame said Chandler followed athletic program policy by submitting her 
recommendation for the dismissals to administrators before announcing the move. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it is valid it is supported," Brame said. "If not, an alternative may be 
recommended." 
</P>
<P>
 Waldorf and Esparza can appeal the decision to a school financial aid 
committee headed by Vu Tran, Northridge's acting financial aid director. The 
players have said they are not planning an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Waldorf said she would appeal what she said was a decision by Chandler not to 
grant her a release in order to transfer her eligibility to another school. 
</P>
<P>
 There probably will be no need. "At no point (Wednesday) night did I refuse a 
release to Kris," Chandler said. "What I said was that I was not willing to 
discuss her plans to transfer last night." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Hiegert, Northridge's athletic director, said NCAA rules will prohibit the 
athletes from transferring and playing for a Division I or Division II team 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Both players can reclaim their eligibility after sitting out a season, or they 
can transfer to a Division III or NAIA school and have immediate eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the eight freshmen, sophomores and juniors who started last season as 
players with scholarships, only center Maureen Batiste and guards Shannon 
Crouse and Carrie Dormire remain on the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Two players quit in the early stages of last season and another, forward 
Katina Mines, left the squad immediately after the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge basketball program has been racked by turmoil in recent 
seasons, a trend Chandler blames on circumstances starting with the resignation 
of Coach Janet Martin in December 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler, then a newly hired assistant, took over the program on an interim 
basis when Martin left at midseason. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been through everything you can imagine the past two years," Chandler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors finished 3-22 in their most-recent campaign, which was muddled by 
complications related to the Jan. 17 earthquake and capped by a late-season 
traffic accident in which three players were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge finished the season with six healthy players. 
</P>
<P>
 "When things aren't going well and you're not winning basketball games, it's 
tough," said Chandler, whose record at Northridge is 11-58. "The people who are 
left here are going to be stronger people and players because of the 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "The juniors we have coming back are tough people and I expect them to provide 
a solid nucleus to build this program around. We've all been tested, and we're 
all better for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge announced only hours before Chandler dismissed Waldorf and Esparza 
that six recruits have signed letters of intent. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with guard Sarah Hagman of Crescenta Valley and Kelly Morris of Diamond 
Bar, who committed previously, the Matadors signed Sarah Bell of Oakland, 
Sherry Ramirez of Ontario, Holly Babcock of Nevada Union, and Tannea Nelson of 
Richmond. 
</P>
<P>
 Brame, who also attributed Northridge's recent high rate of player turnover to 
"unusual circumstances," said she expected the vast majority of Chandler's 
latest group of recruits to stay for the duration of the collegiate careers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would expect that we'll have a more stable program the next couple of 
years," she said.

GOLF TEAM HAS INTERNATIONAL FLAVOR; COMMUNITY COLLEGE: PLAYERS FROM NORTHERN 
IRELAND, AFRICA AND THE U.S. HELP MAKE SADDLEBACK WORLD CLASS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Even if Bill Cunerty, Saddleback's golf coach, was the most cunning recruiter 
in the history of collegiate athletics, there is no way he could have 
intentionally brought together his current team. 
</P>
<P>
 Because to do so, Cunerty would have had to travel to Northern Ireland and 
Africa as well as Colorado and Van Nuys before stopping in his own district. 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is, Cunerty says, he doesn't recruit all that much. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he relies on past achievements, solid reputation and a top-notch 
practice facility to sway players toward Saddleback. 
</P>
<P>
 Cunerty's team has won 12 conference titles in his 13 years. The Gauchos have 
won State titles in 1983, 1985 and 1989, were second in 1982, 1984 and 1988 and 
third in 1986, 1987 and 1991. Saddleback was fourth last season. 
</P>
<P>
 No community college program in California has a nicer practice facility than 
Saddleback, which has an on-campus driving range open to players from 8 a.m. to 
9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had nothing like this at San Jose State," freshman transfer Aki Amaya 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Amaya and team captain Jason Reeder average 75.5 strokes per 18 holes. Colin 
McElderry, a sophomore, is at 75.6; sophomore Jason McDaniel averages 75.9, 
freshmen Justin Grandy (76.5) and Jerome Valentin (78) round out the first six 
for Saddleback. 
</P>
<P>
 Cunerty figures this year's team has a strong chance of winning another State 
title. Saddleback already has won the Orange Empire Conference title with a 
17-1 record. Saddleback is 83-3-1 against all opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's 18-hole scoring average is 374, four shots better than the 
Saddleback season record. 
</P>
<P>
 "They certainly are as good as any of our State (championship) teams," Cunerty 
said. "Our depth is such that they push each other all the time. We have a deal 
where the throw-out score (highest of the six) has to clean the van and no one 
wants to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Reeder came to Saddleback after hearing of its reputation. He grew up in 
Fruita, Colo., near Grand Junction. He played four years of varsity golf at 
Fruita Monument High School and advanced to the State tournament each season. 
</P>
<P>
 But after high school, he wasn't ready for a four-year college, so he looked 
at California community colleges on the advice of his older brother, Randall, a 
teaching professional at Los Angeles Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 "This team doesn't give up," he said. "We all know how hard everyone works and 
we all get along great. We've never really had any fights except when we argue 
about who hit the worst shot of the day." 
</P>
<P>
 McDaniel is from San Clemente, but Cunerty reached into the past to recruit 
him. McDaniel, 25, said he was more concerned about partying with friends than 
graduating from high school in the late '80s. He went to work full-time and 
temporarily gave up on college. 
</P>
<P>
 McDaniel continued to play golf but knew he could be much better if he worked 
harder at it. Finally, a year ago, he made a serious commitment to college, 
moving in with a friend's family to cut down on expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best thing I've ever done," he said. "I'm having the time of my 
life. It's just incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 McElderry came to Saddleback from Northern Ireland. He wanted to move to the 
United States to play golf year-round and heard about Saddleback from John 
Adams, a former Gaucho whom he met playing golf in Palm Springs while on 
vacation with his parents. 
</P>
<P>
 McElderry went home last summer to play in local tournaments, but likes the 
year-round warm weather of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just looking around for a place to play," McElderry said. "I figured 
this was one of the best and I wasn't wrong either." 
</P>
<P>
 Amaya, who turns 21 today, adds to Saddleback's global make-up. He was born in 
Japan and moved to the United States at age 10. He and his twin brother, Yasu, 
played golf at Van Nuys Birmingham High School. Yasu went to Fresno State, 
where he currently plays, and Aki went to San Jose State. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Aki's roommates was Bob Jacobson, who had played at Saddleback. When 
things didn't work out at San Jose State, Amaya visited Saddleback on the 
advice of Jacobson. 
</P>
<P>
 Amaya commutes to Saddleback from Torrance, where he lives with his parents. 
He gets up about 6 a.m. and gets to school before 8 a.m. He practices at the 
range for about an hour, then goes to class, then back to the range, waiting 
for traffic to ease. 
</P>
<P>
 "It forces me to practice," Amaya said. "I can't go home and take a nap 
because it's so far away." 
</P>
<P>
 Valentin came to Saddleback from the San Diego Golf Academy but is from much 
farther away -- Africa. After high school in Dakar, the capital of the West 
African nation Senegal, he came to Florida, where he stayed for nine months. He 
worked on his golf game and his English. 
</P>
<P>
 He heard about the San Diego Golf Academy, which teaches the game and the 
business of golf, and went there two years ago. After graduating last December, 
he was ready for college and made some inquiries. Several people mentioned 
Saddleback, and he figured it must be the place. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was lucky," he said. "You have to meet the right people to get the best 
advice and I did. . . . I really like it here. I have a lot of time to practice 
and if I have a problem, I can ask one of my teammates for help. Everybody is 
not in his own corner." 
</P>
<P>
 Grandy comes to Saddleback from Trabuco Hills High School. He didn't start 
playing golf until he was a freshman in high school and used to sneak on the 
Mission Viejo Country Club course near his house. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first I played because I had nothing better to do," he said. "I was pretty 
horrible at first, but I kept getting better." 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback starts its quest toward a State title Monday, when the Gauchos play 
in the 36-hole Orange Empire Conference championship at Singing Hills Country 
Club in El Cajon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gauchos hope to advance to the May 2 Southern California championships at 
Santa Ana Country Club, then to the State tournament May 9 at Mission Viejo 
Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really a unique team," Cunerty said. "The other day I was driving the 
van home from a match when it hit me. They all like to listen to jazz and were 
doing homework. Plus, they work really hard. If they are not in class or doing 
homework or asleep, they are hitting balls."

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK: HARVARD HANDS LOYOLA SHORT END OF MATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It wasn't exactly David against Goliath, because when Harvard-Westlake High 
met Mission League rival Loyola on Tuesday, it matched the two top-ranked 
volleyball teams in the Southland -- and perhaps the top two in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola was undefeated and ranked first in the Southern Section Division I. The 
Wolverines were ranked second, their only loss a five-game defeat to the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
 But after looking at the two teams, the Harvard-Westlake players could be 
handed slingshots. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cubs are loaded with height, power and leaping ability. Ten players on the 
roster are listed 6-foot-2 or taller. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at No. 9," Harvard-Westlake Coach Jess Quiroz said, gesturing to 
Loyola's Eric Bennett, whose shaved head made his 6-5, 225 pound-frame even 
more intimidating. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a man." 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard-Westlake plays with an undersized lineup and has only two tall players 
(Seth Rodsky and Jay Ingram each stand 6-4). 
</P>
<P>
 But athleticism takes many forms. The Wolverines' precision passing, smart 
hitting and the uncanny setting ability of Court Young propelled them to a 
four-game victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's how we beat most teams," Young said. "We're not big, but we're pretty 
steady." MISSION LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Sweet Dreams 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard-Westlake's Matt Sebree, one of the nation's top high school volleyball 
players, did not sleep the night before the match against Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had an art history paper due, so I pulled an all-nighter," the senior 
outside hitter said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was wide awake at game time, finishing with a match-high 29 kills and 
leading the team to the emotional victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was joking with my teammates, I may never go to sleep again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chaminade's fine pitching is only getting better. The Eagles allowed only one 
run in two games last week and had won seven of eight games until losing to 
Alemany on Wednesday, 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Gabe Crecion leads the team with a 6-2 record and a 1.62 earned-run 
average in 39 innings. The 6-foot-4 sophomore also plays first base and has a 
.319 batting average. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's just throwing incredible stuff," Coach Dave Desmond said. 
</P>
<P>
 Crecion's older brother, Adam Crecion, joined the team Saturday after sitting 
out since mid-March because of a broken nose.

 Adam had a two-run single in his first at-bat. He will move from catcher to 
right field and from first in the batting lineup to fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need run production and he can do it," Desmond said. "He's playing exactly 
the way he did when he went down." MARMONTE LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Wishful Thinking? 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura Coach Bryan Maloney said his program had a turning point when it blew a 
12-1 lead to Dos Pueblos last week. A positive turning point, believe it or 
not. 
</P>
<P>
 Positive because the Chargers won, 14-12, in eight innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's important for the program," Maloney said. "We've been trying to teach 
the kids how to play. Now we feel we're trying to teach them how to win. When 
you blow a 12-1 lead, your attitude can just be, 'Here we go again.' " 
</P>
<P>
 After winning that game with two runs in the eighth, the Chargers came back to 
beat Bishop Diego, 14-8, in their final game in the Santa Barbara tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won two in a row, which is something for this program," Maloney said at 
the start of the week. "We feel like we're rolling." 
</P>
<P>
 The roll was a short one. Agoura (5-13, 0-7) has lost to league opponents 
Newbury Park and Camarillo this week. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo baseball Coach Jack Willard was impressed with Moorpark, a Frontier 
League team that won the Camarillo tournament, which included mostly teams from 
the larger Marmonte and Channel leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're pretty good," Willard said. "They could play in (the Marmonte) League 
with no problems. They have two good pitchers and are solid one-through-nine." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley right-hander Bill Scheffels, an All-Southern Section pitcher last 
season, might have his problems straightened out. Scheffels has pitched poorly 
in his past two starts -- no decision in an 8-6, extra-inning loss to Newbury 
Park and a loss to Moorpark in the championship game of the Camarillo 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Mike Scyphers said the problems were Scheffels' control (12 walks in 
those two starts) and a reluctance to throw his changeup, generally considered 
his best pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "We finally told him he's going to throw it and not be shaking it off 
anymore," Scyphers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheffels is 5-1 with a 3.09 ERA. 
</P>
<P>

 The bottom of the Royal batting order provided all the runs, runs batted in 
and five of the team's six hits Monday in a 4-2 victory over Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Shawn Fossen (two hits), Kevin Mellinger (one hit) and Ben Lemos (two hits, 
three RBIs) batted in the sixth-through-eighth spots. No. 9 hitter Jesus Robles 
walked twice. TRI-VALLEY LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Sizzling 
</P>
<P>
 Whose going to stop Brian McMullen? The wind maybe. But no pitcher has shut 
down the Oak Park catcher, who is batting .529 after 34 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's to the point where he goes two for four and his average goes down," 
Coach Mike Bolyog said. "At Bishop Diego and Santa Barbara (in the Santa 
Barbara tournament), he's hit balls into 35-40 mile-an-hour winds. And they 
went 380. They would have gone out, but they ended up being a double and a 
triple. They were crushed." FOOTHILL LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Getting a Taste 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank (6-8) and rival Burroughs (8-7-1) might not be playoff contenders, but 
they sampled the postseason atmosphere when the teams met last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank's 5-4 come-from-behind victory at home featured bright lights and a 
huge fan turnout that caught first-year Burbank coaches Chad Nammack and Sandy 
Sreden by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a pretty intense rivalry, which we didn't know about," said Sreden, an 
assistant. "Both (teams) aren't doing that well, but the stands were filled. 
There were 300-400 fans. People were loud, yelling the whole game." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulldogs came back to win the night game. With Burroughs leading in the 
bottom of the seventh, 4-3, Brian Sindle hit a one-out double, stole third base 
and scored on a squeeze by Jason Jonas. Later in the inning, Frank Garcia 
walked with the bases loaded to end the game. MID-VALLEY LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Coincidence 
</P>
<P>
 Birmingham's Lionel Villareal knew it was coming. 
</P>
<P>
 After teammates Don Wingo, Jimmy Uline and Dave Cohen him hit home runs on 
three consecutive pitches against North Hollywood's Carlos Sandoval, it was 
Villareal's turn to bat. 
</P>
<P>
 With warnings from teammates about a possible pay-back pitch ringing in his 
ears, Villareal took a curveball square in the back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he hit him on purpose," Birmingham Coach Rick Weber said. "It 
was a curve that didn't curve. If he wanted to hit him, I think he would have 
thrown a fastball." 
</P>
<P>
 Villareal, however, didn't let Sandoval get the best of him. He later doubled 
off him -- twice. EAST VALLEY LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Rios in Relief 
</P>
<P>
 Beware of Grant relief pitcher Walter Rios. When he takes the mound, the 
Lancers tend to find a way to win. 
</P>
<P>
 At the start of the week, the right-hander had pitched just 11 innings, yet he 
is 3-1 with one save. Rios has never started a game and has never pitched more 
than 3 1/3 innings in a game, but he has the most decisions on the staff. 
</P>
<P>
 His secret? Fastball, no more than 50 in a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a one-pitch guy right now," Grant Coach Jeremy Lawrence said. "He's not 
a (Joel) Zamudio or a (Randy) Wolf, but he's gonna develop his speed. He's a 
big kid." 
</P>
<P>
 Rios, a 6-foot-1, 200-pound junior, has beaten Cleveland, San Fernando and Van 
Nuys in relief. He has allowed five hits, four walks, two earned runs and has 
struck out five. Around the Leagues. . . .

sliding into third base in a game against Arcadia. The senior outfielder will 
be out about three weeks.

League batting race. Scheffels was hitting .551, 60 points ahead of teammate 
Ryan Hankins (.491).

 * Royal shortstop Joel Mellinger had two triples in the Santa Barbara 
tournament last week, raising his season total to a school-record six.

QUARTZ HILL'S CRIMIN TO RETIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Co-coach Don Crimin of Quartz Hill High told his track team earlier this week 
that he will retire at the end of the season, and he received a nice going-away 
present Thursday when the Rebels' boys and girls posted victories over 
Littlerock to clinch Golden League championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Quartz Hill (5-1, 5-0 in league meets), led by double winners Troy Searcy and 
Jamaal Chase, won the boys' competition, 94-37. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Michelle Perry won three events to lead the Rebels (5-1, 5-0) to a 
80-47 victory in the girls' meet. 
</P>
<P>
 The victories gave Quartz Hill its second boys' title in the last three 
seasons and its sixth consecutive girls' title. 
</P>
<P>
 Crimin, 56, has coached the cross-country and track teams at Quartz Hill since 
the school opened in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still like going to practices and to meets," Crimin said. "But I hate bus 
rides. I think that finally caught up with me the last couple years."

STOCKS AND BONDS STAGE DRAMATIC RALLY; DOW ADDS 54; MARKETS: JUMP IN IBM PROFIT 
FUELS HEAVY TRADING ON WALL STREET. REPORT ON BALLOONING TRADE DEFICIT PUSHES 
YIELDS DOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The stock market staged a dramatic rebound Thursday on the back of a huge 
rally in the battered bond market and surprisingly strong profit at 
long-suffering IBM Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 53.83 points to end at 3,652.54. The 
New York Stock Exchange imposed its so-called collar on program trading to 
dampen volatility once the index rose 50 points. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, advancing issues swamped declines by about 11 to 5 in 
very heavy trading, with 378.66 million shares changing hands, up from 362.02 
million Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury bond yields plunged, pushing prices sharply higher, extending a brisk 
three-day rally touched off by sentiment that the U.S. economy may not be 
growing as fast as previously believed. 
</P>
<P>
 The long bond's yield fell to 7.21% from 7.31% the day before. Its price, 
which moves in the opposite direction, jumped 1 5/32 points, or $11.56 per 
$1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond prices have advanced 2 1/4 points since Tuesday, more than wiping out a 
sharp loss Monday in reaction to the Federal Reserve Board's third increase in 
short-term interest rates this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond market rally was sparked by the Commerce Department's report Tuesday 
that the trade deficit ballooned to $9.71 billion in February, partly because 
of a surge in imports. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of economic forecasters have since indicated they will revise 
downward their first-quarter growth assessments, which had generally been in 
the 4% range, to 3.5% or less. The government will release figures for gross 
domestic product late next week. 
</P>
<P>
 More questions about the strength of the economic recovery were raised 
Thursday when the Labor Department reported the number of newly laid-off 
workers filing claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly rose by 14,000 last 
week -- the third straight increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond prices often rise on news of poor economic growth, because it lessens the 
likelihood of worsening inflation, which erodes the value of fixed-income 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks rose in tandem with bond prices, which shot higher following a weak 
report on economic activity from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Broad-market indexes also advanced. The NYSE's composite index rose 3.52 to 
248.18. The Nasdaq index of mostly smaller issues advanced 13.22 to 718.74, and 
the S&P 500 index rose 6.77 to 448.73. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stock market has been under some tremendous pressure over the past two to 
three weeks," said Paul Hennessey, vice president of trading at Boston Co. "It 
was looking for an opportunity to rally here, and when the bond market rallied, 
it rallied along with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Larry Kinney at Soundview Financial: "People are beginning to feel 
halfway decent about things. This is the best rally we have had in about three 
weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 The surge in the shares of IBM, which is a component of the Dow average, 
helped ignite the market's upturn. The stock shot up 6 1/8 to close at 58 3/8 
in heavy trading of more than 8.7 million shares, after the world's largest 
computer company posted a strong $392-million profit for the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, economically sensitive cyclical stocks took a beating, but 
analysts said that may have set the stage for Thursday's rally. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's "selling was overdone," said Bob Stovall, president of 
Stovall/21st Advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Shares of computer makers rallied. Apple rose 1 3/8 to 29 5/8. Compaq, which 
reported strong earnings Wednesday, surged 6 7/8 to 108 3/4. Hewlett-Packard 
rose 2 7/8 to 78 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * McDonald's, also a Dow component, rose 2 to 58 7/8, getting a lift from 
solid first-quarter results. 
</P>
<P>
 * Texas Instruments gained 6 3/4 to 71 1/2 after reporting a rise in 
first-quarter earnings. Intel gained 2 3/4 to 60 1/4 and Micron Technology 
gained 3 1/2 to 34 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Utilities extended their rally. Peoples Energy rose 3/4 to 29 7/8 and 
Commonwealth Edison added 1/2 to 25 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks were mixed in overseas trading. Mexico's Bolsa index reversed all of 
Wednesday's drop as investors found the lower prices for shares attractive, 
analysts said. The index closed up 117.99 points, or 6.03%, at 2,075.32. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei average fell 82.82 points to 19,799.36. In Frankfurt, 
the DAX 30-share average ended at 2,196.9, up 14.33 points, while London's 
Financial Times 100-share average gained 2.9 points to finish at 3,101.2. Hong 
Kong's Hang Seng index tumbled 286.42 points, or 3.11%, to close at 8,934.59. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, the dollar posted sharp gains against the Japanese yen.

 Jim Edmonds, who originally was expected to get about 150 at-bats this season 
while being used primarily as a defensive specialist, is quickly changing the 
Angels' plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonds, who had never played first base, proved Wednesday that he is quite 
proficient.Considering that he might also be the Angels' best defensive 
outfielder, and is batting .417 this season, Edmonds might find himself in the 
lineup quite more frequently. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's surprising the hell out of me," Angel Manager Buck Rodgers said. "I 
watched him make those plays (Wednesday), and I said, 'I can't believe how 
smart you are, Rodgers.' I could have looked real dumb, real fast. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jimmy has become a valuable bench player on this team." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Edmonds: "I feel like I can play anywhere. If I was right-handed, I think 
I could play all nine positions. I've always wanted to play the infield, be 
closer to the action, so this is great."

PARENTING; KEEPING THOSE BULLIES AT BAY; * WRINGING THEIR NECKS IS NOT THE 
SOLUTION. FAMILIES AND TEACHERS CAN HELP CHILDREN AVOID BEING TARGETED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The neighborhood bullies are picking on little Ryan Wright, 6. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruffians -- some of whom are twice Ryan's age -- pursue the youngster on 
bikes. They pretend to run him over. When he goes out to play, they order him 
indoors and chase his friends home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It infuriates me," said Ryan's mother, Denise Wright of Saugus. "I feel like 
wringing their necks. I want to go out there and handle it, but I can't fight 
my kids' battles. I don't want them to rely on me because I am not always going 
to be there." 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, wringing the little monsters' necks is not the solution (tempting 
though it may be). And while youngsters often work out their differences on 
their own, parents and teachers can take steps to help children avoid being the 
target of bullies. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright, for example, attempts to strengthen her children's character. "I teach 
my kids to verbally fight back," she said. "Ryan is getting tougher. He used to 
come in crying all the time, but he is learning to acquire a 'back off; you are 
not going to walk on me' attitude." 
</P>

 Kids who are regularly pounded on by other children are likely to suffer from 
low self-confidence -- which in turn makes them even more vulnerable to 
attacks, according to Loeb Aronin, director of psychological services for the 
Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents need to build their child's self-esteem," he said. "Compliment your 
youngsters; continually praise them; show them the areas they are skilled at; 
tell them how important they are." 
</P>
<P>
 Aronin also recommends that parents allow their children to wear the clothing 
and hair styles popular among their peers. "Kids who stand out physically are 
targets," he said. "Let your kids fit in." 
</P>
<P>
 It is easy to spot children who are chronically harassed, according to Martha 
Mutz, principal of Bay Laurel School in Calabasas. "Kids who get upset when 
they are put down, kids who get overly hurt, kids who are sensitive are 
identified pretty early on," she said. "They don't have internal strength, and 
they believe the put-downs. It's almost like they are wearing a T-shirt that 
says 'I am the victim.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Mutz often invites such children to her office to practice building their 
self-esteem. "I have them write things like, 'I am strong,' " she said. "If 
they get teased about their name, I have them write, 'I like my name.' We 
rehearse comebacks like 'buzz-off; get away from me; get out of here.' I teach 
them to say it loud and clear, in a firm way." 
</P>
<P>
 But children who repeatedly find themselves on the receiving end of a bigger 
kid's wrath say such tactics do not always work. "Bullies are really strong, 
and they want to hurt people," said Johnny Tredent, 9, a Bay Laurel 
third-grader. "Like this girl, she trips me, pushes me, kicks me. I say, 
'Please stop it. I don't like it.' But there is no possible way she will stop. 
I am just going to have to get through it." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Aronin believes that schools have a responsibility to end chronic bullying by 
providing counseling to offenders and their parents. "If this is how the kid 
learned to win his point, it is likely your child is not the only one who is 
being picked on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He recommends that nonaggressive problem-solving techniques be taught in class 
and that peer counseling groups be established to resolve conflicts. He also 
suggests that parents and teachers work together to establish supervised areas 
on campus; young children can be matched with older "buddies" who keep an eye 
out for them; and students can walk to classes in groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Parental intervention is sometimes called for, as well. Vickie Cardoza of 
Glendale, for example, encourages her daughters, Jaqueline and Jasmine, to work 
out their differences with playmates. "But if it keeps up, I take further 
steps," she said. "No child should have to put up with verbal or physical abuse 
from an older kid." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In most cases, all Cardoza has to do is let the offenders know that she is 
aware of the situation. "When a group of bigger and older girls was ganging up 
on Jaqueline and giving her a hard time, I went up to them and simply said, 'I 
expect you to leave her alone. If I have to talk to your parents, I will.' The 
harassment stopped," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bay Laurel fifth-grader Peter Young, 11, admits that he used to pick on other 
kids. "Whenever something little happened, I would get really, really mad," he 
said. "I just lost my mind and went after them. It was almost like I had a 
psycho brain." 
</P>
<P>
 Now reformed, Peter carries a card that reads "I'm sorry" to remind him that 
he may regret it if he harasses someone who annoys him. Why the turnaround? 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad said if he hears bad reports on me, I will be suspended from using my 
Roller Blades," he said.

SLAUGHTER IN BOSNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The world's inaction to stop the slaughter of people in Bosnia and elsewhere 
on the planet speaks loudly of the distasteful reality that we humans still can 
watch genocide, rape and murder, vocalize somewhat about it and continue to do 
nothing. Personally I believe that our inaction is more reprehensible than the 
actions of the perpetrators. I feel embarrassed to be a human being.

 * In response to "Beyond Vietnam," by Charles A. Kupchan, Opinion, April 17: 
</P>
<P>
 Kupchan said, "Comparing Bosnia to Vietnam was wrongheaded for two reasons" -- 
essentially that the Cold War is over and our goal is limited in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 When I awoke with a sucking chest wound in an Army field hospital at Cu Chi, 
lying in the very next bed was a 14-year-old Viet Cong with two short stumps 
for legs, all bandaged and oozing. There was a soldier at the end of the bed 
with a loaded weapon watching the kid. I was told he had already tried to 
escape twice. That's what we were fighting in Vietnam. We came with our 
technology, our partial commitments, and a "limited" goal, fighting people who 
had the driven, emotional determination that came from the belief that they had 
to fight to the last breath to defend their homeland. In Bosnia we would be 
going in with our "limited" goal to take on centuries-old emotionally driven 
religious and ethnic hatreds. We could go anywhere, do anything in Vietnam, 
and, as in Afghanistan for the Russians, we could never win. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the hearts and minds of the people, stupid.

 * President Clinton's handling of the Bosnia situation leaves much to be 
desired. If instead of running away from the Vietnam issue, he had participated 
in a college ROTC program or had served in the military, he probably would be 
much better at negotiations. First and foremost, diplomacy with tyrants works 
only when you are willing to use your military advantage if required. 
</P>
<P>
 I attended a land-grant college (University of Wisconsin) and I had to take 
two years of ROTC. There was no choice, it was mandatory during the '50s. Did I 
like it? No. Do I regret it? No. I learned that there is no glory to war. 
However, I also learned that if one did not understand and use his military 
advantage, playing diplomacy with a tyrant is a losing proposition. From Hitler 
to Radovan Karadzic, all tyrants are alike. Their object is to win, no matter 
what it costs in human life and misery. 
</P>
<P>
 Does Clinton really think that dropping less than a dozen bombs in the course 
of months is really going to frighten a tyrant who is dropping three cannon 
shells a minute? Let's get real! In summary, can our nation develop a 
successful foreign policy when the leadership is someone who has no training or 
understanding of what the military is all about?

 * Has anybody noticed that all of those people who criticize President Clinton 
for not being more aggressive in sending our military forces to places like 
Bosnia are the same people who attack him if any of our people get killed or 
injured in the operation? If they know a way to fight a war without getting 
some of our people killed, I sure wish they would let the rest of us in on 
their secret.
